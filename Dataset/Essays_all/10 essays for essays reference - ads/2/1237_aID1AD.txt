I do not think there should be any legislative attempt towards restricting television advertising towards young children. 
The purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of its citizens, not to interfere in their lifes. Those natural rights include the right to life, to liberty and property, all aiming to give the people a maximum amount of freedom.
Now, obviously a child does not posess the same ability to make choices as adults, so placing them under authority is essential to safe adolescence. 
This authority however, must be a parental one and not one of the state. 
It is completly unnecessary to restrict advertising because when growing up, parents can do a far better job at restricting influences on kids than the government because they have direct knowledge of their mental state. 
Normalizing the grabbing of traditional tasks of parents could lead to an increasingly dangerous amount of power concentrated within legislation.
