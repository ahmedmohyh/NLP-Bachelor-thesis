In the newspaper there was a discussion about television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. In my essay I will discuss this question.
Young children aged from two to five should not be allowed to direct television advertising, because they don't know anything about television advertising.
They are too young and perhaps in advertising there will be shown how little children have to behave. On the one hand they could learn something but on the other hand their parents show their children to behave differently. This is the reason why children get confused. In some ways if the children look every time this advertising, they will behave like it was shown in the advertising.
For children aged from two to five it is necessary to interact with their parents because parents have the most influence of their life. Otherwise they don't learn anything about communication and often the advertising doesn't reach the young children.
Advertising was created to earn a lot of money, that people watching the TV will buy what was shown in the advertising. In some way advertising can have a big impact on somebodys life and this isn't positive.

In my oppionion I think television advertisng directed toward young children should not be allowed, because as I said above, they are too young. In their first years they have to learn how to behave by their parents. Televison advertising can have a lot of negative things because most people don't think about it and they do what was said in the advertising.
