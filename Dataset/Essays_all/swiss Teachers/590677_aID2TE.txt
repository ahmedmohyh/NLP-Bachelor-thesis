Clearly a teacher needs knowledge of his subject, but after a certain point of knowledge aditionale knowledege does no longer help the students to get better because the teacher can't tell hem everything anymore or the students just can't remember it and if there is to much knowledege, yes this can be the case,a teacher will loose the conection to he students level of knowledge and will tell them tings that are nice to knw but completly unusable and maybe evenununderstandable for the students.
A teacher that is hated by the students won't be able to teach them in a way they will remember the subject good. If a student does really hate a teacher he will always remember the teacher and how he hated him and when ever the subjectcommes up the student tries to get past as fast as possible an will not verthink what e does for it. this can be cheating at test to get revenge on the teacher or just not use the subject par example english in the future.
While a teacher without excellent knowledge, but good relation to the students will teach them a subject in a way they really understand te subect and when it cmmes to use it in the future the might remember the ways how they were told how it works and can remember and use what they learned in scool.
That's way the way a teacher teaches is more important than the knowledge of the subject
Or as a quotation "teorie is if it does not work and noone understands why,pracsie is i it does work and noone understands why"
