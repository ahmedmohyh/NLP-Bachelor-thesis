It says, teachers are here to relate with students and not to teach them. If it was correct, the teachers would be taught in an other way. They wouldn't have to know, if drink means trinken or essen. Otherwise, it is very important to communicate well with the students, so they are motivated to learn something.

First of all, motivated students are the best students. They will be silent, they will do their homework and the excercises in the lessons. If the students do not want to learn, they won't learn. In brief, the teachers need some education in being able to control the students. It is worth it. As far as the lessons are silent, the students do their excercises serious so the marks will rise.

On the other hand, it is not cheap to educate all the teachers in Switzerland in pathological studies. Our canton has not got enough money to pay this extraeducation. It would be expensive for the teachers, if they had to pay it by their own and we have not got enough of them anyway. I do not know if the parlament thinks it is worth it. They do not see the value of good educated teachers, they just can see a few thousand francs invested in a school.

In my opinion, it is not just a school for teachers, it is our future. The children have so many advantages with good school education. Additionaly, a good teacher may teach  in less time than a bad teacher, means we need less teachers, we need to pay.
All in all, it costs a bit to educate all the teachers, but in five years, the costs are on the same level as the value.
