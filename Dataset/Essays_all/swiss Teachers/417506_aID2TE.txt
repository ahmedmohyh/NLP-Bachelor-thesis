"Oh no, coolwe have a French lesson.", Lia said to her friend Lucy. "Oh, really?! I like our French teacher Madame Meier really but sometimes I have the feeling that I know more than Madame Meier", complains Lucy. "Yes, I understand you but she's so a cool person, I really like to go in her lessons", answered Lia. That problem might have many schools.The teachers are very kind peoplebut don't have an excellent knowledge. So ther originated a statement: "A techer's ability to  relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." 

On the plus side of this statement is that the kids prefer to like to a teacher who has the ability to relate well with students. They have fun with the teacher, can joking with him... He's like a good friend. 

Another point is that the students are more motivated and with this motivation they learn much better than without. Like Lucy and Lia they are looking forward to the lesson.

But for every advantage there's also a disadvantge. And one of them is that the kids don't learn as much as they would learn by a teacher with an excellent knowledge. So if the teacher can relate well with the students it isn't very learnful for the kids.

Finally it isn't very good if a teacher might have less experience of the subject than the class or if the class could explain the things much better than the teacher. Sometimes the students learn more if they teach themself the grammaire...

All in all there're  many advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion the perfect teacher has both, an ability to relate well with the class and also an excellent knowledge.Because if the teacher don't really can explain the stuff of the subject it isn't very useful for the kids. But also if you have a teacher with an excellent knowledge but he can't explain the students thing it's also very unuseful. So as usual something in between would bethe best.
