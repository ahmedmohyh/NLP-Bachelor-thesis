Primary and secondary school teachers differ. Teachers at primary school have studied at university how to educate, how children learn best and how to explain. At our school, teachers have studied the subject they teach. After that, they went to an extra course for becoming teacher. Of course, primary and secondary teachers have to be able to do both things. They have to know their subject but also have the skill to explain complicated exercises to their class. But which one is more important? 
Without any knowledge of their subject, a teacher can't answer a pupil's question. As a consequence, students become unsure if their teacher doesn't know the answer. Knowledge of the subject begins to seem unnecessary. How should a class see the importance of a subject if not even the teacher finds it important? A teacher must be their idol, they should have the goal to become like him or her in the specific subject. 
But in my opinion, the ability to teach, to explain and to motivate students to learn more is so much more important. How should a pupil learn if the teacher isn't able to explain? How should he be motivated if he doesn't understand? How should he like school if he doesn't like the teacher? I think that school can only satisfy if you reach goals, if you realize that you're getting better in a subject. So if you don't, school feels like hell. And this is what happens if a teacher can't explain. People get uninterested, they start to hate a subject. No matter if the teacher understands what he says or not. The teacher's knowledge should be better than the student's knowledge, but it doesn't have to be perfect.
Also, mistakes of a teacher represent his humanity, it represents that it is ok to fail, that the world doesn't end because of a fault.
Because of those arguments, I think that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
