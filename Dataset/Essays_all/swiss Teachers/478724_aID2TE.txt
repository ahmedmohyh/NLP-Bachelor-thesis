I don't completely disagree with this statement but I don't agree with it eather. It's very important that the teacher relate well with the students but it's also very important to teach the excellent knowlage. Imagine if a teacher is the relating excellent with the students and everyone loves him/her, but her teaching ability is horrible and they fail for example a very important test. It wouldv'e been better if the teacher just teached the subject very well, the students wouldn't have liked him very much but they wouldv'e passed the test. In my oppinion a teacher which has exellent knowledge of the subject isn't hated by the students even if he doesn't relate with the students. The important part is that the teacher can teach the kids the subject. In the end it only matters that the students pass the finals and not if the teacher related to them very well. The perfect teacher would be if he has both atributes. In my opinion a good teacher can do both but if I have to choose I would rather have a teacher who understands the subject perfectly. But one thing must all teachers do, and that is a good passing of knowledge to the students. It doesen't matte rif he has both atributes as lang as he can't "teach", and that is mostly the problem. Mostly the teachers know very much about the subject they teach and related very well with the students, but as long as they can't teach, all the previous points are inrelevant and that is in my opinion the bigest problem.
