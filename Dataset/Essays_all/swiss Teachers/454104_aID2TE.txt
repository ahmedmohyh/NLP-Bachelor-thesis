It is well known, that the teacher must have some type of connection with the students, otherwise the teacher will have a hard time teaching the stuff the students require. If it is exactly more important than the knowledge is discussuionable and controversial. I believe that the teacher automatically relates better with the students when he or she can communicate the essence of that very specific topic. It is pretty much all about communication. Of course what is being said needs to be true and that requires knowledge from the teacher. 

Knowledge can be defined differently. Perhaps it has been picked up from a trip, the teacher made in the past and can then tell the students from his experience. This is especially important in creative subjects, languages and subjects such as geography or history. In subjects like maths or chemistry, the topic needs to be told very correctly, so that the students don't get things mixed up.

 An argument could be that the teacher relates better to students when he or she is younger. But I personally don't think that this is true, because older teachers may have a more experienced knowledge and can transfer the knowledge better, than a younger teacher who has just recently graduated as one and still needs to find out in which way they want to transfer the message to almost peers.

So I reckon that the best out of these two aspects is probably the combination out of both. If a teacher can relate to students and help them to graduate as fearless as possible and also owns a perfect knowledge of that specific subject, he or she is most definitely a very good one. So in my opinion, I believe that this phrase is quite correct but you can't just generalize this to every teacher or every subject.
