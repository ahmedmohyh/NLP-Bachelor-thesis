Education nowadays is taught not to be difficult and complicated. Today it is much more important for students and teachers to have good a atmosphere in school. But also it isn`t ok to learn nothing of the subject being taught in school. So what is the best solution?

In my opinion, the teacher has at least a 50% influence on the notes, because a teacher never can be perfect for each students in his class. You might be good in school and also in the subject, but have bad notes. And after one year perhaps when the old teacher leaves the school and a new one starts his career in your school, you might become better notes.

But today there also many teachers who are probably much to easy with their students. in this fact, the problem is that the students think they might are good in school and can chill, but when a new teacher arrives or they leave their old homes and go in a new school, they become very quick few problems.

To sum up, I think that every teacher has the chance to teach his students like he wants to, but if it is to much hard or easy going, there should be a dialog with the teacher and the students. But I think it also takes time for a teacher and the students to get known, for example about hobbys or other personally things.
