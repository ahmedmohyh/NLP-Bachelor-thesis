Is a personal connection between the student and the teacher more important than the education of the student without trying to bond with him? In recent years the idea of education has changed vastly. In the early days the main idea was that knowledge should be taught without any connection to personal life or problems of society. Nowadays education has become much more personal than just facts and bonds between teacher and student have formed.
Personally I think that it has been a good change but also bad things have turned up. 
With the personal bond the student feels as if he were connected to the teacher and the other way round. Many students don't want to have anything to do with the teacher so the forcing of this relationship can annoy and burden the student quite a bit. Also a student probably doesn't want to share his personal life and personal problems with a teacher since for them it's embarrassing and also other students can tease you.  
On the other hand if the teacher knows the student he can teach the knowledge of the subject better because he knows the weaknesses of the student and he can try to teach the knowledge in a more convenient way so that the student can understand it. The surrounding of here your school can improve if you know the teacher on a personal basis.
Basically I think it has some positive factors but me myself wouldn't want to have the teacher understand/relate to me.
