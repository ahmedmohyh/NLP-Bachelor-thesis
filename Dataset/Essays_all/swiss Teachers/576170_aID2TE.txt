In order to support the statement, one could argue that students are more motivated to study a subject taught by a teacher they get along well with. The learning atmosphere is a lot better if the teacher has a good relationship with his or her students. The students know that their teacher will help them with questions and will be patient and understanding with students who need more time to get familiar with certain topics. Especially for children in primary school and middle school, the social skills of their teacher might be a lot more important than his or her knowledge of the subject. The kids need to develop skills like discipline and social behavior before they can start to really get into a school subject. However, in high school, a teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is very important. Students will realise when their teachers are not comfortable with the topics they present and when they don't fully understand what they are talking about. Excellent knowledge of a subject gives a teacher authority, so does the ability to relate well with students - in primary school, as well as in high school, maybe even in college. In my opinion, teachers must therefore be able to build a good relationship with their students as well as excel with knowledge of their subject.
