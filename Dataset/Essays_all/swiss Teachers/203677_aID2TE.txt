I think that completly humbug. Its god if a teacher relates well with the students but if he ore she doesnt know a shit about the subject he ore she teachs the students wont lerne anithing. So they might have got a "friend" but it wont bring them anithing for the rest of ther live. I think its more important that the teacher knows exactly what hes thlking about than beeing "friends" with your students. I have to say if a teacher relat bad with his students its irelevant what knowledge he ore she has because the students wont listen to him or here. so i think you should find a way where the teacher has a god knoledge but he or she should alsow could talk to the students ant they even listen to him ore here. My opinion is that knowledge is more important than the relatonship betwen teacher and studentis. If a teacher knows exactly that he or she is talking about he or she can answer the most of the questions that are asked an doesent have to look the up in the internet or in a book. And he or she can be a better teacher and he or she doesnt wast that much time with looking up things witch he or she could have used to build up a god relationship to the students.
