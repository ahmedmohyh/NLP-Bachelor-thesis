Sometimes a student doesn't really get what the teacher tries to tell him. The teacher tries his best to make the student understand because he, the teacher, has the excellent knowledge of the subject. 
But is that all that it needs to be a good teacher? The perfect knowledge. If the students have problems in class and the teacher can't help, then what is the point of knowing the subject perfectly?

If a student has problems with understanding the subject being taught, the teacher needs to have the ability to relate with him to find a solution. But it is also important that the teacher can help if the students have problems not concerning school subjects. 
But if a teacher only has the ability to relate well with the students and has no excellent knowledge of the subject, he can't teach it very good. Because if the students have questions and the teacher can't answer them, they can't expand their knowledge. No student is on the same level as the other, so the teacher always has to know a bit more of a subject than he teaches. In this case studets that are a bit faster than others can learn new things that are interesting, whereas the students that didn't get it the first time still try to learn the basics that the teacher taught. 

In the end I would say that it is important for a teacher to have the excellent knowledge and the ability to relate well with the students. Because if he has both of it he can teach his subject really good. For the students that aren't that fast, he can explain it again so they understand it and for the students that are really fast, he can make extra exercises so it won't get boring for them.
