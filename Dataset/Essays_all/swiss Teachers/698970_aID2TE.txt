As a teacher there are a lot of things they can do for having a great lesson. A great lesson means that everyone in class understands the subject well and there should be improvements in class too. But a great and understanding lesson does not come with an excellent knowledge of the teacher, it also depends on the relationship between teachers and their students. The teachers have to get on well with their students or the lesson would be less exciting. There are some factors which influence the lessons of a teacher, which I will show you in the following content.

The most important factor is the atmosphere in class. The atmosphere should be comfortable but still strict. Everyone in class should be involved and should do their homework for example. Because a lot of teacher lose their temper when their students do not do their homework. But atmosphere can not just be created by doing some work at home. The teacher has to look after the atmosphere and he should be able to improve the relationship between him and his students. Just being strict because he knows everything of this subject does not a make good teacher. He has to be kind and should have some understanding. In fact a comfortable and strict lesson is a sign of a good lerning atmosphere.

In my opinion an excellent knowledge of the subject does not mean a good teacher. They should rather have an excellent knowledge of the subject and an ability to relate well with students. I think teacher can not just choose one of them and expect from students to have great marks at the end of the semester. a good atmosphere can only be created when both point can be in relation with together.They need both of them to master a teachers profession.
