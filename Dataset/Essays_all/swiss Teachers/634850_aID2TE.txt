The following statement is quite contraverse because in some lessons it is not helpful when the person is very kind and funny but does not have a clue what he is doing. At first the teacher needs to have a basic knowledge in his subject. When it is a subject where you have to explain difficult things for example maths. The teacher has to be good in his subject because if he only understands the topic that he can solve a question then he can not teach the class properly because he also does not understands it good enough. But in other suspects the teacher has to be good in relating with the students. For example in english the teacher has to make a good discussion with the students if he can not relate with the class nobody wants to join the discussion. Personally I think the teacher has to be a good combination of both. Because If the teacher can get on well with the class the sudents will not learn much because there are to many discussions and other things to talk about. Which do not connect with the subject but if the person is excellent in his subject and can not teach and relate with the class as good as he should then it is like talking against a wall because nobody is listening to the teacher and for both sides it is vey boring.
