It's very important that a teacher owns an excellent knowledge of his or her subject, there shouldn't be any incompetend teachers in school. Because nowadays many students don't critise a teachers opinion and his or her explanationes and just believe what they say. To be certain a teachers task is to give as much knowledge as possible to the next generations and to teach them for their futur life, that they then can give their owned knowledge to a next generation and so on. Of course it's not only the task of a teacher, actually it's everybodies task to give something of their knowledge to the next generation, but since students spent so much time in school, teachers are in this view very important for the futur of this world.
But on the other hand it's also very important, that the teacher and the students go on well with eachother. For students it's often much more difficult to  understand a teacher and his or her subject if they haven't got a good relationship with theme. And if a teacher is able to relate very well with her or his students, it also means that he or she has a positive attitude and this has a influence how good students learn and if they like to learn. Generally it happens that if a student  likes the teacher he or she also likes the subject, but if he or she doesn't like the teacher the subject is often not their favorite one.
Personally I would say that there has to be a good mixture of the ability to relate with the students and an excellent knowledge for a good teacher. Of course we all prefere the nice teacher where we never have homework or something to do. But it's also very important to make progress in school and to improve our knowledge, and to achieve that you need a competent teacher with an excellent knowledge. But for making progress and being motivitated there has to be a nice and positive setted teacher, who is able to have a good relationship with the class.
