We're going to school, to learn, discover and to keep relationships with friends. But is the learning byitself more important than the relationship to the teacher. I think it is.

Normally I stand up at six o'clock. I'm getting up, because I like to gain some knowledge and discuss about themes important for the life. Perhaps it's    aswell. The things is, I have a target and want to understand the world, though the knowledge is worth for me to get up early.
Today, a high knowledge is important to be successfull. We have to pass the Matura in Switzerland to start studying. It means, that we have to fullfile some tests of different subjects. A good relationship with the teacher wouldn't help in this caise. It's necessary to concentrate on the material and basically learn. 
I think that relationships, for example between friends or parents, can be fixed during the free time. The role of the teacher can be fullfiled by parents or older siblings.
It just annoying and hard to thing about a good functioning relationship between me and my teacher. I like to concentrate on the subjects, it's content and not how the teacher talks to me or how he appears. It's just nonsense. Nevertheless a teacher should be kind and a kind of helpful.

It's important to have an ordinary teacher, but it's neccesary to concentrate on the subject.
If we want to success in life we need to study at school. At home for example we can safe or start relationships. We should not waste time on uneccesary problems, like the teachers ability to relate well with the student.
