A teacher has to be an expert at the subject he teaches. He has to know the answer to at least 80 percent of the questions that are asked and that have something in common with the subject. A teacher should be an absolut expert at his subject, because that is a teacher's job. And students don't respect a techer, when they realise he doesn't know to much about the subject, because a lack of knowledge comes always hand in hand with lessons which are too short or the teacher seems not too secure. 
If a teacher has excellent knowledge he is able to teach the students the most important things of the subject because he has the overall view and then the teacher is able to filter all his knowledge and theach the students the important parts of the subject. With good knowledge he can prepare the students perfectly.
If the teacher has not the ability to connect with his students he's gonna have a problem, because a good relationship to the students is important, but not as important a perfect knowledge, because let's face it a student is not in school to make friends or build up a good relationship to the teacher. It's nice to have a good relationship but that what counts are the grades you have, because no one later in live gives a damn about how good the relationship was. All that matters are grades and knowledge. And a teacher just has to hammer the knowledge in your mind and that works also if he is not very nice. Even if you don't need all the knowledge later.
