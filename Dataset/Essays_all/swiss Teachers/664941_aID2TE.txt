This statement is very intresting, because it unites the intelligence quotient (IQ) and the emotional quotient (EQ). On one hand, it's important that the teacher has a high IQ, so he understands what he is speaking about. On the other hand, the EQ is very important as well. Without an appropriate EQ, the teacher can not understand the students with problems to understand the things the teacher is teaching. In order to create an efficiant work on both sides, the teacher, as a person of authority, has to understand the difficulties of his students and especially why they have those difficulties. 
When we read the statement again, it does not just say that the teacher has to able to relate with students, but that this is even more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. If we look at this, it's obviously not true, that a teacher with the highest EQ can teach something that he does not understand. 
Personally I think the teacher's ability to relate with students is very important and it gets forgotten too often, but the main goal of the teacher is that the students understand what he is talking about, which can not be assured, if the teacher does not understand the subject perferctly.
