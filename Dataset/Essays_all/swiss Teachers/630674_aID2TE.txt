The profession as teacher is not just to have an excellent knowledge of the subject and to present this in front of the students. A teacher should have the ability to relate well with students as well. But is this more important than to have a big knowledge? A good knowledge of the subject is fundamental ability, which a teacher needs. Because without it he would not be able to teach students about the subject. He has to understand it and be able to explain it. But the ability to relate well with students is important as well. Students will more listen to the teacher if they like him. Is their a good connection between students and teacher, then a student will not fear to ask the teacher to explain him something. In a way the teacher influences the students if they will like the subject or not. Their has to be some own interst from the students on the subject before but if you hate the teacher, you will not like to go to his lessons and to listen to him. With this point of view you will start to dislike the subject. That is the raison why I think it is important as a teacher to have the ability to relate well with students. I think it is hard to say if the ability is more important than excellent knowledge. Maybe is a good knowledge of the subject enough and you do not need an excellent knowledege of the subject as a teacher. But I am sure if a person has the ability to relate well with students and has a good knowledge of the subject as well, so this person would get a great teacher.
