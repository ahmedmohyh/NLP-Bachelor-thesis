The teacher's ability to relate well with students is it really important? We all know students, who say at home that the teacher isn't good because she/he is mean or that we don't like the lesson because we don't like the teacher. 
Firstly, the ability to be kind in the lesson is very important, because when you have a friendly teacher, you like going to school. Maybe it is easier to learn more and to get good marks. Secondly, when a you have an awesome relationship with your students, you are popular. For example, when you see as a teacher that your student has a big problem, it is more logical that the student will trust and tell it to you , when you're popular. With this ability you can help people. Lastly, It is more difficult to teach someone, when they don't like you, than when the like you. They will do their homework and they will listen to you. 
On the other hand, when a teacher has a really close connection with some students, parents or workmates could think that you might have a sexual relationship with your students. You could have a lot of troubles, if you were suspected .Secondly, the knowledge is more important because a student goes to school to learn something and not to have a friendship with the teacher. Therefore the teacher doesn't have to relate well with the students. Last but not least, when a teacher is strict, they learn  how life is. Later, when they must work, the life isn't easier. This is a good preparation for being able to do an excellent job. 
In conclusion, personally, the ability of a teacher to be kind and to teach kindly is better than when you are vicious and moody, because when your teacher has this character attitudes you like going to school and you have a better chance to get good marks.
