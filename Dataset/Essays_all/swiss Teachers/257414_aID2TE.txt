In school there are a lot of different teachers, some of them are more populaire then others and some of them can not relate well with students. But what is more important? Is it the ability of a teacher to relate well with students or is it his excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

On the one hand it is quite important to know well of the subjects you've been teaching at school because other wise you can't explain all the important details of the materie. But on the other hand it is also impossible that you can relate well with students, because if you can't the students wouldn't listen to you at all and you keep talking the whole lesson.
Knowledge is very important if there are a lot questions in class, as a teacher you must explain them to students otherwise they will question your authority and this would be a huge problem for the following lessons. As a teacher you can also win authority if you treat the students right, that means to accept them, to treat them like adults and to have a got clima in class. 
To conclude, knowledge is not just important for teaching, a teacher must also write some exaims and give grades for presentations from students. Imagine you as a teacher are listening to a presentation but you have no idea what the students are talking about, it means you can't give them a fair grade or an effectiv critic. But it makes it a lot easier if you can relate well with the students so they will accept your opinion and the grade easier.

My opinion is simple. It has to be both. As a teacher your knowledge has to be excellent to give good lessons and prepare the students for the matura, but it is for students and teachers much more fun if they have a good relationship. Learing in school is so much simpler if you have a good clima during the lessons.
