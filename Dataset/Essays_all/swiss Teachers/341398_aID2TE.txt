Its important for teachers to get on well with their students. They have to be exact and helpful to give students the best possible education.

A reason that agrees this statement ist that students won't get the knowledge of a teacher perfecty if the teacher talks his stuff about the subject with no relation to the level of knowledge the students have. So the teacher has to give them a chance to understand and learn. An other agreement is that students are more interested in Subjects of a teacher when they have a good relation to the teacher. Its a teacher's obligation to motivate them and to try ones best to bring knowledge to his students.

On the other side there are also negative points like: It's worse if the teacher has absolut no Idea what he is teaching. Maybe he or she could relate well with students but no knowledge of a teacher about the subject isn't acceptable for students.

Finaly I hope teachers have both abilitys to bring a good knowledge to their students. Especially on lower schoollevels where they have to motivate children.  Its importand for a school to get teachers who are able to teach well.
