In general it can be said that a teacher has to be able to relate to his students as well as to be an expert in his subject. In order to find the balance between the two abilities you will have to compare the advantages of the said abilities.
Teacher traditionally were supposed to only teach the knowledge he has to his student. Of course the teacher has to have excellent knowledge but communication is key in this matter so being able to relate to his student is of great importance. Because in contemporary times most of the education systems around the world are reliant to teachers which cover both academic as well as social tasks.
It is given that students will confront hardships during their career and it does not matter in which grade you are or how old. Since the teacher is the person you are likely to spend most of your time with during the week he naturally becomes a person you yourself can relate to. That is why it would feel extremely awkward for both parties if it was not the other way around too. So teachers are bound to be able to relate to his students in terms of modern education.
There is no doubt that the teacher will be able to convey his knowledge to his students with this ability. Even if he will not be able to explain the subjebt in depth at least he covers the parts which the educational plan expects to be taught.
My opinion is that teachers should be able to relate to their students no matter what because I myself prefer having a teacher who cannot be replaced by a roboter even if I receive the same amount and detailed knowledge.
