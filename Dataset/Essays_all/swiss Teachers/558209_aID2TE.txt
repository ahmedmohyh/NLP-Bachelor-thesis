There are many reasons for both statements. 
First I would like to start with the statement why the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important. When the students have a good relationship to their teacher, they like to learn something new. And they would lisen more to the teacher when they like him. Also for the teacher it's better when he has a good relationship to the students, because when he likes his students, he has more motivation and so he can do a good job. I think both have advantages with a good relationship.
Now I would like to discuss the second statement: Why it's more important to have an excellent knowledge then a good realationship to the students?
When the teacher has excellent knowledge he can learn the students more and better. He is able to prepare his students for the university for example. But a problem here could be that the students don't listen to the teacher, when they don't like him. And they aren't so motivated to go to school.

I think that it's important that the teacher has a good knowledge but he mustn't have excellent knowledge. And it's also important that the relationship between teacher and students is good, then so both are motivated. So I don't agree to 100% with the statement.
