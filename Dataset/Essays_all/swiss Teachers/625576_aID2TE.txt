I think this is true, because you can be the most intelligent teacher, but when you can not relate well with students the the students are not motivate to learn something. A teacher that can understand the students and can help them with a friendly smile is much better because then the students like it to lern. When something is not clear in the class and the teacher do not know what the answer is then you can look in the internet or in e book that would not be a problem. I think the students like it much more when they can reach something together as when the teacher knows everything The students have to think less when the teacher knows everything. Or it would also be a problem, when the class is not in controll and everybody is speaking loudly. Then the teacher can not teach them. But when a teacher can relate with the students well then the teacher can look for a good learn temperature and it would be calm in the class and then the students like to learn. So when I can choose a teacher that is really intelligent or a frindly teacher that can relate well with students I would take the teacher without a excellent knowledge, because the information can I take by myself, but a friendly teacher not.
