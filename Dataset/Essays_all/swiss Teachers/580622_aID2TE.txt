In my opinion a teacher's knowledge is more important than the ability to relate well with the students. Geting well with the students is always an advantage and important, but if he has no idea what he's teaching about, the students will have problems understandig this subject.So they will get bad grades and that is definetly not the achievement of going to school. When they are having bad grades their motivation or interst will sink and it will have negative consequences about their mood or thinking of school. 

When a teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject he's teaching,the students will learn more. I think that this is the main goal of going to class. The school has to take care of the students. So the teachers are the ones to blame when the students haven't learn anything of a subject.Of course every teacher need the ability to relate well with students or caring about them, but if he has a low knowledge about the subject he's teaching, then he shouldn't have become a teacher. If the teacher has no knowledge about his class, it will have negative consequences for the students who are planning for example going later to the university. They will be one of the slowest with understandig it and have to probably repeat a year.

 An other point is the missing knowledge if the students want to study this subject, because if they don't know what's about, how can they say or decide that it will be fun studying it on the university. A teacher with a high knowledge of a subject will prepare them for the university. It's also easier for the students to decide if they like a subject or not. In my opinion there are on both sides pros and cons but the fact that a teacher has to have a good knowledge about the subject he's teaching is overwhealming.
