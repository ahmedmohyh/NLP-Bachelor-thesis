There exist two sorts of teatcher: the teacher, who is really nice, interested in his students, talk with them on there future and really care on what they think, but maybe do not know his suject very well. The other teacher, who know his subjet perfectly, is only interested in giving his knowledge, but do not care on his student's toughs. So, what is more important in a teacher ability: related well with students or having an excellent knowlege?
A theacher, who talk and talk hours long, allthough he know all perfectly, if he can not related with his students, they will not learn anything. Noone is listenning to something like that.
Moreover, we always like someone who like us. So if the teacher is nice to his students, they will also be nice and be happy to be on this cours. For example, there is a lot of students, who are not interested in physics, but although are happy to go one this cours, because the teacher is nice and they can talk with him.
On the other hand, a teacher, who is appreciate from everyone, but do not know anything, is no more a good teacher. The goal is that the students learn, so the teacher have to be competent.
In addition, it is impossible to teach something you do not exactly know. How should the sutdent get something that the teacher himself does not exacly understand?
All things considered, I think a teacher had to have an excellent knowledge of his subject and also be able to teach it. This mean be able to go on well with students, because it do not help anything if he know all, but his students do not undersant anything and do not want to go to his cours. In my opinion, the knowledge of a teacher is even more important than his ability on relate well with students.
