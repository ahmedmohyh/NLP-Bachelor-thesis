Is a good ability with students more important than en excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

A good relation with the students is very important, because the students only want to come to your lessons or listen to you your stuff, when they know that you make your things very well and you can tell the things you want in a intresting and satisfying way. But when the teacher don't have any knowledge about something, the students don't want to come. The students want to see an idol in the teacher but if the proffessor don't know anything they don't see the role of an idole. 

Another reason why a good realation to the students is very importent is, that the stundents must have the feeling of "I want to go at school, because I like this teacher today". When the stundents don't like their teacher it is very difficult for the teacher to hold a lesson. Nobody hear to him and when nobody hear to him everybody talk to each other and it isn't silence in the room.

So at the end I think a good realation with students is more important than an excellent knowlege but the knowledge must be exist to have a good realation.
