As a student I can relate perfectly to that statement. It a question that depends a lot on the students study habits and their age.
In my opinion first of all, it should be clear that givig wrong or incomplete information in order to help the students does not help at all. Clearly it depends on what level your are. On my level it is necessary to have seen the big picutre because we need to prepare for the future for work. Later you will have disadvateges in your working evironment.
Also on our level we are here because we decided to study more not because we must be here. So it is our right to get as good information as possible. Which is kind of complicated if the teacher is not able to give it to you.
On the other hand some students could be overwhelmd by too much information, so they need a theacher who they can relate to. A teacher sould be able to realte well with his students in order to know how to teach them the materia. Because every student lerns diffrent.
Finaly i like to sumarize that  on my level the knowlegde is much more important because we know how to learn properly. In primiery school it is vice veras because there the students first have to leran how they can extract information properly, there the teachers ability to relate to them is way more important.
