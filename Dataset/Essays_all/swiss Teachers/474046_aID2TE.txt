When you ask a student, why they like one specific subject in school, it's often mentionned that the teacher has a big role. So if a teacher is friendly and nice it is more likely that they like that subject. But i think it is also very important that the teacher is familiar with the subject and knows more than they teach their students, because it is very likely that a question comes up. When they ask about any connections to other subjects that is relevant, the teacher has to teach them correctly. Because of my own experience, i think it is more important that the teacher can relate well with the students because i had one teacher who really scared me. When i see it objectively i think my teacher was a pretty good teacher: she had authority and knew her subject pretty well. But because of that, i was too scared to even ask her something in case it was a dumb question. So i didn't participated in class well and my grades were obviously bad. That is why i hated to go to these classes and was even a bit scared to go. 
Because of that experience i think it is more important that the teacher has a ability to relate well with students. The classes are just more fun and you listen better because you like the teacher. Sure, the teaacher has to know at least the important things to their subject, but for me it is the teacher that is important, rather than the knowledge. But that is from the perspective of a student. When the question would be asked to parents, they would probably say that the knowledge of the subject is more important. Parents want their kids to learn something in school.
