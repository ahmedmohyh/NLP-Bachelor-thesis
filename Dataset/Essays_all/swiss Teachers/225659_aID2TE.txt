We live in a ever knowledge based societey. Progress was always our ideal. To reach it we aim to be more sophisticated, faster and better in many ways than we were before. Academics been asking themselve wheter it would be more important to have teachers for their kids and the further generations that are able to connect well with them or who have a great knowledge for the concerning subject. In the following essay I am going to state my opinion.

Firstly let us be clear they we are talking about a process. Learning is a process. Many people think that a teacher with an excellent knowlegne is surely the most important to ensure a successfull teaching in class. If you conceive about someone with a broaden knowlegde for example of stones you do not doubt that he is really enthusiastic about minarals, his topic, and that he would be able to give his knowlegde in a intresting way to his students. Also state that for students will have a certain resept to him while he stands confident in front of the class. 

On the other hand sympathy is an essential feature in all ways of learning. If you are not willing to learn, you won't. When the teacher can not relate to his students, it's going to be difficult for them to built up respect for him and to find motivation to follow his lessons. Furthermore you expect people who are teacher in certain subject to have a great knowledge about it. Last but to least a devasted relationship to the teacher will affect the students regards and feeling about the subject this will lead to an unsuccessful learning process.

To sum up, regarding to the arguments in my opinion a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. As long as students will be taught by human beings there will always be a human interaction.
