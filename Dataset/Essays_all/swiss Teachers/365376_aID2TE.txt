Students can have different reasons why they won't be learning with a 100 % of their potential. The teacher does have a big influence on the learning process of a student. So it's very important that the teacher can relate to his students. If he has a great connection to a student, the student can be specially motivated in his classes. Without this connection between student and teacher he can be as great as he wants ( if it comes to his knowledge) but he still isn't going to be competent to teach those students. He should also be having an excellent knowledge about the subject, which is being thought. This makes the class (Unterricht) much more interesting. if the teacher hasn't an excellent knowledge, he himself can get überfordert through questions, which the students ask. In this case the class can't really learn in detail and create interesting discussion. That will have a negative impact to on the students.

So I think I  can't agree or disagree on the statement, that says that it would be more important to have a ability to relate to students than having a excellent knowledge. As a teacher you need a great balance. So or so a great teacher should be able to have an excellent knowledge to get in depht when it comes to the subject and he also should be able to relate to his students. If the two Bedingungen are given, the class will learn a lot and even feel fun to learn something new.
