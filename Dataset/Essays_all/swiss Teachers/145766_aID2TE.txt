Teacher must can relate well with his students otherwise its very hard to teach the students. Many of students like Teacher who can realte well with students becouse they are not boring. And that the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, is true. You can be the best professor in physic but when you dont now how you teacht the students well, they will learn nothing from you. But otherwise you can be the best teacher but when you dont how the excellent knowledge of subject being taught, in thiy case the students will also leran nothing from you. 

Both albilites are important for a teacher. He must can teach well and now the knowledge of a compartment. I mean thats the reason why many student dont lisen to his teacher when he talk about something important. If he talk very boring then the atmosphere from the classroom is also very boring and nowbody lisen to him. But if he dont have the knowledge of subject being taught then the students will also dont lisen to him

In my view, a teacher must can manage both ablities to be a good teacher. But I now its hard for a teacher to work with students which are evertime noisy. But thats the work from a teacher and he must be able to manage this, I never want be a teacher becouse of that. I respect every teacher becouse you need for this work many nerves.
