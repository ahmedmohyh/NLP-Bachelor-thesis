Teachers have an important part in our society. Every child goes to school here in Switzerland so a lot of time is spent with our teachers. It's obvious that they have to be sort of a role model for us and that's the point. Do they have to be friends with the students or should they be more like a real teacher and just fous on the stuff we have to learn?
So a teacher who can relate with his students isn't bad at all. I personally think that a teacher is like a friend for his students, they are more likley to come to school and enjoy their time in school. For example if a teacher just 'teaches', maybe the students don't like going to his class, they feel like they are just a big bundle of people. But if the teacher is friendly and as I said like a friend or he just has the ability to realte well with students, they may feel like they are an individual and not just someone in a big herd.
Another point is that if a teacher has the ability to realte well with students, he can change the beaviour of some of his students. Like if a student isn't interessted in a certain subject, the teacher has the ability to change his students mind with his friendly character. And i think that a teacher who just teaches his subject hasn't that ability or he doesnt^'t even care.
Now to the teachers who just 'teach' and aren't like a friend. For sure these type of teachers can teach a lot more, they have a bigger knowledge so they can know more about their subject. Maybe their students don't like his type of lessons but they learn a lot more for sure.
So in my opinion thats the most importand point. You go to school to learn something and not to be friends with the teacher. So I think the hypothise isn't correct. A Teacher with a big knowledge can give a lot more for a students future than a teacher who is just a friend. And I personally think that a lot of older students go to school to learn and not to be friends with the teachers.
