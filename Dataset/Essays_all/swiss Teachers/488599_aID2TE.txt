In some way I agree with this statement. The realtionship between a teacher and his students can have a great influence on a students life. If the teacher is nice and tries to relate well with his students, then the subject automatically is way more interesting than if a teacher is a sob. Teachers that only try to teach their subject without being interested in their students, don't have a successful career in many ways. I mean they can still earn enough money and have a save job but I think for most teachers it's also importatn to be liked by their students.
But all the sympathy a student feels for his teacher doesn't help to have good grades(if they both act in a legal way).
 A teacher also needs the abiltity to teach in a way that students understand the subject. The main task of a teachrer is to teach the things students will need to pass their final exams. So it's also true that teachers need an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught by them. They should not just show video clips students could watch by their own but they should try to teach difficult things in a way students understand. 
To summarize; in my opionion both, a teachers ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, should have the same importance in a teachers life.
