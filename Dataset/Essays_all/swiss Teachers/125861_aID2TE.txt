A topic having to be considered is if a teacher's ability to get on well with his students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

On one hand, when pupils relate well with their teachers it is much more easy for them to ask questions and to enjoy their lessons. For instance, when a student dislikes the person who is teaching the lesson, he also does not like the subject which is being taught. People who enjoy going to school are more motivated to learn something new and to improve their skills than others.

On the other hand, teacher are needed because of their knowledge. So, the use of teacher is that they are experts on their domain. When students do not understand something in school their teachers ought to be able to help them. Otherwise a school does not bring up the expected results.

In my opinion, satisfying knowledge of a subjet that a person teaches is more relevant than a very good relation between students and their teachers. That does not mean that I think the ability of a teacher to relate well with pupils shows no importance. I do not expect excellent knowledge but a balance between social skills and helpful support in questions concerning school lessons.
