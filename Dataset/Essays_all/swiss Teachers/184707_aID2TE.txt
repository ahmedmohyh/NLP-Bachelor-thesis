Of course it is very important that the teacher has a big knowledge about his subject, otherways the students will not take him serious. That would be a big problem, because they will not listen to him and loose the respect towards him.  But the knowledge is not everything. As a teacher you need to have a strong personality, that your class respects you. Also to get a good learning clima you should have a good relation with your students. Once you reach this, the persons you are teaching will be more open to learn something from you. 
Thats why being a teacher is really not an easy job. Finding a good balance between those two aspects is hard and not many are able to reach it.

All this to say that it is very imprtant, that both, the student and the teacher, are motivated in what they are doing. When the teacher gets the feeling, that people are interested in what he is talking, he will also have more willingness to get on well with the persons he ist teaching. And when the students get the feeling, that their teacher is treating them in a fair way, they will also be more open to him. This creats a good atmosphere between the two sides and both get a bigger motivation. Nobody can really say what the perfect mixture between knowledge and relation with the students is, but what everybody can agree with is that you can only be a good teacher, when you have both qualities.
