Teacher's ability to relate students well or excellent knowledge - in an exemple of the English lesson

We are learning English since the 3th grade. The knowledge of the subject English is very important nowdays, but is it more important as a teacher's ability to relate well with students?

Nowdays, you can speek English in all over the world. In all the diffrent countrys, the people will understand English. So it's very important that you lern English very well from the start. But the teachers ability to relate the students well is also important. When the student is afraid of the teacher, so he wouldn't ask her to help her in English and that would be not good for his English knowledge. Also when the teacher is uninterested of the students work, the students have a feel of beeing such as air and not being importing in the class. So they wouldn't be active in class and this would have negative aspects. When there's a good connectection with the teacher, the students would do the ecercises correct and with fun, so the knowledge would also be good. Whe the connection between teacher and student wouldn't be good, the will be a lot of problems, the student wouldn't come with a good motivation to the lesson and so the full lesson wouldn't be succesful to get better in the knowledge.

My opinion is that both statements are very importent, because i think when a teacher relate well with students, the students would talk with her like a friend, but still in a formal from and would so ask question to get better in English. So the relate with teacher and the knowledge would be exellent.
