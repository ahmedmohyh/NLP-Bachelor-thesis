One of the most important and difficult things for a teacher is to relate well with his students. A teacher can have the biggest knowledge in the world but when he can not make it clear to the students it is not worth a lot. For example my "Schwerpunktfach" teacher in physics has always an answer to my questions. Sounds good but in reality I have understood rarely something what he told me. Probably I did not understand because it was to difficult for our level here. But sometimes I asked someone in my class and he could explain to me clearly and on an easy way. This means that not every teacher who knows more than in class needed is automatically a better teacher.
Apart from my own experience I would say that surely it is better when a teacher has an excellent knwoledge but then he has to teach on a level where such a knowledge is needed. It is another case when his a ability to relate with  his students is that good that he exactly knows what they can understand. The combination of a great knowledge and the ability to relate with students would be perfect. Mostly this is not the case. When someone has a great mind he or she often thinks really fast and complicated. And then it is very difficult to explain it to the students in their language so they can understand it.
So the fact that the ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge is in my opinion true. A teacher with a great knowledge is just as good as someone with a normal knowledge when their communication skills with the students are the same. In other words, in my opinion these skills are much more important than the knowledge because every teacher has a big enough knowledge when they finished at university.
