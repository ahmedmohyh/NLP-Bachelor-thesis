It is important that the teacher can interact/relate well with students. To conferm this, there are a lot of students which are more likely to go into class with motivation wheater there is a teacher they like. But is a good connection between students and teachers more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

Firstly the teacher needs to have good knowledge of the subject that he teaches. This argument is pretty obvious because you cannot teach anyone something if you are on the same level of knowledge. Therefore there needs to be a difference between the knowledge of the student and the knowledge of the teacher otherwise the concept of school does not work anymore. 

Secondly a good connection between teachers and students can help students to learn better and faster. I am sure that everyone can relate to this argument. We all had this one teacher we just did not like at all. This caused us to be lame and inactive in class. In addition to this we had bad marks and everything was just horrible. In contrast, if the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students, the students get motivated and are more likely to get good marks and learn better and faster.

In conclusion it is important that the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students but additionally it is important too that the teacher has an higher level of knowledge than his students have. I am not saying that his knowledge needs to be excellent but at least he needs to know more than his students. In my opinion a mixture between both, having the ability to connect with students and having great knowledge about a subject, is what counts. These two things are related and one does not work without the other.
