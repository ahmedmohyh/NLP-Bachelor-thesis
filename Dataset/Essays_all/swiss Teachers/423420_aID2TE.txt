Kids in the western world spend a lot of their daily life in school, learning and being with teachers and friends. Even Sometimes you spend even more time with a particular teacher than your parents; so what is important in a good teacher? What and how would be the best way to go through a succesful school career? Is it more imprtant to relate well with the students, maybe be almost like a collegue or friend for them or having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

A teacher, who has empathy for the students and has the ability to relate well achieves higher goals because with them because even in school trust and comfort is really important. Being comfortable helps growing a relationship, which increases the will of learning something. I mean would you rather listen to a teacher who has no connection to the kids and you don't really understand or one who shows you empathy and relatability.

But should school be the place for having good relationships with teachers and where you feel understood? Shouldn't school at first be a place, where you know you'll get good informations and knowledge handed out? What even is the sense of school when this argument, that I said is not anymore the most important one? Why should there be a teacher who went to university for years to tell you about this information, that comes after the ability to relate well with the students. 

I think the ability to relate well with the students and the knowledge of the subject should go hand in hand. The one follows the other: For example when you like your teacher because he gives you the feeling that he understands you, you probably will listen to him. Then when he even has excellent knowledge I think that would be my favorite teacher. Like evrything in life you should balance this two kinds of benefits out.
