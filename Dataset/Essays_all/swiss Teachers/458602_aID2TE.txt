We all have different kinds of teachers. The strict one, the lazy one,the relatable one and the one we actualy really like going to the lessons to. But which teacher has the best qualities? The one that relates to us or the one that has an excellent knowledge?

A teacher must know the topic he is talking about or he will only tell the students nonsense. He must also be able to relate to the students in order to make it easier for them to understand and keep their attention during the lesson. If a teacher doesn't have the knowledge he cannot relate to the students because he will be over occupied with the content of the lesson and will not beable to teach them appropriately and after all, the obligation of a teacher is to teach the student in order for the student to be prepared for his following studies,life and his career.On the other hand if a teacher cannot relate with the students his lessons will be boring and the students will not pay attention and therefore won't remember much of the lesson and the topic. And once again the aim of teaching will not be achieved and because the student is the important person in this job his interests have the highest priority.
 
In my opinion in this fist and foremost important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the topic he is teaching as it is the most important part of his job but that is not the only quality I expect from a teacher.He must know how to teach and therefore relate with the students to a certain extent.If he ends up being to relatable the students will not take his courses to seriously.
