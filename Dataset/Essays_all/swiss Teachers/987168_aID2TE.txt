A teacher needs to know enough, to teach students. It`s hard to say how much this needs to be. If a student asks you something, you should always be able to answer correctly, if not you aren`t qualified to teach. Of course there are exceptions, for example very complexe questions can only be answered after a research on the internet or in a book. Of course it is important to relate well with students, otherwise you can`t make interesting english lessons. On the other hand, if you have perfect knowledege of the subject, the lesson might be borring, but you will get a very informative lesson. 
I personally like teachers, which i relate well with, a lot. They can make funny lessons, you will always pay full attention. In such lessons you can better learn things, that is a plus for teacher`s who relate well with their students and don`t have excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. But the question still is how much information was thought. If a teacher`s amount of knowledge isn`t very big he can learn you everything he knows, but this might be not enough.
Questions in lessons are very important. They help if don`t understand, what the teacher was talking about. If you already understand everything, but you are interrestet in more details, questions do help aswell. That means, a teacher needs to have enough knowledge to answer questions, even if they are very deep and complexe. Answers always have to be correct, if not a teacher can confuse his students completally. Confused students are a desaster for teacher. They spam lessons with silly questions and you cant go on with the actuell material.
