It's everything but easy to be a good teacher in our time. Some students prefer a teacher who acts like a father or a mother who helps them also in the private time. Other students say that a good teacher just has to have an excellent knowledge of the subject. They say, that teacher whose relation is good with his students haven't enough autority. But who is right? Which teacher is better?

In my opinion it's very important to be a respectful and helpful teacher. The better the relation and understanding between the teacher and his students, the better a teacher can teach them. The students are mostly more motivated when the teacher is nice and they want to understand the things the teacher says. 

It's important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject. But if he's too arrogant and unkind, the students will not like him. The feeling in these lessons is so bad that they mabye even don't listen to him. 

As a teacher you work everyday with other people. It's definitly not just the knowledge of a subject that make you a good teacher. I think if you have a huge knowledge of something but you can not work with other people because you're social disabled, you can work in a labor and use your knowledge there. 

To concluse I agree with the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." Especially in times we live in, it's important to force the social thing. Because with the internet and our mobilephone, the knowledge is easy to find. But the relations between people aren't. School isn't just there for knowledge, it's a bigger thing.
