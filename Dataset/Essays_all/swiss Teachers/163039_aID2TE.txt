This is a good question. The job of a teacher ist to teach the sudents something but what is more important? excellent knowledge of the subject or a good relationship with his students?

The job of a techer is to teach something to the students. So first we need to answer the question how the students learn something efficiently from the teacher. Some think that a teacher has to know everything about a topic, because then he can give the students as many informations they need. When students have questions he can answer them all and the relationship between them has not to be good, but also not bad. The students need informations and the teacher gives them these. So the only relationship which exists is speaker and listener.
But on the other hand there are some who think the relationship between a teacher and the students has to be good. It is like in working live. Teacher and student are a team and they can just reach something if they fix togehter. In the earlier societies the teacher had to get as much informations as possible but today you can get all informations in the internet and the teacher does nod need the excellent knowledge he can read all in the internet if a student has a question.
The first side thinks that if the relationship is too good between teacher amd student then the students will not learn anymore and just make silly stuff and will not listen anymore.
On the other hand a student can learn efficiently if he has a good relationship to the teacher. Whenthe teacher is sympathic for the student tht student tries to work as good as possibly because he feels an indirect feeling of duty to do what the teacher sais because he wants to keep the good relationship and he will work for it.

I think a teacher needs a good relationship to the students but he also need his knowledge. If he has just one it will not work. He need both in a balance and then the teacher can teach and the students can learn efficiently.
