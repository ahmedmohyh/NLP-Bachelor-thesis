I think both of it is important. To relate well, to interact and to communicate with the students is such as important as having a good knowledge of the subject. To interact well with the students isn`t more important than having an excellent knowledge of the subject though. Because how does a teacher want to teach his students when he doensn`t have a good knowledge of the subject? So it doesn`t work at all with only relating well with the students.
Teachers are here to teach the students the subject they have studied in and to give them a lot of informations about it. So it is essential to have a good or even excellent knowledge in this subject as a teacher if you want to have a high education level in a country like Switzerland.
So I would rather prefer a teacher with an excellent knowledge of a subject than having a teacher with almost no knowledge of his subject but who can relate well with the students because I am here in school to learn and to add new informations to my own knowledge. But it would be great to have a teacher with both abilities who can relate well to us students, so that he helps us and the lesson doesn`t seem as boring as it does in some teachers lessons and that he has a good or even an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching us. Those two abilities combined would make the lesson way more exciting and informative for both, the students and the teacher.
