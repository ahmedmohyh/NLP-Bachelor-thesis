A teacher who doesn't have an excellent knowledge of the subject he teachs is not that bad. Because if he doesn't understand a little bit of the subject he teaches, he wouldn't be a teacher. 
Also i think it's important for a teacher to have a good relation with his students because if not, it is very difficult to teach the students and then the students don't have respect. 

I think the most important thing to be a great teacher is, that he can explane very well. If not, the students understand nothing. This is a reason why I think the teachers don't have to study so much to be a primery school teacher or a gymnasial teacher. Because most of the teacher who are very intelligent or studied much, are very difficult to understand. And if the teacher have a good realtion with his student, the students listen more to him and understand the teacher better.
 


So this are the reasons why I agree with the statement.
