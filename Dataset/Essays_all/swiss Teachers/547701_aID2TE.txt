The importance of the ability to relate with students

Some people think that teachers should be able to relate well with students and that this task is more important than the actual knowledge of the teacher in a specific subject. In my opinion both of the facts are tremendous important because a teacher can't give his knowledge to his students if he's not able to relate well with them. But at the end of the day the students need to know the things they need to. It is much easier for the students to get the point of the subject when the teacher interacts with students who for example are not that fast and need help. Furthermore we can say that if students know, that their teacher can relate well with them, it is more likely that they go to school with a bigger motivation and try to do their best, whereas when the teacher is not able to get on with them, they will detest every lesson. 

As an example we can take me. During secondary school we had a biology teacher who had a great amount of knowledge in that subject but she was kind of strict and nobody got the point when she something. She like excepted to much from us students. Then she went on holidays and we got another teacher who was much younger but was able to tell us the facts with everyday examples like McDonalds or stuff like that. Everyone in our class liked him and went into the lessons with a smile.

So as a conclusion I can say that it is not more important but as important as the actual knowledge. During my school career I had different examples which proof the fact that it is much easier when the teacher can relate well with the students.
