Relationsship helps everywhere. With relations diffrent things get easier. Knowledge is espacially important if you are a teacher.

On the one hand, to relate well with your students is only giving you advantages. If you understand and respect them, your subject becomes favourously. Students learn more and they like visiting your subject. If you are funny, respectful, understanding and kind students love to come to your subject. When students love to come to your subject, they learn more and they even are easier to handle.

On the other hand, knowledge is important if you want to be a good teacher. If you have not got enough knowledge you will not be able to teach well. What do you want to teach your students if you do not know your subject. A good teacher has a huge knowledge. He knows thing above what he needs. He needs to get along with the most difficult questions because only like that he can explain everything.

Last but not least, you need to know how your students feel. If they do not understand what you are saying you need to explain it easier. It is often greatful if you once were in a position like them. If you also did not understand what youre teacher was saying. Because then you know what it takes to explain well. 

All in all, in my opinion you need to be talented in both ways. A good teacher is only good because he takes both caracteristics with him. If you take these caractersitics with you, you shoud become a great teacher. Because nothing stands over a teacher who raletes well and has a big amount of knowledge.
