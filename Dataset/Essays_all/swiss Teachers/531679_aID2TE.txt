A teacher must have different qualities when they would like to teach an class. Each class is different so, the teacher has to do use other qualities. They have classes which is very loud and heavy and other classes are to silent. It's important to find out in which class you use which points. When a teacher doesn't have an relatonsship with her students they don't have a connection. 
A teacher has a level of knowledge, because they have study something. 
But is it more important to relate well with students or an excellent knowledge?

An argument is that when a teacher has a connection with her students, the students know that the teacher can helps and understand what's the problem. When the teacher has no connection with her students, the students don't trust her. They would have problems to communicate together. But exactly that is important that students trust her teacher. So they have a well connection to communicate together. 
But what's about knowledge. When a person don't have any qualities didn't study something. Each person have a favorit election and each person has on thing which they doing well. The result is, that you study this election. So it is also important to have an level to study something. 

To be teacher you must be have an good knowledge. It helps to have an good knowlege before you start to study. When you don't have an qualities for that job, you don't have an chance to employ in this gov

My opinion is, that is more important to have an well relate with students than excellent knowledge. 
But I mean, both are important to be an teacher. To summary, for you future it will be confortable to have an good diplome. Also to study something which you love and have fun.
