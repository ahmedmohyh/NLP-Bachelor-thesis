To relate to the very same level as the students are, is way more important, because they have to set themselves to their positions and think about the topic, or whatever, form the view of students. This specific ability is very rare and because of that it´s even more important that a teacher uses it when he or she has it. In very high leveld universitys, for example the cambridge university, the students told some voleys that they were teached with a very high level, which means that the teacher are on a very high level. For me or also for some other students a teacher is on a very high level when they were very confidence with a good friend, because they were able to see the school subjects form the view of the students.

On the other side, the teacher has always the upper hand, which means he or she has always to be on a higher level than the others. It´s very important, that the teacher can bring the knowledge into the class or into the lesson and when they were able to relate well with the students you can´t ride both cars, in my opinion. When you konw so many things then you are very smart and can help yourself and others in some situations or you can even teach them the konwledge. 
It´s always good when you konw nearly everything about something, but what when you can´t bring it to the students? You just can´t know everything and think you are a good teacher because of that. 

In other words I would prefer that teachers relate well with students than excellent knowledge of the subject which they were taught. Of cours it would be great to know so many things about something, but it´s worthless when you can´t taugh somebody.
