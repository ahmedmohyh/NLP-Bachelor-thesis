Is it more important for a teacher to be able to relate with the students or is it more important for the teacher to have a lot of knowledge about the subject? I am sertain a lot of people would answer this question differenty. I personaly can relate to both of the sides. 
When the children beeing taught are younger, it's probably better for the teacher to be able to understand them well enough to help if there is a problem. As specialy students in kindergarden need a lot of support when it comes to going to school and spending time in a different place other than home. If the childen are understood they can feel more welcome and are not worried or upset to go again the next day. When the teacher relates to the students well enough, they can teach them in a way that is most confortable for the kids. 
If the children are older or even teenagers they act differently from the young kindergardeners, they try to seem more grown up than they are. During this age the students don't want to be treated like a baby, they probably don't even want to go to school anyway. In that case I think it is more important for the teacher to make sure the students learn the correct thing and don't spend to much time relating to them. The student should be educated with excellent knowledge in order to be prepaired correctly for tests and life. If the teacher wouldn't educate the kids correctly, they would have to teach themselfes all of the things at home. And the whole point of going to school is to learn something and not to be understood and taken care of. Mostly the older students are just waiting to go home, beacuse that's where their parents take over th role of the teacher and try to relate to them in order to help. 
I think in the end the question isn't about if the teacher should relate to the children or educate them correctly, its more about figuring out which age group need what. As specially because each child is different and has different needs.
