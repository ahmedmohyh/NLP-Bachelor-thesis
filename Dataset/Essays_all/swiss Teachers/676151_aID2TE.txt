Being a teacher

To be a teacher is a difficult thing. You can be a great teacher or a worse. But what is the most important thing of being a teacher? Is it your ability to relate well with students or an excellent knowledge of your subject?

It`s always a good thing to be informed aboout your subject. This ia a big disadvantage but how can you deal with it, if you didn`t teach as well? Your`re hated by the students and they didn`t listen anyway. 
In the other side, when you have a good feeling for human being, understand the students and you`re able to teach and explain your subject right, but didn`t really know much about it. There is a little possibility, that you teach ,them the false things. And this is much worser, than teaching them nothing. 
But this happends raerly and maybe the students didin`t learn much with this teacher, but they eventually have fun.

And this is the reason why I agree with this statement. You`re a better teacher when the stundets learn a little bit about your subject than nothing.
