Several aspects influent the learningproces of the students. First of all the teacher should be competent, he should have a good knowledge about his subject and have a good relationship to his students, of course bouth is important, with just one of this two abilities the teaching is not done. There are more aspects, for an example it's important that the students understand the stuff they have to learn, so the teacher should give good explications, that it's easy to follow the lessons although new stuff is taught. If the students understand, they like the lessons more than if they don't understand anything. It's an adwantage if the students like to go to school and to their specific teachers and for that a good relationship would help to motivate the students. A good teacher should be able to give answers to each students question, and listen what they say. For this aspect is an excellent knowledge of the subject useful. But alsow the the ability to relate well with students. I think bouth learn as much as possible
