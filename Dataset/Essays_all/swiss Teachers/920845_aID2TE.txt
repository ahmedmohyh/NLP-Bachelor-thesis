The perfect teacher, relates to stundents and is an experty in his subject. But we don't live in a perfect world, so we have to value, which is more significant.
The most important thing is, that a teacher needs at least a bit of both. Without a relation to students, we could save the money of a teacher and let the students learn for themselves, by the internet or book, since without a relation without the students, they wouldn't listen to the teaching person. But if the teacher doesn't know anything, how can he teach the students? But what is the advatage of an more relatable teacher? Students have it easier to learn, it is more enjoyable and the teacher motivates you. You can't learn if you doesn't want to and a bad relatable teacher is the first step for dismotivation. But the teacher can't just motivate students, he also has to teach them, so he needs to know the things. The better the teacher understands it, the better, more accurate and easier he can teach it. But is 'excellent' knowledge needed? It depends, on the students. The younger the students are, there is more need for relateble skills than knowledge, but still the basic knowledge has to be accurate. But as the students grow and get more experienced in the school or university enviorenment and know more things, the knowledge becomes more and more important and relative to the knowlegde, the relateble skill becomes less significant.
As for my opinion the relatble skill is more important, than the knowledge, but it shouldn't be forgotten. You need both, but I personally agree with the statement. You don't need to teach the students, you need to create an evironment, were the students can learn by themselves and evolve.
