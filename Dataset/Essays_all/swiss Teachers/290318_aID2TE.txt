I believe it is true that a teacher's ability to relate to students is important, but what good is a teacher who is nice, funny, and who gives good grades, when you don't learn anything in his class?
Of course it is difficult to concentrate and enjoy the lesson when the teacher seems like he is from a different species, maybe even seems to feel like he's above the younger students. My German teacher for example has a very set point of view on the youth of today. No matter what we say or do, we will never get her to see us as equals, or as interested, engaged members of our society. My history teacher can't even hold our gaze for too long before nervously looking away. My French teacher seems absolutely terrified of us.
But all these teachers know their subjects well. They teach us about grammar, about the confederation of the United States, or about "le subjonctif". And as long as I can walk out of the classroom knowing more than I did when I came in, I feel like my time was well spent. I cannot sit in a class room for an hour, listening to a teacher joke around and converse with fellow students, trying to build his or her image as a likeable, funny teacher, when I can't learn anything from him or her. I come to school to learn.

However, I am not saying I agree with all the teaching methods. I believe that when you decide to become a teacher, you aren't just committing yourself to a lifetime of explaining your favorite subject. After all, you are explaining it to students. I do not understand teachers who can't seem to stand students, or even talk to them. If you think that we are such horrible, spoiled brats, then why did you choose this job?
