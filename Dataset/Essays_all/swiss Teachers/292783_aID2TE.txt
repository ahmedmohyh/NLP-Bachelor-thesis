I think the relationship between student and teacher is very important, because this relationship has a very big influence of how much the students will learn. Of course the knowledge of a teacher is also important, but if the teacher don't know, how he can give his knowledge to his students, the student wont learn a lot. If a teacher relate well with his students, the students like to go in his lessons, so the students are more motivatet. And I think motivation is one of the most important things for learning. Here is an example: If I know Mr. X makes some jokes in his lessons and is a friendly person, then I like to go to his lessons and then I'm open for learning something new and listen to this teacher. But if the teachers knowledge is huge, but he only stands in front of me and the whole lesson is talking about a topic whithout any interesse in the students, I only sit on my chair and can't really follow what he sais.
An other important point is respect, I think. If the teacher respects the students and the students respect the teacher, the athmosphere in the classroom is much better and everyone feels good. And the athmosphere is very important too. If the students are afraid of the teacher and the athmosphere is not good, the students make a wall between them and the teacher and they will learn nothing. So yes, a teacher's ability to relate well with student is more important.
