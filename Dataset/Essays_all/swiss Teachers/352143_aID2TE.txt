Who likes teachers, am I right? Teachers always think everything is so easy to understand and students need to understand everything right away. It would be so much easier if teachers could connect with us in another and better way. But the question is, do you want a teacher to connect with in a friendly way or a thougher teacher who wants to teach you soemthing the right way?
On one hand, if the teacher doesn't have enough knowledge in his subject, how can he help you when you don't understand something? He has to have enough knowledge to repsone to almost every question possible in his subject. It's important to give you as much information you need so that you understand what he's trying to teach you.
 On the other hand, he has to understand what your question is. If a teacher isn't able to realte well with his students, he doesnt know how to help you with question or he isn't even capeable to really relate with your question and so it's not possible for him to help you solve your problem. A teacher has to realte well with his students so he can help everybody individually and students dont get stressed if they don't understand something.
But the most important argument is that a teacher has to remain a teacher. Teachers are here to teach you something you don't know, and if they don't have an excellent knowledge in their subject, they can't teach you. If they're not informed perfectly about what they are teaching, how can we be sure we ge taught the wright thing? 
As a conclusion, a teacher which you can relate to is something that will help you in the moment, but a teacher who  you cant really relate to very well but gives you the best and especially true informations has a much bigger worth for you, not only now but also in the future. Besides, how can a student understand what a teacher is saying, if the teacher himselfe doesn'treally understand what he's telling them?
