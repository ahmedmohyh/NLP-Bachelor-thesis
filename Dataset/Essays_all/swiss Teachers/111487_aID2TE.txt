Of course the teacher's ability to relate with students is important. When we have a good relationship to our teacher, we can learn better and with more interest. So we didn't get bored very fast and we can concentrate us on the topic of the lesson. And we also ask more questions when we didn't understand something or when something isn't clear. So we understand it better and we can go at home without to learn many hours for an exam because we understand the most things. We only had to repeat it a little bit. Perhaps some people are afraid of a teacher so they got a pression to be good and that's why they got bad marks at exams. But when the teacher can relate well with the students, the students didn't have to worry about something. So they can learn without any pression.

But of course the excellent knowledge of the subject is also very important. Because a good relationship with the teacher is nothing without a good knowledge of the subject. We couldn't learn something in the lesson when the teacher have no idea about the subject. Then the good relation to the students is for nothing. It's true it makes more fun to go into the school when we are good related with the teacher but when we couldn't learn something then we can also stay at home.

My opinion is that we need a good relationship to teacher because so we can learn with more motivation and when we are in trouble we can go to our teacher and speak about the problem still we solve it. But we also need a teacher who can explain us something so we can learn it better and much faster. Both of the is important. The combination of the both is the best.
