In school it's important for every student to have a stable inviroment to study and learn. Most of the times the students need to have a good class, but sometimes it's not enough. 
For a student it isn't important to like your teacher, because school should be professional in some way and that can only be accomplished by having a distant relationship between teacher should be there to teach the kids certain things and not to be their friend, because in the end the only thing that matters is, that the students get educated well. But most students pay attention much better if the lesson is taught by a teacher they like, because they can relate with the teacher and are more open to ask questions. Many students aren't likely to raise their hands and give an answer to a task, if they dislike the teacher or are afraid. But if a teacher likes or dislikes some of the children of the class the grading could get very unprofessional. Some teacher are likely to give better grades to those studens who are behaving well and always do their homework. A teacher who doesn't have a connection to the studens can't understand them, because he cant' imagine how one of the students feels.
So if I had to choose the way, how it would be, I would choose both. I think it's important for both, the teacher and the student. to get along very well, because if they don't, it wouldn't go well for long. In my class some of the student have a healthier relationship to some of the teacher and I think they a very good time int the lessons. Sometimes  teacher has a strange opinion on a student and you get to feel that in the way the teacher handles certain situations. I think that a good connection is possible without conflicts of any sort. In my opinion a teacher is able to like a student and to fair to the whole class and the other way round.
