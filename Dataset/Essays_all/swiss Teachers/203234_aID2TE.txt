It is essential for any teacher to be able to relate to his students. And I think that many teachers fail in this part of their lessons. I, as a student, am familliar with the problem.
Every desition that a human makes, is made in his own body. This means that whether a student studys or not is  his own choice. If he sits in the classroom and gets bombarded with tons of information, he will get annoied very quickly. Of course there are some individuals that like this style of lessons, but the majority doesn't. So, if the teacher is kind to his students, if he helps them a lot and if he's willing to assist every single one of them, he will be able to teach them a lot more. 
Furthermore, teachers who are not only focusing on getting their knowledge out of their brains, but also on stuffing it into their students heads, will be accepted by the students. And as soon as these start to like their teacher, they will be more interested in paying attention to him in general.
Finally, it is a common fact, that the biggest part of the new knowledge is forgotten again by the students. They will focus on what they think is important. So in the end the extra information of the genious teacher isn't really needed. 
To sum it all up, I think that teachers who can relate to their students are supperior to ones who simply throw knowledge arround them. A good relation between the students and the teacher will strengthen  a students will to study.
