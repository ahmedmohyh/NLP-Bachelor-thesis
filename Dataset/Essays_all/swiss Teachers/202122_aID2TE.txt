It is indeed very important for a teacher to have excellent knowledge of the subject they're teaching. If not it can be quiet difficult for a student to understand something because if the teacher doesn't fully understand all the aspects of a subject himself he can't even explain difficult things regarding the subject. I also think that it is very important for a teacher to have the ability to answer the students questions. And answering questions requires knowledge. A teacher shouldn't have to look up everything he's asked. I think if a teacher doesn't fully understand his subject it shows that it could be that he didn't choose to be a teacher because of teaching actual knowledge but that the main reason was the money he gets paid.

On the other hand it is also very important to relate with the students. You can have the deepest knowledge in a subject and know almost everything there is to know about it but if you're not sociable and can't really interact with the students the students won't make any improvement and won't learn anything at all. A teacher should also know where his students stand knowledgewise and regularly ask them if they understand everything and if he doesn't do this or if he acts ignorrant or even arrogant the students won' be motivated so they won't work. But it isn't only the teachers responsibility the students also have to bring a certain amount of motivation and will to work to the lessons.

In my opinion a teacher should have both abilities. It is important to have knowledge but it is also important if not more important to have the ability to spread this knowledge and give this knowledge to your students. So a mix would be perfect. I think having a good student-teacher relationship is a key to successful learning, teaching and the atmosphere and will to work during the lessons.
