I agree with this statement.
A teacher who is really good at his subject but can't relate to his students doesn't teach the students anything. 
First of all if the teacher is boring nobody listens to him. He has to be really into his subject so that the he can share his knowledge and excitement with his students. If he has the mentality that these are just students and it's their problem if they don't listen he is a bad teacher no matter how much he knows about his subject. He has to bring the happines to his students about his subject. On the other side if the teacher doesn't know anything or doesn't know how to explain something because he's not good at his subject, then it doesn't matter how good his teaching abilitys are. He has to know something about it otherwise there is nothing to teach the students.
Second of all when the teacher knows everything and has a really high IQ he maybe expects too much from the students because it would be "easy" for him. But for a student that is willing to learn but doesn't know much yet it's harder than for an other student and a good teacher should see that and help this person. Not everyone is good at this subject, everyone has their strenghts and weaknesses.
Third of all there are times when a student has a rough time maybe becuase someone died in his family or something like that. In this time it's hard to concentrate and the will to learn is not there. A good teacher should be able to relate to that and help him trough this time and realease the presure of school. Fourth of all maybe a student has other prioritys in his life. Maybe it's a sport or maybe an other subject. A teacher should be able to relate to this and bring the most excitement as possible to this student even though it maybe doesn't work so well as with other students. Don't ignore either of them. 
In my opinion brining excitement to the student is the most important thing because then they are willing to learn the most.
