Some people may think that being a teacher is an easy job everyone could do. You only have to stay in front of a class an teach them what you have studied. ,,Knowledge is power'' one could say, but related to the statement, is that really true? Don't you need to have more qualities to be a good teacher, like the ability to relate well with students?

An argument in favor would be that psychologically it is crucial that a teacher does not only have a superb knowledge but also has a feeling how he has to teach students the corresponding subject/s. Without building a kind of 'relation' with the students, there isn't a good coorporation in the lessons, as the students can feel that the teacher 'only' stands there and does what has to be done. 
For example in maths, some teacher except that you suddenly understand the learning matter as it is logical for the maths teacher, but the he also has to understand that students are confronted with a totally new subject they first have to learn. 
Some may understand it more than others and thats why also the teacher has to at least try to relate to the situation of the students.

A counterargument would be that before you can even teach you need to have a deep, or as the statement says, an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. So the ability to relate well with students could not be more important. An example for it would be that you can't just become a teacher because you think you can relate well with people.

In the end i think that both points are needed to be a good teacher. Students like to work with teachers that really do their best to teach them the subject but to fulfill that, the teacher needs to have at least a good knowledge.
