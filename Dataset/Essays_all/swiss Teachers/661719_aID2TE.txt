I think the teachers ability is more important than the knowledge of the subjek being thaught because if the ability of the teacher is better than the students will be more interessted in the subjet and will be more motivated too.
the first reason why I think ability to relate well with students is that the students will learn more in the lessens because the time in the classroom will  be funny and "learnful" too. The way of the excellent knowledge of the teacher is not so helpful if the Teachers don't know how to do exercises with the students. Mostly the teacher let the students do exercices from the book and then talks the teacher a lot. She or he talks a lot because he/she has the excellent knowledge and want to explain everything in a short time.
But a Teacher who is well with the students can do more exercises and the students are mostly more active in the classroom because they feel maybe better with this teacher. And the time in the classroom goes faster because its more interesting to listen a teacher who can explain good. The negative point of the teacher who has not a excellent knowledge of his subject is that if a student asks the teacher a question and the teacher doesn't know the answer then maybe think the students that the teacher is bad. But thats not so important. The teacher can allways look for an answer and explain it on the next lesson.
Finally I still think the teacher who has abilitiy to relate well with students is more better than the other. Mosty are they cooler and more comfortable than the teachers with excellent knowledge.
