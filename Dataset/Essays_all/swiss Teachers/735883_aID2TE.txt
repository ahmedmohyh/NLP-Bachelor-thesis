In school it's really improtant that we learn something. And the most important people are the teachers. It relys on what they do if we listen or not.
When a teacher can't relate well with students then they wont listen to him carfully and his knowledge don't helps him. The students need a teacher wich they like because then they like to come to his lessons and learn something from him. For example when I have a lesson with a teacher I like even a subject i don't like is interessting but when I have a teacher I don't like then I wont go to his lesson and I wont listen to him. But when a teacher we relate well has no knowledge then we don't learn anything too. 
Otherwise when a teacher has exellent knowledge the students see that and this can also be a reasen to listen carfully to the teacher.For example when a teacher talks about a theme I'm interrested in then I listen to him and I will automatically learn something about it. When students know that the teacher don't understand his theme then they won't listen to him too. 
A teacher who has an exellent knowledge maybe can't bring it to the students because he explains it to complicated. For example when a teacher talks very complicated then I listen the first few minutes and then I think that I wont understand everything and this doesen't rely on what I do then I wont listen to him anymore and do better things. 
In my opinion there are three improtant things to learn something in school: a teacher who we relate well or at least okey, a teacher who has good knowledge and a teacher who can explain it good to the students. All this things count then just one thing is not enough.
