Nowadays, people are discussing whether the teacher's ability to communicate and relate well with their students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject or vice versa.   

On the one hand, a teacher exists to give students important knowledge which they will be able to use later on. But on the other, if the students have a bad relationship to their teacher, he could try to make the lessons as interesting as possible but they wouldn't be willed to learn what he is trying to teach them because they do not like him. 

Secondly if the students want to profit from their teacher's huge knowledge they need to be ask him. But they will not ask him if they do not like him very much. So a good relationship is required. Further more they listen to your advice.

Lastly they will trust you to teaching them useful knowledge which they wouldn't if you are not so popular with them.

To summarize I think it is more important to get round well with students because they are more willed to learn tfor the subject and they are more likely to listen to your advice and trust you to lead them through school successfully.
