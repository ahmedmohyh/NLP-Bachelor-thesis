I want to tell something about a subject which is very important in school, the relationship between a teacher and student or the question how nice or strict should a teacher be? My opinion is, in general a teacher should be a person who gets respect from his students otherwise it does not work in a school, because if this is not the case the students do what they want to do in a lesson. 

I do not really agree with this statement that the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt, because sure it is a very important aspect to have a good relationship with the teacher but the teacher should be an authority person. There are some teacher who feels like a friend from a student and I think this is not right. Both is important a teacher should have the knowledge and he should be nice with his students. And today a teacher is not only a person who teaches the students in the lessons like history or something, I think today is a teacher a person who has to teach the students also in other things for example: how you should talk when you have an important discussion. Or the teacher shows you how you can get a job in future. I think another problem or maybe not problem but a fact is that the teachers, who teachs in school for example in a gymnasium or in another school with students between sixteen until twenty or something, are getting younger and younger there are some sport teacher who are maybe 23 years old. And I think it is really hard to stay a teacher and not be like a friend if there are only 5 years between a teacher and a stundent.

At the end I have to say there have to be a good mix with both of it.
