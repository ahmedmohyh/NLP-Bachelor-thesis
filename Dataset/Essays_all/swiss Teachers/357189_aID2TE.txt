Are teachers ment to be a good friend or a book of information

Teachers often work with the younger generation and spend the most of their life with them. So do they really have to have a good relationship with the children or is it more important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. What's the profession of a teacher. Is she just a tutor who explains everything to the students and beside the school never talk to them or is she a person whom the students could trust and talk to about certain things?

To become a teacher you have to make a course to learn how to get on well with the children and to read their minds. So teachers are here for the children as a part of a parential function. They not only teach them the school subjects mostly they also teach how to behave well and move correctly in the society.

On the one hand teachers are an advisor but it is important that the children learn something about the main subjects of the school. Children got to school interact with other children and to learn together in the same class room. And teachers do not belong in the circle of the children because they are above the children and they are the one to teach them the right. 

To answer the question, if it is important to have a good relation to the children as a teacher or to know everything about the specific subject they teach, we have enough information from the past. So I think children would learn more from a teacher who knows less about the subject than another teacher does but has a better relation to the students. If the teacher is interesting enough the subject also would be interesting. For an example I used to hate the French language but know I love it and later I realised that the language was not the problem but the teacher was.

To enclose it is simply said that teacher with more love to children are better teacher.
