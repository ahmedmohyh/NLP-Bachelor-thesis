What is worse? A teacher who is an expert about a topic but cannot relate with students if they dont get everything the teacher explains or a teacher who isn't as knowledgable but knows exactly what the students need to hear to understand the topic? 

For me the answer is clear. A teacher should be able to relate well with his students in order to teach them properly. Often times there are a few students that need more time to understand something and therefore the teacher needs patience. He or she needs to understand that not the entire class is as fast in understanding things as he thinks it might be. Furthermore the teacher has to understand what the students don't  and how he could explain it such that it makes sense to them. It won't be helpful for students if the teacher knows everything perfectly but cannot give proper answers. The students get taught more but what keeps in their minds eventually is much less. 

One could argue that teachers are specialized people and should therefore be masters of their subject and know everything. I don't think that this is true. You don't need to know the entire range of your subject in order to be a teacher. It is much more important that you teach your students properly in order to make them understand what you are talking about.
