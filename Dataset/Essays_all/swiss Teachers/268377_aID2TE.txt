A very discussed topic nowadays is, if it is more important that a teacher relates well with his students or if it is is more importandt that he has exellent knowledge of the subject being taught. The perfect thing would be to have both qualifications, but we know that this is often not the case, so let us talk about the advantages and disadvantages of both sides.

First let's focus on the ability to relate well with students. This is a very important point of being teacher, because a student that goes along well with his teacher can often concentrate better in class and also wants to participate more in class. This are two very important things because they often lead to better understanding of a subject and more interest. On the other side the students can also be to relaxed because they know that the teacher is not going to do anithing about it and that would not be good at all. 

Now let's come to the point, of teacher having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. This is also very important because this is the reason why the teacher is the teacher. He has to know the subject so that he can teach his students and that is what school is for. But if the teacher is to strict and cannot be relate with his students the might have no interests and just do not listen to him. That would be even worse.

Both sides are important for a teacher, he needs a bit of both to be a good teacher and to get the best out of his students. But if I need to chose one, it would be the ability to relate with the students, because if the teacher doesn't know something he can work with his student at the subject or at the specific question. Like this the interest of the students is even higher and by searching a subject by your own you might lern even more.
