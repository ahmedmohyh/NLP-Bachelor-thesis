On one hand, the statement is true, because it is easier for a teacher to understand this students and talk about problems or about the lesson. For example when someone is being bullied and wants to talk to the teacher. They talk and the teacher is open and can better relate and understand the student, which is more important than the subject at the moment.
Moreover, it is good when students can be open with their teacher and the teacher does not get angry very fast. For example, when the students ask for another date for the exam, because they already have a lot of exams that week and the teacher understands that his or her students are probably stressed out. 

On the other hand, I disagree with the statement, because if a teacher relates too well with the students, the students take advantage of the situation and overthrow the teacher. The teacher loses the control over the students, so the knowledge being taught is swallowed by a lot of chatter, for example.
Secondly, students go to school, because they want to learn something and not to have a good friendship with their teachers. The knowledge being taught is important for a students future and not the fact that the teacher can relate  well with the students.

I disagree with the statement, even though it is important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students, but I do not think that this ability is more important than the knowledge being taught. We go to school to learn something, so that in a few years we can build our future.
