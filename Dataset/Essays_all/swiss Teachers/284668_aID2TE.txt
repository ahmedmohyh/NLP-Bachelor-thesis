To have a good relationship between a teacher and a student is very important. I am asking myself if it is more important to have a good relationship or to have a knowledge of the subject being taught.

A teacher who knows how to deal with different kind of students is great. It is very important to get well along with them. It is easier to teach them stuff if you are on a friendly basis especially when the students are still young. In this case they can not see the big difference between student and teacher anymore. The problem is that this could also lead to a loss of respect. A teacher should be a person with a big authority against the students. If the relationship between the students and the teacher is too well they might get more disrespectfull and they might not take them very serious anymore.

Of course a teacher has to have a big or wide range of knowledge of the subject being taught. Otherwise he would not be a good teacher. The teacher has to be able to know almost everything about the specific subject because he is like an expert and it is his job so he gets paid to teach students something about this subject.

As a conclusion I can say that I think to have an excellent knowledge of the subject is more important than the ability to relate well with students. But to be a good teacher you must also be able to relate well with them or otherwise they will not like you and your lessons.
