Teachers are either being good at teaching or good at relating to stundents, but it seems as if both is not possible.

In my opinion is it more important to have teachers being able to connect with students than having someone who can teach their subject well. It is harder to prove the ability of relating with students than to increase your knowledge by studying more. 

If a student has a problem or is no feeling well, the teacher should be able to help him by either only noticing the problem or also having a solution to help the student. A teacher who knows everything about his preferred subject may not be able to notice the problems the students may have or even be able to help them.Relating to other people who might be on an other level is hard to learn or even impossible sometimes. 

I have a teacher with the ability to relate to students and even notice their current mood, so if I have problems at the moment with either school or something else, she "sees" that and asks if I am okay or need anything. If you are or look ill, she is going to take her time to ask how you feel or if you would rather go home. 

So at a time where mobbing and grade pressure are a daily issue, I find it crucial for teachers of any subbjects to be able to connect with their stundents on a certain base and to notice any changes in their behaviour, of either small or drastic measure.
