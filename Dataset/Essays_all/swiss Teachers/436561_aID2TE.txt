Here in switzerland everyone has the privilege to have a good education, this isn't in every country like this, so we have to be luky. But often children/adults don't really like going to school, they're different reasons why, but the most popular one is that they don't connect well with the teacher(s). So the actual question is: is it better  to love going to school but without learning or to hate going to school and learn something?

It's hard to answer this question, so let's think about it: for example when a six year old girl goes for the first time in her life to school, but she has an awful teacher and cries every morning, because she hates going their. So maybe she is so frustraded that she never likes going to school and have a good education. So is this better than learn nothing? But on the other hand what should a six year old girl do, when she can nothing? In our society a good eduction, in fact a good job, is one of the most important things in life. For many people their job is their life. Without a good eduction, so without learning you can't achieve succes, and this is a problem. Another point is, that you have to change school for a few times in your life, so the teachers changes too. For example from primary school to secondary and then maybe to university or many different other possibilities. I know nobody who had just one teacher in their hole lifetime, so you have good chances the get a few teachers you like and maybe they are some you don't like, but this is life, isn't it?

I think their is not "the right answer" for the statement, they're so many different points it depends on. It's also important who you are. If you are  someone who wants succes and fight for the things you want or if you are a lazy person and doesn't really care about the future. In the end I can say that in switzerland you have the oppertunity to remove from one school to another and you have so many different ways to get the education you want.
