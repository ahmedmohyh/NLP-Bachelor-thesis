I am convinced that physics teacher that rather focuses on empathy gets much better results than a brilliant physician with less ability to meet the students where they curretly stand. Physics beeing an abstract subject of high difficulty, in which good grades are mostly achieved by talent and not by hard work, an emphatic teacher can make a difference. Brilliant scientists might have problems relating to somebody who doesn^t share their passion for the subject. While they are drifting in the endless debts of the world of numebers and abstract processes, stundents might not event understand the basic laws of them. This situation benefits the passionate students, while it fustrates the less interested ones. A less brilliant, but more sensible teacher could teach the less ambitious students easy, basic stuff without feeling like his talent for the subject ist beeing wasted. This leads me to the conclusion that teacher gifted with an exeptionallly large knowledge should be teaching in specialized classes, while teachers putting their focus on hepling the students should teach the basic, less adavenced classes.
