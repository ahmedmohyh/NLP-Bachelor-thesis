It's very important for students to be well treated by their teacher. If a teacher is able to connect themselves with students, understand them and respect their needs, they will feel more comfortable during classes. Of course it is also important that a teacher knows the subject, but the best knowledge of it is pointless if the students don't give full attention because they do not like the person that stands in front of them and tries to teach them a subject that they are maybe not interested in. Of course, they could also not be interested when they like the teacher, but a nice and well-known person is better able to motivate students to study anyway. But the teacher has to find a mixture between good relation to his students and a good knowledge. If he acts too friendly to them, they will propably not respect him anymore, because they don't see him as a authority. The other way, if a teacher knows too less about the subject, the quality of the class will be badly hurt, because he the teacher is not available to answer questions or explain things well enough. And a teacher who doesn't know his own subject is nothing worth, is he? 
In my opinion, the teacher should rather watch to have a good relationship to his students than know every detail, but be prepared to teach them as well as they can pass their exams without any problems.
