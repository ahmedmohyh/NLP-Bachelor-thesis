A good teacher is hard to define. Is it more important that he/she can relate with his/her students or is the defining factor the knowledge he/she has? This question will be discussed in this short essay.

On the one hand it has to besaid that if a teacher can't relate with his/her students this can lead to a bad learning attitude of the students and a bad class environment. Nobody likes learning with a teacher one doesn't like and can't respect. So a lot of students show some kind of resistance. It doesn't matter if the subject being taucht is actually very interesting. If the teacher lost the connection to the students they often stop paying attention. But if students like their teacher and feel closer to him/her they are more motivated to learn. So an ability to relate well with students can be cruscial for good lessons.
On the other hand an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught can also be of great importance. When students realise how intelligent their teacher is that often leads to them respecting him/her more. Also it is appriciated when a teacher can answer every kind of question concerning that subject. Furthermore, the actual reason you go to school is to improveyour knowledge in certain subjects so it is necessary that the teacher is actually able to teach you. This means a teacher has to be AT LEAST smarter thatn the student. It has to be metionned though that if a teacher  knows what he's talking about but can't relate with his students the lessons can get very boring which leads to people paying less attention.

In my opinion a teacher has to have both: The ability  to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge in his/her subject. The mixture of both makes the perfect teacher. Though I think personally I would prefere a teacher who knows his/her subject to a nice teacher beacause I'm in school to learn not to build up a good relatioon to my teacher.
