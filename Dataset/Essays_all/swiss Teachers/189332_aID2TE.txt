In every school there is one teacher, very often a math teacher, who knows his subject very well, but his lessons are so boring and you would like to sleep because there isn't a possiblity for you to relate to the them. 

First of all a teacher should be able to relate to his students and try to make the lesson as interesting as possible to catch the attention of everyone. Because if he's not able to do this, the lessons won't be intersting neither for him nor for any of the pupils sitting in front of him. 
Furthermore a teacher is, as the word says, a person who teaches somebody to do something. So it's not only to know the subject but also to know how to teach. In other words to know how to make the subject interesting for another person, to relate with the pupil. Because that's what the difference between a good teacher and a bad teacher is. A good teacher is a teacher who can win his students for his subject and how can share the love with them and not a grumpy one who has a great knowledge but has no idea how to communicate with students.  

On the other hand the teacher studies his subject the best and this is what counts the most. He has give his knowledge to others. It helps nobody if the teacher doesn't know his subject and teaches the children wrong things. Furthermore every teacher gets a sort of teaching how to teach students and how to relate to them. So there is nobody how can't relate at least a little bit with the student.

All in all I think both abilities are very important to get the best education for a student. And I think also that it really depends on the age of students. But it's definitely really important for yountg students. And also when I think back at teachers with a bad ability to relate to me. I wish they would have had another job and I would get a teacher how can win me for my subject.
