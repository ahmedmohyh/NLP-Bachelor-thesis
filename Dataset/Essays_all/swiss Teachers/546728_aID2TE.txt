In schools you often can hear how the students say that this professor is so boring even though he knows so much about his subject while this other teacher is such a nice and friendly person, but maybe he doesn't know as much as the professor. So we often ask the same question: Is it more important to have a teacher who has the ability to relate well with students than a teacher with excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

There are many pros to have a teacher who can realte well with suents. Because of this teacher who automatically seems to be more friendly and also helpful the students like to go to his lessons. They are also more interested in the subject and they really try to understand the subject. 

But on the other hand there are some cons too. Because when a teacher is friendly but he doesn't know anything about his subject the students aren't able to learn something. So they become stupit while other classes can learn something. When the teacher knows a lot about his work he can make the lessons really thrilling but the only problem I can see about a teacher who knows much is that you don't try to ask a question because you have to much respect of  of this person. 

Personnally I would prefer a teacher who knows much than a teacher with the ability of relate well with students. Because I'm going to school for learning some new stuff and not for having a great and funny time with teachers. I don't like these teachers who are really friendly and have so great characters, but can't teach their subject and you learn there nothing. As a person I like these people but as a teacher I don't do. Every teacher who is really in to his work is interessting and thrilling. I don't know a single teacher of this kind who is boring. I think when a teacher knows much and loves his job it's always a good thing and then you don't have to ask you this question.
