So many people are saying that a well knowledge of a theacher is the most important thing in the whole schoolsystem. 
But how is it, if the teacher knows everything about his subject but hasn't the ability to relate well with student? 
Clearly these two things have nothing really together, because being nice to each other is a personal thing and having a high knowledge the other. 
But in the end we can say that it is more important than we are thinking.

It is very important that a teacher, not just in the Gymnasium level has an excellent knowledge of his subject. Not just because he has to teach us the stuff also because he should know more then the students and represent an idole.

But even more important in my eyes is that the teacher knows how to relate with us. Without kindness students often lose the respect for the teacher and they aren't able to do something serious for this subject. In conclusen there will be no motivation to do something even when the subject should make fun or is important.

So in the end we can say that a good mixture of both is the best. Because having a good knowledge of his taught subject and having the ability to relate well with the students has nothinig really together.
