A teacher has to be good in a lot of different areas, the most important is to be able to relate well with their students and to have more than just general knowledge about their subject. If you ask the students, a lot of different answers will come, because not every student thinks the same.

First of all, a teacher, especially in middle school, has to be able to understand and help their students more than a teacher from a higher level. Let's think about a  student in the third grade. That student does not only needs help in math or biology or chemistry but also in areas not related to school. If a ten year old kid has problems at home it is much more likely that he is going to ask his teacher for helpful advice. However grades are more important in the school system which brings us to the next point.

Let's now take a university student as our example. The chance that a university student is goint to ask his proffessor about advice for other problems than school is virtually zero. In a university the proffessor needs to have a very good understanding of the subject which they are teaching. Relating well with students does not matter. What really matters for a university student is pass.

At the end there is no right answer because both abilities of a teacher are essential in real life to make the best out of their students. For lower class students it is much more important having mental support from their teacher than to a university student, but profiting from the excellent knowledge of a proffessor is more important for university students.
