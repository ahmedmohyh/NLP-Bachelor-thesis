Is a teacher`s ability to relate well with stundents more importatn tahn excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

Nowadays educations plays an important role in our society and having teachers who can relate well to students is essential. But is it even more important that having an excellent knowledge about the subject being taught?

Many would disagree with that statement for only undersanding a topic well can guarantee good marks and a good degree. For examle if a teacher has a great relationship with his/her student, however lacks knowledge about the subject taught, the students will probable get along well with the teacher, but fail to undersand the over-all topic. Only when receiving relevant and structured information can a student process it correctly and initiate the learing progress.

There are many teachers though who cannot transmit the necessary information to students due to a disfunctional student-teacher relationship and not being able to relate well with them. No matter how knowlegdable the teacher is, if his lessons are boring and impersonal no student will be motivated to study thoroughly as well as feel distanced from the professor and therefore will fail to understand the topic as well. Moreover the students will not feel the necessary connection to discuss these issues with the professor.

That is why, in my opinion a good teacher needs to have both qualities: being able to relate to students and knowing the topic taught. Only then will the students receive key infermation about the subject taught in addition to being motivated to learn due to a functional student-teacher relationship.
