I do not completely agree with the statement above. I think it is important to note if there were a teacher here at our school with the best relatability with the students but he/she wasn't confident or any good at his/her subject, then you may as well not have that class altogether. The knowledge of a subject is just as important, if not more important than the social skills and understanding of the student's situation. 
For instance one of our teachers at secondary school. He didn't seem to remember being a pupil himself as he was quite old. When somebody didn't understand something or forgot their homework, there were always strict punishments. Regarding that he was still a great teacher in my eyes, because we learnt so much from him. Coming to college we, my friend and myself, had a distinct advantage over most others from our new class. Of course at the time I might have preferred a more easy-going teacher but in the long run I would always pick a teacher with more knowledge over a teacher who can relate well with students. 
However if the statement wants to express that the teacher has good knowledge and relates well with students instead of picking one over the other, then I think the first attribute could be more important. Many students, especially in maths, I'm sure would be a lot more interested and therefore understand more if only they had a young teacher who knew exactly how he himself was in another subject when he was at that age. Often exactly those people can also explain things better to the students, because they know how they think. For example our chemistry teacher who is a young guy. First of all everybody pays attention to the classes because he makes them interesting and can explain things well but when there is something we don't understand wecan be sureof him delivering either an extra sheet or explaining it again. He just knows how we see things and caneasily make the subject more interesting and clear to us. Nd everztrwtrwrwrwwjhe
