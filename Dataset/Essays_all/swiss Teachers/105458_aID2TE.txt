Both aspects are very important for teaching students. But I tend to agree the statement, because a teacher has simply to teach the subject on specific grade. SO in some situations it's not necessary that a teacher has to know very much about a theme. For exemple mustn't a high-school teacher in biology be able to know all the bones and muscels by heart. So it's not necessary for high-school to have Dr. title. It's much more important that he knows how to explain the subject of the grade of high-school the best way. Otherwise a teacher should be able to answer some questions about the theme. Because at least the sence of school is to get knowledge about something. And it's also very important as a student to ask questions and to think about something. Most of the time a subject in primaryschool can be explained without much backroundknowledge. So the higher the grad the more backroundknowledge a student and especially a teacher needs. Sometimes it can even be diffucult to explain something to someone with less knowledge then you. Especially in maths you tend to solve an exercise on a other way. A way the students wouldn't understand because the don't have the same backroundknowledge then you have. Very often the best way to get something explained, is by a a student on the same grade. So at least both things are very important and it depends a bit of the grade u are. But in my opinion the ability to relate well with student and to make them understand something, is a a bit more important then an excellent knowledge
