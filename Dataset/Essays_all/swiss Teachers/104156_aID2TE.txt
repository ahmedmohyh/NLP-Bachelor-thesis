Today everyone agrees that school is one of the most important things and that it is important to visit it. But allthought school isn't something new and exists for more than 100 years we don't realy know, what the right way for learning is. The way we learn today hasn't improved over many years, beacause even today we don't know what the major parts are, that will make learn us something. So it is also questionable which part the teacher has and how he schould educate his pupills. Is it more important that the teacher is well related with the students or that he has an excellent knowledg about the subject he educates. 
I think that both are important, beacaus without excellent knowledge, how should a theacher even educate somethig to his class if he doesn't know it by him self. But just great knowledge doesn't makes a teacher good, he should also have the ability to relate to his studants. Beacaus it makes it easyer for theme to learn something and taking action during the lessons, if the have a good relation to there teacher.
So in conclusion I thinke a good mixure is the best way for a good teacher to make learning easy and interessting.
