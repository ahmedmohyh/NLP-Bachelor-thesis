The definition of a teacher for me is a person that can teach a subject the easiest and best way. For being able to do that you need a relation with students. It is like asking, is love from both sides important for a relationship rather than knowing what love really is.
A teacher that has a great relation with his stundents can accomplish more than a teacher that has more source of knowledege.
Imagine sitting in a classroom where a teacher just talks about the stuff you need to learn but you do not have any clue of it and also imagine a classroom where a teacher tries to make you fully understand the subject. In which class would you like to be? Well atleast I would like to be in the second one.
In the first classroom your learning would be short-termed f.e. just for the next exam, whereas in the second classroom you would learn the subject completely whilst fully understanding it and you could use this knowledege also after the exam. 
A teacher that tries to bond more with his students will also make them listen better to him because then they will not get bored or get stressed because they do not have a clue about the subject.
