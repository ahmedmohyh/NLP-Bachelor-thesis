If a teacher should be hired for an assignment at a school, the head of school doesn't ask for social recommandations. He/She wants to see a great educational background of his/her future employee to have an optimal level for his/her students. Take any "Gymnasialschule" for example: For getting an offerd job there, you have to have studied the to be taught subject at a university at least. It's not so much about "How well did former students of yours like you or like your way of teaching?".

If a teacher is standing in front of the class and is just doing his/her hours to be done with no faszination then the students will show the exact same amount of interest: Zero. But if the teacher is interested in the subject and in the students and willing to share his/her knowledge with them, then it is easier to integrate even students who, at first, didn't really want to visit this particular class. It would mean that the teacher would probably have to prepare more and be more active during the lesson but it would generate a "win-win-situation": An enthusiatic teacher who can spread the faszination over to his/her students won't have boring lessons, most of the students will be participating and by that write better marks.

Well, in the first place I would have stated a definite "No!". Because if the teacher him-/herself doesn't really know what he/she's talking about there wouldn't be any sense in attending this classes. But now I do have to say that the same goes with a teacher who is not able to actually teach in a didactally good way. So for me the two aspects should be considered as equally important: A teacher should have the knowledge to help even over-the-schoolsubject-interested students out but he/she should also be able to relate to the students on a social basis.
