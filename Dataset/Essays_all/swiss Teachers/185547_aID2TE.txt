In this essay I will be discussing the following question. Is the teacher's ability to relate well with the students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject.The answer to this question depends on the person you ask and their perception of the school's responsability.
I think we all agree that the school's duty is to educate the students. But what exactly is education? Most of us go to school in order to get general knowledge of different subjects resulting in good decisions made in their lives. But which skill is more important to make this possible?
One person might argument that the only way to transfer good knowledge is by knowing everything about it and being able to give you every detailed information. This person might also say that only the teachers with the excellent knowledge are able to make difficult question where you really have to understand the subject before you can answer the question. 
On the other hand someone might say that the only way knowledge is transmitted by the teacher relating to the students which results in a more personal and attached confrontation with the information. Not only that the information is also longer kept in our brain as it is psychologically proofed that not only the infromation but also the attached feeling to the information in the relation to the teacher is saved in our brain.
In my opinion there is no clear answer to this question. I believe that both skills are needed to become a teacher and a very important to get the best knowledge.
