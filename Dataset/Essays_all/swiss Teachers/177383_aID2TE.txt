Nowadays everyone and everybody can look up everything on Google, Bing or Firefox. Searching and finding information is easy. Understanding it isn't. That is the reason why we still go to school, why we still have teachers. We need a expert who can teach us these things in a manner so that we can understand them. 

I think that teachers should teach us more the ways of how to understand a subject or a topic, and less the topic itself. I think we can compare this to the famous saying about fishing: "Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day, teach a man how to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime."
In my opinion, this sums up what I beleive the answer to this problem is: Excellent knowledge of a topic is great, but not necessary. Students would be better off if the teachers were taught more of how to understand our problems and help us resolve them, and also how to help us resolve it ourselves next time.

I believe that a teacher's main quality needs to be his ability to relate with the students and to understand where their problems lie. Otherwise, the students know that there is a highly intelligent and knowledgable person in their classroom, but they can't understand what he/she is trying to explain, nor can he/she realize thus. In the ocntrary situtation, the teacher understands what the student's problem is and can lend a hand to find the soluion. If he/she doesn't understand the solution him/herself, he/she can easily and effortlessly look it up on the internet. The important thing is, that he/she can follow the student's way of thinking and problemsolving. 

Because of what use is a mathematics teacher who understands his subject perfectly, but is unable to understand the students' problems and explain them the subject in a way so they understand it?
