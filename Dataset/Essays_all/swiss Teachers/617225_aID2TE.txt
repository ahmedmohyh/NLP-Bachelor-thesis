A teacher without an excellent knowlege isn't maybe able to prepaire them for university, because he/she don't prepare them with the right knowlege which is needed in the futur.
Teachers should have a good knowledge of the subjet they teache, but I my opinion an excellent knowledge isn't needed. In some cases it's even better, when teachers don't have that large-scale knowledge. For example it's possible that a teacher knows a lot, but he/she is bad in explaining the issue of a subjet. The students don't profite from the excellent knowledge of the teacher. Furthermore teachers who aren't respected in class they don't have a chance to bring up the issues to the students, because the students don't pay any attention. Excellent knowlege isn't even needed to teach students well. Sometimes it is easier for them, if the teacher uses simple vocabulary and examples and this is often the case, when a teacher could think in the way the students do as well. In addition students prefer going to school, when they like their teacher and know the todays lesson will be interessting. It is really important to motivate them. Motivated students learn much easier and better, than the ones who are sitting in class, looking out of the window, because their teacher's lessons are really complicated and at some point they couldn't follow them anymore. 

To sum it up I totally agree with the statement. A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than having an excellent knowlege. I already mentioned that it is really important to motivate students. The range of advantages of a teacher with a good ability to relate with students is bigger. Excellent knowlege isn't everything, also later in business.
