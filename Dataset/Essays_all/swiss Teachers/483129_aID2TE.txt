Exellent knowledge of the subject odr relate well with students?

Do you know the feeling that you don't like to go to class because you don't like the teacher? But you have to go. You do't like the teacher because it isvery taught. Is the ability to relate with students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subjekt being taught?

One reason for the statement is the if a techer has a good relationship with the students they have al lot of fun and the students like to go in their class. And if they like to go to the class they learn more than if they stay home.

A second reason for the argument is that if a teacher has a good relationship with the students they do more that what the teacher want because they like them. Thats the same with a schoolfriend if you like this camarad you do a lot more for him as for a camarad you don't like.


But it can also be that you have a good relationship with your teacher and for this reason you think that can have less respect.
Because you know that this teacher is sympatic and don't want to give you a extra- doing.

Another thing that is disagree with the statement is that if the teacher isn't taugh you learn less than if he is.  

My opinion is that a good realtionship with the students is better that to be able to be taugh. Because I'm a better student if I like the teacher and I'm more nicer to the teacher. I like it more to go to class and I do always my homework.
