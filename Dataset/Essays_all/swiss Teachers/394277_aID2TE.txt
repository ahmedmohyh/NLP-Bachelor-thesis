What is more important to have a teacher with an incredible knowledge on his subject or a teacher that can relate well with his students? Obviously, there are argument for and against both cases. A few of these arguments I am going to discuss in this essay.

Firstly, I would like to talk about the case of a teacher with incredible knowledge. Let us take, for instance, a mathematics teacher. We will assume that this teacher has an unbelievable knowledge in mathematics. Knowing everything from integrals to simple counting. Yet the question is: Is he able to explain the students the subjects in a way they understand it without being able to relate with his students? For the students it is absolutely useless to have a teacher who knows everything but cannot bring across the matter. On the other hand, a teacher with a huge knowledge might be rather interessting for very good students since this might be more challenging aswell as motivating.

In the second part I would like to discuss the importance of a teacher with great relationships with his students. Here, it is important to bring up the fact that a teacher like this is more likely to be able to bring across his subject, rather than a teacher who cannot relate to his students. However, it is clear that without the knowledge it might be less challenging for extremely good and interested students. Furthermore, a teacher being able to relate with his students is clearly able to motivate his students more, a crucial factor in teaching.

Taking everything into consideration, a combination of both factors is probably ideal. However, in my opinion, having a teacher who can relate to his students is a whole lot better, since it makes school so much more interesting and it is also easier for the students to understand a hard math problem if they get along well with their teacher.
