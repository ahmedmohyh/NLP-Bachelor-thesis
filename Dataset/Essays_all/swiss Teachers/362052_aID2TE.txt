A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

A teacher's knowlege of the subject being taught is really important. The students wouldn't learn anything when the teacher wouldn't have a good knowledge.
And a teacher also have to have the ability to explain the school stuff, the students have to understand what he teaches them and what he wants to learn them. For students it is really important, that their teachers can explain them the school stuff well, that they get it , so they begin to find it interesting. So they want to go on and learn more. Otherwise they get frustrated because they don't unterstand anything so tehy don't want to go on in their school carrier. They lose their moti
A teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject is one thing, but when you want to be a teacher, you must have the ability to relate well, because otherwise you couldn't become a teacher. Then you should go into the research. 
For children or students in generally, it is very important, that their teachers can explain them the school stuff well,that they get it and that they begin to find it interesting. So they want to go on and learn more.
Otherwie they get frustrated because they don't understand anything so they don't want to go to school anymore. They don't have any motivation.
A teacher have to be patient with the students, he have to listen them. He have to be there for them. Many students or children don't have it good at home or they have other problems in their private life. So they are very pleased when there is someone who listens them and who tries to help them.  

Personally, I think that every teacher has to have a good mix. At one side he must have the excellent knowledge of the subject and he must have the abilty to explain the students the stuff well. But at the other side he must be there for them and give the students comfortable feeling.
