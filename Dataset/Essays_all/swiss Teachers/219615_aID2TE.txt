I totally agree with the statement: A teacher's ability to relate well with his students is mroe important than excellent knowledge of th subject being taught.

First, it is well known that students who like their teacher learn better. 
Who likes a teacher who is speaking in front of you and doesn't even tries to know how his students feel about what he is saying? The answer is easy: Nobody. We all want to have a teacher who explains what we don^t know and if somebody has a problem to understand something, the teacher repeats and explains clearly what he said. 

In addition, an excellent knowledge of the subject can't jump from the teachers brain into the brain of a student. For students its better to have a teacher who knows how to teach his students. They have to love what they learn because if a student loves a subject and the way the teacher creates his lessons, the student is more interested in learning.

On the other hand, a teacher who has an excellent knowledge can help his students to be more than good. He ignores the worse students and continues teaching excellent stuff to the better ones.

Second, if a teacher has a very good relation with his students but teaches them wrong facts, this can be worse. In a higher level in school maybe the students have a big disadvantage. 

To resume, it is more important to have a teacher who relates well with his students because they pay more attention and maybe even begin to love the subject. Only for the bright ones, it could be a little bit boring during the lesson if a "Dummie" asks stupid things and gets the full attention of the teacher.
