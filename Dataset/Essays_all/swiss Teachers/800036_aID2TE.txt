Teachers play an important role in todays society, they help a child mature. Some people say that a teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. This essay will show why this is partially true.

If a teacher can't relate to his students, he won't be taken seriously by the class. This can lead to an athmosphere in class without any respect from anyone. The teacher and the students will have no motivation to study for this subject and fool around in class.

However, a teacher that doesnt have excellent knowledge in his subject may face the same problems. The class may think that a teacher isnt qualified to be a teacher if that person can't answer the questions that are asked by students. This can lead to a loss of respect, which leads as mentioned above to no motivation on the subject and fooling around.

To conclude, both the teacher's ability to relate well with his student and an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is important. In primary school the relateablity of a teacher is more important than knowledge as younger children don't ask as difficult questions as the older ones. After primary school knowledge gains a lot of importance and finally is the more deciding factor of the two.
