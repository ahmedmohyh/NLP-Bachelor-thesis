Generally speaking, it is very important for the teacher to be able to communicate well with his students. In order for the Students to be able to learn propperly, they have to be able to talk to and get understood by the teacher. If the communication between students and teachers fails, both parties are not going to be able to work efficiently together. If a Student doesn't get along with his Teacher, he will respond negatively to the inputs he gets from that teacher, just because he doesn't like him on a personal level. Also, the teacher may tend to not be as friendly and focused, if he has a personal problem with his students. On the other hand, it's absolutely necessairy for the teacher to know his subject. If a teacher is very nice to his students, but he fails to transmit any kind of knowledge to them, the students won't learn anything which results in them liking the teacher, but not gaining anything from his lessons. Additionally it can happen that the students start to lose the respect for their teacher, because he gets on a friendly basis with them, on which they don't take him as a person of respect anymore. If this happens to a teacher with a class, that has this kind of caracter, the teacher has lost. He will not be able to get back his authority in that class. Ultimately, he won't be able to teach anything, even if he would have the knowledge to do so. In conclusion, the teacher has to have a good balance between his knowledge of the subject and his treatment of the students. If he knows his subject well and is able to connect with the class while keeping his position as a teacher and not losing it and thus the respect of the class, the teacher will almost automatically be able to interact and communicate with the students the way he's meant to. He has to be a person that is seen as an authority by the students without them being frightened by him.
