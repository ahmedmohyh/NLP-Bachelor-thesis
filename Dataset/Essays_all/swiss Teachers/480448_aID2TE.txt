"It does not matter how intelligent or how much knowledge a teacher has if i do not like him. I wont listen to him anyway." This sentence is a sentence you hear a lot from students but is the teachers ability to relat well with students more important than his knowledge in the subject? In this essay i will try to find an answer to this question.

Of couse it is helpfully to teach something effectifly when the students like you. Because if the relationsship between the teacher and the students is good, the student may participate more activly and ask more questions. But if the teacher is not able to answer the questions correctly it does not matter how many questions the students ask. So the teachers understanding and knowledge is also important.
There are also teachers who know everything about a subject who are not able to teach these things because they do not care about the students or they can not see a problem of a student because for them the things are so easy. For example our math teacher knows everything about math but the students do not listen to him during the lessons because they can not follow his thoughts. 

So in conclusion in my opinion the teachers ability to relate well with stundents is as important as his knowledge of the subject. So a perfect teacher should try to help and motivate the students but he has also to understand what he is talking about.
