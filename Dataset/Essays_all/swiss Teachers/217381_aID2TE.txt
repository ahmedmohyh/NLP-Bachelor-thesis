These days, a lot of students complain about their teacher's ability to teach a subject. Even parents want the schools to focus more on employing teachers with high social skills instead of professors with an excellent knowledge. Is the teacher-student relation really more important than a good education based on knowledge?

In Switzerland we have a great amount of well educated teachers who studied a specific career and are therefore pleased to hand their knowledge on to the next generation. The students can profit from their lessons by having a look on complex subjects and are surrounded by experts who are able to explain them every detail.

On the other side, a lot of students prefer teachers who do not talk to them as experts, but try to explain them the subject from an equal level. That way the students feel taken more serious and process the learned subjects in a complete different way.

As a student who had already a lot of differnet teachers, I agree with the statement. For me, it is easier to learn something from a teachers I can realate with but I think a specified knowledge is important as well.
