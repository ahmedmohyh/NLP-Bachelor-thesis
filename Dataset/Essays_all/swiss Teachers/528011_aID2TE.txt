What kind of teacher is better? A teacher who has an excellent knowledge about the taught subject but no good relationship with his students or a teacher who is loved by all student but he does not know much about the taught subject.
Of course a teacher has to know a lot about the subject being taught but if the teaches has not a good relationship with his students, they are not that interested in the subject and they do not want to listen to the teacher. If the teachers relationship with the student is good but they do not learn anything noone can profit. As you can see this two examples are bad for both, the students and the teacher. It is important to have a mixture. On one hand a good teacher should be friendly and should have a good relationship with all of his students but on the other hand he should be strict sometimes. And of course he should know something about the taught subject.
In my opinion a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important because if the relationship between the students and the teacher is not good, the students are not willing to listen to the teacher and so they will not learn much. Of course a teacher shold always know a lot about the taught subject but I think that this is less important than the ability to relate well with the students.
