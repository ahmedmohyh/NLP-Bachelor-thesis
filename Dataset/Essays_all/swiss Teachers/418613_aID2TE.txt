In this essay I will write about this statement if i agree or not.To find that out I will write about negatives and positives arguments. Whit my school experiance i will argue


A positive argument is that students are more motivated going to school. It's important that a student feel comfortable and that he likes going to school. To have a good realationship with a teacher can help to be more interested in the subject and second to average our knowledge.

A Second point could be when a teacher tries to explaine something.Students listen better to them and understand more.


However, there are negatives arguments aswell. A student could influence a teacher opinion with their marks. When a teacher really get well with a student it could be that he receives better marks than the opposite. That's unfair. 

I could be that the teacher teaches less important topics. If he relates good with students he talks maybe about lot of others thing and not about schoolstuff. That would be pitty beacause we are going to school to study.


I think there are negative and postives argument but I think to have a good relationship with the teacher is important because I'm more motivated and interested for the subject.I really like going to school because the teacher's are really kind and sometimes funny.I learn better when I know that a teacher likes me because it's easyer and I'm more motivated.
