It is important that Teacher and students can work together for learning as much as possible. But have the teacher to have some knowlegde or can he also just be a good intertainer and fried of student?

It is really important, that a teacher can work with the students! If the cannot realte well with them, the don't like to work with this teacher or don't even want to go to his class. If they don't like to go to his class the also don't want to learn something from this teacher and just sit there like a bag of potato. This also makes the teacher agry and sad because he wanted to teach sudents and not bags of potatos.
So to teaching something to the students, the teacher should have a good realation to them. So they like to go to the class and like listen to him.
But if he just tell the student bullshit and don't know anything about the themes, well thats also a bad thing. The students should learn something in school and this is only possible if the teacher have some knowledge to teach! 

In conclusion the teacher should be able to relate with students, otherwise they don't even listen to him. Furthermore they need some knowledge to give to the student, otherwise they don't learn something in school even though this is the sens of school. So i have to say no. No, it is not more important that a teacher is able to relate well with students, than have a good knowledge. It is both important for a good teacher.
