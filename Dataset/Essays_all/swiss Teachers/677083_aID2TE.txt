I agree with the statement in some ways because if the teacher is really good in his subject, but he can`t give the students the information or the stuff, they don`t profite. The other way is that the teacher is like a friend so the students they might have no respect and again the profit isn`t really good. 
In my opinion, the mix is important. The teacher has to be good in teaching his subject and has to understand what the students should understand, but there has to be also a good relationship between the students and the teacher.
For example, at my school it`s really important that the students understand the stuff because thats matura stuff. It`s quite unimportant how sympatic your teacher is. The fact is, that the teacher has to taught the subject in a way, that the students understand it and that they can take their learnings to the exam. 
I can imagine, that in other schools (like secondary schools) the relationship is more important than the learning goals and the exams. At the end of their schooltime it`s just the average of all the subjects who counts and if there is one subject who is really bad or the mark is good but your knowledge about the subject is really bad it doesn`t matter. That`s the fact which really disapoint me, because I really think, that school is there for learning the subjects and not just for having a good time with your teachers.
