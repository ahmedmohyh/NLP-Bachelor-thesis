In our community, it is more likely, that people listen to people they like and not to people they don't like, whether they have an excellent knowledge or not. Maybe this is a fact, because we don't spend much time with people we don't like so we don't have to be interested in what they say. Everything gets a lot more interesting when it is said by someone we like. This can be adjusted on teachers. When a teacher we like says something, it is by far more interesting as the same words coming from a teacher we don't like.

Students, especially at our age, should be able to interact with people, they don't really like. Our teachers are here to teach us things and not to be our friends. A good teacher knows a lot about his subject and what he/she wants to get in the students heads. He/she did his studies in a specific subject and not in something called "How to make friends with students". For sure, the best teachers combine both, a good relation and an excellent knowledge. Recording to my experience, students don't learn much from teachers they don't like. They hate going to their lessons and they don't really pay attention on what the teacher sais. If the students don't like their teacher, they begin to hate the subject and they don't rate a mark in that subject as high as they should and as high as other subjects. A teacher whose realtion to his students is good, even if he/she doesn't have an excellent knowledge, makes the students like the subject and they are more likely to do their homework and pay attention when they're in class.

A teacher can compensate a lack of knowledge with a good relation to his/her student. It is more comfortable for students to listen to someone they like and they learn and contribute more. And over all, knowledge isn't everything. Especially in our century, everything can be found on the internet.
