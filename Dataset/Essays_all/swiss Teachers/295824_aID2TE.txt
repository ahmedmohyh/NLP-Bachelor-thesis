I agree with the statement because of the following reason: A techer isn't a good teacher if he can not teach the right way and for that he needs to relate well with the student.

 There are many people on the world who have the knowlegde that a teacher has but there are only a few who teach it. If a teacher does not know how to relate with a student his knowledge is a waste because the student won't understand. For example I have a chemistry teacher, whose sweet, caring and tries her best to make us understand but she teaches us like we are university students, which we are obviously not (we are highschoolers). So no matter how hard she tries or no matter how hard we try to cope with her we are not able to.In the end her knowlrdge doesn't help us because we don't understand what she is trying to teach us.

On the other hand there are people who think the the more knowlegde someone has the better he is at teaching because he or she will be able to find new ways to teach something easier which can be partly true. But it mainly depends on the topic. If you are teaching a language, the aren't many ways of teaching grammer. the same goes for biologie,maths, partly bioligie too. But if one is teaching physics or chemistry there are many ways to teach that (with short clips, experiments, tables etc.)

In my oppinion, i still think the a teacher who can relate well with his students is more important than the one who knows his subject perfectly because if I for eexample don't understant what my chemistry teacher wants to teach m
