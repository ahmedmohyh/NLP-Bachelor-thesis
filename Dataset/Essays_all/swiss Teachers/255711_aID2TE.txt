My oppinion in this case is that the relationship between teachers and students is really important, maybe more than the most people think. So I agree this statement. The knowledge of a techer is also important, but there are all the teachers who were good at university and had good grades and they are really bad in their social life.
it's a difficult statement because i think a techer has to be a mixture of both.
If a teacher helps the students in a other way than in knowledge of a their schoolsuject, it's maybe better and more important in their life after school.
we find some examples for both, but I support more the side with the ability to relate with students, it's really nice for young people to learn some other things than only the schoolsubject.
The teacher who is maybe not his best in the subject he teachs, maxbe has a really good inteligence based on social life.
If I will go to university and learn much about some subjects, my social life will maybe fall because i haven't the time to meet some friends and pracitce a sport. On the other side my knowledge will be much better and I will hopefully earn more money. But for me is the aspect with friend and my sport the most important one. I can't survive without doing sports and meeting some friends.
Maybe you have a financel better life if you have a job you earn much money but your life outside of your job is really bad you can't life happy.
Finally everybody has to choose for himself what he thinks it's best but for me it's no choice to let my sport and friends go because of my job.
Many good mathematic masters have a knowledge like no other in this world, but mostly they are a bit outside of a civilisation. They haven't enough time to plan their life outside their big love, the mathematic.
You have to know what you do and like it in this way.
