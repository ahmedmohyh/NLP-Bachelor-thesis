The way teachers organize and teach their classes has changed throughout the years. Nowadays the teachers can't just have the knowledge, they also have to educate the children in another matters such as social life and general knowledge. But where are advantages there are also diadvantages. It became more important to teach children morals and other values. And because parents don't always take matters in hand and are somewhat careless with morals and social standards, it has been decided that it also should be the teacher's responsibility. 

The change of responsibilties has helped some students as has been shown. Because of the more personal interaction between student and teachers the teachers became people of trust. It results in students talking to their teachers when they have problems, for example at home, and they receive help.

But there are people who think that because of the personal relationship students have with their teachers they lose their respect for them. Which results in not paying attention in class and not doing your homework because your teacher is your friend.

Whereas different studies have shown that the change in teaching method has helped students who had difficulty with studying the traditional way. The classes which are now held more open helps the students who learn better in a different way.

In conclusion it's obvious for me that there are more advantages than disadvantages. If you have a good relationship with your teacher the chances are higher that you listen and actually want to learn something even if his knowledge is not as good as someone else'sknowledge. Also it is always good to have a personyou can trust and some children can't find that at home.
