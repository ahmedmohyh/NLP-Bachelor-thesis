Teachers need to have a good education and psychological understanding. But which aspect seems to be more important than the other? 

If you want to become a teacher you have to learn quite a lot things first. You go to school for a long time and than you decide in which direction you would like to educate. Afterwards you are very well educated and you know that education is something really important. But if you are in front of a class talking about any issue, you need to have a good relationship with your students as well. But that is not as easy es it seems to be. Maybe you even have to be more strict to push the students or you have to be less strict because otherwise the students start to be mean to you. And always next to these educating methods stands the education plan which you have to complete. 

In my opinien teachers need the ability to relate well with students as much as they need a good knowledge. But perhaps if they are too well educated they cannot imagine how the students feel when they do not understand the topic. So they get stressed because they know that they cannot explain it. Mostly that is bad for the students because they are afraid of the teacher and cannot concentrate anymore.So maybe this aspect shows that teachers need a good education in psychologie. If they are nice to their students and they get along with them, the students will automatically improve more. That is how educating gets authentic.
