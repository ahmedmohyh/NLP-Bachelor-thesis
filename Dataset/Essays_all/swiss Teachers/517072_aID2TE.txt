I wouldn't say that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Of course it is important to have something like a relationship with your teacher in terms of understanding each other and being fair but the knowledge has its importance too. As a student you sit there and listen to your teacher. Some things you hear from them for the first time and you want to be sure that what they are talking about is true. I think its also important because afterwards for example at an exam you want to make sure you understood everything what the teacher said and also that everything is right what he said, because in the end you're the one who has to deal with the consequences.
So the knowlege is something very important .
But of course the relationship between a teacher and a student has its importance too. You can't love every teacher they're also just normal people but isn't it nice to relate with one of them and to feel a certain bound inbetween. When you know that they understand you and know how you feel. I think that makes everything easier and more comfortable.
