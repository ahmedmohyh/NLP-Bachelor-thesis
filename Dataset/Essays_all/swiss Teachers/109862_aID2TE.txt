Everyone is going to school at least once in a lifetime. For some, their schooltime is the worst, and some might really enjoy school. One thing that makes school and learning so controvesal are the teachers. A good teacher will definitely make school more likable, whereas a bad teacher makes school boring and unenjoyable. But is it more important for a teacher to be able to releate to his pupils or to know his subject by heart and teach it on a non-personal base?

On one hand, a teacher who is one with his subject is able to explain every little detail. If the students are into one particular subject, a teacher who knows it all can be an inspiration and can have a big influence on them. But this is only possible if you like the subject as a sudent. 

On the other hand, a teacher who has nothing else in mind except their own subject can be really nerve-wrecking. These teachers are in their own little world and they just can't understand it when someone isn't into the class they're teaching.They tend to explain things in a way not every student can undestand because they teach in a very scientific way. So for a student who might not really be into this one particular subject it's way more important that a teacher can relate to them and sometimes explain things in way that everyone in class can follow, even the ones that may not like this subject.

So even if sometimes a teacher who knows nothing except their own subject can inspire you, I think overall a teacher who can relate to their pupils is way more importanat. Especially in college, where you attend a lot of different classes, it's important that you can keep track in every subject, even if you might like one more than an other one.
