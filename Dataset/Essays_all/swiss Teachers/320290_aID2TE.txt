There are rumoures saying that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knownledge of the subject being taught. With this essay I'm showing if this is really true or if the knowledge of the teacher is more important.
Before i start i want to give my own personal experieces to this topic. Personally i think that both are very important for the improvement for the students. When i'm in class with a teacher having good realtionship with, I'm learning better than with a teacher that i don't like to be teached from.

Many students and even myself claim that a good relationship with the teacher is more important because when you are going into classes with a teacher who has a good sense of humour, you automatically learn more efficiently. This is what a student wants. He wants to have fun.
Good connection with the teacher brings you also possibilities to be teached even after the school. Learnig with a guy like him makes learing even more fun.
 
On the other hand many parents claim, that if you have fun in classes you cannot possibly learn more efficiently because you are not concentrated what the teacher says. A good relationship with the teacher brings the students more confidenccy and as a result they talk with other students knowning the teacher won't do anything bad to them.

They also claim that if the teacher is lacking on knownledge, their child wouldn't get the knownledge they paid for the school and failing a test makes the hole story even  worse.

In summary i can say as a student, that a good realtionship with the teacher is more important than the knownledge being taught. If you really are interested in the topic and if the teacher gives you the knownledge you need you will have no problems in the tests. There is no teacher whos knownledge is to bad for teaching. Otherwise he wouldn't become a teacher right?
