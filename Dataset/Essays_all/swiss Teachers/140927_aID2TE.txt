At first I have to clarify that this statemant shows an extreamly biased opinion. it is important to point out that teacher must have knowledge about their subjects and about their students.
I think it is a realy important ability of a teacher is that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching. In my opinion thats maybe the most important ability to work as a teacher bacause if you have no knowledge about the subject you want to teach you are not able to teach that. For example if students know the stuff the teacher is teaching etter than him they do ot learn anything. Students are in the school to learn something and they realy get dismotivatet and they would loose a good relation with the teacher. 
On the other hand it is important to have a good relation to the students because they won't listen if he could not relate with them. And if studends do not listen to the teacher they do not learn somethhing either. It is also important to see that a good relation between teacher and student motivates both sides to be more motivated and as a reason for that both sides make their work more effective. 
As conclusion I would say that teacher must e able to teach the students new knowledge but they also need to be able to relate with the students so they culd get their attention. In my oppinion it is probably easyer to teach with much knowledge and less relation to the students than with a great relation an no knowledge. I would even say that this relation would get lost if the students coul'd not learn anything from the teacher.
