This essay is about the question: "Is a teacher's ability to relate well with the students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". At first, it's quite important to relate with the students because of the harmonie and the athmosphere in the classrome. In example, for a student like me it's easyer to learn when I'm going well with my teacher. I hate it when I'm not confident with him, because then I'm to shy to aks questions or take part in the lesson. I don't like to work with pressure. My second Argument is, when a teacher relate with the students, every one is intressted in de lesson. When students are not going on with a teacher, they`re don't like to come to the lesson. On the other side it's also importent that a teacher knows what he teach. Students which are talentet in a subject, always asks difficult questions. A teacher should be able to answer those, also if there a little bit complex. An other fact is, no one can take a teacher serious if he isn't exellent knowlege about his subject. For example in my geografy teacher lesson always are based about some papers of the internet. We can tip the title of the paper in google and the first link we will find is the solution of our paper. When we ask him the same questions two times, in the seconde time it's an other answer as in the first. The you don't know whats correct now. So on my opinion, the arguments for the teacher, who relate with the students, are more important. Because I think when some one study a subject he know a lot of the subject and thats enough for students like us. But it's clear that a mixture of both types is the best solutions .
