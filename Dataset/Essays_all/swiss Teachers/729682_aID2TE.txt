A teachers ability  to relate with students is more important that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

I think that to be a teacher you have to be able to relate to sudents but also needs to have an excellent knowledge of the topic this teacher teaches in the following text I will explain why. On one hand teacher needs to be able to relate his student because if he doesn't his lessons would be monotone which then causes the pupil to dislike the topic that teacher teaches to him. But on the other hand if the teacher doesn't have a broad knowledge of his topic he can't make a lesson worth to participate because the teacher would have to look up some of the questions the students ask and if he didn't tell it how it is he wold have to correct himself causing the lessons to be confusing and thus not productive. I disagree with the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" because if the teacher has no knowledge his subject or he can't relate with his students the lessons woul become boring and not worth participating.
