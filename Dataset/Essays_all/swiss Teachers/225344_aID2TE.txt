Imagine you are a student. You have to sit in class the whole day and listen to whatever the teacher says. You are feeling that your teacher knows what he says and you try to keep as much information as you can. But what you also realise is: If a student has a problem, the teacher is often unable to help him or he is impatient and wants to move on with the lesson. He also doesn't like the students very much. The lesson is over, you walk to the next classroom and the new teacher enters the room. Everybody gets to know him very quickly. He feels more like a friend and not like a teacher. He also finds it very important that everyone can follow the lessons.But as the lesson continues you realise that he seems to be a very nice person, but has not got a clue what he is telling. The information that he gives is completly wrong.

I think these two examples demonstrated very well that the most important ability of a teacher is to teach things to his students. It is not terrible if he (or her) and the students don't get along. The quality of his lessons will stay the same and the marks of the students will most of the time be rather good. In contrary, a teacher without very much knowledge is liked by the class, but the marks are horrible and some of the students drop out of the school because of him.

But what if a student can't follow the lessons of the first type of teacher. He will have bad marks even though the lesson have a high quality. That is the reason why a teacher has to bee able to help a student and be ready to to talk to them. If he knows not very much it is often enough to get the students through the tests with average marks. He generates way funnier lessons and tries to get the students to learn something while having fun.

In conclusion I think it is very important to have a teacher that has good knowledge but is also able to relate well with his students. But if I would have to decide which aspect I find more important, I would say the knowledge.
