In this essay I will write about whether or not it is more important for a teacher to relate well to his or her students or to have excellent knowledge in the subject being taught.

If you consider a teacher to be very intelligent and an expert in his or her subject this does not give you the perfect preconditions for a teacher who is able to pass down his or her knowledge. Of course it is of great importance to understand the subject one is teaching but usually this precondition is to be expected when someone has finished a degree. In my opinion it is not the neccessity of a school to test whether or not a teacher understands the subject he teaches but rather if a teacher can get along with people. If a genius cannot pass down his or her knowledge to other people due to the lack of social skills this does not lead to the desired outcome.

On the other hand it is obvious that someone who lacks of knowledge but establishes a great relationship with his or her students does not lead to a perfect teacher either. A stable realtionship where both parties feel accepted and respected is not to be neglected in any case, but the lacking knowledge of a teacher would soon lead to the dissatisfaction of the students. 

Due to the listed reasons above I can state that the teachers ability to establish a stable relationship with his students is just as important as the excellent knowledge in the subject he or she needs to pass on. Both factors, knowledge and social skills need to be given in order to have a useful teacher who reaches the desired outcome for both parties.
