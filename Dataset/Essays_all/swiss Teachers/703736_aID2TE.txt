I absolutely agree. If you want to teach something to other people, it's very important to understand how to relate well with students. Even the most knowledge owning mathematics won't be able to teach anything to anyone if they don't know how to relate with students. If teachers don't have this ability, no one will be interested in the lessons, that means nobody will listen and learn something. How much the students benefits from the lesson only depends on the teachers teaching skills. The teachers usually got their fixed plan about what they have to teach and when they have to. I guess what they have to teach is usually about main knowledge for the teachers, so having a good knowledge of the subject shouldn't be a real problem for them anyway. The only thing that matters is how they're teaching it to the class because that's also the only thing teachers can do different from other teachers. It is less useful if a really intelligent teacher explains a theme in a very complex way that literally no one understands it than if a less intelligent teacher explains something in a less complex way that everyone gets it. At the end teachers just have to know how to bring the stuff they have to teach in the students brains.

I want to go forward but time's at 15 minutes now...

I'm really bored
