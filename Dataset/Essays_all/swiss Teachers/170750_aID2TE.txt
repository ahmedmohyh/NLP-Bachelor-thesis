I do not fully agree with the given statement since I think it is important that every teacher can relate with his student but they also should have a certain knowledge of the subject they teach. Not only the love to their subect it important in my eyes but a teacher should also like to give their knowledge to others. If the do not have this wish it would make them a kinda less good teacher.

As we know every teacher once was taught by a teacher on their own. They have the experience how it is to be taught by their own teachers but also learnt throughout the years how it feels like to teach others in the same way they were once taught. Their experience is the key to the answer. Therefore the ideal of a teacher's ability would be when a teacher has both, the idea how one can relate with the students and the idea how to teach them so they will eventually start to like the subject.

On the other hand it's not that easy to provide the ideals I described earlier. They're ideals because teacher are also all human beings. Sometimes they don't have a good day, have problems with the school or in the worst case they have students they do not like. Despite of not having a good day or not feeling well teachers always should give their best when it comes to teaching others. They also need a certain motivation and one of these so called motivations is obviously that they want to see results. It makes one happy when they see that the hard work, here the teaching, brought up some great results. It lights up the glimmering fire in their eyes. 

In conclusion it's like I admitted earlier not easy to provide these ideals but everyone should give their best. Students and they go hand in hand because they cannot without each other
