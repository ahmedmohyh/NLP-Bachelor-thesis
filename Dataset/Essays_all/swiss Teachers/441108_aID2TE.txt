A teacher has to have many abilities. On one hand he has to have an excellent knowledge and on the other hand he has to be able to refer woth the students and to build up a relationship.

For me the teacher's ability to relate with his students is very important during primary school. There, the students only learn the foundation of knowledge. The part which is more important concerns the social life. The students learn how to make contacts, how to function in a group, how to handle with a person of respect like the teacher and so on. So in this time, and even further on to the secondary school, it's essential for the students to have a teacher they can refer to. It should even be possible that the students can take their teacher as their idol.

Later when the students go to the gymnasium, all the subjects become more difficult. So the teacher has to have a good knowledge of his subject so he can really go in depth with his students. For gymnasium teachers it's also very important that they can explain the content of their subject to their students. In my opinion it's also easier to understand a teacher if I can relate with him. Like this I understand more his personality and how he, for example in maths, searches for a solution to a problem. 

In the university it's even more on the side of the knowledge. But there I think it's okay if a professor doesn't really relate with his students, because there are so many of them so it's impossible to handle with all of them.

Concluding I can say that it depends on the students's level if it's more important that the teacher can relate or if he has an excellent knowledge, but I think that every teacher should have in minimum one of both. And I think that this is not very often the case.
