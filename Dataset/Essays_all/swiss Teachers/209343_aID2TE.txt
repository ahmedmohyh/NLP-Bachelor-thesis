A teachers job is clear. He or she hast too teach. But there is disscussion about what kind of traits a teacher needs? Of course the teacher needs a large amount of knowlege about the subject that he or she teaches. But he also needs somekind of connection with the stundents to get his knowledge accross more effectively. This raises the question: What is more important his knowledge or his ability to connect with the tudents hes teaching?
For one its important to be able to relate with his students because it leads to a better learning environement. The atmospere in the classroom is a lot nicer and learning becomes more enjoyable. What ends up happening a lot with unpleasant and closeminded teachers is that the class starts comlaining r instead of concentrating on the subject. 
Also, teachers who are more relatable are able to get points across better because students are more willing to listen to somebody they can relate with. It is also a factor in the desicion to ask a subject related question or not. Students might be intiminated to ask question when their counterpart is someone they cant relate too. I feel like all of these are valid reasons to assume that teachers with whom you relate with better are better teachers. Of course they cant be clueless about the subject but still the assumption that teachers who connect better with their students seems correct in theory. 
But reality is a lot different and there is no better example for this than my  former music teacher. He was not relatable at all. He would come off as arrogant and nasty and most students disliked him quite a lot. But still, the class was productive, worked hard and learned a lot in one year. It was still unpleasant and there was a lot of complaining. But what counts for a teacher are results. And in that regard he did a tremendous job. 
Thats why I believe that having a large amount of expertise is more important than beeing able to relate to your students.
