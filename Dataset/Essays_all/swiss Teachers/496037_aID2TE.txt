It is important that the teacher and the students have a good relationship, because if they haven't you can see and feel it in the classroom. Most of the students wouldn't listen and work as well as they would do if they like the teacher. It is even hard to like the subject when you don't relate well with your teacher.  The concequence is that the cuality and the learning process is lower.  On the other hand it is really important that you suceed an excellent knowledge. If the teacher only makes jokes and you are not learning the stuff you would probably like him. But t would be todally useless and at the end you would not acheve an excellent knowledge of the subject.It is the sense of shool to learn a lot about diffrent subjects and if the cuality isn't high your howl education is on a lower standart. Personnally i think you need to have a good atmosphere in class to learn. If i don't like the teacher i give not as much interests and energy in the subject as i could. But the cualtity of knowledge is more important and usefull for your live. If you don't learn a lot in a subject you have wasted youre time.
