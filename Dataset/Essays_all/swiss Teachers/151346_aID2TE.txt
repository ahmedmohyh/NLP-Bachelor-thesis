"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." I am going to write about the abilities a good teacher has. Sympathy, the knowledge of teaching or the knowledge of the subject, which is the most important ability a teacher should have? It is more than just the knowledge of the subject. 

First, it does not matter which subject is taught, if you don't like the teacher who is teaching it, you probably won't like the subjet too. Therefore, to be a good teacher the students have to like you. Actually, a teacher should be sympathic and comprehensive. A bit of humour is not bad as well. So all in all, the impression a teacher makes on the students and whether they can relate together, are important abilities of a teacher.

Secondly, the knowledge of teaching is important too. For example if your teacher of physics knows his subject very well however he cannot explain it in a way the students will get it, the students won't like this subject. There is a difference between someone who just has studied physics and someone who teaches physics too. The second one learned how to explain the subject and how to make a subject interesting.

On the other hand, it is important that a teacher has a good knowledge about his subject. For example a few years ago we had a teacher who was really nice and we had a good realtion to her, however she could not explain the subject and made many errors. 

To conclude, I believe it is the mixture of the abilities which makes a good teacher. It is important to have a good knowledge of the subject, however the knowledge has not to be excellent. Students rather like a subject if the teacher is nice and has less knowledge of the subject whether if he has an excellent knowledge of the subject but is not comprehensive and sympathic at all.
