We got a teacher in our school, in his lessons my friends and I do not get anything. He is a nice guy, but he cannot teach us. I think for a good relationship with the teacher, the first meeting is important. It is important how he stands there, whats he is wearing and if he is self-confident. If he is, student have interessts build up a relationship with the teacher. And if you have a good relationship you may are willing to learn more. If you like the teacher, and the teachers lesson, your motivation for a good grade is bigger. But in our situation, the teacher is nice, but he cannot teach us, if he starts talking we do not get, what it is all about. So I do not think a good relationship is more important than excellent knowledge. The teachers knowledge may be gigantic, but it is not necessary for us if he cannot explane it. The problem in teachers mind is, that they know everything in their subject. And often they forgot that wo do not have a huge understanding in his subject. So he starts in the middle of the subject, but we do not get the start. Often, when a teacher knows excellent about his subject, he things, his subject is the only one we got. But it is not. So a good relationship is important, but a good knowledge too. 
I do not think, that a relationship is importanter than the suff they teach, is just important if they can explane to us, what we do not get.
