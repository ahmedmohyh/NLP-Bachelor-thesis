If a teacher relates well with the students, it's more likely to learn things as a student, it isn't always very strikt but you learn less.
It's more likely to learn things as a student when you have a good relation to your teacher, becausezhen the teacher is more interestet that you learn something. It's more personal and the teacher can better help you when you have a problem and he can understand better what your problem is.
It isn't always very strikt during the lesson because sometimes the teacher can take a choke and doesn't is that serious all the time. It shows that the teacher isn't allknowing and is even just a person who can make mistakes.
It can be that you learn less when the teacher hasn't an excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught, because he hasn't that knowledge. But on the other side he can better explain something to you because he knows how you are thinking. It also takes more time because sometimes during the lesson you talk about other things that the teacher wanted.
I think the quote is right because it shows that the teacher is interested that I learn something and I have to learn less at home. Sometimes if a teacher has an excellent knowledge he goes to deep into the subject and he tells things that are to complicated and  I can't understand it.
