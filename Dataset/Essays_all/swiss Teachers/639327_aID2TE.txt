A very important point of discusion in school always is how nice or how good theachers are. Often this is the most intresting and first mentioned quesion. However, the ability to teach does not always refer to the competences of knowledge. Is it better if teachers are able to relate with studens rather than being a good teacher who is well informed about the topic of the subject? I do not think so.

First of all, why are people going to school? Are they, because it is fun? Are they, because they want to meet nice and gentle people? I think the point of this rethoric quesion is clear for everybody. Of course they come to school beacuse they want to do something with their life. They want to use the possibility to be educated. This is something that many people around the world can not do, simply because threr is no school at all. I wonder if they would care about a teacher who is not as nice as the woman at the airport. In fact, people who go to school want to learn something. How should  that be possible without a well informed teacher? I think this point is clear: No education without a good knowledge of the person who is responsible to teach this. 

On the other hand side, school seems quite annoying with a grumpy teacher. What can a student do with a person who is very well informed but does not know how to handle students and realte with them? I can tell from my own schooltime that a teacher, who knows almost too much about his topic is something very intresting, because I could ask him anything. But in fact, he is just a bad teacher. This also has no good influence to the education of a student. 

The main point should be clear. A healthy mix of both sides is the best condition for good education and a good and useful schooltime.
