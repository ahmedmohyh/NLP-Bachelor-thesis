In my opinion the ability to relate with the students is the most important one. It's really necessary to give students a comfortable feeling during the lessons. A teacher who always sets the students under pressure is not very popular and because of that, the students are less motivated to perform well. The ability to speak with the students and ask them how they feel with the amount of homework or with the level of difficulty is essentially. Only that way it is possible to build a nice social base with the students.Well it's logic that excellent knowledge is a very nice thing, but it wont help if you cant bring the information to the people. It's also a very nice thing to talk with your teacher if they are any kinds of problems. For example: There is a very kind student who is always doing great during the lessons, but who can't get good grades. Exactly at these moments a good teacher has to react. He should take care of him, ask him if there is a problem or even if he wants more exercises to learn with. Maybe this way he can take profit and can improve his grades. Anyway, it's not very cool to learn something new from a person, who you really can't stand or who even doesn't care about you. So all in all I think it's more about the combination between these two diffrent capabilities but it's still more important to keep a good relation to the students.
