In my opinion this statement is true. I'm in school since a long time and i made much experiences and because of that I can just agree with it. Because of that I can name way more pros than cons. One of the biggest Pro is that it makes way more plasure to learn when you have a good relation to the teatcher and you like them. You can also have way much more fun in the class withch give some (Abwechslung). When you have a good relation with a teacher, he knows, for what you are abel to do and iff you mess up an exam, he knows that you can do it better and motivates you that you will do it better next time. A good example for a good relation to a teacher is, that our class went on a advencer weekend with our teacher. This motivated us to to work better in this class and i enjoyed every time at this teachers class. 

A big con for me is that when a teacher knows much about his subject the class is most of the time boring because they just speak on and on and don't get that the students can't understand what they say because the knowlege aubout this subject from the teacher is higher than that from the students. The teachers use then words that the students can't understand. Because of that I am never motivated to go in a class of a teacher that teach like that. And I always must (zwingen) me to went there.
But it also depends on witch subject is is. When it is a subject that I don't like no teacher or good relation can motivate me to like a subject like that.

How I already said in my first lines, i totaly agree with this statement. But it is important that the students don't (misbrauchen) a good relation with the teachers.
