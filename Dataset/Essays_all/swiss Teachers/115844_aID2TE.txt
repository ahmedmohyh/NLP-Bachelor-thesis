There are teacher which have a great knowledge but can't relate well with students. On the other hand, there are teachers which have a good relationship with students but aren't able to answer any difficult question from one of their students. Which type of teacher is better? In the following I want to answer this question and show the advantage of each type and finally come to a conclusion which one better is.

The knowlegde a teacher has about his subject is an elementary thing. Without this he/she wouldn't be able to teach. If the students are interested on the subject and want to know something that they don't get teached in the regular lessons they can ask their teacher about it. And if the teacher is able to answer these questions it firstly helps the students to improve their knowledge and secondly to become more interested on the subject.  

If the teacher can answer all question regarding his subject but isn't able to give his knowledge to his student because he can't handle with them well what is his knowledge then good for? The students may not understand what their teacher is trying to say them or they are simply not interested in listening to him. Maybe they make fun about him instead of learning from him what he's trying to teach them.
The social qualities of a teacher are as important as his knowledge. Or maybe even more important; With this he can attract the attention of his students and can teach them in an interesting and thrilling way so that the students are willing to learn.

In my opinion, a good knowledge is very important. But more important is that a teacher has a good relationship with his students so that he can teach them the best possible way.
