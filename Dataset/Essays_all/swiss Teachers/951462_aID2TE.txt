The right dosis of relate with students and knowledge of the subject

I think this statement is right, because if all students hate the teacher, and the teacher hate some students, they can not learn something, because the teacher can not overgive the subjects to the students. But if they relate well, it is much easier to learn something. But on the other hand, if the teacher don't know what's the subject is about, he can't teach it to the students and the best relationship is useless. In primary school this is more important than on secondary school or on the university, with young students is the relationship more important than the subject, but its easier to know much about it. In university the subject is more important, because the students don't agree as much as in primary school with the teachers. He only writes the things to the wall and the students copied this. If the professor don't know much about the subject, is he not able to teach the students and he can loos his job. Students at the university should have respect to the teacher, this isn't possible. if the relationship is to lazy, and then they learn nothing too. For professors is it really difficult to have a good relationship to each student, because there are many students and he can't know each of them.
At the end, I think in primary school, the relationship is more imortant than the subject, in secondary school, both is important to learn well and at the university, the subject is the important thing to teach well, the relatinship is unimportant. So I can't say what is more important, because for the best way of learning both things are essential.
