My first thought: I absolutely agree. Many teachers think, they know exactly how a teacher should teach his students. It isn't wrong if a teacher wants to be an authority. Teachers have to be authorities and they have to earn respect from the students. But they also have to be like, I'd call this, "friends with distance". You should be able to talk about sports or recreation things with your teacher. Of course not while your sitting in school and doing your tasks, but perhaps when you see and greet them on the floor. If there are teachers who never tell anything about themselves, they're not liked in most of the cases. That's my opinion (because of expieriences). On the other side, every teacher has to know how any student thinks, what types of working they prefer. That is the psycological aspect every teacher has to learn, even has to understand. Every teacher was a student once. That's what I don't understand if teachers are really unfriendly... Did they like their own unfriendly teachers? I actually can't believe in that. So why are they like the teachers they didn't like? For me such a thought is mysterious. If there is any chance to do it better, every teacher should take the chance and work for a good relationship with their own students. Everyone wants to be liked, or am I completely wrong? I don't think so. 
A teacher should be a mixture of a friend, an authority and a human being. They also have problems we have. And they're not much better thanall students are.
