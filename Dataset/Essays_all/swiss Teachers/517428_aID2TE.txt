What makes a teacher a good teacher? Of course it's very important that the teacher knows what he is talking about, but I think that every teacher has a good knowledge, because he had to study the subject he is teaching the students. For example a maths teacher in the gymnasium or at secondary school had to learn much more diffult things than he is teaching. So his knowledge has to be good enough to teach it. An excellent knowledge is important but a teacher at primary school can teach maths without having a special talent in maths. Everyone who made the matura has enough knowledge in maths to teach it at primary school, but not everyone would be a good teacher and thats why it is more important to relate well with students than having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

A teacher has to have the ability to explain the suject to the students and to be able to do this he has to have a basic knowledge about the subject he is teaching. With basic knowledge I mean he can do everything he has teach easily but he doesn't need to know much more he isn't teaching. The excellent knowledge doesn't help him  more than the basic knowledge, because for his students the knowledge the teacher isn't teaching is useless. 

On the one hand a good knowledge is important and an excellent knowledge may be even better but on the other hand the ability to relate well with students is more important. If the knowledge of the teacher is far better than the knowledge of the students may cause problems because the teacher thinks everything is easy and he can't see how the students can have problems with that. So maybe he has some difficulties with teaching his subject because he knowledge is to good. 

I think the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject and thats what makes him a good teacher.
