A teachers job is to teach the students. This requires a good knowledge about the subject being taught. If the teacher does not have this knowledge, he can not teach anything.
But if a teacher does have an excellent knowledge about the subject, it does not mean automatically that he really is a good teacher. If he is not able to give his knowledge to the students in the right way, so that the students will learn the subject, he does not fullfill his job. That is why even if you are the most intelligent person, it does not mean you are the best to teach a subject.
So what really matters, are both. The right mixture of those two components makes is the most important. A good teacher should have a great ability to relate with the students. This means, he has to be able to understand what the students ask and on which level his expectations should be. Not too high and not too low.
Now to the question, which of them is more important, it is not easy to give an answer to. But in the way the sentence is written (A teacher's ability to relate with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.), it leads me to the answer that the first of these component's, the ability of the teacher to relate well with the students, has to be rated more important because of the fact that there is the word "excellent" in the second component. The teacher does not have to be the most educaed or intelligent on this subject. He just has to be above the level of the students so that he is able to higher their level of knowledge of the subject being taught.
