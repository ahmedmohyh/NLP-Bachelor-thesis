For teachers at highschool level the questions they are asking the students about often seem so logical to them, that they exspect a really good answer. But it does not always perfectly make sense to students, that is why it can be difficult for both the students and the teacher to create a good and successful lesson.

In my school I have some problems with teachers in the way they are creating their lesson. For example in mathematics I find it hard to understand my teacher. The reason I think there is that problem is because he is such an intelligent person who does not really believe that someone like my does not always understand what he is saying. For a math genius like him everything seems so logical that he sometimes totally forgets us, the students. I think he does not relate very well with students, otherwise he would not treat us like we would have studied math since forever. I mean you can not start in the middle of a subject if you have not learnt the basics yet. On the other side you also have to get good information and this you get from well knowing teachers who can share this knowledge with their students.

Beeing a good teacher is to try make the students feel good in class and try to understand and relate to them. Otherwise I think they will not be able to concentrate well during the lesson. Additionally I think also their motivation depends on how the teacher treats you in class, so it is a big part of the school life of a student. 
Personally I totally agree with the statement because of the experiences I have made until now. You can only gain knowledge if the teacher is willing to help you understand the subject from the beginning til the end, and sometimes it is better when you have a teacher who does not always know everything.
