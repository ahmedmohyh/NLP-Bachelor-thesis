In my whole schooltime I met a lots of different teachers. In the primary school the teachers didn't have a big knowledge, but they made their job with pleasure and had a good relationship with their students. In the gymnasuim it is the opposite, they have a big knowledge, but some of them aren't that motivated.

There are some teachers who studied their subject for a very long time and have a huge knowlege. For us students it is really interessting being taught by a person who knows that much, but the teacher also has to have the ability to explain the things in a way we are able to understand it. And that is the point, a teacher who doesn't know how explain the exercises clearly isn't a good teacher. Teachers have to motivate the students, that they get interessed. To motivate people is a hard job, but one of the most important for a teacher. I think to motivate them needs a good reationship, the teacher has to know what the students like. He also has to be friendly, so they like to visit his lessons. This two facts have very much incommon and a teacher is just a good teacher, when he has the ability to connect this two things. 

In the end I think it depends where the teacher teaches. In the primary schook it is more important to have a good relationship with the students, but in the gymnasium it is more important to have a good knowlede. Because here we are prepared to study at a university or something like that. To achieve these goals we go to school to learn something and not to make friends with our teacher.
