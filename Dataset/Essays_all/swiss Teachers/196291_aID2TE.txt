A teacher is a very important person in the life of a student. If a student can relate to a teacher, they like to listen to that person talking. And so the student might learn a lot easier and faster. Since you see your teacher almost every day, you surely learn a lot about them. Contrary wise, if a teacher is unrelatable, students usually don't really like the subject they're teaching and wont even pay attention. The same thing also applies to politicians in certain ways. A teacher needs to be relatable in some way, but the person also must be able to teach the things that are required to succeed in the subject they're teaching.
You always expect your teacher to be an expert on the subject he/she is teaching. So they have to know their stuff. If a teacher can't give you a satisfying answer to one of your question, then they certainly didn't do their job very well. They have to be able to pass on their knowledge to the students proparly while also maintaining the respect of the students. It's most important that a teacher doesn't become a sort of friend, otherwise the students might lose their respect for the person and won't be able to learn anything at all. 
I personally think that a teacher needs to be a mix of both characteristics. A teacher must be relatable to some degree but he/she also must be respected by the students. All in all it's most important that the teacher does his/her job and teaches the things he/she needs to teach in a way that is relatable but also efficient for the students. This is a very difficult job because a teacher most of the time only wants the best for their students.
