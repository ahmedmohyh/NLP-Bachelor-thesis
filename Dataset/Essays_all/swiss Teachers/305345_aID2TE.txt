In my opinion this sentence isn't correct. It's exactly the other way round. When you are a teacher and you don't know the subject, which is being taught, the students can't improve their english knowledge. And maybe at the englisch lessonst the students have a lot of fun, but later in the future or in your job you can't talk with each other on englisch. For example when you want to become an pilot, you have no chance for being one, because you can't speak fluently with the other pilots or the tower. So you it has a big negatives cons in the future. For sure you can later improve your englisch when you make a language stay or when you go longer to an private school. But this would be very expensive and takes a lot of extra time.

It's also very important to relate well with the other students. Mostly its like this: When a teacher is harder in his englisch englisch lessons, then the students don't like him very much, but at the future they are very appreciate to him,  because of their good english knowledge the students would also have a better social live and can earn more money.

At the end you can say, that this statement is for some students true and for some not, because most of them will need their english knowledge later again. For example also when you make holidays in America or an other englisch speaking country. It's much better when you can speak on english with the people in the forgein country, also when it wouldn't be very fluently. Because then you show a bit of respect to the country. For me I think the mest solution is a middle way. A theacher also can be very clever in his englisch knowledge and can taugt this to his studends and at the same time he can be very relate with his students.
