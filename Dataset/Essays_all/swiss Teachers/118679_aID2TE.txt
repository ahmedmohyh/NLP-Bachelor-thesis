Education is getting more and more important. Is difficult to find a good job without being well-educated. Therefore also teachers getting more important. They have to make the lessons exciting. And althougt the lessons should be interesting the pupils should learn a lot. But what's more important, getting well on with your students or having an excellent knowledge?

It's important that teachers have a good relationship with their stundents.
By getting well on with them, teacher have a bigger effect on their students. Teacher can teach them important knowledge about life. Students listen to the advices of teachers they like. Therefore teachers can influence the life of their students positively.
In addition students are more attentive during the lessons. They can concentrate better and will listen carefully to the words of the teacher. They will graduate with better marks and more knowledge.
But on the other hand, a good relationship is not useful if teachers don't know much about their subject.
The stuff students learn in school is now more than ever important for their life. They have to get a huge knowledge about everything to have a chance to find a good job. And this cannot work if the teacher himself doesn't know much about his subject.

In my opinion a combination of a good relationship with his students and a lot of knowledge is the best way of teaching. One of them doesn't work without the other, they influence each other.
