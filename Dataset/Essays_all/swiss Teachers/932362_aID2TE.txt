This statement is true because it is very important to relate well with students und people if you are a teacher. When someone decide to be a teacher, then he also decide to help their students. A teacher should be a person for their students where they can go and talk about their problems or ask them for help. But if a teacher doesn't has enough knowledge and the students see that, then he also has a problem because the students also want to learn and want to have good grades. If their teacher is not able to teach them enough and to prepare them enough for the real world the stundents don't like him very much and then their either doesn't go to him when they have problems or when they needed the teachers help. But I think it depends on the Age of the Students too. In the Primary school it is more important to have a good connection with the students, the teacher are like heros for their students in this age and they think that the teacher knows all even when the teacher knows not so much. But afterwoods, when the students are older and their teacher aren't heros anymore, it is more and more important to have a good knowledge. Because if the students see that they know more than their teacher knows thats pretty awful for the teacher. Then students aren't allways nice to their teacher and esspecially not if they doesn't like the teacher and they see that they can do anyting with him.
My opinion is that if a teacher has not a perfect knowledge but an excellent relate with their students and he is a primary teacher, then it is ok. But a teacher who works as an secundary teacher needs a better knwledge than a well realte with students. So I think it depends on which school a teacher works.
