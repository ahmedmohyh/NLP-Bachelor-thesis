A good atmosphere in class is important! If the relation between students and the teacher is good, both are more motivated to have class together and to learn something. Of course people are able to pick up more informations because they should be more interested if the teacher relate well with them.
On the other hand we should see that school is here for learning and not to do anything else. It is really bad if the teacher tells you something about a topic, but can not discuss it with the class because of his worse knowledge. You could not ask him question and get a answer which is surely correct or in the worst case he absolutely do not can answer your question. For example your teacher tells you to discuss a specific topic in a group and in the end of the lesson you should have a little presentation about it. And finally the teacher will come and congrate you, know he had learn something new too and then you find out that you have told the class worng things. That would be really bad.
Another bad experience would be if you are so interessted in the issue and want to learn more about it. You have many good questions to the teacher and the teacher just says he is sorry, but he can not answer you the questions beacause they are not writen in the book.
Less knowledge of the teacher is contraproductif for your learning and your motivation!
I want to add that it absolutely depense on many foctore like in which class you are (primar or secondary) and on the unknowledge of the teacher.
In my opinion it is much more helpfull if the teacher has an excellent knowledge because I would be really unmotivated if my teacher could not explain me things, I want to know. But if I would be just seven years old or something like this, teachers do not have to have such a big knowledge like teachers of the gymnasium.
Finally I can say that a good mix of both points is the best thing. Not just for students who have more fun by learning, also for teacher!
