A tacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Memories that human can connect with emotions are much stronger than memories without any emotions. It's important that the teacher can relate well with his students because especially students have to learn the stuff the teacher is teaching and if they remember the teacher in a positive way they will feel and remember joy while they think about the subject. Students connect the teacher with the subject. As I said before it's much better for students if they connect the stuff they learn with emotions like joy, pleasure or even emotions like sadness because they learn much faster and more effective. They start giving the subject another importance. If they like the teacher and the teacher is kind of important to the students the stuff he teaches is automaticaly important too. 

On the other side the teacher has to know his subject as well as he knows himself. Especially in subjects like science perfection and excellent knowlegde is asked. In the later career they also have to learn to perform a task as they are asked to and if they don't have enough knowledge about that they will fail. 

In the end to me the relationship of the teacher to the students is the most important thing and so the teacher's ability to relate with his students. The students spend a lot of their lifetime in school and they learn more than the stuff he teaches from him. They learn a lot about life and the teacher has a big responsability because he's the like the leader of a group and we are human so we should learn how to be human and not how to be machines. The ability to interact with people is in most cases more important for the students than excellent knowledge.
