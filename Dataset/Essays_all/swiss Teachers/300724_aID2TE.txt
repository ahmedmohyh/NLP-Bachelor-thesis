For me a good teacher needs to be able to relate quite well with students so I definetly agree with the statement written above. I think so because of various reasons. One of them is the fact that if you have a teacher you can relate to you will definetly be more motivated in the subject and you will have more personal motivation as well. Of course another pupil could say that having excellent knowledge in a subject is more important because you learn more valuable information about the subject but is it really more important to have a teacher who knows everything about his or her subject or is it more important to have someone teaching you the subject who you personally like and get along with? For me it surely is he second one because I think a healthy student teacher relationship is the key to every students success in any subject. Other opinions now could state that this is not as important as having a specialist teaching you  in a subject but what can a specialist teach you if you can`t relate to him or her because it is a very cold person without any interest in helping you to understand or learn with fun or motivation?
For example if you had an english teacher with an excellent english but no ability to explain, relate and/ or help you, what would his or her good english help you in that subject if you did not understand what he or she was trying to say?
Another aspect I would like to mention is the fact that teachers are not just here to teach a subject, they are also here to give us students something for our life. If that means they give us just the basic information of the subject but give us a fascination or a motivation instead of additional information, I am willing to take that because I think school is not just here for teaching us the normal subjects, I think we should also learn something for life and because of that a teacher with the ability to relate is more important for me.
