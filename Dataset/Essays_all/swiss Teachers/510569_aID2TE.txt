Every student knows the two scenarios at a school: Hi goes to his class and the teacher starts talking. He obviusly knows what about he is talking but every student in the class does not. It is too complicated for them. On the other hand in de next class there is a teacher which works well with his students and they understand everything. But what for, if the teacher has not the right knowledge? How can a person be a teacher, when he is not in the position to prepare his students for the tests or for the exercises in the rest of their life?
There are many kinds of teachers and not everyone teaches the same subject or in the same level. Therefore it is very important to understand as a teacher what you want to teach to your students. Every teacher has to understand his knowledge otherwise he cannot give his knowledge on. In this case the students will love him, because he cannot make hard tests and push his students to the best. And as you already see, in the next pages of life this black hole will become a biger problem.
On the otherside everyone had once a teacher who was really smart but did not know how to make the students understand. Mostly the teacher was hated by his students because the stuff was to hard and to difficult to understand. The most students had bad grades in his subject.
Personally, I think that the knowledge should be the most important quality of a teacher. Even here in the high school we have some teachers, which say wrong thing (or say `things` wrong). I have not the opinion that a student can learn from a teacher which does not have a knoeledge by himself.
