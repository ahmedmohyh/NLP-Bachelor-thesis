Teacher's ability
        
A teacher needs many abilities to be a good teacher. The statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught isn't totally incorrect but it's also not totally correct.

It is important, that students like to go in class. For that, they don't have to like the subject, but they prefere it when they like the teacher who teach it. The students then like going in that subject and are more willing to do homework and study for it. To get on well with your teacher also resoluts in a warmer class-clima and that again can make a student or even the whole class better in this subject.
So can we say knowledge isn't important when we come again to our statement?

No, we can't! Sure getting on well with your students has it's good sites, but without knowledge from the teacher the class still can't learn anything! But a teacher with excellent knowledge who can't speak with the student also isn't a conclusion. If the teacher can't bring his informations to the class the students can't learn and in the worst case they forget what they have learned before.
So we also can't say to relate well with students isn't important.

All in all I think a good teacher needs both abilities. To get on well with the students resoluts that the students are willing to learn more and the excellent knowledge is needed to teach the students so that they get better day and day.
