Is it really more important to get on well with the students and to get the students trust rather than being an expert in your subject?

It seems like a very easy question, but is it really? In my opinion you need a lot of time to answer this question because we all know, that if we can build up trust with somebody you are much more willing to do an effort but you can't forget the quality of the class you get. Let's take a French class for example. It's true if you have a teacher who is not willing to understand the students mood, emotions or struggles it will be a rather challenging task to motivate the class to learn something. But in contrast you can't either give classes if you don't know the French grammar or don't pronounce it well. Because otherwise the students will ask themselves if it makes sense to still attend the lessons. Because isn't it more sensible to learn a language or anything from someone who really know what one is talking about? 
Or we can take it the other way round. Imagine you have a very intelligent physics teacher who is brilliant and knows every answer to every question but he can't explain it in a more easy way so that the students have a chance of understanding. Imagine his lessons are boring and full of difficult terms you won't understand without having help of others or youtube. This won't be the right way to get the students' attention.

So in my opinion the right way to do it is to have both of the things mentioned above. To relate well with students aswell as having an excellent knowledge of your subject. Only if you are able to make a propper mixture of both qualities you will make an exellent class.
