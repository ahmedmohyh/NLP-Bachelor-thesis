Firstly, as we all know, teachers play an important role in our academic school time. They need to relate well with students in order to get a relying, stable relationship. If a teacher is able to interact well with his students, he will be understood more often and likely pupils will listen more carefully when the teacher is a communicative person in front of the blackboard. In contrast to this, teachers should also fulfil what the government requires, a funny teacher is definitely not helpful when he is joking all the time without teaching serious things.

Moreover, excellent knowledge is supposed to be quite important, because universities are not in favour of taking students with no idea of anything. The perfect teacher should get a balance between being strict in contrast to the more positive aspects like being patient and good-tempered which means not to be furious when a student is asking something twice. 

In my opinion a teacher has to obtain both sides. On the one hand the friendly and explaining father, and on the other hand surely the one who shows where the students have to get to in order to be ambitious and successful. Especially a person like me needs to feel that one is accepted and respected by the teacher. With keeping this in mind, it is much easier to improve your knowledge for tests. But as I said at the top of this essay, the subject being taught has a hundred percent to be exactly and matching with that what higher schools expect from students. If not, I would rather have a inexcusable one who has the capacity to force pupils with the goal of being successful in school life.
