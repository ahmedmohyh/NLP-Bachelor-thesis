In todays essay, we're going to treat the question, if the ability to relate well with students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach.
 Looking at this question I think, that the knowledge and also the ability to relate well are very important, because of several reasons. First of all, I think that it is important to relate well with the students, because you sometimes spend the whole day with them. This is often the case in lower education classes, like kindergarden or primary school. As a teacher you must be very empathetic and get on well with your students.

But is the ability actually more important than the knowledge of the subject?
 In primary school this statement might be right, but as soon as you look at higer education, like college or university, I completely disagree. Some reasons for my opinion are, that you aren't as close to your teacher in college and university as you were in primary school. You only do higher education, because you want to learn more. So why should the ability to relate well be more important, than the excellent knowledge? Some people might argue that there aren't any teachers anymore in college, but more like people who just hold their speeches, but at the end of the day all they do is, they teach you the things you need to learn and so they are teachers for me.

 I now come to the conclusion that the ability to relate well with students is more important in primary school than it is in college or university, where as the knowledge of the subject is more important in college as it is in primary school. A reason for this might also be, that in primary school teachers often teach more than one subject, for example maths, english and arts at the same time, and in college they often teach one specific subject.
 So I think that the statement is only partly true, because of the previously said reasons.
