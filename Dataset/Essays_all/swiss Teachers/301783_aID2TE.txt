We all have some teachers we do like and some we do not like as much and that has an impact on our grades and motivation to study for their subject but is the reason for that the ability to relate?

On the one hand a teacher with perfect knowledge of a subject might know the exact way to explain the task or theme.
On the other hand a relatable teacher would know what to do if something is not clear and find another way to explain the problems.
In my opinion I enjoy class more when the teacher can put himself in the students place to relate. Because he or she then knows what to change or continue doing to make class the most comfortable and helpful to a student.
In case a teacher has excellent knowledge that would show his passion and interest in the subject and he is willing to teach you and inspire yoou to study. And you study better if you are completely motivated to know and understand more of a certain subject.

To compare these arguments for a final statement we have to give a weight to each. If a teacher cannot relate that might have a negative effect on the students willingness to study but if the teacher also has perfect knowledge and wants to share it with you I think that is more valuable because you are as interested in the subject as with the relatable teacher and additionally you have the explanation of an expert. So for me the statement above is incorrect.
