Nowadays there are people, who think it is more important to have a good relationship to the students than an excellent knowledge of the teacher. This might be because of new education ideas, that were raising in the decades.  Which leads me to write an essay about this theorie and I am going to discuss which arguments are supporting this theorie.

When students do not show any interest in classes, it is often not a question of motivation, more a problem of the teacher. One example of a math teacher; he is very intelligent, has graduated with the best marks, but he can't give his knowledge to students, because he never made the experience to explain it in a way that the most students could uderstand. A lot of teachers, especially younger ones, are having this conflict. They only learn the material, but what they do not learn is how eaxactly to teach it. 

On the other side it is really important too, that teachers are well educated. It does not help if he is friendly and like a kind of big brother, when he is not qualificated. This causes students that are hanging around or are playing with their smartphones during the lessons.

In conclusion I would say that both aspects are necessary for good
