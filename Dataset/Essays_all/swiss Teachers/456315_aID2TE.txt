I do not agree with the statement for one simple reason: I do not care if a teacher can realte to me or not. I don't relate to them either and I am not planning on doing so because that is not the reason why I go to school. I come here everyday for one reason only and that is to gain new knowledge. So, how am I supposed to do that if the person teaching me does not know what she is talking about? As I already said, I am here for one reason only and the same goes for my teachers. I am here to learn and they are here to teach. It doesn't really get any easier than that.
