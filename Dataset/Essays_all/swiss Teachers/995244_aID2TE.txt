Well, this theme we have to regard with different views. There are positive and negative aspects.
A positive aspect of relating well with students is, that they learn quite more if they have a teacher like that,because they like listening this sort of teacher. The other sort of teachers that know almost everything about a subject but don't have the ability to relate well with the students isn't enough. If you have a teacher in front of you that read exactly the thing from a paper or learned a text or whatever by heart, you're just bored and not interested, but a teacher that makes storys, tell something on the level of the students, so they can follow the red line and like that they are very interested. Often it's the case that the students aren't at a "excellent" level so if a teacher hasn't got an excellent knowledge of a special subject it isn't that bad. It would be mouch betther if he knows arrange himself/herself with the different students. On the other hand there are always some "special" students that like to have a very high level of teachers and they like to know so many details of a subjetct where a teacher that doesn't have an excellent knowledge is on the wrong place. 
I think it's much more important that a teacher can relate very well with students. On my oppinion this is the most important thing that a teacher should have. I think the level on which a teacher talks and relate with the students can decide about thoughts and psychical healthy of the students. There is a lot of pression on the shoulders of these students. So the relation between teachers and students should be well.
