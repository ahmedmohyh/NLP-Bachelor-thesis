" Excuse me, could you explain to me how you can multiply 2.2 and 2.5? I don't know how to do that because.." "Finish the excercise you're meant to do."   Me: "But im already finished." Teacher really anoyed:"You can use the calculator and then do something else, you can draw something!" "But I want to know how to calculate this myself." Then my teacher's voice rose:"Why are you insiting on that? I can't explain this to you!" So I shrugged, went back to my desk and drew something.

This happened in primary school, I can remember it well because this lady, my former teacher, usually was really nice but all of a sudden she kind of lost it. She got quiet angry and I didn't understand it. It took some time for me to realise why she wouldn't help me. Not because she just wasn't up to it in that very moment but because she really couldn't explain it. She didn't really know the answer herself. The fact that she usually was really nice didn't help me in that momen because I would have needed her to do what she's meant to do, to teach me something. I think teacher should have excellent knowlege of their subject, How are students supposed to learn something from someone who doesn't really understand what he's explaining himself?

So I disagree with this statement because no matter how well the teacher can relate to his students they won't learn anything if the teacher's got bad knowlege of his subject.Sure it's important teacher and students both get along with each other. But after all school is a place to study and to prepare for the future, if a teacher doesn't fully understand his own subject, if there are gaps in his knowlege he's not doing his job right.
