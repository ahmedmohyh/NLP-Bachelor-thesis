For young children the padagogically correct teachers are very important, beacause with them they learn to like school and to learn more. Me, for example, I'm very glad that some of my teachers are kind to us and tell us the story about her life or why they are sad. 
Also for children, which are very shy or not at all selfconfidant the treatement of a teacher who followsyou in your way in school is very importent.
if a techersknows much about his subject thelessons are muh
Do you have to be friends with your teacher?
Teachers are not at all teaching because they want to get friend with their students, they are just doing his job. 
You are in school and do your stuff and write exams to reache a good mark and later to study what you want. You don't have time to get friend with your teacher and it's not the sense behind it, beacause it's not necessary if you have teacheras friend but your marks are very bad.
Another dangurous thing is, that the teachers loose authority which is the most important thing for teaching. Without authority, the childrens do what they want, theteacher can't teach his subject, thelessons are boring and the relation between the class and the teacher isn't comfortable.
So in my eyes it has to be a mix of these two aspects, which are named in the phrase.
The padagogically level is very importent to feeling confidant and to see that they are also justhuman beeings. But also the knowledge in subject is imprtant to creat a intressting lesson and to keep the distance between student and teacher because of your authority you get if you know very much.
