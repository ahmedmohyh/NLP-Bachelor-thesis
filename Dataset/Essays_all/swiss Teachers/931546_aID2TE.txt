What is more important? A teacher with the ability to relate well with students or a teacher who have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I also thought about this question, and for me there some cricial arguments. For example, do the a  students learn something about the subject or does it only be a fun part with the teacher.

So the people, who agree wit the statement, have the argument that a teacher have to have the ability to comunicate with the students, only then students could learn something about the subject. It's because the teacher could motivate the students to learn something interessant about this subject, this people have the opignion that if a teacher wouldn't have the ability to interact with the students well, they wouldn't learn something. 

The persons who disagree with this statement have the argument, that the students have to decide for them own if they want to learn something new, so it's better if they have got a teacher that has an excellent knowledge of the subject than a teacher that can interact with the students, but he doesn't know something about the subject.

So the persons that agree with the statement also claims that it would be better when the teacher have got the ability to discust with the students, so it will also be good for the class.

So in the end my opignion is that it's better when we have teachers that have excellent knowledge of the subject then a teacher's ability to relate well with students, because now a days we have to much teachers, the most of them are low qualificatet, they want earn a lot of money, they want also thirteen weeks hollidays, so we have a big problem, the gouvernment have to clean up the whole teachers scene and test them hard, so that the students could lern something. The students go to school to learn something new and not to learn how to act and speak in our life, that's the task of our parents. I disagree with the statement.
