Exelent knowledge of the subject is an important part of teaching. You need to be able to answer the students questions. But I think it is more important to come along with your students good. If this isn't the case you will have a hard time teaching the students your subject. They wont respect the teacher too, wont listen to the teacher because they just think the teacher is a "dumbass". A teacher really wants to don't let this happen. In fact this is more important than exellent knowledge of youre subject. But knowing what you say is also important. I think this is logic, because you always need to answer questions and if your students don't get the answer they want, they wont respect you and your subject too. These two factors need to play along in good subject teaching. But as I said, relating good with your students is more important. For example; We have a teacher that knows his subject in a almost frightning way. As a logical conclusion we should be able to lern his subject in a perfect manner. In fact, no one really listens to him, because he just stands in the front and drops his knowledge like a "boss". In addition man has the feeling he doesn't want to teach us. He can't work with us together and does not understand what he makes wrong. In most of his lessions the class just sits there and waits for someone to answer the question he asked. No one really likes to participate in his lessions because of his complete ignorance. He thinks he's a good teacher and everyone likes his subject, but in fact the partissipation is lacking extremely in his lessions. All just because he can't relate with the class in a good manner.
