Everyone who is going to school probably knows the feeling when you just do not like your teacher. It is the same struggle every day and you can not find any motivation to learn properly. But which ability of the teacher is more important for students to get excellent marks, the relation with the learners or the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

First of all, it is true that teachers whith a great knowledge who are educated and probably intelligent are an idol for most of their students. They can teach them many important things which they will need for their graduation.

Secondly, it is a fact that the students, who have to get almost all of their knowledge from their proffesor, can learn more of someone who knows most.

On the other hand, the process of learning something new is only given when you hear, see or liten to whatever you have to know for the assesment. So if the relation is tense between the student and the teacher you will not get the results he wasprobably expecting because the motivation was not there to even listen to him or to do the exercise.

Another fact is that students can keep their knowledge longer and are more motivated to get good marks if they like a subject better. The possibility to like a subject increases when you get on well with the teacher.

In my opinion the arguments which say that the relation whith the student is more important than the great knowledge of the teacher from a specific subject are most important.
