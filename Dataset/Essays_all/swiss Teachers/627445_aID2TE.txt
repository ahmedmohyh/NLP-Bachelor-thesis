A teacher's ability to relate well with studens is very important, because if a student doesn't like to go to school because of the teacher, than the studens lose their motivation. A teacher also need to like his students and have lot's of fun during the lesson. I think that a teacher need to love his job. If he just know everythink about one subject and doesn't like childrens he doesn't need to be teacher. He also can work in a labor or an firm. 
But in the other hand its important that a teacher have excellent knowledge of the subject. If he doesn't know importent thinks, for exemple details from the second world war, he can't be a good history teacher. The studens don't like to go to school because in the lesson is verry boring,if the teacher can't answer their questions. I think for a teacher it's a little bit embarassing if he doesn't know things about the topic...
I'm disagree with this statement, because I think that the excelent knowledge is as important as the ability to relate well with students. A teacher is a person who need to can do bouth. That's the ability from a teacher, he can compaire these two things.
