Students often say they have a good or a bad teacher. And they sometimes think that it's the teachers fault when they have a bad note in a test. But what is a good teacher? Is it more important that the teacher relate well with the students than that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject?

Of course it's important that a teacher is someone students like. Because then the students are more motivated doing something for this subject and they are more interested in. They make more homework and will be better in this subject than when they have a teacher they dont't like. But it's for every student different which teachers he likes so it's difficult to say if a teacher can relate well with the students or not.

On the other hand it's really important that a teacher has a good knowledge of his subject. He has to explain this things the students in a way they can understand him and he has to know more than other people to give answers to questions the students asks. And it's less boring when someone who is really interested and informed in this subject tells you something about it.

But I think it isn't more important that a teacher can relate well with students than he has an excellent knowledge of the subject. I think the two things are similar important. The best teachers will always they be, who can motivate the students in this subject he has an excellent knowledge.
