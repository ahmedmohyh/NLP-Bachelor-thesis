I think it`s very important that the Teacher has a good atmosphere with the students. When he relate well with the students then he know better what he need to tell the class and how he tell the class something. The Students are also more interested and like to go to the class with this kind of Teacher. Then when the Teacher can`t relate well with the students then he can`t teach his knowledge of the subject. But the Teacher need also much knowledge about his subject, because what will he tell the class without knowledge? Also with much knowledge he can say why something is how it is or why something is wrong or right. I think you can`t say what`s more important because a teacher need the ability to relate well with the students and the knowledge of the subject. Finally i disagree with this statement because for me a teacher need both.
