Many students love teachers, who can relate well with students. On the other hand, teachers who have a good knowledge of the subject are also popular. Is the ability to relate well with students more important than a good knowledge of the subject ? In this essay I like to give arguments for and against the statement, that relating to students is more important than knowing the subject.

First of all I prefer to start with the arguments in favour of this statement. When students get along well with their teachers, it is easier to learn, than when they don't interact together. Students feel more free, they can ask a teacher questions and they like to go to this lesson. If there is a teacher who just knows the subject well, but can't interact with his students, then it is difficult to teach them something, because the students think that the teacher does not care about the students. Hence they would not be passionate about going to this lesson.

On the other hand, teacher who knows the subject can make better lessons. On account of the knowledge, the teacher knows excactly what is important in the subject. The other type of teacher might be very easy in the lesson. This can cause lack of level of the subject. 

To sum up,for me it is very important to have a bright knowledge of the own subject, but more important is to relate with the students, because in this way they like to go to the lesson and learn something about the subject. In addition they can always ask teacher questions. Thus I'm for the statement that relating well with students is more important than having a excellent knowledge of the subject.
