School is very im portant for our future life, we need school to understand with what we're confronted with.And like in every school or other education systems we need teachers, they are there to teach us the subjet their best in, and to help us to get trought education. The most asked question about teachers is : 
"Is the teacher’s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?"
Thats a very good question, the main advantage is that pupils have way more fun and are more motivated in class if the teachers can relate well with the students, thats because we feel more comfortable happy and opened near a person you can relate with, if you have a teacher who just does his job and dont really interact with the students are more likely to be unmotivated and bored what leads to lose students with interessts in the subject.
That is an other argument, that students lose interests very fast if the teacher dont interact with them, they get bored an dont really care about the subject anymore.

At the other hand, its important to learn as much as you can about a subject, so a teacher with much and excellent knowledge would perfectly fit it.
You feel comfortable around a teacher who excactly know what they are talking about, because you know that the teacher knows what he is talking about, and that he is the position to anwser all of your questions.
A teacher with more knowledge can bring the class more information about the theme.

I think that both ways have their positive and negative sides, its just important that the students can learn from their teachers and that they wont lose interessts in the subject.
