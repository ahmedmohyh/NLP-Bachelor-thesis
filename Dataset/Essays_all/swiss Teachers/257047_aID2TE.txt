I neither agree nor disagree with the statement. 
In my opinion it is a mix of both of them to make the students understand a subject well. On the one hand it surely is essential to have an excellent knowledge of the subject otherwise it will get tough to answer the question of the students and giving them a good overall sight into the subject which is really important because it is often easier to learn about something if you understand the source of it. A teacher should be able to know about the necessery connections a subject contains so the students can relate and make their conclusions maybe as well connect them with other topics they have learnd in other subjects.  But on the other hand knowledge alone doesn't help much if you can't share it with your students which in the end is the destination of a lesson. A teacher who isn't able to report the students about the subject he is teaching won't be succesfull by introducing the students into a topic. In this case the majurity of the students could both loose the interest in a subject and in the end have no or at least less memorys of what they should have learnd during the lessons. 

If a teacher is able to handle both having an excellent knowledge and having the ability to relate well to the students, the students will have absolved a successfull schooltime in which they will have learnd a lot as in the end how this world and his envirement the universe could be working.
