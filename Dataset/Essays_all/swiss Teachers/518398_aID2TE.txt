I agree with the statement, that's important,that the teacher is able to have a good relationship with his students. The relationship to a teacher has a huge influence on the student's marks, because teachers are also only humans and can't quit treat their students subjective all the time.
In our modern world with these headways in thinking and the change of our value system, i think we also should ignore this old fashioned thought of a teacher as an authority person only. Also the teacher's ability, to have an excellent knowledge of the taught subject is very important, but if the social relationship doesn't function between folks and the teacher,it's difficult to learn something, even if the teacher knows everything. When a teacher relates well with his students, he can teach them things better which they'll understand in a better way.
The fact, that a teacher is very competent in his subject, doesn't mean, that he could reach the students with his learn methods.
I think it shouldn't be a friendship between students and teacher, but a good relation supports the learning effect.
