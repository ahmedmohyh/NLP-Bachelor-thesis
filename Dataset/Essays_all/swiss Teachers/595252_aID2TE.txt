Today it's about the question " what's more important: a good relationship between teacher and student or the knowledge from the teacher about a subject that he/she taught".

First i`m gonna write about the pro arguments for this statment. It's important that teachers have a good realtionship to their students. Because when they are something like a "friend" for the students, and not like a teacher its easier for many children to learn something. Also they like to go to school more and when you do something volunterly and with fun it's easier for exampel to stay up in the morning. 

But their aren't just pro arguments about this statment. The knowledge is also very imortant because that's the reason why the students go to school. the want to learn something that's right and they wanna have the security that their teacher knows exactly what he/she is talking about. When the students regnonize that the teacher hasn't a perfect knowledge about the subject, the teacher will lose his seriosity.

So I disagree with this statment because i think both, a good relationship and a good knowledge, is imortant for the students and also for the teacher. In my case I've some teachers that try to relate good with the class and in these lessons the class is more active and also their is just a good atmosphere in the classroom. So most of us like to go in these lessons. Otherwise we have teacher that are very badly prepart and they come in and say something like "hmmm what can we make today?" and in this case I've absolutly no need to sit there and listen to what he's talking about. And I think that's very sad. I mean i go to school because I wanna learn something and with such teachers that very difficult.

A good balace between these two things would be perfect. And I think it would be more fun for everybody. For the teachers and the students.
