What would you like more, a doctor, who knows what to do with your body or a doctor, who is nice?
 
There is a reason why not everyone can do every kind of job. For every job it is important to have a great knowledge regarding the job. If a teacher is lacking knowledge of the subject being taught, the teacher is not satisfacting. Can you call him a teacher when he can't even teach?

Not only theory is important in a job but also a lot of emotional intelligence is demanded almost everywhere. In jobs with many interactions with people it's demanded even more. A teacher has to have emotional intelligence and the ability to relate well with students in order to befriend them. If the teacher isn't nice, no student is going to like him, leading to students hating these lessons and not being listening. 

To conclude, what ability is more important in order to be a good teacher? 
The ability to relate well with students is more important. Because even if the teacher has an excellent knowledge but no ability to relate with students, no student is going to like his teaching and they wont learn anything. 
But if a teacher is a teacher, there is a reason for that. He knows his subject well enough even though it isn't excellent. Now, he also knows how to relate with students , which makes him more nice and likeable for students. This leads to an attentive class that learns a lot.
