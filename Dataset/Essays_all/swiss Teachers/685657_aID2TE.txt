For me it's clear that teachers must have the ability to relate well with students. Especially in the time where so much in a students life changes with puberty and becoming adult it's important to have a steady person in the everyday life. It doesn't mean that the teacher has to start the conversation with the student about family problems or self-doubt but if the teacher showes interest and empathy towards his students, they will speak up. A students life is very stressful and especially with many different subjects at the same time where the teachers expect full concentration and effort it's hard to please everyone. I don't think it's acceptable if a teacher doesn't have the knowledge about his subject but as long as he can explain somewhat controversial questions on a slightly higher level it's acceptable. Something I don't understand are teachers who don't actually like kids in general and aren't willing to relate to their students. This, I think, is much worse than not having an excellent knowledge of his subject. If the students like their teachers, feel respected and taken seriously I'm sure the mood and grades will go up which is in everyone's best interest. It motivates to listen if a person which students view as a role model stands in front of the class. In fact I think it's important to send another person, this can be another teacher, to watch how the teacher acts near students and give him feedback. I don't think everyone has the ability to be a good teacher especially if they don't even try to relate with students. As a school it's important for the well-being and future of the students to make sure to know who they put in front of the class.
