Being at school is a big part of our live. The first 9 years we have to go and the following 3 years are not obligatory. School is a important thing for our social live and our education. Here we meet friends, have our first experiences with boys, learn a lot of things, a lot of important things, and here we learn more about us self. Teachers are a important thing on this points. They join our way and created us like who we are now. In school you have always this teacher or these teachers you don`t like. Because they are strongly or the examens are very difficult or simply you don`t like the class.   

About the central question i`ve made me a lot of thoughts already. " A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". You wish always that you have a cool teacher, who isn`t not very difficult and who makes the class very funny and easy. Yes I also wish a teacher like that, because you`re enjoing being in class and I think the social live has a big positiv influence. But my worries at this them are, that the students often lost their respect for the teacher. They have fun and something else, but that isn`t all. I think when you have a very good clima with the teacher but you learn nothing, because the good knowledge of the subject isn`t here, that isn`t the idea. The knowledge is also very important. The teacher should be bough, having a nice ability with the students and taught an excellent knowledge of the subject. 

So I think you can`t say what`s better. Because, firstly every person is diffrent and learns diffrent and secondly only one of both isn`t healthy for learningn. So the best way is a mix of both, a creat clima and an excellent knowledge of the subject, for you and your live after.
