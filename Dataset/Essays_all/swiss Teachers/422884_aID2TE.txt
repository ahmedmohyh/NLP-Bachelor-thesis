There are many different opinions about how the perfect teacher should be. Some find it very important that the teacher is strict and pushes his students to the highest level possible, while others enjoy being taught by very friendly teachers. But is it more important to relate with your teacher or being taught facts by someone who has an excellent knowledge?

On one hand it is nice if you can relate with your teacher because if you can relate with someone you are more likely to like this person. A very important point is, that teachers have to be the people you can talk to. Especially if you are in a camp or excursion with your class or if you are too shy to talk about it with your parents. 

On the other hand it is important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of is subject because if the teacher does not know what her or she is doing, you will neither learn anything important nor will you know whether you have been taught facts or something made up. Especially if the teacher works at a Gymnasium it is important that the teacher is an expert in his subject. Otherwise it does not make sense to stay in school for four more years.

In my opinion it is way more important, that the teacher is an expert in his subject. Of course you shoulld be able to talk to your teachers if there is a problem but honestly I came to this school hoping to learn more. Not being friends with teachers. nd if the teachers are unable to teach their subject because of lacking knowledge, I would either start to question the importance of Gymnasium or quit school and start working.
