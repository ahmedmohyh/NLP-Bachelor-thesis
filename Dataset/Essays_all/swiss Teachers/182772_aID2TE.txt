I think bouth statements are importent. If the teacher is an boody no one is listen to him in the class. But if the teacher haven`t the excellent knowledge he can`t teach the students and i ask myself, how could he becom an teacher?! When an teacher haven`t the knowledg to teach an class i would talk to the upper teacher and i would like to have an other one. Becaus it can`t be, that a teacher doesn`t know the things, we have to know. There are things, witch an teacher can`t know, but he maked an lassey and have to know that things.
When a teacher have fun with an class and make the lessons nice the children are listen better to this person and work more. The teacher can include games or show an video to the students and so they have more fun. 
Like i sad befor, it`s very important that the teacher have an great knowledge and he should be like an friend. But it doesn`t mean that he have to make something with the students in their freetime and that the teacher have to have the same hobbys like the kids. A teacher have to anderstand the students and to listen to them. But it`s also important to know that an teacher isn`t a parent and he haven`t to learn the children how they have to speak or something. His job is to learn the children things, witch they can use in there life. 

So an combination with bouth things are important. He have to be funy an creat the lessons intesting and he have to have the excellent knowledge.
