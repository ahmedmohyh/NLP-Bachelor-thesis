A teacher has to simply do bothe. He has to relate well with students and he must have an exellent knowledge. If you are a teacher you have to be with students every day. You would make yourself sick if you do not like children. I would get really angry but thats not what we talk about. But it's not only that you should like the childrens, the children should also like you. You would'nt get enough respect if they do not like you. But at all I woul'nt understand why somebody would like to be a teacher if he or she or it would not get on well with students.Tthe other part is the knowlege. just to say if you have no idea of the subject you teach, you would be very stupid if you would teach it. It's just not fair. The students would'nt learn anything. But the thing is if you teach for example biology, you have had a long study in biology so why schould'nt you know anything about it? I can just say it again, if you relate well with students but do not know anything about what you are teaching it does'nt matter, you just should'nt teach. Because it's the same fact, you would'nt get respect from your students. In the other way if you know really much about the subject but don't get on well with children you also should not teach. You have to find a mittle way or just do both. Than you would be the perfect teacher. So back to the statement. I'm disagree at all. And i dont know what to say else about it. It's just this and thats all. and I have to write one more sentense and here it is. Just have a nice day and please don't get a teacher if you have not bothe sides of the statement. thanks and bye.
