What is a teacher without his pedagogic skills? What is the use of excellent knowledge, if one dont know how to make the students listening and make them get interessted in te materie? It is much more important to relate good with the students, than know all stuff about subjects,even though both abillities should be needed in the job of the teacher. Teacher wich aren't able to get the students interessted shouldn't be teachers. In some case, we as students have the feeling,that some teachers just want to read their stuff down and dont seem to care, if anybody is listening or understanding the treated stuff. In the other case teachers shoud know her subject very good, therefor, they went to study it. I don't know, what I should write any more, because for me it seems really obvious, that teachers should carry at least both abillities with them after long studies of pedagogic (pädagogik) and their own subject. In any other case, the shouldn't have choosend the job of the Teacher.
