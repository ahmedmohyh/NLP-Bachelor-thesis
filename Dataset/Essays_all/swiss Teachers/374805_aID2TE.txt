Everybody knows the situation that the teacher tells the students to solve the exercices in the workbook. Suddenly, wyhle the class is working consentrated and silent, the teacher beginns to chat with some students. The class enjoys that chat and starts a conversation too with their neybours. Now I'm asking me, if this behaviour from the teacher is good or bad for the learnig progress of the students. Is it more important to have a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or to have one who has a great ability to relate well with students?

If the teacher often likes to chat with their students instead of leaving them solving their exercises, gives a better climat in the class and the students are always motivated and they enjoy the lesson with tis teacher. So happy students are also motivated to learn new things. This might give a better learning athmosphere. But you also have to say that this conversations during the workingtime disturbs the concentration of the students. So they don't learn much at school and have to do much homework. It is widely known that a student doesn't like homeworkso they often just copy them from their friends a cople seconds before the lesson. So you have no adventage of having a funny teacher who makes an enjoyable lesson, but he can not learn the students new things. A teacher who is taught is much better, if the students want to learn something. He helps them and he reminds them to do their homeworks. If they don't do them, he would make un unexpected test about the homework and gives punishements.

So if the students want to learn something, it is better for them to have a taught teacher, then a teacher, who proptheir friend.
