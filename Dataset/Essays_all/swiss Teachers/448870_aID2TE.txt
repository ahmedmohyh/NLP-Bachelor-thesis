Teachers are often in crossfire in case of classes with bad grade. In such a situation many state the question which abilities a teacher has to fulfill to be a succsessful mentor for his students. Is it the knowledge or social competences which make the perfect teacher?   
In this essay I'm going to explain why a teacher with the skill of relating whith students is much more effient and why students could even learn more from this kind of people, than of a just in knowledge superior teacher with lacking social abilities. 
If we want to learn something knew we have to listen. But listening isn't as easy as it might sounds. Listening depends more on speaking one than on the listener. So it a nessecity to be able to transmit informition in a intresting way. You can know everthing about a subject but if you don't understand how you can make listener keeping attention, your failiure is for sure. So even if the knowledge of a more social teacher is limited, he is able to bring the information in the heads of his students. Furthermore he is able to create a positve atmospere in class, which defintly improves the learn-dynamics of students. Such a teacher knows what his students think, how they feel, what they hate and what they like. He fights for the weaker students and knows when the students get the subject and when they are having know clou about the subject. 
Finally social abilities are as important as knowledge in future life. This abilities of socializing have to thaugh by a teacher with empathy. This empathy could result in student who really love to go to school.All in all I strongly beliefe in teachers who can relate with their student. You leanr by far and a way more as simply the subjects they teach. To give you a education who life really works beside to boring facts.
