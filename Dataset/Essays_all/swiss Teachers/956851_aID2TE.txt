Every student whishes the perfect teacher. But how should he or she be? Should he give homework? Should he prepear easy tests?
I think there are many aspects that make a good teacher. It is not only about the teachers knowledge or how he relate with students. Although these two points are the most important ones.
 
If a teachers knows everything about his materia but he has no feeling for his class and he is unable to teach them. The class will not pay attention and improve their knowledege. You have to create lessons interessting and keep the attention of the studensts up with differnet kind of stuff.  With a theacher without the skill to relate good with his students the progress of them is not that big as if there is a teacher with less knowledge but the ability to relate well with his students.
 
To be a good teacher you need to understand how students think and u have to relate well with them . It is really helpful for students if the teacher has a feeling for where the differnets students stay with their knowledege so that you can help them. An other point is that a teachers how is able to relate well with students creats the lessons better. But of course a teacher with all this helpfull abilitys has to have a sloid knowledege of his materia. Because if not he can't answer all the upcomeing questins of his students.

To conclude. I think as a good teacher you need a good knowledeg. Because he is able to answer all the questions without cheking his books because if he has to he wastes time of the lessons. But as well a good teacher has to relate very good with students. Because so he is able to cretae his lessons so that the students are makeing progress.
