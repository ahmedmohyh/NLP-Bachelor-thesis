Knowledge or friendship?

The main idea of teachers is, that they help the students to learn. So it's very important that the have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. If they make faults in class, every student learn the fault thing. I mean for what are teachers there, when the students would know more about a subject than him?
For every student learning is induvidual. Some kids can work alone very well, other students need a lot of help from their teachers. 
If a child for example isn't good in French, it helps a lot if the teacher gives you a good feeling. In my opinion if a teacher who gives you the feeling, that you can do it, even you had some bad grades, is a good teacher. 
Young childreen often need a person with who they can talk if they have problems or they need help in a difficult situation. Teachers can be a person like this.
That is why sometimes it is really important if a teacher's ability relates well with students.
The teacher has not to be like your best friend, but if you have a good relationshipt to him, learning is easier. Because if you have to go in a class and you absolutly hate the teacher, you would maby do not listen very well and then in the end you have some bad grades.
For me, to relate well with students and an excellent knowlede, both of it is very important. A teacher have to find a good middle, between this two things.
If a teacher can relate well with students, but hasn't an excellent knowledge, it isn't useful for the students. And in the other way, if a teacher as an excellent knowledge, but everyone hates him and doesn't listen to him, is also not useful for the students.
In my opinion a teacher has to have both things. Only with both things, the students can do good grades and have success.
