In school students always complain about their teachers. For some students the teacher is mean and they do not get along with him. On the other side ther are teachers, in whose lessons you absolutely do not know what he tries to teach you. So, wich teachers are the better ones?

It is always nice to know that today I have lessons with the teacher you like and otherwise he likes you too. You are relaxed and it is easy during the lessons. You also can talk to the teacher because he listens to you and the clima during class is good. Probably you did not have made your homework because you were on a party yesterday so you did not had time. But you aren't afraid to get problems with the teacher because you know he is going to believe you that you just have frogotten to do them. Also during class it is easy to learn something about the teachers life instead of doing math for example. And in the end there is an exam but you absolutely don't know what it is about. So that is the negative part of this teacher. You have no ideawhat you have learnt in class and so you have to revise everything for your own at home. It is also difficult when you change teachers. The new teacher thinks that you should know all themes and makes a unprepaired test. The result is probably not that good.

On my oppinion a teacher should have the ability to relate well with students but he also should teach you something. It is nice when your teacher is kind but he should not forget that we are students and we are in school to learn something there and not at home, although it does not always looks like this. He also must have control about the class. To resume: Teachers can be kind and well related with students but they still have to teach them right.
