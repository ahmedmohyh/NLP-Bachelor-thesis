Theachers - a difficult job

At the KZO there are theachers for every single subject. So they are spezialized on theire hopefully prefered subject. All of them should have an excellent knowledge of what they are teaching. But is that enough to be a good teacher?


If a teacher just tell the students the dry but correct theory, then there is a chance that they might not understand it. So the teacher has to explain it well, but also relate well with the students. Otherwise they might not be able to get the stuff. It is important that the teacher can help the students in many different ways, so that each and every student get the chance to understand the subject.

But even when a relationship between a teacher and a student gets on well, the student might not be able to understand it. And if neither the teacher really knows what he is talking about, then there isn't any chance to learn something correctly. The teacher has to have an excellent knowledge of his subject, otherwise he won't be able to teach it right. And a teacher who cannot teach something helpfull, can be as nice and well related, but it wouldn't make any sense to let him teach. 


I think it isn't a question that a teacher should have an excellent knowledge of his subject being taught. It has to be like that, so the students really learn something. But it's also important, that the teacher relates well with his students to be them a better help. 
It's a good thing if the teacher relates well, but it's as important as having the knowledge. I think that bouth aspect are very important for a teacher to can teach effectfully. One without the other won't work that well. 
If a theacher wants to be a good teacher, then he should try to include bouth aspects.
