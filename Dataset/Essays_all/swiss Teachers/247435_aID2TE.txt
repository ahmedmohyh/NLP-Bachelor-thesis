The case is, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge.

Of cause, on some point it is matter of opinion, but if the teacher is able to teach and the students have fun while learning they learn for life and not just to be good at school. The fact is, we students are more willing to leran if a teacher is on more or less the same base, so it makes is easier to ask questions and to understand. 
If the teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject but no idea how to talk about it in a low level or just a level we can understand his specialized knowledge is useless for us. We are maeby too anxious to ask questions because he could laugh about us. Sometimes a teacher who has an really good knowledge does not understand that some things which seem simple are difficult to understand for a beginner.

There are also some points against my argumentation. A teacher who has a good connection to the students but no knowledge or a lower knowledge than we have is also totally useless, we could think about him like we think about our classmates and we also treat him like this. To be a bit better than students is good, but to have no idea about the subject being taught makes us laugh about him and we have less respect than from an educated teacher. A teacher with an excellent knowledge blows maeby our minds but it also opens us knew things to think about. It is a challenge but when we accepted the challenge and when we are able to understand some things we are proud and we are ready to accept more challenges because of the absolutely welth feeling we have afer undd

In a nutshell: It is important for a teacher to have both, a good ability to relate well with students and also knowledge of the subject being taught.
