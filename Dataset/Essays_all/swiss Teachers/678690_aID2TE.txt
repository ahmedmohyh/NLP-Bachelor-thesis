I definitly disagree this statement. I find it more important, that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject, than realte well with students. It is also important but not so important like the knowledge, because when you go studying after school and you don't know anything about the subject, but you had a well relationship with the teacher, that doesn't help you very much. i find it not good when teachers speak and handle with students like they are friends of each other, because they are just teachers, who should teach a subject and not more. The parents also pay that their children can go to school, and for this the teacher schould have an excellent knowledge. I would find it unbelievable when a school would pay a teacher who has an realy bad knowledge about his subject but he can relate well witch students. That's not to job of being an teacher and for this teachers shouln't be payed for. His job is to do an intresting class. I find it already stupid that we should disguss about this topic, because the answer is definitly clear.
