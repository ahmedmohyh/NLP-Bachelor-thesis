"A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught"

After 12 years of going to school I already have experienced lots of different teachers.

I had nice teachers, who were really young and who cold relate well with students. These kind of teachers knew what interested people at my age. Maybe we didn't exactly do what the subject was about but everybody liked going to this class. Due to the friendly and cool behavior of these teachers, my class always had much trust in them. So we felt like the teacher understand us and they would really care about us.
Having a teacher with an excellent knowledge is really impressing. I do love going to classes where the teacher is able to reply to every question. I do love going to classes where the teacher is really passionate about his subject. But I can't stand classes where you have a really intelligent teacher who isn't able to explain his subject patiently and when he does explain something it's way too complicated for most of the students. It might be a cool lesson for the nerdy students who are really into the subject, but for the rest of the class it mostly ends up really boring. 

To come to my conclusion I think that it's really obvious that being a good teacher is more than just being nice. It's more than being a cool friend for the class. The ideal teacher is able to relate well with students but still can teach excellent knowlege of his subject. The ideal teacher is someone who's able to convince myself about a subject that  I never liked. So I wouldn't completley agree with the statement because I think the ability to relate well with students is as important as teaching excellent knowledge.
