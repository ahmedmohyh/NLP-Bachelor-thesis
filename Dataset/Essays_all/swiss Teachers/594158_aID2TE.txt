Do I agree or disagree with the following statement?

I think that it isn't easy to answer this statement with just one point of view. So my opinion of this statement is that you have to discuss both; the ability to relate well with students and the knowledge of the teacher. 

So first I talk about the ability to relate well with students. It is important that a teacher has this ability. Because if he would not have it he could not use his knowledge in class. It is harder to teach students when you can't relate well with them. So if a teacher can relate well, it makes more fun for the students and if it makes fun students learn more in class.  
But this ability to relate well with sutents is not more important than an excellent knowledge. Because as a teacher you have to know what you are teaching about tothe students. The students would remark if you have no idea what you're talking about. So it would be very hard for a teacher with little knowledge. 

So I don't agree with this statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important. Because if a teacher has no knowledge of the subject he can't teach the students good enough. It would be useless for the students to go in class because the teacher would have no idea what to taught, he just relate well with them and would be a "friend" for them. 
So my conclusion is that a teacher have to can both; relate well with students and taught them with excellent knowledge.
