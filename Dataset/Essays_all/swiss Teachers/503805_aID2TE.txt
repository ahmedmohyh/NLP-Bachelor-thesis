First of all I think that is very improtant, that teachers understand their stundents and can help them if they have to, because when the teacher can't understand their problems he can't make them away and the students are furius by the fact that nobody is helping them. In the other hand I think that an excellent knowledge is even more important for a teacher. Because it is pretty bad to understand nothing in school but when you understand things wich aren't true is even worse. I think when teachers have a good knowledge, someone in class will understand the subject and this student can help the others, eventhough the subject is very complicated. What I think is iritating students most is the fact, that when you ask a question and the teacher can't answer it. This makes problems e.g. when a student understands nothing and the techer is answering the question false, not only this student who gets nothing is iritated the whole class is it, because the teacher talk things wich doesn't go together. But when you have an excellent knowledge this problem isn't appearing at all and he needs no ability to relate well with students.

So I don't agree with this statment I think it is the other way around: It is more importent to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught (when you are a teacher) than having a ability to relate well with students.
The best thing would be, when teachers have bouth! But we all know that this has hardly any teacher at schools. But you never stop learning, so maybe one day teachers learn to have both.
