Relating well with their students would be important for both sides: student and teachers. Student will profit more from a teacher with a good comparison for its students than from a teacher who is only teaching his subject on the blackboard. Because if students have fun in class they will learn much easier than in a bad mood, and they will come to class instead of staying home. It's important for their future that most of the basic stuff stays in their heads if they go to university for example. And this won't happen without a good relationship between teachers and students. 
But on the other hand, the teacher has to be able to give an answer to all the questions students can have. He should be able to help where possible. And he must teach all the stuff which is coming at the final exams, because if not, it will be difficult for the student to get good marks and go to college. 

I think something between excellent knowledge and the ability to relate well would be the best. It's very important to have a good relationship to the teacher, but he shouln'd become your best friend. There should be respect from both sides, because without comparison or nice treatments the classes would be boring and won't be usefull. If the teacher hasn't enough time for his students they will suffer later instead of the teacher himself.
