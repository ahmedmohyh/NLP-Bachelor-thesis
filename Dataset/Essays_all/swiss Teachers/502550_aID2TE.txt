A teacher's ability to relate well with students is important. It is funny wheater the techer make a joke. This is good for the atomosphere. It is funny too if the teacher isn't from Switzerland because he have a funny accent and says funny thins like "atomische bomb" or "suppe" or "tabulieren" or "kompass" or "huhren" or "traslation" or "Spaghetti Bolognese". Do you like Spaghetti Bolognese? If the teacher eat Spaghetti Bolognese in the break the students can work better. Cause of the teacher is a Spaghetti Priest. He prays during the lessons in the Spaghetti language. For example Spaghetti ours in the heaven of pasta your Bolognese happens your empire coms... Isn't it very funny haha? It is funny too if the english teacher says:"this is really funny" without any emotions. So absurd. The knowledge isn' important becaus in university the study only the fascination about laughing. I know a friend who studied funnyologie. This is the most common studyway in the world. What is the best thing in the world? Laughing.
