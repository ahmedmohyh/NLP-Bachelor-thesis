It was monday morning and school started. The first lesson of Lena was biology and she really liked it. At this day they talked about genes and how babies with trisomy 21 originate. Lena was a bit confused about the name of this disorder so she asked her teacher why it's named trisomy 21. But instead of answering the question of Lena the teacher complimented her t-shirt and they started talking about clothings. At the end of the lesson the teacher said that Lena should do a research about the trisomy 21 and do a presentation on next monday because she didn't really knew the anser. 

In fact it's very imported for teachers to have a good connection with their students. The students should feel comfortable with the teacher and also feel comfortable to talk to him when he has problems or questions. If someone has any problem the teacher should try to understand the situation of the student and help him if he can. But there should be a line which the teacher should't cross. He shouldn't act like his students or try to be that cool teacher and don't give any homeworks or don't really care if they're listening in class because he's still their teacher.
If the students have any questions about the topic they're talking who should they ask if not the teacher? The teacher should know almost everything about his subject. If he doesn't know what should the students learn in school? Students go to school to learn something to reach something in life. But if the teaher doesn't have almost excellent knowledge about his subject than it's just a waste of time for the students to go to school.

In my opinion the teacher is obligated to have an excellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching. That's why we have teachers. They're here to give us some knowledge. If they don't know what they're talking about than why should we even go to school?
