Is it more iportant for a teacher to have the ability to relate well with students or to have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? The only accurat answer to that question is:"It depends." To be more percise, it depends on the level of english that is being taught and on the age of the students.

On the one hand the ability to relate well with students could come in handy for every teacher teaching any level, but on the other hand it isn't as important for a teacher who teaches older students. With older students the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught becomes more important. Because it would be emberassing for the teacher if some students had more knowledege of the subject than the teacher himself. Although it would be emberassing to have less knowledge than a student, it is also possible that a teacher would know enogh without excellent knowledge, meaning he would be better of having the ability to relate well with his students.  For younger students or kids it might be more important that the techaer is more socially gifted than an intelectual person filled with knowledge. Because kids need someone who is more sensetiv and understanding about who to teach all the kids, also the ones that need a bit more time to understand the subject. It will seem more secondary to a child how much knowledge his teacher has. Especially when we look at the fact that children don't have as much knowledge as the adults anyway. So to a child it might seem that the teacher knows alot about a subject even if he dosen't know as much as some other higher level teachers. 

Summarising you could say for low levels and young kids schools should hire teachers with the ability to relate well with students and for high levels and older students they should hire teachers with excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
