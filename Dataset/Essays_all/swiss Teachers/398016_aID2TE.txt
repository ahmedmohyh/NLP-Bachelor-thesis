Teachers

At first it must be said: I think the ability to relate with students well is one of the most important things a teacher must learn at University or in the "PH" here in Switzerland. An important Pro is that the students get more enthusiastic. This results in better marks and a higher level of education. If a teacher's behaivour is boring and he isn't able to provide the stuff in a good, interesting way, the students get bored and don't work with full efford. Of Course the knowledge of the subject is really important. Without, it wouldn't be possible to teach the students at all, but this must happen in a creative way. In turn there is a dangerous possibility, that the students mean that the teacher is their collegue. This is one of the worst things that could happen in a school because the students do not respect the teacher anymore. In that case it's really difficult to get back the respect of the students propperly. So The ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge of the subject should be on a equivalent level. Otherwise the students take advantage of the situation and behave inappropriately. For example, a teacher of mine used to be to lazy last year. He din't really prepare his lessons and didn't react, if somebody was on his mobile phone or computer. So the students assimilated this behaviour and didnt do the homework, didn't prepare for tests and didn't work at all until the Principal observed one lesson, so the teacher had to prepare his lesson carefully to* . At the end I must say I would rather be a teacher who doesn't know all things but is able to get well with his beloved students.

*pretend that he's prepared very well
