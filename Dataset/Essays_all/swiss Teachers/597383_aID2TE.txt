First of all is it important that a teacher show interest to his class. He shouldn't just teach like he's teaching a wall. And he shouldn't just make a presentation. He has to show to the students that he knows that he's teaching human beeings by involfing them. For example should he try to learn all student's names. He should conversate with them by asking questions to them and answer their questions, by honoring them and by giving some advice to them and by leading discussions with his students. It shows to students that the teacher recongise them and it gives like colors to the lessons. At the same time is it inportant, that he shows that he's the teacher, that he's the boss in the classroom. He has to show his authority from time to time.
But if a teacher just talks about his life or what happens to the world and if he just chats a bit with his students, they'll become bored by his lessons. Because all students know that they're in school to learn something. Even when many people don't like going to school, everybody is interested in learning new things and take some easier and harder challenges. So, if a teacher don't teaches the knowledge that students attend , they don't understand the sense of going to this lesson. As older we become as more do all thing we meet in our lives have to have a sense. For exemple if a class goes to a geometry lesson and the teacher tells them about what he's done this weekend, the students are sitting there and asking themselfs what they are doing there and if the teacher has any knowledge or if he's doing the wrong job. Because they are here to learn stuff about countries, volcanos and earthquakes. 
A very important point about teachers ist that they has a big knowledge in his subject. Tha's what they are learning for. But the way he teaches that knowledge to his students makes him a good or boring or bad teacher.
