We here in Switzerland must vistit school till the 9th year, it is obligatory wich is defenitly a privileg
and we can be happy about this. But we go to school to learn something we can need in our lifes and it is a must that the teachers have an excellent knowledge of their subject. After you have the mature it schould be possible to study everything you want. For example biology or english you should have achieved the knowledge in every subject to visit an university. Next to the excellent knowledge it is also important for a class to get on well with their teachrs. Beacause then you enjoy learning for this subject and you can recive succes.But even more important than the relationship between students and teacher is the knowlegd of their subject. If you have a teacher who knows absolutly nothing about his subject and you have the feeling that you are no ot learning anything in his subject it is defenitly the fault from the teacher. They have to learn you soemthing and not only get on well with you. If the teacher knows what he is talking about and seems prepared for his class then you enjoy this subject and you give him or her your attention. Also you are participate very good and all this points lead to a good relationship between students and teachers. So it is even more importent that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject than relate well with students. A good teacher know everything and is good related.
