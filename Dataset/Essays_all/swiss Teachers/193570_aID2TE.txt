Critics say the teacher's relationship isway more important that the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But is this really the case or does the knowledge of the teacher make the atmosphere in class? 

 If the students are happy to go that specific class, it automatically creates a better working atmosphere. The students also lay more trust in their teacher, feel way more comfortable and are willing to participate more in the class. So this results in better knowledge of the students, so therefore also in better grades. If the teacher is able to relate well with students, it will make the class much more interesting. 

But other people also have the opinion that if the teacher can not handle their subject, their knowledge, it will get very hard for the students to understand the subject being taught. Although the teacher cares about his/her students, it also very important to be able to teach the subject, otherwise the teacher will not be taken serious anymore.

I think that the connection between teacher and student plays a big role in creating a good learning atmosphere, but still do I expect the teacher to be able to communicate his knowledge in a way we all understand. Because that is why I go to gymnasium; to get the biggest general knowledge possible and to be prepared for university. A teacher's ability to teach shows in the balance of the excellent knowledge and being able to relate with students. As a teacher, you should be able to deal with both of ot.
