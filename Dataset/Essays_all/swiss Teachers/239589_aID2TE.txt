A teachers job is to teach students about a specific subject. In order to give the students a good education a teacher must have a good knowledge about his subject. But what if there isnt a good relationship between the teacher and the students? Maybe the teacher is not really interesting and boring in teaching the subject? Wouldnt it be better, if a teacher would have the ability to relate well with the students even if he wouldnt have an excellent knowledge?

A teacher wich knows almost everything about his subject is considered a good teacher. He can teach the students all they need to know. Because of his knowledge in this matter, he can teach very precisely and can bring in a lot of details. But it is possible that students dont really have fun being taught by this teacher.The lesson could be considered boring. A teacher wich relates well to the students can originate a good working and learning atmosphere. When the class has more fun participating in class it could be positive for creativity and efficienty. On the other hand it could be dangerous that the subject would not be taken that serious anymore. A teacher witch well kmowledge could prevent such things. Even when the subject is rather boring, the subject is taken more serously and it could be achieved more.
 
In my opinion having a teacher wich has a good relationship with the class is a better option. Even when a teacher with better knowledge can teach probably more precise, I think the other one can teach more efficient. When the students have fun with the teacher, they probably are more eager to learn about the subject. When theres a good lesson athmosphere its more easy for everybody participating and less exhausting.
