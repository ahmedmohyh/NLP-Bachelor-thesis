Before I agree or disagree with this statement one has to imagine two fictional teachers.The first teacher is beloved by all his students and helps them with all the  problems they have in life, but he has no clue on the subject he should teach. And yes, I just assumed his gender. The second teacher can help all the students with questions they have on the subject, because he's an expert. But this teacher wouldn't be able to understand the fears of the students and would also behave in a weird way in class.

So of course one would say none of this teachers should teach students at school, because the first one is incompetent and the second teacher is insensitive. Clearly a teacher should have the ability to relate well with the students and he also should have an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches. But I would personally prefer the first teacher I've listed, because in my opinion it's more important for a teacher to have a good contact with the class. I think that the ability to socialize with the class can't be learned, whereas every teacher with a graduation can learn a subject and become an expert on it.One the other hand one could also say that it's more important for a teacher to be an expert on the topics he should teach and being social isn't that hard and a teacher, who doesn't like students would've never had become a teacher. 

Lastely I would agree that both things are important for a teacher and none of the teachers I've listed are great. But I still think that having the ability to relate well with students is slightly more important than being a genius on the subject taught.
