The relationship between a student and a theacher is very improtant, for the feeling in class. 

If a student has not a good realations ship with his theacher, he can feel demotivated, or he thinks, that the teacher treat the students not fair enoug or he just not feels comferdent in class. 
But if a teacher looks furdermore of how the realationships between his students is, than to look that the students learn the things they have to, the students can not learn the thing they actually have to. Somehow it could be, that the student thinks that the realtionship between the student and the teacher is to near, in a negative way.  
Othrweise a teacher have to have social competenses with these he can teach the students. It is not enough for a theacher to just know the pedagogic knowledge, he has to practie these thing for explain the things the right way. 
If a teacher is to easy, the students think they are " the boss" then it could happen that a eacher can lost the control and lose the respect he gets from the student. 
If he just explain the things on his level, or can not really explain things for people wich never had heard of that bevore or ust can not hanle the contact with students his job may not be the best for him. 

Firstly I think, that bought is very important. A student does not only go to school, beacause of the things he is learning there, it is very important, that a student feels comferdent in his class. Secindly I think that he gets this from the other students and the teacher. If you can not really speak with your teacheR because you think you can say something false or dumb you can not feel comferdent enough. But a teacher has to give his knowledge to his students in a good way, I think he can get that only if there is a good feeling inn class.
