There are a lot of diferent types of teachers. Some are very strict and some almost too nice. But is it more important to relate well with students than to have excellent knowledge of the subject they're teaching?

I have mixed feelings about this. A big advantage of relating with the students is that the teacher can always know, how the students are thinking and what they are feeling. He can write a test so that he knows that the students can solve it but still are challenged to do so. And the teacher knows that the students have a life outside of school and don't always have the time to study in their free time. So he can feel when the students are very tired and not really able to work in school. Because of that he knows that it's not worth doing something very important that needs a lot of concentration that day. But is it really more important than the knowledge of the subject he's teaching?

If he doesn't have very good knowledge of the subject it doesn' matter if he can relate well with the students. Because he can't teach them the subject properly. But that's only an extreme case. But still, if he cares more about the students than about he's subject and that the students are good at it can be not that good. 

I think a combination of it would be best. A teacher has do have a very good knowledge of the subject he's teaching because otherwise he couldn't teach it with passion. But it's very important to know how the students are feeling and to not just ignore them. So I kind of agree with this statement. I don't think that he needs excellent knowledge but he defenitly needs good knowledge to teach it.
