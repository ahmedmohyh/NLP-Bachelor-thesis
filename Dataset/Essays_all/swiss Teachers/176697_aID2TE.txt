Knowledge or a good realtion? What is more important for a teacher. Should be the good realtion more important than his knowledge? or the opposite?

First of all, it is important, that a teacher make his lesson very interessting. If it is interessting, the students have more motivation to learning something. If the realtion between teacher and students aren't good, the students won't learn something. So the relation between teacher and students is important for the motivation. Also if the lesson is interessting and you like your teacher, you like the lesson (Fach) much more and your motivation for a good note is higher.

Secondly, if a teacher haven't a knowledge about his lesson, the student can't learn anything. Why should someone be a teacher if he haven't the knowledge to teach students? A teacher is a teacher because he have the knowledge and is able to share it with his student. If it is just about a good relation, everyone could be a teacher. So the knowledge is important to be a good teacher.  

In my opinion, both aspects are important. The teacher should have a good relation but also a good knowledge. Good relation without knowledge isn't helpful because the students have the motivation to learn something but the teacher can't share something with them because he have no knowledge. For me, the knowledge is a little bit more important. Because a teacher got his job and have to share is knowledge. He have no got his job to have a good relation with his students. If the relation between teacher and students is good, that's great but not a must have.
