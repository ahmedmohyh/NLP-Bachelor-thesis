There are many teachers who know almost everything about their subject, but they're just not able to teach their students that information. But there are also some teachers who go on very well with their students and are compared with other teachers in that subject pretty bad.

This statement has a correct message. It is useless if a teacher knows everything, but the students don't get anything at all, since their teacher is just bad in teaching. The students won't learn anything and will probably fail the test. I've already had such a teacher. He taught maths and like 80% of the class didn't know what was going on. I understood what he wanted to say, but I was one of the better 20% of the students. 

On the other side, a theacher who can relate perfectly with students, but not even he knows what he's trying to say, isn't good at all either. The students will know exactly what he wants to say, but what he's saying just doesn't make any sense. I have personally never had one of those teachers, so it's hard for me to think about how this could be. 

I think to be the perfect teacher, you have to be good in both, relating well with students and knowing your subject well. Obviously, the worst teacher is someone whose knowledge of the subject is really bad and who can only relate badly with his students. Comparing the one who can relate well and the one who has an excellent knwledge, I think that the more relating one is better. Because there, the students are at least taught the basics.
