I have the statement: "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught." 
I think it is true but of the other hand it is false. A teacher who relate well with the students can give the students more motivation to learn for that subject, they will be interessed in the subject and they are going to write better marks. But he hasn`t a lot of inforation in his subject, the students can`t make questions about the subject and they can`t prepare well for the test. That is the case when the students are well knowned and older, but what is whenn they just has to learn simple things?
For example someone in the high scool has to known more about math than a boy in the primary scool. Thats means that the teacher in the high scool has to be better informated in his subject than a primary scool teacher. It is not necessary to know phytagoras or sinus for the primary scool teacher, beacause he doesn`t have to teach those complicated things to a 8 year old boy. But in the high scool the phytagoras is basic everyone has to know him, the teachers too. A primary scool teacher doesn`t need a excellent kowledge about his subject for him is the relationship with the students more important. But that isn`t simmilar with a high scool teacher, he has to know allot more thing then a primary scool teacher and he has to have a well knowledge of his subject.
According to that i have to say that the sentence is true if the stutends are younger, but if not is the relation less important than the knowledge.
