To the question if a teacher is better with the one thing or with the other, there are many aspects to the whole discussion.
If students are faster or more advanced than others the teacher is able to give the students well thought through questions to an other subject or he is also able give them better answers if he knows his subject well. But all this doesn't helps a teacher if he can't explain things to students. Because just giving a lecture isn't enough. Even if he wants to interfere with the students but he isnt able to speak with them, they will loose fast their commitment.

If a teacher isn't able to talk to his students and he can't communicate with them it isnt't in the favour of the students to have any lessons witht that teacher. Because they can't follow him, or the teacher can't explain thing to helpf the students, because he thinks only in his academic way.

A Teacher is a good teacher if he can relate to what he has learned and has a good base of knowledge, maybe he can explain things in a different way based on his knowledge

A teacher needs to have a good balance between knowledge and the ability to relate with students, because everything else wouldn't be good for either party. If he is good in explaining things but he doesn't know much, he can't bypass a question and try to solve it from an other perspective. But also if he knows a lot but he can't interfier with students ther is no use of that knowledge either, because no one would take part in the lessons and he couldn'thelp the students to get along with the lessons. Also if no one would take part in the lessons he couldn't use all his knowledge and his plan for the year would be screwed.
