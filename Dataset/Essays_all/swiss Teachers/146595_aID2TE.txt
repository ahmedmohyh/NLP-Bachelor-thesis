A teacher has to have a lot of abilities in teaching his students. But what is more important? Is it the ablility to relate well with his students or the excellent knowledge of the subject? 

On one hand, you can say that a teacher needs to have an excellent knowledge, otherwise he is not able to teach his students. For instance, if a teacher tries to teach me something and I realise that he has no idea like me, I start to can not take him serious anymore. This leads to the fact that I do not learn from him and have to teach myself.

On the other hand, the ablility to relate well with the students is as important as the knowledge. As a teacher you need to build a relationship with your students. You need to understand how they are and how they learn in the best way. Once I came up to the fact that if I do not like a teacher I can not like the subject and at this point I am not motivated anymore learning something. Furthermore, the vibe in the classroom has to be comfortable and not strict and serious. Students have more motivation learning something if the atmosphaire is right in the room. You are not able to learn if you hate the person in front of you who tells you what you have to do. This is not working. 

In conclusion, I agree that teachers need to have a good knowledge nevertheless the ability to relate well with studnts is more important. Both sides the teacher and the students need to be open-minded to realte well with each other.
