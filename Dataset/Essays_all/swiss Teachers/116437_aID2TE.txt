In my oppinion, it's good to have a good relation with the students and to get on well with them, so they will learn all the stuff faster and better. But, to be able to give all the intormations to the students it's important to have a big knowledg, so that the students are also getting a big knowledge as well.
A teacher who is well-realated with the students can make the students more interested in that subject and they will be more concentrated during the lessons. In this way the teacher is able to go faster throught the learning goals or give even deeper informationts and it will getting more and more interesting for the students. I think, this way of teaching is also a pleasure for the teacher. But the point is, if the teacher has not that excellent knowledge, he or she will  not be able to give more or deeper informations to the students. The teacher will give them the informations he or she has but his knowledge, and so the varity of his informations, is not as big as the one of someone, who has an excellent knwoledge. So I think, for a teacher it's important to have a perfect mixture of both. It's important to be able to get on well with the students and, as a result, to have the ability to motivate them, so they will be interested in the teacher itself but also in the subject he or she teaches. On the other side, it is important that he or she is able to give the students all the informations and the knwoledge they will have to and are interested in. Because if they are intersted in the subject, they will have as much informations as possible and will have even much more deeper informations. But this will be only the case, when the teacher has the ability to relate well with students. So, as you see my argumentation is going in circles because, as you see, it is very important to have both of this two abilities and none of this two is better to have than the other.
