In kindergarden everything depends on the teacher but how is this in highschool? Is it important to have a teacher who can relate with the students or is it more important to have a teacher who has a big knowledge of the subject.
In this essay I want to compare those two theses with each other.

The first argument will definitly be that students are in school to learn something and not for fun. So if the teacher hasn't a excellent knowledege and education how should he give knowledge further to the next generation. It is important that the students learn as much as possible during school, so that they have a specific level when they suscribe to university. Even the parents may prefere this kind of teacher for the kids. Mostly on privatschools the teachers have to be the best in there subject and thrille the kids. What is not exactlly bad but for some students it is. The most importent thing in teaching is to bring the students over there own limits and that they get a huge knowledege of many different subjects.

On the other hand how schould students learn something from someone who can not bring the messege to them. 
If a teacher stays in front of the class and talks in high level language about how to write an essay and nowbody does understand, how will this be great. The students beginn to make noises, gossiping or just doning something else instead of being concentrated. But if the teacher can relate with them and knows how he can get the attention, they will learn much more. Even though he may not know as much as "the boring teacher". The students will be more intrested in school if the lessons are more creative-

In my opininon a teacher has to have both. He must have a connection to the students as well as a knowledge of the subject. It's really difficult to be a teacher or to find a teacher who has a knowledge, has interesset in his own subject and can bring the `Unterrichtsstoff` to the students.
