I ask myself what the teacher will do if someone asks a more complex question and he can not answer it. The students will sooner or later realise that the teacher is not as qualified for this job as he should be. And if this happens the students will no longer admire their teacher although he is sympathic.

On the other hand having a teacher that can relate to the every day student-problems is great. Because this can improve the willing of the students to study for his subject. The students will be more motivated if the teachers social skills are high and therefore they will show more interest in said subject even if the knowledge of the teacher is not the best.

Nevertheless I think that this issue of the teacher not knowing one hundred percent of the materil being taught shows that his moral standards are not as high as they should be. Because he transmits the message that the students are not worth it to get a better education.

Finally I think that the negative parts overweight. Because if someone can teach a subject although he does not have a knowledge big enough to answer the students questions shows that in the end the school is not really caring on what the students are being taught.
