I think, it's not that important to be able to relate well with students. The most important ability is being able to teach. The worst scenario you can have during schooltime, is a teacher who thinks, you can think just as fast as him. The biggest problem is a teacher who overjumps stepps during exlaining. When a student needs to follow a way too fast teacher, it easily gets complicating. Think about math. If the teacher, who learned mathematics at university, is too fast and leaves out stepps, it's nearly unpossible to understand or even follow!

But being able to teach already contains knowing the subject of the lesson. A teacher needs to be able to answer questions going deeper than the mentioned stuff during lesson. So it's not enough only knowing just as much as the student, an excellent knowledge is needed. A stundent can't learn from a teacher who needs to look-up stuff first before being able to answer.

As I mentioned before, a teacher has to realize that students haven't completed learing. They should understand, that it's hard sometimes to understand new subjects and themes. That's the only moment when teachers need to be able to relate well to students. Teacher aren't the students psychologists. Students need to learn from teachers. That's it.

So yes, I think an excellent knowledge is more important than being able to relate well, but it's sill not the most important.
