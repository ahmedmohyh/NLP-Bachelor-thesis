Teachers
What is more important to you? That a teacher without an excellent knowledge can explain well and you have a good relation to teacher or that your teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject but he is not always able to explain it to you perfectly. So this is the statement this essay is about: A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
It is important that the stundents understand what the teacher teaches them. So it might be important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject to explain it perfectly. But what happens if this teacher is not able to relate well with students? If the students don`t like this teacher there is a chance that they don`t pay as much attention as in other subjects. When this happens the students don`t always follow the teacher and because of this they might not understand everything. After one grammar chapter there is a test but most of the students didn`t follow the teacher and because of this they don`t understand the grammar and as a result they get a bad grade in the test. After this test there is the possibility that they don`t like this subjects anymore and so the start to care less about this one subject.
But if the teacher has a good relation to the students the students like the lessons of this subject and because of this reason they pay attention and get motivated to learn more about this subject. Even when the teacher doesn`t explain it into the perfect detail it is okay because the students are know motivated to get  good grades and because of this they learn more at home and when they have a test they get good grades because they learned at home. This is a success for the students and so they keep going on.
Because of this reasons to me it`s more important that a teacher can relate well with students
