The manner of teaching has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Nowadays teachers are excepted to be much more than a source of knowledge. Often the prarents put a lot of pressure on their children and as well on the teachers. 
On one hand teachers ought to know a lot and on the other hand they should relate with their students.

As a teacher it is important to understand your students thus you can help them with thei problems of every kind. Teachers are often role models in the students life so it is worth an effort to have a good student-teacher relation. A student who likes his teacher is probably more willing to study, beacause he relates studying with something good. As a result the student get better marks. The social abilites play nowadays an important role in this profession.

On the other hand a teacher should not only be somebody to have fun with he also is ought to be an expert in his subject. A teacher is responsible for the students education thus he have to know very well about what he teaches. The students future jobs may be dependent one day of what they have learnt at school. 

In the beginning of the 20th century nobody would have asked a teacher to be more sensible. His only object was to stand in front of the class and teach children which meant explanations of the materia. Today weak students are often taught individually and get extra help. I do not say that it is something bad but still I think a teacher should be objective and treat everybody in the same way. We often expect too much of a teacher. He should not be responsble for our social developement his only job is it to educate us in subjects as maths or history. He is a source of knowledge which we should fully use. Parents should not delegate their task to any teacher. It as a mothers and fathers responsbility to grow theri children up to well educated youg adults.
