The question of whether it is more important for a teacher to be able to relate to students or to have excellent knowledge of his/her subject is not an easy one. I would personally argue that both are essential to a good education. 
Of course it is vital that students get reliable information about their subjects from their teachers. A teacher should be thoroughly educated on their subject and should be able to pass that knowledge on to their students. This is where the ability to relate with them comes into play. A person may be an expert on a certain topic, but if they are unable to explain it sufficiently to the people they're trying to educate, it is useless. If I say someone is a bad teacher I'm not questioning their knowledge or their intelligence, I'm questioning their skills to communicate clearly and understand where I'm coming from. One needs to stay flexible and try to say things in different ways, so that different people may understand. 
I'm aware that this is not an easy task, but it is one that needs to be mastered for the sake of providing students with a chance of improving at subjects they otherwise don't like or find difficult to internalise. In general I think it's important that we learn how to treat other human beings, and form an understanding for them. If we can relate to someone, it's easier to imagine them complexly. Teachers should respect their students for what they are and the other way around. I've met too many teachers in my lifetime who have dismissed me as stupid because I didn't understand their way of explaining things, and when I told them so, they did not listen. If we are to better the education system, we should take a look at how information is presented to us and start working from there. A person who knows their subject in and out but can't teach it properly to other people is not a good teacher.
