The most people in school liked the teachers who were friendly and gently to the students, and hate the teachers which were strong and had a strict way to do there lessons. But from which type of teacher do you learn more?
The lesson with a nice teacher ends often very fast, because you like the way how he teach and so you forget the time you learn something, but you don't know that you do so. If the teacher is to friendly, than the students could los the respect.
A teacher who wants that his students have a excellent knowledge often use strikt rules and strong methodes. You have to work the full lesson and can't laugh any time because that is not that for what you are here in school. The only thing you do here is learning and learning and learning. Later the students know the important things because they have really learn them, but they hate their school time.   
In my opinion a teacher should be in the middle of nice and a strong teacher, because if he made every lesson like a cabbaret show, the students don't belive anymore in the teacher and don't see the real truth of what he is trying to say. In the other hand, when the teacher is like a little beast and the students are affraid of him and the success won't be very good. So if the teacher is strong but he makes sometimes a little joke or tells little story to help the students with the stuff, then they aren't affraid, but they respect their teacher. I think with this way and this optimal teacher the learning effect would be the best.
