I will discuss now a the subject, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

I think both talents are needed because when a teacher has much knowledge, but is not good in relating with student, it has no use, because she can't give her knowledge very well to the students, because it could be that she/he explains something that hard and in a high niveau that they can't understand anything. It also can be that the students don't let teach them because they don't like her or that she doesn't have them under control. In contrast, it also do not use when she can relate with them well but she does not have enough knowlegde. Because then the student wouldn't learn anything. Or not that standard that they have to learn. So a good teacher needs both a good knowledge and the ability to relate well. So she will also understand well with the students and teach them well so both sides could be fine. 

Me as a students know some teachers, who are very smart and have an excellent knowledge, but they have problems to pass it to us, because they don't know how to relate with students or also how to teach it to us, because sometimes the things are so clear for them that they don't understand why we don't understand it. 

In conclusion, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is equally important like an excellent knowledge and not more important.
