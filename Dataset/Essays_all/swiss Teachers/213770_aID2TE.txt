Sometimes in school, you had teachers that dind't realy know, what they were talking about. This was no good, because you didn't learn anything in this lesson. But wasn't it fun, when your teacher was nice, even when he didn't know anything about the subject. But isn't it important, that both causes are fullfilled. So do teachers have to know what they're talking about to teach something?
If you do not learn anything in school, because your teacher didn't know, what he was talking abut, that's not good since especcialy if it was important, you will have to learn it by yourself later on and that's not very funny. It will cost you time, that you could have spent for soething else and maybe, it costs you money, because you have take lessons in a private school. Probably you will never do that, because it's too much effort. Teachers that know what they're talking about can spare you extra effort later,even if they're not realy nice.
On the other hand were teachers that were really nice, even when they didn't know anything about the subject they were talking about. Having one of these teachers was also good, because maybe you didn't learn something about the subject but something for life.
But acctualy there is a third kind of teacher. these were the ones that were able to do both. Those were able to interact with the students on a good level and you had much fun whit these teachers. But they were also able to teach you everything because they knew everything. You were able to learn something very easy and fast.
In the end, I think that  a teacher should have the abitlity to do both jobs, teaching and relating with you, so that you will be able to listen to him.
