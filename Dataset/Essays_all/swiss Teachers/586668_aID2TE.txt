Most students like to have a teacher they can relate to. But is a teacher's ability to relate well with his students really more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

The advantage of a teacher who relates well with his students is that often the students are more motivated to participate in the lesson. Rather than having to fear giving a wrong answer, the students are in a comfortable environment where the teacher understands them.
Also I believe, that a teacher with the ability to relate wiht his student understands what his students find interesting and the learnning methods they like the most. This could make the lessons more intressting but also more fun for the students as well as for the teacher.
On the other hand, it is difficult when one has a teacher who can relate well with his students but doesn't know much about the subject he's teaching. It doesn't help when there's the afore mentioned comfortable environment where the students are eager to learn something when the teacher isn't actually able to pass on indepth information on the subject. As long as a teacher who has all this knowledge is able to pass this information on in a way that is comprehensible for the students, there is no necessity to relate with them. obviosly it is of no use if a teacher knows everything about the subject when he can't explain it.

That's why I, personally, don't fully agree with the described statement. I think the basis of a good education is a teacher who knows a lot about his subject. Of course there are teachers who are bettter in teaching than others but I don't think that a good teacher has to be able to relate well with his students in order to be a good teacher. However it can be a nice perk if a teacher, on top of having indepth knowledge on the subject, can relate with his students, just because it could make the lessons a bit more fun and a bit less boring for the students.
