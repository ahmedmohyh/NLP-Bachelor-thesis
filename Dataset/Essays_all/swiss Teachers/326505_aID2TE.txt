Teachers play an important role in every students life. Some you like, others you hate. But you can`t choose them so you have to spend time with them every week. But what is more imporant? Their ability to relate well with the students or their excellent knowledge of the subject?

If a teacher likes it`s subject and makes his classes interessting an different, the students will enjoy the class more. Nothing is more boring than doing the same for three hours every week. Like this you`ll loose your motivation and you won`t pay attention. Therefore your grades will get bad and than you loose even more motivation until you hate the subject.

Teachers are very intelligent and should know their topic very well. I think if a teacher has a small knowledge of his subject, this will cause problems. If you don`t know your subject very good, you won`t be able to explain it to your students. This is a big problem. If the teacher is very bad at explaining your marks will be very bad. The`ry only good, if you`re smart enough to understand it on your own. So I think teachers should have a grande knowledge but it`s not important that they know every little detail.

If a teacher is friendly and able to relate well with you, you`ll like his class more. Also hesmore likely to help you, if you have a problem or bad marks. I think it`s important that a teacher understands students and doesn`t give them tons of homework if he knows that they already have a lot of homework or many exams. Also teachers should not show if they like or dislike a student. They should treat all of them the same.

All in all I think the best would be to have a friendly teacher, whos classes are interessting and not boring and is very good in explaining.If you have a friendly teacher, who explains very bad, you`ll like his class but you`re marks will be very bad. In the end it depends on what you prefer; having good marks or having a friendly teacher.
