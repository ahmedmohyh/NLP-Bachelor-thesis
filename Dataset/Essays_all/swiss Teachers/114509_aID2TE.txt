A teacher's ability to relate well whit students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught

Ther are always teacher's you like and others you do not like. And of cours there are teacher's who are good and others ther are bad in explayn ther subject.
I think it is importand that the teacher  know wat he or she is talking about. And the relation whit his studends is not that importand because we are in scool to learn and not to get on well wiht the teacher's. We neat to respect them but do not be frinds whit them. And this is a big problem because the moast teacher's just want to have a good relationship whit the studens and forfet so to teach well.
But i also think that whit some people you get on really well and whit oders not and this you can see at the first moment. So some thimes ther is just a bad fealing and you can not do anithing tho change.
The teacher nead tho find a middle way. To gett on well whit the studens, but do not los his respect and also have a excellent knowledge.
For me a good teacher is social, get on well whit the stoodens but can also teach well.
To be a good teacher is realy hard and to be a good student as well. We both can learn alot from each other.
