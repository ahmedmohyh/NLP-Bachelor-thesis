I think you cant say whats is more importent beacause a teacher must have a mix between this to statements.
If a teacher doesnt have good know-how about his subject no one can take him serios. But for the studtens it is importent that a teacher have a good realtionship with us to learn us the know-how easily. I think if you dont like the teacher you automaticliy dont like the subject and if you dont like the subject you dont want to learn something.
I have a teacher he is very simpatic but he is to good to us and no one can take him serios. And then all make what ever they want and no one lisen.
Because this argument it is importent to have a good mix between the to statement, but I think you cant learn that you have it or you dont have it. I like teacher who are a bit strict but in the right moment funny. I like to learn with fun. I know that not every subject are very funny but if a teacher can to this funny you learn most. But the teacher must like his subject and belive that he can teacher it better then everyone.
