Essay: Do you agree od disagree?

In this essay I have to give some pros and cons to a specific subject. The subject is about the style a teacher teaches. 

First of all I will explain some arguments which favour the ability of a teacher to relate well with his students. If a teacher can cope well with his students, they are more interested in the subject he or she teaches. They also may prefer this subject just because of the teacher. A contra argument is, that they maybe speak about other topics then they should and then the students learn not as much as they should.
Second I will present also some pros and cons to the statement that it is important, that a teacher has an excellent kmowledge of his subject. A pro is, that he or she is able to explain everything. So they also can give the students a feeling of security when they have to learn something. A contra argument is, that they are sometimes so excited, that they forgetthat they are not alone. And then they maybe set their knowledge before their task.
 
In my opinion a good teacher has both. It is important that he or she can get along with the students, but also can provide his oder her knowledge. Then finally they got paid for giving their knowledge to others. I think it is also important that the students learn to cope wirh difficult teachers because in real life there are always people who are not one's favour and because of that i think it is not a real problem if a teacher is too sensitive or too engaged. But it gets more problematic when a teacher has neither the ability to relate well with his studdents, nor has an excellent knowledge in his subject.
