Students see their teachers everyday. They like them or they don't like them. There are diffrent types of teachers but for all students there are the same. What is the actual job of good teacher? Do they have to relate well with students rather than be excellent at their subject?

I think teachers have an important job in society. Because the students see them everyday for 8 hours. The teacher can decide what the students should think for that day. It's important to relate with students because they work with them daily. When you're excellent in one subject but no one understands when you explain it to somebody that isn't a good thing for teachers. Teachers should know how to explain compley things easier so that the students can relate. In the other hand a teacher who isnt't good at what he is teaching isn't good either. Teachers could teach them the wrong things and the students would believe it because they don't know it better.

I think both things are important. A good balance between relationship with students and a knowledge of the subject is what makes a good teacher. I once had a teacher which was excellent in mathematics but I didn't understand a word he said. It was really difficult for me to follow the lessons. But I also experienced the other side. A teacher who could relate good with students. Which made me feel very confortable in the lessons even if I didn't understand something. I could ask anything and the teacher would relate to me and explain it.
