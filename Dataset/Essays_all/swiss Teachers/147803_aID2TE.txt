In every school there is a teacher who doesn't respect you. It doesn't matter if you know the answer and raise your hand to tell it to the hole class, the teacher simply ignores you. The teacher could be an excellent teacher with  with knowledge of the subject but he could be unable to have a relation between the students.

The first point I want to say is teachers should have an excellent knowledge because if you have a teacher with poor knowledge of the subject you don't even learn something during the lessons and you're unable to pass the exams successfully.
Another important point is a teacher without a relation between students can't teach the subjects with an enthusiasm. The students could be bored fastly during the lessons and could go on doing other things exept listening to the teacher because the lesson is getting more and more boring without an interaction with the students incase of the missing relation.
The last point I want to tell is if the teacher doesn't have the ability to relate well with the students the students could start to hate him, give complaints to the school director so the teacher could get mental problems and could give up at his own or could get fired.

To sum up I want to say there should be teacher with both abilities and I know they're rare but the school has to hire such a teacher. This will get good education for the students they'll pass all their exams successfully and graduate.
