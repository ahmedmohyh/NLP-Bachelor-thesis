I don't think a teacher's ability to relate with a student should be more important than his ability to teach. On one hand students are very open minded in young ages and they will get some false impressions of teaching or how school should work. On the other hand the teacher shouldn't just be focused on his subject and don't want to relate well to his students. Because the point in teaching is that the student have to notice that the teacher has a great knowledge of his subject for taking him serious andthe teacher represents it well but also is interested in his students questions and answers. 
If he isn't interested at all students won't like him and are bad in his subject. As a student you are more interested in a subject if the teacher's interesting and makes the lessions interesting.


The teacher's connection to his students should be good but if his knowledge of the subject is bad he will have some problems to face. Students won't understand what he's teaching and always asking questions he can't answer or don't even understand because he does not know the student. This makes lessions very hard for a student they have to study even harder and always has to ask someone else because of the lack of interest which the student has to confront everyday. And a bad consequence of it is that some students will make bad marks because he doesn't understand what the teacher's teaching. 

In summary I want to say that the teacher should be able to find a balance of these two  abilities. You have to have a good relation to your students and also have an excellent knowledge of your subject to be a remarkable teacher. I
