Essay
In the first part in my essay i will write about the disadvantages when a teacher's ability to realate well with students isen't good enough. And in the second part I will write about how important it is to have a well realationship between students and teachers.

In myopinion is when the knowledge of the subject from the teacher is really good but the teacher hasen't a well relationship with the students then it's normal when the students hate this subject. And so the most of them don't learn a lot for this subject therefore their progress aren't big. It like a circle that never ends. 

But when the teacher relates well with students I think the point that he hasen't an excellent knowledge of his subject isen't so important because he knows always more then the stusents. So he can teach what he know and the students are happy. And for me that's the most important thing because when I want to learn more about this subject I could go to university later to study these. 
 
In conclusion I agree with "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being tought".
Because when I like the techer I like to learn
