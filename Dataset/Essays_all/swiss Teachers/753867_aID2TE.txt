In this essay I will discuss the following question: Is a teacher's ability to releate well with students more important than excellent knowlege of the subject being taught?

I think it is important that a teacher relates well with the students. If a teacher is rude and and unfriendly you can not learn very well because you feel yourself unconfortable.A good atmosphere is important for learing well.You should not have fear of your teacher to ask him questions.

If the teacher relates well with his students and if he cares about them, learning will be more interesting. In my opinion the students will be more active in the lessons if they like their teacher. So they get a better knowledge.

In the other hand an excellent knowlege is also important. We are not in school to get on well with the teacher. We are there for studying and learning things which are important for university.We have to learn something. If we relate well with the teacher but we do not learn anything that would be a disaster.

My conclusion is that both abilities are important. I think the relationship between students and teacher have an impact on the learning an knowledge. If the students feel confortable they will be more active and more excited of the subjects. Because of that they will have an excellent knowledge. The teacher should also know that he is there for teaching excellent knowledge instead of making friends. But he have to relate well with the students and he should have the ability to be friendly and careful about his students.
