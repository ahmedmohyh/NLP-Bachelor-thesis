Nowadays alot of students like having a good relaltion with their teachers. Some persons think that it is more important that teachers can explain and understand the problems students can struggle with than an excellent and hudge knowledge of subject. But is a cool understanding teacher better than a strict teacher with a big knowledge? 

Many stundents would immadiately say yes.They like having a good time at school and be able to feel okey with not knowing some things.Nevertheless there are students that want that their teachers have a big knowledge about the subjects. They want to hear as many interesting informations over the subject as possible and want to feel challenged. 

Often it happens that people start disliking subjects because of the teachers. They do not like the way teachers handle problems or they just do not understand the material used by the teacher.
On the other hand a teachers with a good relation to their students can motivate them to make a bigger effort and help them uderstanding. Also it makes sitting the whole long day in school funier.
It is not nice going to school and even having to be afraid not to know things. Eventhough sometimes this is the only way to get students to actually study things or learn things by hard. 

It is important to have a good knowledge and every person who is teaching should actually have it. Nevertheless it is not only important to know things but aswell to be able to explain and see where students often make mistakes. Also it is important to understand that not every stundet will be good at every suject.

In my opinion it is really helpfull to have a good realtion with teachers because it makes the school life easier. It is nice to go to clases in which you feel well even with not understanding every single thing. Nevertheless it stays important that teachers know more than students and it is good if teachers can also handle tricky questions on a higher school level.
