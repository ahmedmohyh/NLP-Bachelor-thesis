Many student struggle at school, with their marks but as well on a social level, for example by the communication with teachers. Currently it is still very contreversiable wheater those problems occure due to disagreements with teachers or as a result of comprehension problems in specific subjects.


It is very important especially in lower- and prepschools but of course as well in middle and senior schools to make sure the students get along well with their teachers and the other way round. The motivation of a student to come to school is much higher if they know that his or her teacher cares about them and will treat them nicely.And  as a return I am sure that most student then would be respectful and grateful as well. It is simply much easier to motivate students to learn if there is a good athmosphere inside the classroom. For example learn groups may support the understanding of a topic very well or in lower classes songs and games. If a teacher is able to relate to students personally it will be much easier for them to teach something as well, because they might be able to explain on a other level. Furthermore students may believe in their ability and therefore listen more carefully because they are convinced that they can understand something. 

But on the other hand there are many disadvantages of a deeper relation between teachers and students as well. The subject being taught could move into the background and topics might be left out due  to a lack of time, spent on personal conversations. Student might start to like the teaching form too much and  do not want to have noral lessons anymore. Evenmore it can be dangerous especially for male teachers relating too close to female students. The relationship could go over its boader.

I think that it is very important for teachers to relate well to student because they will be able to learn much better and it will be much more comfortable.
