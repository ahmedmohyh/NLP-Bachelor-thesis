A teacher has to be good in his subject, everybody knows that, but if he/she isn't really accepted by the students, he/she won't be able to teach them all the things he/she should. Scientist have proven, that the psychologigal relation between teachers and students is very important, because the tstudents learn everything easier with a teacher they like. In my case, I automatically do less for a subject when I don't like the teacher.
So I totally agree with this statement, but only if the teacher is competent enough to teach me the important things in his subject.
