I think a good teacher should have an excellent knowledge of what he is teaching. If he has not, he will not be able to explain complexe questions and he will not be able to fullfill gaps of his students. He should also have a good mix of being an authorian and talking nice and friendly with his students. I think you can not say which part is more important because they relate togheter. You will not be able to teach students without having the required knowledge and a bad atmosphere will not allow you and the teacher to work well togheter. The only way to figure out which part is more important is when you take a look on individuals. For some students a good working atmosphere is not that important and for others it is essential. Some students are better in specific subjects than others. The students who are not that good in a subject need to have a teacher with an excellent knowledge because he has to answer their questions accurate to fullfill their gaps. Finally, it is hard to agree or disagree with this statement because for me it is a very individual question. For me the knowledge of a teacher is more important than how good he relates with my class. But as I  have said it is very individual.
