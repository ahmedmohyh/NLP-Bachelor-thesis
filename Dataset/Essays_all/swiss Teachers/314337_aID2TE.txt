As a teacher there are to things which you should be good at. To have a good relation to the students and to teach them many things. Now what of these two things were more important? In this essay Im gone tell you about.

Some people say, knowlegde is the most important thing, because otherwiese the teacher could teach something wrong because he also didn't know enough about it.
If hes an expert he also could talk about otherthings which were not fixed in the hidiculum and than the students would be fascinated or they would understand the topic better.

The critics ague that teacher should have a better ability to relate well with students, because then the teachers were more able to understand where problems were and which style of lesson should be the right one for the students.
The students would also listen much more to the teacher if they had a good relation and would be more interested.

I personaly think that the mix between both is the best because both have very important points.
