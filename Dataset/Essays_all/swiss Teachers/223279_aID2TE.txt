As a teacher you should be able to feel with your students and understand them. Teachers should have a strong personality to teach as a respected, but not feared person. So if a teacher is not like a machine who wants the students just to learn the subjet, but also how to deal with others and how to work in groups, is a real teacher. Because if a teacher only give informations about his subjet there is no need that the sudents will understand it. Students need other people to help them understanding something mostly. If a teacher can be the person who give advices and explain his/her subjet with relate well with his/her students, than students will understand the teached stuff better. 
Imagine a highly intelligent teacher knows everything about the subjet he/she teaches but is not able to deal with students, he/she will not be respected and nobody will be listening to him/her, because they are not understanding what he/she is talking about because the teacher is not able to teaches his/her knowledge to other people. 

So it is clear I really agree with this statement, because the IQ and excellent knowledge is not the thing which matters if you are working closely with other peolpe. It is needed that you can work as a team and not feeling dumb because you do not understand the subjet because the teacher can not deal with students.
