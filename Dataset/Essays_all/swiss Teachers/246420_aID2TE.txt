Go and ask some student what they think about their teachers. Ask them how much 'good' teachers they have. Ask them when a teacher is 'good' or 'bad'.  A lot o Students will say their teachers aren't good, the class is boring and that the teachers doesn't know how to create a interestning lessons. So wthat we are gonna discus today is the question whats more important for a teacher: 
If it is the abilty to relate well with the studens or the excellent knowledge whats the key for beeing a good teacher. 

On one Hand you must say that the teacher passes a lot of time with the students. SO it is important, that his relation to them is good.  Students often respects much more a Teacher that get on well with the students. It is the first step for a good class.

on the other Hand you have to say that a class in which the teacher only tells uninterestning things, is really bad and boring. A teacher must have a good knowledge. If not the teacher wont be able to teach the students and give them interestning informations.

The Problem of that aspect is, that a teacher who doesn't get on well with the students often doesn't know exactly how to teach a class or make a interestning lesson. And there's the Problem. A Teacher can have very very much knowledge but in the end the important thing is how he presents it, in which form he gives the students the information.

I think both aspects are really important. A good teacher is a teacher which know how to create an interesting lesson has humor and gett on well with the students. A teacher that can also talk about some personal stuff with the students. But it's important that a teacher also know how to show authority and is able to show the students his knowledge. It's important for the students that they see how inteligent their teacher is. Then they will look up to him.
