Is it more important to realte well with his stundets as a teacher or to have an excellent knowledge about the taught subject? He has to teach his students a specific theme. His job is to find a way to teach it to the peoples that are sitting inside his classroom. He had to learn and creat a quite big knowledge to be able to talk about a certain theme. But a teacher with the greatest knolegde is usless as a teacher if he doesn't know how he has to work with his students.

You can't taught anything to anybody if you don't know anything about the theme you have to talk about. So it's really important that you understand what you're talking about. You should also be able to tell about complex backgrounds if they exists. Because it's a worse thing when you're talking to your stundets and you're not even sure about what you're teaching by yourself. 

You need to be able to work with specifc stundentns that got some problems by understanding. You have to structure your lessons in a way where all of your stundets are able to follow and understand what you're talking about. You're job as a teacher is to give knowledge to others. A teacher that can relate well with students will do his job way better than a teacher with the greatest knowledge. Because if you're not able to taught them they won't be able to know anything after the school. All of the invested time would be wasted. 

To teach about a theme you need quite some knowledge for sure. But it's more important that you're able to work with your stundents. A great teacher is person that is able to give knowledge to all of his students. The greatest knowledge won't help you as a teacher if you're not able to give it to others. That's why it's definitly more important that a teacher is able to relate well with his students than having a excellent knowledge about the taught teacher.
