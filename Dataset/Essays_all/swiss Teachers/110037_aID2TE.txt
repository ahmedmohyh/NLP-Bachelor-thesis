 I think it is nessesary that a teacher has a good relationship with his students. If a teacher is not having a good relationship with his students, the students wont have fun learning and attending class. And those are the two main parts about learning and improving. If a student never attends class beacuse he hates his teacher he wont improve. The students should really enjoy attending class and with that willing to learn. My personal best class are those, in which I like my teacher. Some of my teachers have a friend-like relationship with me, that is a huge motivation to learn and show them what I can do. I wouldnt want to miss a class. Whatever they say seems logical for me and I try to memorize everything of it. On the other hand I have teacher which I really hate. Everything they say makes me think they are stupid and thats sadly the truth. If I could skip without any consequences, I would. And thats something really bad and I cant help it. That way I wont improve in a class.
 But it is also essential that a teacher has knowledge about his subject. Because imagine a teacher telling things to his students that are not true. Then he completely failed in his purpose. A good teacher should know everything about his subject, because the more he knows, the more he will be able to teach his students.
 The "perfect" teacher should have good balance of both. A really good and wide knowledge of his subject, but also a good relationship with his students is essential. Personally I think I would prefer having a teacher, which I like and I enjoy working with, but isnt the best in his subject, then a teacher, which I hate, having a excellent knowledge.
