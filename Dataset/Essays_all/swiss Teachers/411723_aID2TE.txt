To excell in school, a student must mainly rely on themself. This is a saying that is reasonable but the question now is, how big of an influence the teacher has on the students results.
The two most important qualities of a teacher is to have the ability to relate with students and at the same time have enough knowledge to pass on. Is there a lack of one quality, the learning effect will not be as successfull as it could be.
If a teacher now for example is a well-educated physicsprofessor but has no clue how to bring it over to his class, the chance is small that it will be understandble for others than himself. With his physics knowledge he might be able to build bridges or spaceships, which is to be respected, but as a teacher, the other quality is almost more important. If the teacher is useless, students might as well read books on their own. 
In the opposite case, when the teacher really catches the pupils attention and is able to explain whatever the subject is, it at least shows them something new and maybe gives an insight to a before unseen subject. Thereafter the student can still go on their own and find out more if they feel the need to do so. 

Therefor I find it more important for a teacher to be able to relate well with students, see their strenghts and weaknesses and work on them instead of scaring them away by showing them a deep,dark,blurry world.
