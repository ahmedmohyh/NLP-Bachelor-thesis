I don't agree with the statement.
I personally think, that the "excellent knowledge", is one of the most important qualities, a teacher should have. 
A teacher's job is based on explaining students the meaning of a spesific subject. In order to do that, a teacher must know a lot about it.
If a teacher is able to teach his students in a way, so they really think that they did learn something, he is going to motivate them the most, to keep up with the subject or with school in general.
In my opinion, a teacher's excellent knowledge is a requirement for good lessons, because he is familliar with the subject and knows what he is talking about. Also, if someone has a great knowledge about a certain topic, this person has more or better ideas, how to explain it to someone, who doesn't know anything about it. The teacher knows, what the really important points are, and how he can make his students understand them as well.
I truely think, that it is important for a student, to work in a good atmosphere and to feel comfotable, while he is in school. If a teacher is able to relate well to his students, he can definetly support a good working climate and mentain a good relationship to his students. 
But even though, those might be significant points for a successful "teacher-student-relationship", I don't agree with the statement, that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than his excellent knowledge.
Because, if the teacher is able to make his subject attractive to his students, based on his knowledge, he can build up a strong relationship with his students as well. Because the teacher makes is possible, to share his passion and interest for the subject with the students, and this is going to connect them.
