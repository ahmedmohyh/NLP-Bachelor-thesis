I don't thinkt this statement is true. In my opinion the best teacher is the one who can relate well with the students and has a big knowledge about the subject her or she teaches. It is nice if you have a super nice and easy-going teacher but that's not why you are going to school. The students come to school to learn things. 
Even though I don't think the best teacher is one that can only relate best with the students I neither think someone is a good teacher just because the person knows how to teach the subject taught. 
Sometimes when I'm at school I wonder why some of my teachers are working here. It seems to me like  they don't enjoy what they are doig or seem to dislike teenagers ord children. Some of them are good at teaching things but I still don't like the class because I don't like how the teacher treats the students orthe way he/her teaches. So the best teacher is someone who knows how to deal with students in a way they don't lose the interest in learning or feel insecure. If a teacher makes me feel bad I immidiatly can't learn as good as I did before. A good teacher is someone who knows the subject, but also someone who is good with people. Especially with kids or teenagers. If a teacher is not mean or too strict I am not afraid to make mistakes and I can learn better. In my opinion being a teacher is not only about teaching a subject it is also about being a coach to the students and help them find there way in there lives. Especially with teenager. A good techer knows the perfect balance between being easy-going and being strict and teaching the subject well. If a teacher knows how to teach a subject in a fun way the students are open to learn and in my opinion that is all the magic it takes to be a good teacher.
