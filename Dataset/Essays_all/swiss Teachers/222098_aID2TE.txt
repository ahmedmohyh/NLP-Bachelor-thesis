We all know that in school there always exist these teachers which know there subject very well, but does not know how to act with young people in a accurate way. But what is more important: To have a teacher who have an excellent knowledge of the subject the're teaching or a teacher who has the ability to relate well with his students?

Firstly it is verry important as a teacher to know what you're talking about. Because you're task is to educat. And students can not learn from you when you don't know your themes excellently. 

Secondly to earn money as a teacher you also need the relevant education. So if you don't have the education you need or if you don't know your subject well you will be fired by the counseler. 

But as a third argument it can be argued that studetns can not learn from a teacher with whom they can not identify. They learn the theames, yes of course, but they just learn theme for the exam and not for theme selfs. And I personally think it is verry important to learn for your self because it is your life and your education and your base for your worklife in a few years.

So my conclution to this question is, that it is important to have a teacher who know what he is talking about but this is just the base. To be a good teacher you need the ability to relate well with the students you're teaching. And for me that is more important. Because if you have a teacher who know his subject but did not know every single thing it is even better thant to have a teacher who can answer every question but not know how to behave with students. So yes I agree.
