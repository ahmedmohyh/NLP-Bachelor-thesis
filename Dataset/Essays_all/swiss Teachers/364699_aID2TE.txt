To answer this question, we have to ask ourselves first, what the priorities of a teacher are.
From my point of view, a teacher must have the ability to explain the subject to the students, so that they can understand it and have the motivation to learn it.
There are many different teachers in my school and so there are many different ways how they explain their subject.
Of course it also depends on which subject it is, we can't compare maths to german or biology to history. But there is still a main way how to teach the students. 
But back to the question: The relationship of the teacher and the students is as important as his knowlegde. If the students doesn't like him because of his behaviour, the students will be afraid of him and won't like his lessons. They also wouldn't like the subject, even if the subject would be fun. The reason for this is, that when the students are thinking about the subject they simply make a connection between the subject and the teacher. 
But it's also the other way around: If the teacher doesn't know anything about his subject, he wouldn't be hiped by his students. Here I must say, that even if we complain about learning and how exhausting it is going to school, it's mostly exaggerated. 

Recording to these aspects, we can see, that both of them are in a way important. One thing depends on the other thing.
