Working as a teacher is not easy. Some students think you do not even know something about your subject and others think you can not teach them anything. But what is in fact more important? The knowledge or a teacher's ability to relate well with students.

A teacher's work is definated in teaching. That means they have to make sure that the students learn something from their knowledge. It is really necessary that the relationship between teacher and stundent is full of respect to achive this target In addition to this purpose teacher have to have the ability to relate well with students, otherwise they will not learn something and they will not spend respect. 

In contrast to this statement, is one of the most important thing that teacher have a brilliant knowledge. Otherwise the can not teach and do their work. A teacher without knowledge is like an computer wihout power - you can not use them. 

In my opinion is both very important. A teacher has to have the ability to relate well and also offers an excellent knowledge. It is really important that teachers find a way between how can the share their knowledge and having  a well relate wirh their students.
