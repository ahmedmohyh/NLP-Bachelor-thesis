In my opinion both aspects are very important. If I do not like a teacher I will not listen to him as carefully as i would to one that I like, because I think that if a teacher is able to explain certain things well and patiently the class will automaticly understand more of the topics he or she is explaining. On The other hand if a student does not understand what the person in front of him is talking about he will be easily distracted and will not be able to understand all of the things he will hear. In my daily life as a stundent I have to pay attention in every single hour that I am in class because if not, I will not pass my exames or i will fail my goals that i have at school. Having a good relation to a teacher helps a lot because how I mentioned before I prefer to listen to a person that explains things in an interesting way. It is obvious that if someone keeps telling you things in a monotounos way it will sooner or later effect yor concentration and you will stop listening carefully to what the person is saying, this does not only happen in school with teachers but it happens to me every time someone is talking to me independent of where I am at the moment. If my knowledge in the subject is very good it is of course much easier to understand the things the teacher is telling you. For example if I am interested in biology I will pay more attention to the words of my teacher than to those of my neightbour. 

So I would say that the two aspects are equally important, because if I do not like my teacher the chances of improving myself are as bad as if I would not know anything about the subject.
