Teachers

I'm stting here bored of everything. I have no intresst in listening to what this guy is talking in front of our class. I used to be interested in math, but now I can't stand it. I'm sure he is very intelligent and know nearly everything about this topic but is that not enough?

I think it's a question of how well the teacher relate with the students and how much he or she knows about the subect being taught. For example, if the students know more about the topic than the teacher does, they won't  learn anything even tough the students adore him or her. If the teacher has the excellent knowledge it depends on how he's teaching the stuff. So the statement is clearly false at the moment. Of course I understand how it was meant that's why I want to try to correct it a little bit so that I do agree with it. 
First it need to be said that it's very important that the knowledge of the teacher must be better then that of the students.Maybe you think that's logical but it's has to be mentioned. Second he or she must be able to explain everything to the students he is teaching. For that you need the knowledge same as the ability to explain so it's half relation to the students and half knowledge. Last but not least there is the point about the motivation of the students. The raletion between students and teacher has so much to do with that! If you like the teacher you like the the lessons and if you like the lessons you l like the topic so you want to learn more about it and that is what we all want.

In conclusion, I think the statement isn't that bad but it's not enough precise, so i can't really agree with it.
