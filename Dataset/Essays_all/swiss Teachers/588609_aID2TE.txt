At first I think this statement is right because the ability to relate well is so much more important then the knowledge of the subject. A student or a pupil learns better with a great teacher, someone who relates well and is nice to the students. 
The next argument for the statement is that all the knowledge do you have isn't useful when you didn't know how to give to the others. The word teacher say it, they have to present you the things in a way that you understand it and you learn something. Some teacher give only the theory and some tasks to solve but when you don't understand it and the teacher hasn't the ability to relate well, then you have a problem and the teacher doesn't do his job right.
On the other side is the teacher only a teacher and the only thing for teaching he need is the knowledge and the others things are less important, because the teacher hasn't to care for the students. He isn't responsible for the bad marks of the students or when they didn't come to the lessons. The student has the responsibility for his marks when they adult they never have some teachers who helps and gives better marks when they say: "you haven't relate well."
My own opinion is that both is important. I think we can't say what is more important, the ability to relate well or the knowledge of the subject. It is the balance between the both. A teacher without ability or without knowledge isn't a good teacher. The best balance is when the teacher teachs you and you, a student, understand it and learn something.
