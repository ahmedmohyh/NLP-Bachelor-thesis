Often there is the discussion if it's more important for teacher to have a good relationship with the students or if it's more important to have a good knowledge to teach the students. 
There are some arguments for the teacher to have a good knowledge in what he/she is teaching. The first is that the students actually learn something in school and they wont't be irritated or confused by the opinoin of the teacher because of their friendly realationship. So they won't be influenced because of the sympathy to eachother. An other reason is that we're going to school for learning something and not for just having fun. The students should also have the feeling that the teacher is an autority person and not their friend otherwise the normal state of the lessen will be changed. 

On the other hand a friendly realationship between the student and the teacher is a good start for having some interesting lessons. The stundents are often more likley to participate if they like the teacher and if they are interessted in the subjekt what often goes hand in hand with how good or bad the realationship is. School shoudn't just be learning it should also make fun because the sudents spend a lot of time there. An other point is that when they like the teacher even if they don't like the subjekt they probably listen more carfully to him/her and try to understand it so there will be a better learning than if they don't like the teacher.

In my opinion a teacher has to have both: A good realationship with the students and an excellent knowledge of the subjekt being taught. It's not bad if one of these two things are more shown when in the end non of them are shown too much. So if a teacher doesn't have a really good realationship with the students it doesn't automatically mean that he/she is a bad teacher who doesn't do his/her job the right way.
