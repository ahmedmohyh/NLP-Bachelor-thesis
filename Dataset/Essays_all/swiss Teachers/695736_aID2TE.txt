That is a difficult question and of course it's a discutated thing in our school. I think both is a very important part of being teacher. 
On one side, if the techer doesn't have the excellent knowledge of the subject, he isn't able to teach children or make them learning something. Of course he can have a good time with them in school, but that isn't the reason to go to school. The reason is to learn something, to understand the world better and to prepare yourself for the future. That isn't possible with an incompetent teacher. I think if someone has an excellent knowledge of a subject, he feels automatically more save. This feeling is important to teach. So i would say if you have the knowledge, you have the safety feeling and your ability to relatewell with students gets automatically better.
