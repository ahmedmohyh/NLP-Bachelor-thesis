What is more important? Understanding the subject being tought or being able to understand, relate and communicate with the students? 
 
Knowledge about the subject beingt tought is important for the students in order to gain confidence in their own abilities. Only a teacher with good social skills can pass his knowledge on to others in a way that the content is understood. Teachers lacking the social side of teaching will find their students demotivated and frustrated while theachers with the ability to relate to their students will find them more confident in their way of studying. Confident students will more likely be motivated to study on their own and inform themselves in other ways if the teacher does not provide the optimal literature or oral information.

In my opinion, teachers often teach what the school tells them to and don't really care about how the stundents feel or if they get along. It's a shame that many schools don't make enough effort in good preperation for teachers. Also, a teacher should be able to focus on both his students and the subject. 
Speaking of me, I can focus on the subject better when I feel understood and I can commusicate with my teacher in a way that makes me feel secure. Teachers who perfectly understand the subject being tought but can't relate to their students, often give me the feeling of being dumb and not good enough. A teacher should be able to accept an answer even though it might be not fully correct.
