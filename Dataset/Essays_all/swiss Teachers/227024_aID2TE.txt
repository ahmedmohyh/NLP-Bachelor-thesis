In this essay I'm going to write about the statemant: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
This first thing I want to say is: There are many people with a excellent knowledge of a subject, but this is not enough. If you have the knowledge it don't means that you can show everybody this knowledge and help them to understand it. Nevertheless it must be that this person is good in communicate with other people. What I want to say is, that there are many people with an other knowledge, the knowlegde of communication. This means not that you're a good teacher if you can talk free with evereybody, but I think that this is defenitly a ability wich teacher should have.
The perfect Teacher is someone who has both of this talents.You can't teach students if you have no knowledge neither if they don't listen to you. I have also Teacher's wich are very strict but also a kind of boring. For example in economy, I have a teacher who is realy boring, he's just sitting on his chair the whole time and giving us excerices and solutions. The thing is, that I'm not good in this subject, it isn't just because of him, but I think he could motivate us better. But there are also other types of teachers, the teacher who is walking around telling stories of his life, doing jokes and so on. I like this kind of teacher and I'm sure it is also because of them that I can concentrate better in their lessons.
My Opinion: I think that it don't work if there's a teacher with just one of those 2 abilities. I agree with this statement, that the teacher must have knowledge but I also agree the he needs to relate well with the students.
