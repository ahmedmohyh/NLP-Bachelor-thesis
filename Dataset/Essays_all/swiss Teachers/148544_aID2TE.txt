Well I personnaly think it sure is nice if a teacher knows everything about the subject he teaches but this isn't worth anything if he's fucking autistic, of course this is an extreme example but it might be possible. And if a teacher is able to relate to his students they could maybe have a little chat and he may even know about the latest trends and memes, and even if they are old memes, they're still memes rigth. And a little laugh or two comes in handy for good relations. But the students shouldn't be to friendly with the teacher or it could come to really annoying situations for example they don't see him as an adult but more like a friend and in conclusion they wouldn't pay the same amount of attetion. So in the end I would say that every teacher should be a little autistic and weird for the perfect balance of learning stuff and not paying attention.


Feel free to ignore the following part, there was some leftover time and I was bored so I started writing nonsense.

[So now I'm done with the stuff above and there are still 15 minutes left so I'll tell you about a story which I was thinking about.
In my opinion it's kind of sad and dramatic but this really depends on the person.

So I was thinkning about a story in which two siblings, a brother and a sister are being kidnapped and they are forced to do really sick stuff and I mean reallllly sick stuff. So one day after their kidnappers are done abusing them they go off to get some food and the two siblings are left behind but of course they're still imprisoned. So they use the situation to confess their love to each other and then one thing leads to the other and they start fornicating, then they get caught and it gets extremely unpleasent.

That's how far I've gotten with the story let me know what you think alright? Thanks.]

PS: I'm really sorry for the person that has to read this awful crap.
