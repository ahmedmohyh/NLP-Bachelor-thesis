The statement above leaves me with mixed feelings. I neither agree or disagree with it because for me, both aspects are important. As a teacher you have to both, teach a child and lead to their gratuation and care for the student as a human beeing and make their school experience as good as possible. Relating with the students plays a big part in that. For an adult it might be hard to understand what is going through a child. This obligates a teacher to get in the head of the student and one has to try seeing things from someone elses point of view. This is important in situations such as problems at home. In school teachers might only see bad grades and certain behaviour but in reality it is much harder for some than others. In such cases it is important for teachers to see the their students not only as a piece of meat, but also as a human beeing and a child growing up. Relating to a child helps them in situations that may be harder than they seem. Outside of privat problems, relating helps to be able to comunicate better with their students. For a teacher the subject thaught of cours is a piece of cake but one also has to see that it is completly new for the children. What seems logical to one might be hard for someone else. It is hard to look at every student individually but it is necessary for a better understanding. But overall i'd say that realting simply isn't enough. While it is important, it serves nothing if the subject is not thaught with enough knowledge. Only relating does not help a student to graduate and truly understand something. Even the most relatable teacher can not teach me something without knowledge and for that i'd say that having knowledge is just a little more important or about equal. Both of these abilities are necessary for a teacher to be able to educate children properly.
