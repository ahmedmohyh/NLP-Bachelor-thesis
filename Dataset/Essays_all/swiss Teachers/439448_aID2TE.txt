There are teacher who can relate well with students but this can lead to many problems and concequences. If a teacher does not understand the topic he is teaching this can have many consequences,too. In this essay I will refer to those types of teachers and furthermore argue on which type is even worse than the other.

If a teacher can relate with his students, it is possible that the students are more motivated in the lessons because he will tell them some jokes and they will have fun together. Another point is that they might be more active and make more progress in talking.
In contradiction to this argument stands that the students may think "The teacher will understand if we do not do the homework, because it was so nice weather." or something similar and then this occurs very often and they will not learn much in this teacher's lessons.

The other type of teacher is the one who does not have excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. Consequences of not having detailed information about a topic may occur later in life, when students are at university and have to relearn every topic they should have learned before. In this case, they will have a big effort to do. A positive part of having not so detailed lessons might be that it is easier to understand.

In my opinion, it should not be the case that a teacher is not a specialist in the topic he is teaching. It may be that it is then easier to understands but the consequences are just to severe and it can be risked not getting a degree. This is a really important point worth considering and in conclusion I say that it is way more important having a teacher who is capable of teaching the subject rather than having a teacher who can relate with the students.
