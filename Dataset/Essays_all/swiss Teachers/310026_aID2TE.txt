As a student i would disagree this statement. Of course the relationship between an teacher and a student is very important, but during a lesson i want to learn something and do just like smalltlak and stuff. This is the could be a problem when the teacher is to social and to silly that the students probably more chatting and gossiping during a lesson instead of working. The danger s therefore, that teacher care more about the social problems that students have instead teaching the subject, because of them the students are in the school. 
What is the necessity about when we've got at teacher with bad knowledge in his subject.This also mean that he's also bad in teaching it, to make it understandable. For a good relate we've got our friends and familiy. we coan go out and searching it. In the school the first priority has to be a "excellent" knowledge. We should twist the statement into: "After an excellent knowledge it is very important to have the ability to relate well with students"."
On point, the subject we are studying, has to be well teached and for all of us is clear, that a skilled teacher will prepare the students much better than an unskilled. A good relationship will underline his skill as an excellent teacher, who can motivate the students, wake up their interrests for the subject and form a lesson in which students like to go. This makes learning much easier. But at first there has to be the knowledge! Because motivation and interesting always has to be a part of your own, otherwise you wouln't go to school. Pasta!
