My personal experience is that it is extremly important for a teacher to know who he's teaching so he can assimilate his way of teaching. To ensure that he knows his class or his classes it is neccersary to have some kind of connection with the students. It doesn't matter if this is via personal interests or hobbies. What does matter is if his students do like his personality and even the way the Teacher teaches. 
I've once had a teacher who was more likely to start a conversation about soccer or tennis in English than teaching English vocabulary or grammer. For sure this isn't the teacher you want if your aim at getting better in the language itself but the conversations increased the interrest in the spoken language and the subject because it simpy felt good to have English classes. So what I wanted to show with the given example is that the attitude of the teacher and the way he is do have an influence on how much you like the subject.

Of course it is fact that for teaching a teacher has to have a certain level of skills in his subject so there is knowledge to give further. But on the otherway around being taught wouln't be fun nor would I be interressted in the subject if the teacher only tries to get as much knowledge in your head without recognise you would probably learn easier an better with a personal relation.

Personally, I think, based on eleven years of personal experience, that it is way more important for a teacher to realte well with his students than to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
