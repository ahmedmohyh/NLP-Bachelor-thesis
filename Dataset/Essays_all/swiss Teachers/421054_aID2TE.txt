A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

A teacher's ability to relate well with students is really important. Because if a teacher has an excellent knowledge but can't relate well with the students, the class won't get along with the teacher what leads to unmotivated students. In such a mood students neither like to go to school nor they learn something from the teacher's knowledge. But you also can't just get along really well with the students and know nothing, you also need to have a good knowledge about your subject. Otherwise you couldn't teach the students the right stuff. I personally think that a mixture of both would be perfect. You need to relate well with your students but also have a good knowledge about the subject you taught.
