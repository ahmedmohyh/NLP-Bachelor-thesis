Teachers

I think the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. My opinin is based on my experience from differences schools and teachers. Now i will explain my opinion.

When the teacher only teaches the theory to the class, its like reading a wikipedia entry. You don't understand it. But if the teacher is active with the class, like asking questions or doing some little excercises, I personally understand it better, because you have to be active in the lesson. The teacher which only teaches the theory, just talks and the students don't have to be active.They can just sit there and be passive in the lesson. When the teachers asks questions to the students, the students have to pay attention, because you don't want to be asked a question which you can't answer. When the student only has to write down the theory, he could learn the things from the lesson at home, but in an active lesson there is only this one time, where you will learn the subject and after that you have to understand it. Because of that, you will pay attention, try to understand it and be active int the class. The only negative point about the teachers with the active lessons is, that you have to understand it. If you don't understand it, you have to learn at home or ask other students.

All in all, I think that a teacher should relate well with students and should have a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. The teacher should find a the right balance of this two things. He or she should try both options and look which is better for him or her and which is also better for the students. Then only if the teachers and the students are understanding each other, the lesson will be a success.
