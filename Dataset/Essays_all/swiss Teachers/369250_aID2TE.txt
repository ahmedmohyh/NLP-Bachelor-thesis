A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Should a teacher have a good relationship with students and be liked, than be able to teach them a lot and give them all their knowledge? Their are two sides to this question and both of them should be heard. But first of all, I have to say, that this is my personal opinion and it can not be supported by everyone.

On the one hand, I do think that it is more important to have teacher that not only teach you a subject, which you may be fond of, but also make you want to go to their classes. In a lot of cases people like a class or a subject because their teachers are kind and support them. You will rather prefer going to school if your teachers can relate well with you and your classmates, than theacher which only tell you of and are not personaly interested in you. 

On the other hand, this teacher, who is a good person, can sometimes be a bad teacher. They will always being kind and will never give you the feeling that you should be stressed. It will be fine, until you have exams with diffrent teachers or your final exams and you will realize you don't have the knowledge for the subject. Some teachers, which don't have the knowledged, won't be able to answer your questions and with this you will not be able to expand your own knowledge. And some people do go to school for only expanding their knowledge, they won't want teachers interacting with their lifes. But they want someone who is hard on them and takes them a long way.

In the end one must say, their are so many diffrent students, which prefer diffrent teachers. Some would rather have a good person as a teacher and for them this will be a good teacher and others would rather have a person with a lot of knowledge as their teacher, that can teach them a lot about the subject, but the subject may be dry and boring for others.
