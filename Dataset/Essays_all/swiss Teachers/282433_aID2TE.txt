As both of the two parts of being a teacher are important I agree with the statement that it is more important for a teacher to "relate well with the students than excellent knowledge of the subject" and in the following parts I will explain why.
I will start with the ability to relate well with the students and why it is important. Firstly, a teacher does not need to have excellent knowledge of the subject to understand and teach the students. The duration of the school is often too short to go into the very detail. However if a teacher relates well with the student it is more comfortable and motivates the student much more than if the teacher is being hated by his students. Also to mention, if a teacher is being hated by his students, his excellent knowledge is not much of use when the students do not listen to what he says or are not interested at all. That means that it is crucial for a teacher to relate well with his students.
On the other hand however if a teacher does not have the knowledge that is necessairy to teach his students he could have the best relation with his students and they would still learn absolutely nothing. Second, if a teacher knows his subject very well he can make it much more interesting and his students are then also motivated to study. So knowledge about the subject is indeed important too.
In conclusion I agree with the statement above but although I think that for a teacer to relate well with his students is more important, knowledge about the subject cannot be left out and a teacher has to have good knowledge about his subject.
