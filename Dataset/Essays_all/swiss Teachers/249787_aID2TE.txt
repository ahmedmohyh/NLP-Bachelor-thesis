It is like always in life, it depends. In the pirmary school for example is this statement true. For students in the age of six to twelve years it is really important that teachers relate well with children. Of course you should not ingnore the knowledge of the teachers but in this age the children shoukd have a good relationship to teachers. So the students can learn to go on well with other kids, because the social life is really influted by school. School is more than school, it is also kind of a life school. You learn how to know other people and how you have to speak with them. I am sure that the teacher can influte this points and the knowledge of them is less relevant than the ability to realte well with students.
 
At age of 15 years to 20 years, like in the highschool, the tacher should focuse to teach as much as possible the students. When you still go to school in the age of fifteen you do not have to go to school in Switzerland. So when you still are visiting school, like the students do in Wattwil for example, you really want to study something. The teacher should his or her job and you should be enough old to rule your own social life. Stuff like bullying other kids it is more often in secuandary school or primary school, because the kids are still kis, but when you are older you are getting an adult and you should behave like an adult.
