I'm now six-teen years old, I'm in the 5th "gymnasium" in switzerland and I've got many different teachers which all are great but really whats the best one to improve in schoole and get the "Matura" without any worries.So thats why I wanna clear the question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt. Let's get into it!
First of all it's really important to get on well with your teacher because when you like your teacher and his way of teaching you will automaticly learn faster and easier but besides that you will also have way more fun in school. Some people or better said students will stay with the fact that you don't have to marry your teacher. He just has to give his knowledge easy and fast over to you. It also is a really interesting fact that a teacher who has the ability to relate well with his students is way more comfortable for the students not only because they have to spend a fair amount of time with him/her but also because they have a really nice socialconnection with theire teacher whih lets them listen more and do their homework. A teacher with excellent knowledge will help so much in understanding his explanations and you can ask him everything about his subject.
So now we heared some nice angles of sight on the subject but is the well related teacher or the one with the excellent knowledge the better or morelikely the more important one? My impression is that the one with the excellent knowledge really can make you improve the most allthough when he/she is to hard with the students, so they don't like the teacher, they wont be able to keep everything what he/she says in mind and wont study good enough. So to come to an end I think there must be a humanious mix between both species of teachers!
