Some people talk about the quality of a teacher. But it is a difficult subject.Is it more important that a teacher has a good relation to the students or that he has an excellent knwoledge of his school subject? In this essay I will discuss this subject.

First I want to talk about the relation between a teacher and a student. For me it is important that the teacher understand his students. Because when he for example does not understand the problem of his students during an exercise, he cannot explain it. Then he explain something very complicate and the students do not understand anything. So he should has an good relation to the children that he can understand what the problems of the students are and that he can explain the subject easy. So that every students understand it. 
Every teacher has meetings with the parents of the children. He should also can talk with the parents about the marks of students. Because the teacher is important for parents. Parents should have the possibility to talk every time with the teacher, if they have a problem at home or in school.
On the other hand also the knowledge of a teacher of the school subject is important. The children go to school that they can learn something. If students know more about an subject than the teacher it is difficult. So it should be sure that the teacher had studied his subject at an university or something else.

In conlcusion I disagree with this statement. Sure the teacher should have the ability to relate well with the childrens. But I think it is also important that he has an excellent knowledge of his subject. Because the students should learn something in school. I do not say that one thing is more important as the other. At the end a good teacher should have both abilities. He should have the knowledge of his subject, but he should also has a good relation to the students.
