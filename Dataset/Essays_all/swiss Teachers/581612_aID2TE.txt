Many teachers in schools don't communicate enough with their students leading to misundertandings or even misbehaviour of students against them. A teacher's ability to communicate with their students is arguably one of the finest skills they can have.

More students like their teacher when they are easy to communicate with. Someone who isn't ready to speak with their students does get hated more which might cause some other problems to occure such as mobbing the teacher or even psycological problems for the teacher. The students like teacher's more when they know how to communicate with their surroundings and even their classes get lot more entertaining. 

On the contrary side someone who hasn't got excellent knowledge of his subject shouldn't be a teacher. Well obviously you can look up for things if you are not quite sure but still a teacher with this kind of ability is rarely to see and also great to see. Misteaching might cause some problems for the students in the near future which would be a disaster for them if they fail to get through exams or even university. To be able to know his subject must be an ability of the teacher aswell.
 
To conclude my essay, I think I do kind of agree to this statement. A teacher who does communicate well with students is for me more chilled and easier to get through his lessons. But I also guess this ability is not more important than having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. The most important thing for me that a teacher can combining the two ability's, the part to communicate and the part of excellent knowledge. Having it done with passion and knowledge, creates a much more chilled atmosphere and also an exciting way of teaching his subject.
