First of all I'd like to say that I agree with the statement. 
In my opinion the relationship between students and teachers should always be harmonic, even though this can be difficult. It's a lot easier to pay attention and understand what another person is saying if you get along well. This is really important for small childern which are still getting used to school. Since this period in childerns development is really important for their future behaviour and attitude teachers should be careful on how they treat the kids. 
On the other hand we go to school to learn and to learn properly we need someone who his able to answer our questions and teach us. Obviously it is really important to have enough knowledge on the subject. An important argument is also the fact that universities and probably all other schools we can visit already expect huge knowledge, which is thought by other teachers.  
After going to school we have to get a job and today it is already difficult enough to get one. A good formation is certainly helpful to win against other people fighting for it. If you get the job it could be that you'll have to do something that requires basic knowledge a teacher in school should have thought you. 
In conclusion I'd like to say that it can be really difficult to get along well with your teachers, but their job is to teach you and this is only possible with excellent knowledge of the sobject.
