Teachers are very important people in our generation, because they show and help many children to live and to find their way in their future life. Now the question is, what's more useful for them? A teacher, who always wants the best for his students or a teacher, who wants that they learn everything.
In the following I'll show you examples, telling what's important and how the perfect teacher should be.

Today there are often many teachers, who just want to teach the students all subjects, but they don't care about their students how well they understand and how they feel about. For example when somebody asks a teacher about something he doesn't understand, then the answer is, that the student didn't follow the teacher. That's not fair from the teacher and the student thinks, that he won't ask something again, because the answer will be that he didn't listen to the teacher. So there can't be a good base for teaching and learning something.

On the other hand, there are everywhere many teacher, who just want to relax and have fun in class. For sure, it's not easy for students with a lame teacher, because they won't know enough in their future about the important subjects.But a teacher, who makes jokes and is having fun, doesn't mean, that this teacher is a good teacher. The students, however, will love these types of teachers a lot more, because they can also relax and have their fun. 

In a nutshell, the perfect teacher should posses a big and excellent knowledge of his subject, but also he should be well related to his students. The atmosphere in class will be a lot better between a teacher, who is like your friend, than a teacher you are enemies with.
