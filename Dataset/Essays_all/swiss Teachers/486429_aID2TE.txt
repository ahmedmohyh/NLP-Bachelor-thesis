In my opinion this statement doesn't make any sense, because the most important thing in school is mainly to learn as much as possible. 
A teacher who can relate well with students might be nice, but in the end you won't learn as much as with a teacher who has excellent knowledge of the subject, which is being taught. School is mainly here to get a broad knowledge and to be prepared for your career later on. In the end your knowledge will make up a big part of determining how your future life will be. 
On the other hand a teacher that can better relate to students will be able to explain the subject in a more comprehensive way and therefore the students might have it easier to understand what is taught. 
I guess it should be a mixture of both to make a good teacher. A teacher should be able to relate well with students and really see what their problems are and help them to solve the problems that occur. And second the teacher should have an excellent knowledge of the subject, to provide the best possible information to the students and really broaden their knowledge. 
Therefore I don't agree nor disagree with the statement and think both aspects should be equally important.
