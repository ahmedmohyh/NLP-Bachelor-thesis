Most students know a teacher who seems absolutely not to understand the subject he is teaching. In this subject, they are dismotivated and most likely not to pay attention to the teacher, even tough they think this teacher in person is really friendly and social. But is it more important for a teacher to get along well with his students as to be an expert of the subject that he is teaching?
In my opinion, it is very important for a teacher to be aware of what he is teaching to his students. I think a teacher should fully understand the matter of his subject, and he is only possible to give the students the right amount of knowledge if he understands what he is talking about. Also, if a teacher does not have excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching, how could he answer the questions of the students, and more important, how would he give extra explanations?
In fact, I think it should not be forgotten that it is also quite important for a teacher to have social competences and getting along well with the students. If this is not the case, students are likely not to follow the lesson and not asking questions because they are frightened, bored or just not interested.
In my opinion, a teacher should be a role model to his students in some way. This means that he should be able to explain his subject to the student in different ways until they really understand. This is only possible if the teacher is an expert in his subject. Also, his social competences are really important too. 
Finally we can say if a teacher is friendly and open-minded, but also knowing exactly what he is teaching, the students will automatically be more motivated to follow the lesson and participate. Both of it, social competences and excellent knowledge of the subject, are really important for a teacher to have.
