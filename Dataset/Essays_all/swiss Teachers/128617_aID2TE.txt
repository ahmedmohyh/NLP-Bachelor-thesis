Is the relation to the teacher important for the students? Is the knowledge of the subject being taught not even more important? These two questions will be discussed in the esssay.


A reason for the importance of excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is that at the end the students learn something in school witch they hopefully need for their future. That is why they have to attend in Class so that this had a big importance. 

Another thing that speaks against the statement is that the excellent knowledge should be the aim of every teacher. At the end of the day that is their job. That is what the teacher gets paid for so that this is what they have to do. 

My first argument to the importance of the good relations between the students and the the teacher is that when you have a good relationshio with your teacher the atmosphere is better. The Students aren't afraid to ask the teacher questions and so they can do their job properly. Also the time passes by even faster when the atmosphere is good. The students aren't bored so that they pay attention in the class. And as a consequence the results get better.  

Another argument with supports the statement is that when the raltion is good the students are so much more motivated for the subject. The reasons can be different for every student maybe they do not want to dissapoint the teacher or it comes automatically with the interesse for the subject, wich increses when you like the teacher. But altogether the students are more motivated and more willing to spent teir free time on the schoolsubject. 

In my opinion the good relation to the teacher has a higher importace because when the relation is good than the interesse of the students for the subject is even bigger so that the knowledge comes with it. So that when the relation is good you have both combined.
