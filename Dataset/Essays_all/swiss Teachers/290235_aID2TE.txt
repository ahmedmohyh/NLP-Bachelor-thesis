I agree with this statement. 
A teacher has to relate well with the students, like this the techaers have a stronger connection with their students. The point is not that the teachers have to give their knowledge to their students. 
The connection, the trust between them is morn important then anything. They have to interaktive with the students and they have to know their mentalltity.  If they only concentrae in their subject and don't take the students seriously, it's not worth it to call the person as a teacher.
For exemple in history class the teacher tells abut the Second World War and she only speaks out what she prepars and doesn't go on on the children. This will be very boring for the stundets and they won't concentrate on the subject. When the teacher interaktive with the class it would be better. 
The teacher has to know what a student wants and what are his problems. The teacher has to think like a stundet and has to be in the mind of the student.
