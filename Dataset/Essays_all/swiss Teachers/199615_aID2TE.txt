If you want to become a teacher you have to learn and study for a long time. For exemple if you want to become a primary teacher you have to make a matura and study for three years, you have to have big skills in maths and english or german. But do you really need this? In the following text I want to think about this.

A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
A teacher who can handle a class is better than a teacher who has a big knowlegde but can not teach and do not like children. For exemple a primary teacher who has a prof. in maths but he can not handle the class and he do not know how you talk to children. His maths professor is not helpfull for him because this class is learning mayby the little 1x1 and this can nearly every adult person. So it is about how to talk and teach to children. 
On the other handside is a teacher who has not got a big knowledge of the subject the teach not helpfull. Because if somebody raises a difficult question he can not answer it and he mayby do not know more than the students. We had a teacher who had not a big knowledge of his subject and the student who were interested in this subject knew more than he, that is strange to because then the other students do not ask the teacher when they have a question but the other students who have a big knowledge in this subject. 
But if you have an excellent knowledge but you can not explaine it will not help you because you can not give your knowledge to the students. 

I think as a teacher you have to have both, an excellent knowledge of your subject and a good use to children and youth people so that you can teach with respect.
