Students often discuss who`s the best teacher. But what do we call a good teacher? Is it someone who understands what young people want or someone who knows everything about the topics he or she teaches? 

For someone knows how to "handle" young people it is much easier to teach students. They don`t want to be taught like in the 50`s. They want do learn something new but also having fun with friends. Working in groups or discussing problems that are present are much more interesting for students than reading texts from the enlightment which they often don`t understand. Of course a teacher can`t always do what its pupils like but integrating them in planning the lessons is a nice way to create a good teacher-student-relationship. 
On the other hand a teacher has to have a great knowledge of the subjects he or she is teaching. If the pupils don`t understand what they should learn or don`t know what the topic is about it can be really annoying to be in school. In such cases they often aren`t motivated or don`t even try to work during the lessons. Therefore teachers should try to know as much as possible about the topics they are teaching. Questions from pupils often lead to spontaneous discussions which are interesting for both sides.

In my opinion teachers should always have a good relationship to their students. To understand what they like is sometimes difficult but it`s so important to make the lessons as much interesting as possible. On the other hand having an excellent knowledge isn`t less important than relating with the pupils. School lessons aren`t good if the teacher shows a lack of knowledge or experience several times during one lesson.

I think the mix of understanding students and having an excellent knowledge is the way a teacher should be. But we know too that the perfect teacher probably doesn`t exist.
