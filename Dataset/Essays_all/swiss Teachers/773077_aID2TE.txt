There are arguments for both possibilitys. 
On one side, a teacher who can relate quite well with students could be too kind to the students. For example, if he wants to do a unprepared test, and the studens say "no, we didn't understand what you told us last weak", he could think that he has been in this situation before and then he doesn's do the test. That would be bad, because the teacher knows what is good for the students,and he knows how they learn best, so he should also do it that way. 
The teacher could also lose autority, because he relates to well with the students. Maybe he acts more like a friend and tries to be cool. The students would like that, but they would't respect a teacher like this. A teacher, for example, who talks about videogames in the breaks, would be cool, but who would still think that he is a person with good autority? Nobody.
Otherwise it makes school much more friendly when a teacher can relate with students. For example, a teacher tells the class when the next test will take place. but the class already has another test this day. Now he has two possibilitys how he could act. He could either say the test will take place on the date he already told, or he says they will write it a week later. For the class it is clear which possibility is the better one. And if the teacher relates with students, h would also choose this one. Like this, everybody is fine. But if the teacher chooses the other one, the studens would be stressed a lot more.

So I think, even if it's less stressfull for us students if a teacher can relate with us, it is more important that they have a good knowledge. Not only about their subject, but also about how to tach well. In the end we are here to learn, not to have the easiest time thats possible.
