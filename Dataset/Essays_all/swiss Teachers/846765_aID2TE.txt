Students attending a school, whether it is a primary or secondary school, will always have at least one subject they can't really relate to and do not enjoy as much as other subjects. In that case, it is the teacher's responsibility to try and make the subject as appealing as possible to everybody. And exactly here comes up the question, whether it is more important to teach the students the knowledge the teachers have as exact and detailed as possible or to rather have the ability to relate well to the students?

The teachers play a huge role in the student's perception of one subject. It is a matter of fact how the teachers teach their students and what values they bring with them into the lesson. As a lot of subjects are compulsory, some of them might not be very popular with students as others. In those cases it is very important to be able to relate to students as a teacher rather than just stick to the school curriculum. If the teachers try to understand the student's issues and are willing to help, the students will feel more comfortable during a lesson and automatically learn more and soak up the knowledge.
On the other hand, students are attending schools for a reason: To learn as much as possible and to gain knowledge in diverse areas of science and language. Therefore it is the teacher's duty to teach and to give their excellent knowledge to students, even though some are not enjoying the subject. 

Understanding the students and trying to adapt to their abilities is a greater factor than to just be focused on teaching the knowledge of the subject. It will increase the knowledge of the students themselves as they are willing to actually learn something.
