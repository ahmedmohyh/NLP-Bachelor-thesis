To tought something to someone is a communicational human interaction. It's highly importend to realise, that the communication is what matters for success. If the teachers abel to relate with a student, the student will automaticly evolve motivation to work and learn. On the other hand the teacher in first, has to know what to tought. If the teacher knows the subjcet, it's easier for him to simplitise, wich helps the student to understand. But what is a teacher with perfect knowledge? Exactly, a computer. It is importent for the student to see that also the teacher's only a human being. The subject now may not be taught perfectly but the student earns a much more importent lessen in life: No one's a flawless machine. Wait. Doesn't that mean it is completly unimportant for a teacher to know his subject? Not at all. The student has to see that the teacher is not doubtless, not incompetent. Sure the teacher has to know his subject, but as importent as this is, it is importent to have the skill for human interaction. These two aspects are both as importent to be a good teacher, they have to live in a symmetrie, none is more or less importent.
