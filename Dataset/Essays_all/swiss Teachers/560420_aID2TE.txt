Teachers are very important for the students. Not only because they have to teach them something, but also as a contact person. That's why the teachers should have a good relationship to their students. If they don't, the students won't tell if they have any problems in any subject or with friends. In my opinion the teachers should have the ability to relate well with students, but that's not the only thing of a teachers job. The main thing in school is, that the students learn something. So the teacher has also got the job of teaching knowledge to his students. One thing is clear: The students go to school to learn something in a subject, they didn't know before. But is this the main or only thing they have to learn ih their school career? I think it isn't. We learn things about chemistry or geography, but we don't even know how to talk to people or how to cook. In my opinion the teacher should teach the students well, that they can learn something new, but he shouldn't be like a robot that just says what he knows and tests the students afterwards. The teacher should be a human as well and talk to his students like to other people. Sure, the students have to respect the teacher and not treat him like he is their friend, but the teacher should also respect the students and give them attention and make them feel save, when they need any help. In conclusion a good teacher should contain both. They should have a good relationship that the students can trust him and use him like a role person. But they also have to teach students the knowledge of the subject.
