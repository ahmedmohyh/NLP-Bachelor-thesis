Nowadays it's very difficult for teachers to handle with their students. The statement above said that the ability to relate with the children is more important than the knowledge about the subject the teacher thaughts.

I agree with this statement because of the following reasons: One of the main advantage is that the teacher can't tell the students what he should if they aren't concenrated and don't want to follow him during the lesson. An other argument is that the teacher can know everything about the subject he's teaching but it wont be clear for the students if he can not explain the subject in a way which can also understand the students. If the teacher hasn't a good relation to the childrens it could be that he blocks something in the brain of the students and even if he explains well they won't understand the subject.

Anyway, there are also reasons against this statement. For example that the teacher could be the nicest teacher in the world and have the best relation with the chilrens but if he doesn't know anything about the material he has to teach, how can the students learn anything? It would be very difficult for those students in the later way of their lifes in case they really hadn't learnt anything.

In conclusion, it's maybe the best if teachers can handle the sitution of their class or students very well but he also has to know about the basics of the subject he is teaching. But I think that it depends on the situation. For example a tutor at university should have an excellent knowledge about the theme he's teaching and doesn't have the best relate ability with his students. At primary school it's a complete different situation because there doesn't have to be much knowledge but an extremly high knowledge about how to handle with little childrens.
