A teacher`s knowledge of the subject being taught is of great importance, otherwise the students could not learn from him, and that would defeat the purpose of teaching. A teacher needs to be able to answer questions of his students, even if they are complex. 
Not knowing his subject well would lessen a teacher`s credibility, students wouldn`t respect or trust him if they questioned his skills or knowledge. 
If a teacher doesn`t understand what he is teaching, he probalby does not feel very passionate about his job, because if he did, he would want the best for his students, which includes preparing them for life by teaching them well, as they might need good knowledge about the subject for a job or further education.

On the other hand, it also depends what level he is teaching. As a middle school math teacher it probably isn`t required to have as much knowledge about math than as a professor at a college. Furthermore, having excellent knowledge does not equal the ability to explain well and make students understand a topic.
A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is an important requirement for his job too. If a teacher is disliked by his students they are less likely to pay attention or be interested and therefore they will learn less.
A teacher that relates well with students, is more passionate about their needs and wants to see them suceed.

In conclusion, I`d say that a teacher obviously needs good knowledge of his subject, but there are other qualities that make a good teacher.
The most important thing for a teacher to do, is to care about his students and have the wish to make them suceed. 
Students will benefit more from a teacher they have a good relationship with, even when he is not an absolutely all- knowing genius.
