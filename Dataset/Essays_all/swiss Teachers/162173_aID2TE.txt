Today many people think that it is more important that a teacher has a good relationship with his students than excellent knowledge. But it is right, that the relationship between students and teachers is more important?

On the one hand, it is an advantages if teachers relate well with the students because the lessons could be more pleasant than if they hate the teacher. Furthermore, if they relate bad, it is more likely to sleep or to rets at home during the lessons. Next, the climate of the class would be better when they have a teacher, who relates good with the students. 

On the other hand, it is not useful to have a teacher who do not know what he have to teach. To add, the students go to school to learn something and not to have a teacher as a friend. This friendship is dangerous when the teacher wants to sleep with a student. It is more likely that the student sleeps with the teacher if they are friends. Moreover, the danger is that the teacher will not know much about the theme. So why I have to go to school when the internet knows more than the teacher.

To sum up this question about the relationship between students and teachers has advantages and disadvantages. I think that it is impotant to have a teacher, who relates well with his students and also have an excellent knowledge. It is necessary that teacher know something about the subject, but when a teacher don not have a good relationship with the students, the students often get bored and they do not want to go to this lessons.
