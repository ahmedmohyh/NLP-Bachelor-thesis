The good thing about having a ability to relate well with students is, that you have a better feeling for their problems. You can understand them and they let you help. As a teacher it could be really difficult to work with their stundents, because there is a difference in age, knowlege and interesting between them. But it is important to know who is the teacher and who not. It shouln'd happen that the teacher has it too good with his students and makes their marks because of their friendship between eachother. 

But when you understand the subject you're teaching, you know many ways to teach. You know different ways to help the students and you don't have to relate well with them. But if this doesn't happen and the students don't understand the way you'r teaching, there can be many problems. Then you have to count on their friends and maybe a student has to take help outside of the school.

I think it is important how old the children are. When they are very young it is very important for them to have a good connection to their teachers. The young students have to trust te t.
When they get older and do most of the things by themself, they need a teacher who knows everthing about their subject. maybe the students got more intresting in a subject and want to know everthing about it. A teacher has to know the answers and sometimes their are difficult.

So I thing it really depens on the age of the children if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But when a teacher can both together, which is really difficult, he is a very good teacher.
