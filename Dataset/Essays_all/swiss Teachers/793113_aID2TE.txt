Every student prefers other teacher individually. This depends on diffrent things, maybe one teacher has the ability to explain the subject better as an other or one teacher knows more about a spesific subject. Anyway, there are diffrent teachers with diffrent abilities, so what is better? A statement says a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

In the one and, It is important that a teacher can realate well with students. Otherwise the students don't understand, what the teacher want them to show and learn. For exemple if a teacher trys to explain something but he explains it  in a very difficult way, so that the stundents don't know what he's talking about, the students are going to have very bad grades in this subject and this isn't absolutely the goal of any teacher.

In the other hand, a excellent knowledge of the subject is eccential. How can a teacher answer all the students' questions, if he doesn't know everything about the subject? For exemple a Teacher can't say: sorry I don't know why, I've never learnd that. This causes insicurity for the students and doesn't shows the autority of a teacher. Of course we're humens and can't know everything, but almost everythin's eccential for the subject being taught.

In my opinion it is more inportant to know how to relate well with the students than have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, so I agree with the statement. I'm convinced that the knowlegde is useless if he can't transmit it to the students. it is better knowing less and teach it very good, than know much but can't teach it at all.
