Is the knowledge of the subject being taught more important than the teacher's ability to relate well with students? 
Personally, i think so. Because students are in school to learn properly about a certain subject and not for fun. Obviously, they should not act like roboters and only be concentrated all the time because after all they are just human beings that need a lot of understanding and spare time. I do believe that it is important for them to have mates they can hang out with and that they should have teachers that can relate with them therefore also understand them but it has to reach a certain level after all. 
Actually if teachers would relate to them to 100 percent, they would not even give them homeworks or give them exams to do because, as we all know, they are clearly stressed with school, family and all kind of other things. After all, the teachers still need to teach them a few things because afterwards they still need it. It is not just about one test, it is about the whole educational problem it would cause, even though the stress rate of young people would go down. 
Honestly, it is still quite a good feeling when somebody has a teacher that relates well with the students and has the ability to cope with all of the student's problems but it is also stressful and tiring for the teachers that has to cope with them every day then. They would have to organise all their stuff all over again because of the exams that would be too difficult or the homework that would be too much. School is about knowlege and accomplishment and that is what our teachers need to actually teach us!
That's why i think it is more important to teach them the relevant things they actually have to know in the future and that are important for their education.
