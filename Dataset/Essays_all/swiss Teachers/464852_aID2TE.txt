In a lot of cases it's clear that a teacher doesn't need just knowledge about one topic to be a good teacher. He also has to relate well with students. So the statement is: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." In the following essay I will argue about this statement.
I kind of agree with this statement. In my opinion it is really important that a teacher can relate well with students because if he doesn't the students won't respect him. It's clear that a teacher needs excellent knowledge of the subject but just having knowledge about something doesn't mean that one is able to share it understandable. Also it is really hard sometimes to keep the students interest for a lesson. A teacher who has a good relatinship with one class has it much easier to learn them new things. Students are more willing to be active in class if they know, that they have class with a teacher they like. On the other side one can say that knowledge is important to because without any knowledge the students won't respect the teacher. That's true but just giving a lot of information about one topic at once, doesn't help a student because he could feel overwhelmed. 
All in all, I think it's important that a teacher has the two things, a good relationship with one class and knowledge of the subject. Neather without a teacher's knowledge a class can work well or neather without a teacher that can't relate well. To be a good teacher one has to relate well with students but not too well, because it is a risk taken that the students will see him as a friend and respect him less. So one can say that a teacher has to find the perfect golden middle between a good relationship with a class and having knowledge of the subject.
