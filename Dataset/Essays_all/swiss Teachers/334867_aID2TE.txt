In todays society teachers have to be able to communicate successfully with their students and they should have a perfect understanding of their topic. Both aspects are really important, but which of those two should be the more important one? In this essay I will discuuss wether the relationship between teachers and students or the teachers knowledge should be the main point.

Obviously, the relationship between those two individuals is crucial for the students learning process. Having a socially engaged teacher, students profit more and therefor have a grave advantage over others. Additionally, being close to the teacher might make the sdutens more interested and engaged. 

On the other hand however, teachers need a wide knowledge. A close relationship is not important if the teacher cannot teach anything because of his lack of knowledge. Yet, the school's standards should prevent the possibility of a teacher educating without having an understanding of his own expertise. Therefore, someone who is not fit subject wise can be ruled out of the discussion. Yet, the differnce between excellent knowledge and normal knowledge should not have a big impact on the students learning.

Overall, I believe that the teachers ability to relate with his students is way more important than his actual knowledge. It is fine for a teacher to be extremely skilled in math, but if he is not able to get his students engaged, the school should have no use for him.
