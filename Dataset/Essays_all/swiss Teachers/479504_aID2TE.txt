On the one hand I actually believe a teachers ability to relate well with students is very important because so the students are more motivated to be active in lessons and disscusions. I also think in general they are more willingly to work. Relating to students can also be very important for the teacher himself.  Of course he likes to teach the students he relates to because he has also more motivation to teach. If that wouldn't be the case he would think the students who dont't relate to him maybe don't like his lessons and so not-relating could have a negative outcome. If a teacher connects with their students he also know the class more and so he can maybe see if the class understands this theme or if the students needs more time to understand it.

On the other hand I don't think that it is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject because if the teacher has no plan what to teach and he just knows basic informations people get bored and the interest automatically sinks in the lesson. The students wouldn't be motivated to be active in lessons and disscuisons. I believe that if someone is very interested in a subject, a teacher who has a excellent knowledge is the better choice.

In my opinion it's actually the knowledge which is more important. A teacher doesn't have relate that much to students because I am in school to learn. I mean it's cool if a teacher has a connection to us students and that he understands the younger generation because this makes it so much easier for us students but in the end if you want to really learn and develop your knowledge you rather walk along the difficult path and gain more knowledge than taking the easy way and risk having a basic knowledge.
