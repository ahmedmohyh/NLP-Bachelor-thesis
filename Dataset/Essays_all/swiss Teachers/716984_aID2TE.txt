This essay is about the topic if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. This question is of great importance, since the answer influences the education of future teachers massively.

First about the reasons, why the ability to relate well with students is very important: The success of the students stongly dependens on whether they like the teacher and its lessons or not. If the students and the teacher get on well with each other, the students are more motivated to do an effort and are therefore more successful. Especially for the education of young students, the ability to relate well with students seems very important and may be even more important than the knowledge of the subject, because the things they learn are not that complicated.

Nevertheless, the knowledge of the sujcet being taught is of major importance, too. If the students distrust the knowledge of the teacher because the teacher makes an incompetent impression, the learning of the students is disturbed. Furthermore, there is a risk that the teacher tells incorrect things, which either confuses the students or they learn things wrong. In summary, one can say that the knowledge of the teacher is also highly important.

All in all, I believe that both the ability to relate well with student and the teachers knowledge of its subject are of a great importance to guarantee a good education. In my opinion, for younger students the excellent knowledge of the teacher is less important, because they do not learn highly complex things. Therefore the ability to relate well has a bigger impact on the success of the students. The excellent knowledge of the teacher becomes more and more important the older the students get, because the things they learn get more and more complicated.
