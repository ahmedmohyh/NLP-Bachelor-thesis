A teacher has to have excellent knowledge of a subject. Thats right, no question. He could not teach the students if he hadn't. But although I agree with this statement. A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
If someone asked me this question like two years ago, my answer would have been: "No, I disagree." Because the teacher in High School related very well with us students, so I didn't know how it would be if there were teachers who could not related well with students. But now I'm in the following situation: We have teacher that just don't care how we feel or if we understand the subject. They are mad when I don't understand something or when I ask if they could explain something again. They can't understand how I can not get it. They can't relate well with students. So I'm scared to go in their lesson and ask questions. But that's the teacher's job. 
They've studied a specific theme but I mean they also learned how to relate with students. And I'd rather go to a lesson whose teacher is kind. I find it easier to learn something if the teacher can relate well with us. I am more motivated to go to their lesson and after I am more motivated to do my homework or to learn for the test. 
And I do not say that the teacher doesn't have to has knowledge but I just say, it is more important to have the ability to relate well with students.
