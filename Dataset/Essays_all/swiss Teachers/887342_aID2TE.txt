Important or more important 

Here is the question if, to relate well with students, is important or if it's MORE important than excellent knowledge.

A good contact with the students is a need for a teacher, it's something that not every one has but those ones who have it, can maybe catch more the interesst of the students. If a teacher can relate well with students, they will pay more attention on his kurs and ,in this way, learnt more efficientlty. I think it's the first good point that a teacher muss have but is it really the most important thing? 

From my opinion, the teacher muss be able to talk about his stuff without interuption like a specialist, but attention, it mussn't become boring. He have to look like entousiastic, like he want to share everything he know with the sudents. If he's passionnate about the topic he's telling about the stundents will know that we know a lots of things and ask more questions.

I would say that the most important thing to become a very good teacher is to have excellent knowledge, so that he can answer every questions and do an interesting class to his students. That's the first ablility for ateacher to have, and at the second time comes the ability to relate well with students because if he know a lots but can't catch the attention of the students it's wouldn't be efficient. It' necessary to have both of them!
