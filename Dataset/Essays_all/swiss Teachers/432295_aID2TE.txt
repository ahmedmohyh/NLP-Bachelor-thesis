I think the relation between the teacher and the students is one of the most important things in the school. When the relation isn't good, most of the students are not motivated to learn something. But with the elan and enthusiasm of the teacher most of the students want to learn something and want to bring good results. The teachers can help the students to get over problems from the school but also from at home. When the teacher speaks a lot with the studens, not only from the school also from other things, for instance of the private life of the students, the raltion between the teacher and the students gets better and stronger. This is a very important point! The teacher should not only be a normal teacher who gives the knowledge to the children, he should also be a person, with which the students can speak. With a lot of conversations and talks the relation can become very well. On this way the students are more interested at the school and they are more motivated to make good marks.  
Of corse is also the excellent knowledge of the teacher a very important point because without a good knowledge of the teacher the school lessons can't be excited and the students can't learn anything. The school lessons are on this way very boring and the students are not motivated to bring good results and make good tests. This could be the reason why many of the students aren't motivated anymore and don't want to go to the school longer. I think for exciting and good school lessons both of these points must be given, but in my opinion the first point, the relation between the students and the teacher, is a little bit more important, because then the school lessons are automatically good and excited, when the well relation is given!
