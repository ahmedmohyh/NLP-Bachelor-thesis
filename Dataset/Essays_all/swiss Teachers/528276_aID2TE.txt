Everybody knows at least two different kinds of teachers in school: The nice teacher who gets on well with studens, and the super-intelligent teacher who just can not relate with students. In this essay I will compare these two abilities.

Mostly, teacher who can relate well with students can explain the subject very well. Furthermore, they also were in the same situation a time ago. The know their students well and see their problems. Also, they don't take things too bad if there are noisy students or daydreamers. Often, they communicate with the class in an excellent way. But sometimes teacher who are sympathic and nice aren't as qualified as other teacher. Moreover, they sometimes aren't educated on the same academic niveau.

Teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject often aren't the students favorite teacher. On the one hand, they do have got a high academic level and can help good students to improve by giving them extra exercises. On the other hand, they mostly are not able to understand the problems of bader students because in the eyes of this kind of teacher the bader students' problems are literally obvious. They do not understand what's wrong and think everything is clear for everybody, even though it is not. 

Eventually, I think it is better to have a teacher who can relate well with students rather than having a teacher with a brilliant knowledge. The teacher will explain everything clear and if you have problems, you can ask him and he well understand you and explain it to you one more time. Mostly, these teacher aren't dumb at all. Just because they don't have the same knowledge as the super-intelligent teacher, it doesn't mean that they don't understand the subject.
