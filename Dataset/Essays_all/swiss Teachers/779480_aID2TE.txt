Should teacher's be able to relate to their students or should they have excellent knowledge?

In classrooms today students meet three kinds of teachers: Compassionate ones, whom they love, and brilliant ones, whom they learn to love as soon as the stundents grasp how important knowledge is. Then there are the unspectacular ones, but nobody thinks of them and they don't have any special qualities. But which of the two first kinds are better?

The relateable teacher will always understand the students problems, thus making him/her feel better what still needs to be tought. This in turn takes the stress from students which are a little bit behind. The teacher might be witty making the lessons even more fun,. A compassionate theacher will always have an open ear aand listen. But theachers must have knowledge to.

Having excellent knowledge on a subject and especially in their specific line of work, makes it more interesting to listen to them, as they can elaborate more vividly. Especially if a theacher notices that a class is on getting along slowly then it might be agreat help beeing able to get out of the compulsory subjects. But again for this the theacher must relate with the students.

I think neither one quality is more important than the other,the perfect mix between them is ideal. I even expect theachers to have almost excellent knowledge on their subject, especially if they theach at a secondary level. A totally ignorant theacher every one will hate, but the only compassionate one will haveth esame fate because the learnt will be slim. But the very special theachers have their one ways anyhow, at thats the differance between good and excellent theacher. If you can pick the student up where they are, individualy and collectivly as a class, than the student will learn and love.
