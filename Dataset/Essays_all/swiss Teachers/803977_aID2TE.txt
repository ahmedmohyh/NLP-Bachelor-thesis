In general, I would consider the first factor, the ability to relate with students, more important than the other one. You have to like a teacher, because if you don't, you won't like his lessons and you won't be willing to learn anything. If the teacher doesn't have excellent knowledge about his subject, he can just use good learning books and stuff, so the student just learns it not as exactly as he should. But, if there is a will to learn, and the will comes with a good relation to the teacher, the student can always learn things about the subject outside of school. The knowledge of the student isn't always related to the teaching skills or the knowledge of the teacher. For example, we had a biology teacher who didn't know his material really well, but he still was a good teacher, because he was nice and interested in the material he teached us. We also have the opposite. Our french teacher seems to have really excellent knowledge of her subject, but she just teaches us things we don't understand, and if we tell her, she won't comprehend. So, she just can't think herself in our position, and because of that, she won't understand us. Although she is a great person and we generally like her, she can't see, at which level of difficulty she has to teach us her material. So, my opinion is, that it's way more important for a teacher to be able to understand us students and interact with us on a level that we all understand.
