Many teacher think, that knowing their subject as well as possible is the most important thing of being a teacher.In their opinion students are students , no matter if boy or girl, their job is it to share their knowledge. What the students think of them as a person, often isn't of much importance to them.

Ofcourse knowing what they're teaching, has to be correct, but that's not all it takes to be a good teacher. Being a good teacher means reaching out to the students and trying to understand them and what their needs are. If the teacher doesn't know what his students don't understand, he won't be able to help them where they actually need the help, which defeats the purpuse of being a teacher.

The teachers who care about leaving a good impression on their students usually enjoy going to work a lot more, because the students will be noticeably more willing to participate in class. The better the teachers relationship to students on a personal level is, the better their cooperation will be in class.

Sometimes it only takes a little change in attitude and the whole atmosphere is bound to change. If the teacher is too focused on his subject and on sharing as much imformation as possible, he is more likely to pay less attention to the students themselves.Teaching should be teacher and students working together to learn a new subject and to achive that, the teacher has to be able to relate to his students.

The perfection of the content in their lessons, isn't all that matters.Teachers should in general be more aware and put more effort in trying to relate to their students, instead of them presenting as much of their knowledge as possible. That way Students will be better at absorbing the new information they get, if they have a decent relationship with teacher.
