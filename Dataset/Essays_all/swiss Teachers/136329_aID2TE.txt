In the beginning of my discussion it is important to say that both, the teachers ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge are the most important ones. But I think, that its true,"a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" because a student like me or my whole class do want to get on well with the teacher. But if we dont get on well with the teacher we automaticly wont listen as good as if we are like friends with the teacher. A teacher is a human being and was once a child too, so they were students too and liked or disliked teacher as we do, so I think they should know how to act with children.
But a teacher who knows how to act but only has brave understanding about a subject he needs to teach is not good either. But no matter what, the teacher should understand the subject hes teaching about. And if thats not the point hes not a born teacher. If a teacher doesnt know how to teach, children wont learn as much because they tent to play with their hair or something because they are bored and they dont listen at all. But a good teacher will take all eyes on him, because students like listening to them.
So relating well with students is way more important, so that the children will learn something.
