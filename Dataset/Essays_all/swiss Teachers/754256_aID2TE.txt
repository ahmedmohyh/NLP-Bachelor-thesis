In my opinion both of these aspects are important. A teacher should be able to relate well with his or her students but on the other side he should also know and also be good at what he or she is teaching. But it reality I think that having the ability to relate with his students is far more important. There are so many teachers at high schools and professors at colleges that know so much about their subject and are so smart but simply aren't able to relate with their students and because of that aren't able to give or teach their knowledge to their students. Only because you have an excellent knowledge doesn't mean you can also teach that knowledge perfectly. Because of that I think its possible that teachers with less knowledge but the ability to relate with their students have a good chance of teaching far more than teachers with excellent knowledge.
Another reason why I think being able to relate with students is more important is because than students will come motivated in your classes and also in a good mood. Having a motivated and also an interested class in a class room helps improve the learning atmosphere and because of that the students will possibly remember far more than they would with other teachers. Being motivated and liking what you are doing is far more important. For me personally, in the classes where I like my teacher it seems far easier to concentrate, be motivated and interested. Because of that I usually also perform better in those classes.
