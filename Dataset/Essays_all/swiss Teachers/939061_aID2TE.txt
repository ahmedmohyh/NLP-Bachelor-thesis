A good teacher has to relate well with students but is it more important than excellent knowledge of the subject?
Imagine there is a teacher who is always making bad jokes about you and your english. He often told you that you're not good in english. He always critisize you for everything you do. He is never okey with that what your doing. How would you feel?
Probably you wouldn't like to go to the english lesson anymore.You won't have any motivation.You wouldn't find a reason for studying or doing something because whatever you do it isn't good enough. Imagine now a teacher who isn't that good in english. He has to look up for answers sometimes which he didn't knew. He hasn't a really huge range of vocabulary but he does his best.He told you that you're going to make it and if you need any help he is there for you. You could ask him whenever you want to. How would you feel about that situation?
Probably you would feel much better than in the other situation. You were motivated and pushed. You would feel confident and you would try to improve your english. You would gain more confidence with every lesson you would go to.And you're getting better and better. You wouldn't be ashamed and you would try to pay attention in the lesson.You would have more trust in him and you would accept his critism.
In those examples you see that if someone has a good teacher but he can't relate with you , you won't learn much.You also won't have a lot of motivation and the most important thing for school is to have motivation to do something otherwise you won't do it good.In conclusion a good teacher is one thing but the important thing is that he relates well with the students otherwise the motivation for studying and for improving isn't there and without that you wouldn't come far.
