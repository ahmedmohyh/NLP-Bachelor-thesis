Students and their teachers

Teachers have a paricular influence to the students. So it's important, that the teachers can relate with students. But is the ability of the teachers to relate well with students more important than excllent knowledge of the subject being? I want to investigate this question during my essay. 
First of all it could be an advantage if a teacher has a good knowledge of the subject being, because then they know the forces of every student and also can help them, when there are difficulties. But it is more important that the teachers know, how to help them and that they talk or give them like some safety and protection, because then the students will know, that there is someone hepling them and that they are not alone. 
A next point is that too much knowledge of the subject being could be also bad for the students, because then the teachers could have an antipathie to you and this is not very nice. 
I think, it is quite important that the teachers have a good knowledge of the subject being, so they can help them and talk to them. But too much knowledge might also be a disadvantage to the student. I think, it is more important that the teachers can relate to students and give them some safety and protection, so the students can have a good feeling and feel safe. It is important that the students know, that they can talk to somebody.
