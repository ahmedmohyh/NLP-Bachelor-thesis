In the essay I will take about the following statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". First I discuss some negative points and in the second part I explain some positives.

In the first part I talk about the negative view of this statement. One negative point is very universal. The teahcer should know something about the subject because he has studied this and the children should have the possibility to ask him some questions. Another argument which speaks against the statement is that the teacher isn't a friend. He is a respected adult who can't or shouldn't be on the same level like the students are. He should be a "higher" person and the children have to obey him. A third aspect is that the teacher is paid to know and to teach his knowledge to somebody. It's his job. 

Now in the second part I discuss the other side of the statement: the positive one. Firstly the children would be much more motivated for school and learnung if the teacher relates well with them. It makes much more fun to go to school and listening to the teacher. Another point is that it is easier to learn something if the teacher is motivated and has fun. He gives his happiness to the students. It is also easier going to school if the teacher likes them. Finally they would trust him more because they like him and the other way round. They are like "friends" in a way. The whole lessons would be with more fun and motivation. 

In conclusion it's important that a teacher gets well with his students but not too much. He has to hold his role as an "higher", respected person. He doesn't have to get in a role as a friend because then he loses the respect and his power. It's also important that he knows something about the subject he teaches. In the end I can't say what's more important because in my opinion both of them are important but not too extremly.
