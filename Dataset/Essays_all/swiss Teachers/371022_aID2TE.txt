It's important that the teacher knows well the subject which he is teaching. What is a teacher if he doesn't know the stuff he should explain to the students? It's a waste of time for the students and the teacher. Also the teacher would have to study for a long time if he want to reach excellent knowledge of his subject.

Its also clear that the teacher has to be able to relate well with his students. Because if he just knows his stuff but can't teach it it's also worthless. Let's take the example that a teacher who has studied 5 years physics and perfectly knows his subject begin to teach in a new school. He would try to explain the stuff to his students but they won't get it and they don't want to get it if the teacher can't relate to them. Also the lessons will be a chaos because none of the students will listen what the teacher says and they'll do what they want to do.

In my opinion its more important that the teacher can relate to his students than perfectly know his subject but can't teach it to his students. Lets take our English and Physics teacher as examples. Our Physics teacher knows the subjects taht he teach, but he can't relate very well with our class. on the other side there's our English teacher. He's a young and sympatic man who can relate well with us. But he also knows about his subjects so he's a good mix between excellent knowledge and a good relation with the students.
