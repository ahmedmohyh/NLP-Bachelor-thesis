A teacher should have a big knowledge but nobody can know everything. It's way more important that a teacher can relate well with the students. The students will memorize the informations from the lessons longer and that's going to increase the marks.

Nowadays, we have the internet and you can easily look up for informations in books. So a teacher doesn't need an excellent knowledge, he just needs to be able to search for good informations. He should be able to filter the right facts from the wrong facts. He needs a good to very good knowledge, but it doesn't need to be excellent. It's more important that he teachs interesting lessons. The students will be more focused, more motivated and more awake. When a teacher just tells fact by fact, the students are getting tired and unconcentrated. They will write bad marks because they won't pay attention at the teacher. Students are more likely to write good exams when the teacher sums up the facts and shows them a film or makes a Powerpoint. They will memorize informations way longer when they can see a picture to the fact. Not all students are the same. The teacher should connect with the individuals. He should have a small personal connection with every student. They will like him and also going to his class. If the lesson is longer than one hour, he should definetly include the students in the class. The teacher should give them talking exercises. This will help to keep the students awake and motivated. 

On the other hand, a friendly relationship could lead to students who think they are better than the teacher. The teacher would loose his function as a leader. A excellent knowledge of the topic would also mean more in depth informations. The students would learn more not common facts.

In my opinion, it's more important that a teacher relates with the students. I would be way more motivated.
