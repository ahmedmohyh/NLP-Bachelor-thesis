A teacher should be able to relate well with students, but rather than relate I feel it is more important to engage them. A teacher should get students to be excited about going to their lesson. For this to happen its important that students and teacher get along. But knowledge should not be sacrificied just to get along. 
When a teacher does not know their subject well enough they will not be respected. So even though they might be getting along with the students the students will use their lack of knowledge against them. In the end they probably rather dislike them as someone who can't teach them properly or well enough. So it is important that as a teacher you are well respected. 
Of course it is bad if your completely incapable of any social skill. Mostly in language subjects the teacher has to be very good at keeping the students engaged and interested. Here it is important  that the teacher can relate to students but not necessarily on a personal level but on the level of understanding that not every student understands the subject and needs a bit more help than others. 
So you excellent knowledge doesn't mean you can actually teach someone. Knowing everything is probably not something a teacher should be able to do. As it is rather difficult to teach something that you understand thouroughly. Sometimes it helps to bond with a class thorugh a question that neither knows the answer to. As a teacher you have to be able to show them how to get to the answer not just what it is.
All in all a teacher should not be a students friend because that will cost him a needed level of respect. He should be good enough in his subject that the students still respect him but a certain degree of not knowing something can help he teacher to relate to his students more.
