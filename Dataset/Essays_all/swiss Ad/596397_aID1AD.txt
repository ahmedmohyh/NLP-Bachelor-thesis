Nowadays there are more and more advertisements. Some are interesting and catchy while others don't really have a meaning and are bad for children. But should television advertising be allowed for young children?

Firstly television advertising can have vulgar topics, so it might scare children. For instance a game advertising about war.

Even though there are disadvantages there are also good reasons to allow advertising for young children. For example, it can help young children to understand difficult things. There are topics that can be explained in a playful way like an advertising. Some advertisements directed toward adults, adults themselves have a difficulty to understand, even though it has a simple meaning that children understand faster. Adults often think that there's a deep meaning behind but actually it's simple. 

In conclusion I disagree with this statement. If parents agree and don't want their kids to see it they should watch television with their kids and turn it off when an advertisement appears. If there are vulgar advertisements there should be a warning at the beginning of the video. Sometimes young children don't even understand if the advertisements are directed toward them. They just have fun and enjoy watching television.
