A lot of parents put their children in front of the television, to have some time for themselves. But what do the children see? And how does it influence them?
Children learn a lot by seeing and hearing. They want to do the same thing like they see. If there is an advertising, in that you can see a child playing and beeing happy, the child in front of the televison wants to play the same game. It influences children heavily. They ask their parents for that game.
But an enterprise wants to be successful and uses every possibility to be more successful. It's just naturally that they produce advertising for children. A teenager is also influencable and it's allowed to produce advertising directed to them. Every generation is influencable, where is the diffrence between young children, teenagers and adults?
Children cannot decide between reality and fiction. An adult knows that he is watching publicity, but a child doesn't know. 
An other fact is that children believe everything you tell them. If they watch advertsing it's possible that they believe in something that's not true. This can cause harm.
Children don't have any money, they cannot buy anything. If they want something, they have to convince their parents first. 

I think television advertsing directed toward young children can be allowed. The parents have to decide if they want to put thier children in front of the TV or not. They know that there is advertising. If their child wants something, they will know that and then they can decide, if they want to buy that or not. Because of that I think televison advertsing shouldn't be not allwoed.
