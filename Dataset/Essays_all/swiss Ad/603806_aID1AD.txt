Everywhere are advertiments. Mostly there are only pictures, but in television advertisment includes moving pictures. Parents who haven't time to play with their children put them in front of the TV all day. The advertiser knows that. With their clips they can influence this children.

Children who spend their leasuretime watching television see a lot of bullshit. Not only the advertising. Some series for children try to support the enfantil development but mostly they aren't really helpfull. The children believe what the television say is true and if an advertisment says that it is super cool to have this car they think their life can only be cool with this car. The one who complains about the advertisment directed torward childern are the parents. but if they don't let their children sit the whole afternoon in front of the TV, the children wouldn't even see the advertisment. 

If the children don't spend their time sitting in front of the TV,  advertisning torward children aged two to five wouldn't be a problem. The parents could also limit the TV time down to one episode so there wont be any andvertising.

The game producer ( not computergames!) has to bring his stuff to the people. The parents mostly buy their chilrdern what they want to have. The easiest way to make children believe they want something is television advertising. In the eye of the producer, this is the only way to sell their stuff then after the children saw something they want, they are telling it their parents and they are buing it.

In my opinion the real problem is that the children are spending to much time in front of the TV. I don't see a problem in the advertising torward children.
