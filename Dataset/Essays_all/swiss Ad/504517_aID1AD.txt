Television advertising wants to influence people and show them things that doesn't have to be reality. Adults and teenagers have learned enough in life to know the difference between reality and fiction.

Young children have got the problem that they aren't able to difference these two things because they are still learning about what reality is.
If young children watch television advertising, they get influenced by things that are even able to influence adults. The children believe what adults or children on TV are telling them. So if the men or child on TV tells them they need something (that's what television advertising is all about), they believe him and think this thing is importent to live.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young children is important for the marketing of these things. If parents doesn't want there child to get influenced by television advertising, they shouldn't let them watch tv. Children aged two to five shouldn't watch television not only because of the advertising. Televsion becomes something like virtual reality for them. It's like an other world. But the problem is that young children can't difference the real world from the world they see on TV.

So in my opinion you can't disallow advertising television directed toward young children. If there parents don't want there child to get influenced by things the child can't difference from reality, it's their own decision. It's not prooved that television advertising deal damage to childrens knowledge about reality, but it could have an influence.
