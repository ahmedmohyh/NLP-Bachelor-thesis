Television advertising toward young children

The statement above doesn't make any sense to me, because I have never seen any advertisement produced for children aged two to five. Additionaly I think that children at that age don't watch advertisement produced for them and understand it by 100%. Furthermore children aged two to five shouldn't be watching channels, which feature a lot of adverts and most channels for children don't show any adverts as far as I am concerned. Even if they understood the advertisements, it would be a better idea to show them those advertisements instead of advertisements directed toward adults, which might include adverts for alcohol and cigarettes.
So to conclude my "essay", I can't really disagree nor agree with the statement, because I am not informed about TV advertisement in general, neither about TV advertisement directed toward young children. I also don't know the behaviour of children aged two to five and how much they already understand if they watch an ad on TV.
