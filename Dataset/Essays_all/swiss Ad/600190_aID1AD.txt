Imagine a child. It is your daughter and she sits in front of the Television. Right now it is commercial time and they are showing a commercial of the newest barbie doll. They show the barbie in a beautiful pink car and everything looks so real. The girl who is playing with the barbie seems to be it's best friend  and they talk about their holidays and do lots of entertaining things.
I think in this example it gets clear, that the commercial was not very realistic but your daughter really believes, that this barbie doll will be different, than all the others she already owns. She  wants to have such a friendship and that is only possible with this barbie doll.
On the other hand, the advertisement gives the girl some ideas of stories, that she could expierience with this barbie doll. Her fantasy gets some thinking boosts. And if the parents give the right direction to this fantasy, maybe the girl will have much more fun playing.
An other thing is, that the commercial seems  to have some prejudicies, because it is a girl who plays with the doll. Boys maybe would also like to play with barbie dolls, but if you only hear barbie doll together with the expectation that girls play with them, a boy will not play with one on his o
I think a TV commercial can have negative aspects like, that the child believes all the promises, that the advertisement tells and it can be very disapointed if it gets the product and realizes, that it can not talk or it does not even move or drive a car. The parents also play an important role in helping the child understand the commercial and having the right expectations about the real product.
