The problem with such kind of advertising is that the children getting manuplated very early. In this age the child just sees the advantages of the product. The Child isn't able to realise that the advertisment just want to sell his product. The argument of the statement is that we have to protect these children from this manipulation. 
But the counter argument is that if the parents allow their children to watch TV at this age they can't complain if they getting manipulated. Their are also diffrent advertisments for older children in the television wich could influence the young children.

My personal opinion is that it is very difficult to see the diffrence between an advertisment for older children (aged six to ten) and the younger children. So how can you forbid this advertiment? I think that this is not possible. So it should be the parents who regulate the consum of TV of their own children. I don't think that you should put your four year old child in front of a TV because the child anyway won't understand anything.
