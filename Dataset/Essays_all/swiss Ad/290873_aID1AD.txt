Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I believe that we should let them build their own opinions on things. At that young age, children are very influenceable and pick up lots of things from their surroundings. Although that is an important part of educating the young, advertising in the media is often not very truthful and is aimed at other things. 
One important point that speaks for this statement, is, that children should not be spending their childhood wathing television. They should be outside playing with others their age. Therefore there is no need for such advertising. Outside in the real world you can learn so much more and live through real life problems while playing. Nothing can replace the experience we get while trying new things out by doing them, seeing it on a screen is not the same thing. 
Another aspect is that nothing can be gained immediately from brainwahsing children. Most of us have seen an advertising of some doll or toy as a child and wanted it. We begged and begged our parents to buy it for us because all our friends hat them and we also wanted to show them off. On television the toys look shiny and colorful which are attributs that most children adore. Seeing these things, one can`t help to be jealous and that is how companies try to make children influence and convince their parents to buy them things they do not need. 
So instead of experiencing new things and making memories in the real world, a child is supposed to watch television and during commercial breaks sees the advertising. However in my opinion, there is nothing to be gained by it. Advertising directed toward adults influences the person direclty. You yourslef can make the decision to get the product. Advertising for children is indirect and making children greedy. They do not realize what is truly important in life and will want things that are unnecessary. Therefore I totally agree with the statement.
