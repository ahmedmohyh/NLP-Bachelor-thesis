There are a lot different positive and negative points about television watching children: 

In general I think that children in the age between two and five years shouldn't watch TV at this time because at this stage of live it is very important to play a lot outside, for example in the field or forest or to play games which you can touch with your hands. A lot of studies have shown that kids who began watching TV so early weren't very clever in their future. The reason for this is that you don't have to think a lot while you're watching a film or serie. You just have to watch.

Another point against telewatching kids is that they should better read or look at books and pictures in it. By doing this they have also the possibility to let their parents explain different objects which are still unknown for them.

A third and last argument against "TV-kids" is that if they start watching television so early, they often will have the need for this "activity" in their future.

But there are also some very positive arguments for TV-kids: For parents it is very easy to let their kids do something while they can do their own job. The two to five years old ones are mostly happy to be in kind of "dreaming world" for some hours. Last but not least there exists also a lot of films and series where the children can lern something about themselves, their environement and the earth.

Well, at the end I'm still against TV-kids in this age and that's why I agree with the statement.
