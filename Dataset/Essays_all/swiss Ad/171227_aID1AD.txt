Young children are very easy to manipulate, which many advertisers take advantage of. Colourful commercials with loud music and fun settings are everything you need to get an infant's attention. But is it fair to take advantage of a small child's impressionable minds? Nowadays many parents will sit their children in front of a tv in order to get a break. The young ones sit quietly, easily entertained, while seconds ago they were having a temper tantrum. It is an easy solution that doesn't require much effort. 

Many times as a child I remember wanting the useless toy advertised on tv. My father would always reply to my wishes with scorn, well knowing that I would lose interest quickly. Today I know that he was probably right. 

Advertising is unacceptable in many cases, for children as well as adults. Grown ups are just as easily manipulated as children, but we just do not notice, since it is done in a more sublte manner.
