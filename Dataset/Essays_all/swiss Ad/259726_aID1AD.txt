Everyone at the age of two to five watched television. We looked cartoons, sports etc. Our parents did not allwoed us to watch televison when the programm is +18. But after every serie there is an televison advertising which is allwoed to person over 10 for example. Now the question is, schould televison advertising directed toward young children aged two to five be allwoed or not?

On a televison people advertising a couple of items. The aim is to sell these products. If an young child watch these products and they like it, they claim on parents to buy this. So the parents get nervoused by their children. 
A nother Point is that young children follow everything what in televison is shown. For example it shows an drink advertisting for sports and you can do life danger things, the child would try this danger things. 
The last adventages is that an child can change his attitude with worng televison advertising. The child is on an age to be grwon up with good attitudes. So televesion advertising can change the childs mind. 

On the other side there is a one plus point. There are also advertisment which is usefull for the child. For example there is an advertisment for the drink Evian. It is showed when people drink water they look younger. Children want to be young. To drink water is also good for health.

In my opinion televison advertising should not be allowed. I think a child should be grown up with parents and not with the telvesion advertisung. A parent should give the child the future and good opinions and not the televison advertisments. I think there are more disadvantages than advantages.
