Watching television is a thing everybody does these days, from young children to pensioners. And it's a normal thing that, while watching television, we are confronted with advertising. But what if advertisement confronts the youngest of us? Can we allow affecting children with these advertisements?

For many people television advertisement is just a nuisance that comes with watching television, they either change to another channel or do something else untill their desired program starts.But children may not understand the whole idea of advertising. If they see something that looks fantastic on television they maybe want to have it too. They can't know that the things they see may not be as marvelous as they seem. However, one could say that kids aren't just influenced while watching television. In stores for example there are a lot of toys and stuff presented for the kids. A typical example is at the end of your shopping tour, when you want to check out, there are always those sweets and chewing gums presented right in the sight of the little children. In the end everybody gets confronted with those advertisements and everybody copes with it differently. The parents may have to keep an eye on their children too and teach them not to believe everything that the people on television say is true.

In conclusion I think one can argue whether or not children get influenced through televison advertising too much. The parents can still forbid theit children to watch television if they are sceptical about those advertisings. Television advertising aren't a thing I would support but I can't say it is so terrible that it should not be allowed either.
