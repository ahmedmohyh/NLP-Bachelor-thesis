My question is: Can a 5 years old child understand what an advertising is? or How they get information about that? Since the 20 century, the world has been changing in many ways: in electric, scientist, politics and more. I'm agree that many young children use mobilephones, television or other electric stuff. On the other side the advertising has been grewing up and many stors or factories are depending on advertising. 
If it had a law that children in aged two to five not be allowed to watch advertising, the television would change in the programm. In the fact, people who works by the television wouldn't send advertisement because they can't control which guy are watching TV.
An other problem is, young children can't understand what a meaning by an advertisement excactly is. If they wanted to buy something because they saw this in the TV, the parents could decided to buy it or not. Children can't buy something allone and normally, they don't have the money for this.
But one problem has advertising. Advertisement about leisure activities like diving or swimming in a river or something other dangerous is for a young child a new experience to do this. Children want always to learn new things. I'm afraid that many accidents like this in the world has passed.
In the end i can say I'm disagree with a law because many people depending with advertisement and parents have a jop to look at their children what they do. In one point could change the TV-Programm. Channels for children is that a good idea. I thing advertising makes not sense their. This programm should be only for learn new experience and to show they what passes in the world.
