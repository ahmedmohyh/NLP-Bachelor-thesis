I think that it could be a problem when childrens spend to much time in front of the television. But like always it is not that easy when you wanne give a new law. Because many parents do not like it when somebody tell them how they should treat their childrens. So it is a difficult statement.

Like already say, I see definatly problems when childrens spend to much time watching television. One argument is that children who watch already ended stories don't have to imaginate their own stories. That means that their ability to build their own world maybe with an friend who isn't there in reality, or where they can be a princess or a pilot won't be used. And that given stories are'nt just in their favorite TV show. It's also in television advertising.
A second point is the watching just before going to bed. Many childrens are very excited when they watching the last hour befour bedtime. There are also parents who care to less what exactly is in the TV right now. Because we all know that some films and also sometimes some too sexual television advertising aren't good for that age.

You see: I am agree that young childrens shouldn't watch television advertising. When I am honest I don't agree that childrens under the age of five should watch televions in general. But on the other hans my opinion is also that every parents should have the right to what they think is best for their own family.
