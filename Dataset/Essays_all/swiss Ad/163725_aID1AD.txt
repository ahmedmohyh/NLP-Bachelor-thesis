We often see or hear about children who watch a lot of television. They regulary watch television for some hours a day. Of course it is normal to watch TV but not always four hours a day. Children dont have to spent too much time on television. They should go out with their friends, play football or do something other outside. It isn't good for their eyes to watch television for a long time. The advertising between the series are very bad for the children. Sometimes it's special what the matter of the advertise is.
When the children often watch television and see a lot of the advertise they want all of the beautiful toys. They only speak about this cool car which they want or the new barbie or whatever. After a while their parents buy them this things. The children get it and play one or two times with the car and then it isn't interesting anymore. Some kids take their toys to school and show it their friends. So it begins a quarrel about the best toy and perhaps one of the friends destroys it. 
It is nice when the children change their toys so everyone can play with an other toy and be happy, but the television advertising can't help to be happy. When I was four years old, we played with the toys from our older sister and we were happy. I know that every factory will sell their toys but I think it isn't good when you always see the new things which are better than yours. You can't enjoy your life if you always have to be better than the others. I have often played with plants or stones. You can make a nice house of stone and the plants are the people who live there. I think with all these television advertising we stole the fantasy of our children.
