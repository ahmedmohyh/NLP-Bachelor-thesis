Children between two and five years haven't learned to judge. They are dependant on their parents and don't really think about what's true or wrong. The consequence is that it is easy to manipulate them and of course, companies take advantage of this. The children are too young to understand that maybe, the thing the commercial advertises for, doesn't have only advantages or is actually unnecessary. But manipulated by the advertise, they want to have it, as soon as possible, because it looked so cool in television. So the commercial taught at a young age that shopping makes you happier, more popular, more content. The society of consume gets stronger. A child doesn't spend a thought on the children who had to produce their toys, who got poisened by the chemics which are necessary for the production. Neither, they think on the contamination of the environment. And with manipulating children in such a young age, the problems in our world always get bigger and bigger.
The prohibtion is easily said, but hard to umsetzen. Who says where those children are? Which TV shows they watch, which posters they see, to which people they talk? It is impossible. Also, without advetising, companies can't sell their products. And the parents of the children are responsible for them. They have to teach them what's necessary and what they shouldn't buy. So all in all, I disagree with this statement.
