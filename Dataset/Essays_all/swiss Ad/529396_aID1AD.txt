What is the goal of television advertisements? Enterprises want to get new customers, which buy their products, with it. Because this is influencing the peoples that are waching them should it be forbidden to show advertisment directed toward young children? 
Young children (aged two to five) do not think that people have bad intentions and because of this they are easily manipulated. 
On the other hand such young children will not completely  understand what is happening in front of them and if they still understand what they see they will not be able to remember the advertised product for long.
Also, they aren't able to buy things by themself. The most parents are not willing to buy a product just because their young children tell them that they saw a thing on the television which they definitly need. 
To conclude you can say it is not needed to make a restriction for advertisment directed toward young children. First of all they most likely will not understand what is happening in the advertisment. Secondly, it is not worth for companies to make advertising for young children that are not able to buy the companies products by themself. With this there will not be many advertisments for young children in the television anyway.
