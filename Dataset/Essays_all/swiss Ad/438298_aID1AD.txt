 In my opinion television advertising for young children isn't neccessary at all because it would be better for them if they would play outside and don't waste their time in front of the tv. Another negative point is that it has got some bad influences on children f. ex. if they see an advertising about a cool toy they're asking their parents if they could buy it. 
I think it would be a lot better if the parents would give them some magazines with toys in it. First of all it is much more natural then advertising in television and the parents know what they are looking at. The worst point about advertising in televsion is that there are so many new toys and each of them is presented in an advertising video. This causes that kids want all of them which could be very annoying for their parents. 
Back to the option with the magazine. If the kid sees something interesting it could ask their parents if they could buy it. Now there are two options for the parents either going to a store or buying it online. The first point would be the better for sure because the kid is having a real life experience. If the parents order it online it is kinda lame because the only interesting thing is that there is a package in the briefcase. But I think that ordering online is the best option for young adults and adults because it's much more flexible then going to stores every time. 
Me as parent would allow my kids to watch tv for 30min a day which I think is pretty normal this time. Another option is to buy them something like a gameboy or Ipod on which they can play games without advertising. 
As I mentioned before the best option is to spend time outside with his kids and not let watch them tv allday long.
