Children are said to be sitting more and more in front of the Television, even at very young age. This does not have to be bad as there are channels especially for children, offering funny as well as pedagogical programmes. However, should it be allowed to direct TV advertising toward our youngest generation?
"Of course", you may say beause they have to learn how to deal with it. There is a huge amount of advertising in the adults' life as well. Wherever you go, you will find some. In addition to that, researches have shown, that children are "immune" to advertising, if they grow up with it. They automatically seem to learn to separate the relevant information from the irrelevant.
On the other hand, there will be an impovement of advertising techniques, which then will fit perfectly to the new generation. The children are going to grow up and lose their immunity as new trends and new technologies are going to change their behaviour and the kind of advertising they like. To add another point, children should grow up without being terrorised by advertising, especially if it comes from the TV. At the age of two to five, they are still learning a lot of central aspects in our society, for example what is important or not. I do not think that advertising belongs to the important ones and therefore it should be avoided.
To sum up, I do totally agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward children aged two to five should not be allowed. Not only it interrupts their development and confuses them but also they soon will be victims of the advertising, as well as adults are right now.
