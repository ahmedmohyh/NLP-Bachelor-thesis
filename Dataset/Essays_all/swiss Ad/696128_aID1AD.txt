I think I'd agree with that statement because yeah why not.
I don't think there are many or any children aged to to five already watching television or even the advertising sections. In adition to that I would say if there should be any regulation of tv advertising than a complete ban of it.
I mean the complete background of this Idea is that little boys and girls are ought to be more influenceable then others. Some studies may have shown so but really: Do those people really think there is advertising directed towards little kids?
Those people then do have to believe that everyone is highly influenced by advertising and it should be banned completly, don't they? And if so - as already mentoioned - tv advertising should be banned completly.
