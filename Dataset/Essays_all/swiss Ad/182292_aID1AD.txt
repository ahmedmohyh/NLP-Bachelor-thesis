Young children need a ot of attention from their parents, their siblings and the whole families. This can be very difficult and busy in situations in which you do not have a lot of time. The problem of children who are looking for attention in such situations, can be solved very easily: place the child in front of the television so it is quite and you have the time you need to cook your meal, tidy your flat or do other housework. 
Nowadays there are a lot of TV-programms which are especially made for young children. There are some happy colorful animals who sing together some songs and your child is happy. Isn't it perfect for a baby?

In contrast to this attitude there is the question if it is a good solution to leave your child in front of the television, watching some child programms during the family which is responsible for the wealth of the child every time, even on busy days, is occupied with other activities. If they do not have anough time to manage the housework  and their child, should they even become babys? 
Watching television in young ages is totally bad for the child's wealth. Kids are not able to understand what is happening on the fluckering screen, because their brains are not enough educated. 

In my opinion watching television as young children should not be a daily activity. Although I todally understand young mothers who allows their young kids, watching television for some reluctant minutes, because they are very busy and had to made really important stuff. I think being a great mother is a big challenge because children needs a lot of time and patience, as a result it is comletely normal, that mums allow things, from which they know it is not the best thing for their loved child (watching television, eating sweets, ...). I think the most important thing ist that a child feels constantly the feelings of love and belonging.
