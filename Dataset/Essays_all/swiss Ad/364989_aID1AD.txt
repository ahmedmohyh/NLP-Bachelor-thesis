Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Is it fair or not to include young children in television advertising? Are they able to realize what advertising is doing with themselves?

I don't think so. It is simply not fair because young children are not able to see that the toy industry just wants to sell their products and don't care about them at all. It is also impossible for them to see that the things showed in advertisings are not as nice in real life as they are in the aderts. Just because they don't even think about it. They just see a toy they like and think that this toy will make them very happy because the child in the video is also very happy with his new toy. 
But let me ask another question first: why do we even include children in these adverts? They can't buy things by their own anyway. So they'll just annoy their parents the whole time until the parents are willing to make their wishes come true. 

Why include children out of this business if it's the parents who decide to buy it in the end? The adverts just show children the latest toys. In the end the parents decide if they want to give a certain product to their children or not. 
On top it would be unfair against companys who sell products for children. All the other industrys are allowed to make their products look nice on television. It is just normal to use adverts to sell your products in our society. If we want to fight against things that are bad for children, we should start in closing Mac Donalds 
and Burgerking because these fast food restaurants are far more dangerous for young children. They make them believe their food is good and they make their restaurants very attractive for young children in having playgrounds, a clown and toys inside the "happy meal". This kind of advertising is worse because it destroys the childrens health and it's not Television advertising. There are also good things in Television advertising directed to young children.
