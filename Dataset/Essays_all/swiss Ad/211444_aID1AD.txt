A lot of people think that young children (age two to five) should not be in contact with television. In the following text i want to show why i agree and disagree with this statement at the same time.
First of all I think that young children should play with other, real children and not with people in the television. They should be in a direct contact with children in their age to grow old together. They need to learn things together. They should not just watch how things are going but learning it by themselves or together with other kids in their age. 
In my opinion they also need to learn that you can have fun without electronics. For example they need to learn that even with just a few stones you can play a cool game.
I also think that it is really important later that you have  best friends since they were young children. These relationships are often really strong and important in one's life and last their whole life. If these strong relationships don't exist, people could have problems to find friends later in their lifes, because they never needed to.
But i also think that these children are going to be in contact with these social medias anyways so it doesn't really matter at which point in their life it will happen. In our modern world which is full with electronics it's nearly impossible to not be in contact with things like the television. 
In the end I personally think that it is okay to let young children watch television, if it is not too much. They should not watch television the whole day but I think it is not that bad if they are watching television one hour per week.
