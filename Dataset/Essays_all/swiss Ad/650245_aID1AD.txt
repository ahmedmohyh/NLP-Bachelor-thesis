In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising direct to young children should not be allowd. A lot of parents don`t know how to handle this issue and ask in conserversation with freinds about their opinion. There are (I think) at the moment no facts which consist on evidence (bestätigen) that television has a bad influence on the childrens health. 

The proponents using this argument add maybe the fact that children should early learn the possibilities we have and know how to handle certain informations. A lot of parents just use the television as unterhaltung for their children while they have to go to work or to the supermarket. They can leave the house knowing the children won`t leave the TV and do something stupid. 

But the downside is that there are a lot of programmes on the TV that show the cruel world, the wars with death people and the destroyed surroundings. Little children don`t know yet how to see the difference between a programme and the reality. Maybe it leads also some children to criminal acts or to do dangerous things they have seen in a TV experiment. 

I perfectly understand the parents view that sometimes children are so annoying and they want to have some free time on their own. But I think too that we are responible for our children and we have to protect their fantasies and don`t influence them to much by the cruel facts.
