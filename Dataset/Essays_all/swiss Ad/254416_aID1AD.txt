In this essay I will discuss the statement if television advertising to children aged to to five should be forbidden.

Adevertises are here to make us buy something. They try to stimulate our feelings so we might feel in need of the product being advertised and tend to buy it.
Many parents and child protection organisations say such adds should be forbidden in order to avoid the creation of consum and desire in our children. 
I understand their position since young children get very easily convinced by something and they might feel ultra dependent on the product being promoted. But I simply don`t se the function of forbidding such advertises. In my opinion, it is a parent`s responsibility to teach his child what he/she is allowed to have and at what time. That is also a good way to educate the child that he won`t get everything he wants when he wants. 
My other point is, if we ban adevertises for children aged from 0-5 they will get to se them at 6 and older. The older a person gets, the better arguments it has, so it will be more difficult to teach him that he wont get the productuct on the advertise. Older children do also bear more money what could lead to them just going to the mall and get that product by themselves.
Therefore I firmly state that advertises for children aged 0-5 shouldn`t be banned. It is a good and effective way for parents to teach their children that they wont get anything they se and get them used to se such advertises and don`t feel attracted to them.
