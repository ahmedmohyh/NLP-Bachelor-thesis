Many children spend a lot of time in front of the television. Television inclueds advertisments. And children can be strongly influenced by them, especially in a very young age. That's why commercials which are directed towards children should be forbidden.

Advertisments are all about selling things. Children's advertisments are often about toys.When a child sees toys shown on television, it probably wants to get them all, because the chidlren in the commercials always seem to be happy and having fun. Now the parents either buy them those toys and spoil them or they don't and the children end up being sad.

The picture which a child has of the world, can be influenced by those commercials too. For example when there are only people with the same nationality shown, it keeps them from being open-minded. Or when the girl in the commercial always has long blond hair, children may think that's what girls are supposed to look like.
