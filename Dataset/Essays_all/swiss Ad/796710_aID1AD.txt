In television often is advertising towards young children. Many people aren`t the same meaning about this topic. It can have positive and negative sites, but which is stronger?

On the plus side is that young children are amused. They like seeing these spots because they are diriectly for them. If there are  lions or  rabbits in this clip then most of children like tho see these. They can be just like a short film for them and notan advertising. Behind these television advertisings are creative people which tries to make the most funniest and cutest film for children.

But one of the biggest cons is that they don`t havetheir one money. The advertising is only used to make the children ask their perents to buy something. They see something in television and they want to have it but they need their parents. The spot should be directed toward the parents who have to buy it. Advertising toward childrean is unfair they don`t have the abbility to put this in a normal context. Most of them don`t understand that their parents can`t buy them all things from these TV spots. The children should learn to be play with that what they have.

But this advertising could also be useful. It`s good for collecting new ideas for christmas presents and also for other plays towards children. In this age the parents of them mostly chose what their children have and what they don`t have.

Good is also that when the young children are loking a film toward children the advertising between is also for children. When the advertising contains stuff for other ages it could be boring or disturbing for young child. 

In my oppinion should be allowed because of children like these and it`s a good donator of ideas for parents. Thats also the reason why I think that the advertising should be more directed toward the parents, they chose what they buy. This would be in my oppinion also more fair.
