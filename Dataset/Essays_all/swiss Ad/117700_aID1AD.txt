The whole day, when I'm in school, series for children are shown in the televisoin, including advertisements. Should it be allowed to show children aged two to five advertisments?
On one hand, children see new things, know what's existing through othre sources than only their parents and maybe the kindergarden. A marketing group that wants to sell their products is quiet interested in television advertisment for young children. They are influencable very well and they are fastly convinced from such advertisements. The advertisement can also be fitting to the serie that the children are watching. For example, that an advertisement for horse-toys is shown during a series about horse-stories. This is also a positive point for the ones that want to sell their products. Children aged two to five have a lot more impressions of their environment. Their parents, siblings, kindergarden-guides and other children. But also very important are the stories that they hear, the movies and the series which they watch. And they are not only influenced by the movie or the series, but by the advertisement too, because especially children can't difference from the movie or series and the advertisement. In case of a leadership of a dictator or a very radical party, especially children can be victims of propaganda. And that propaganda can be made very well in television and in the advertisement that is shown there. 
As a conclusion, if they stop allowing advertisements during children series, I would stop allow some series at all and ot only the advertisement, because there are many childrens series that make the children dumb. And that is also a kind of propaganda and it's more influencing than the advertisement between. Through that, the marketing effect for the sellers is still here what is an positive effect too.
