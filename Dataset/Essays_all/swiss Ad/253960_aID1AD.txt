The Children nowadays get more in touch with electronic machines at a very young age, most of the adults say it makes the youth dumb. Children should more go out and do things instead of laying around and consuming. The youth is getting lazier and they getting more obsessed by these little machines.
 
Parents say the television is good because you can learn a lot from it. But it's not that what the kids do, they watching cartoons. The Children learn more of going out and see the world. The television also sends out some stuff that probably is not good for a kids body. And when the children are young they can learn the most, their brain is fresh and they have it easier. An adult has more problems with learning spanish then a child. With the Television you also make the time rush. Have of your lifetime rushes with the television away. In hard words it's for the children an addicition in later life they can't without the television. More and more time they will sit in front of the television.
I have no television at home and I think my mother was right. For me it makes me angry if I see children with the newest I-Phone. I think a child should go out and learn. The television is bad and makes people dumb and lazy. I'm also sometimes but most of the time i want to go out. Every child should have that feeling.
