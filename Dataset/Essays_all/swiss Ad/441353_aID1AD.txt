Banning advertisement targeting toddlers

Lately there has been some controversary concerning advertisements which target children aged two to five. Since it has become a daily routine that from a young age toddlers watch television, they cannot get around watching advertisement. But how could this affect those children and does this even influence them?

It is commonly known that these days, television overall has a big influence on young children. There is a risk that they will not able to distinguish the invented world from reality. that means that as soon as they see an advertisement trying to sell toys they will think it is essential to have one as well. In a way companies can use advertisement to manipulate the viewers. But that is no new thing. The difference to adult advertisement is that parents these days are often spoiling their kids. If a toddler comes and asks them to buy a toy, they will be more willing to do so than to buy themselves a pair of trousers or a new television.

Another aspect worth considering is that in advertisements everything tends to be depicted in an almost perfect way. if a young child sees this and compares it to his enviroment, he or she might realize certain differnces and start preassuring the parents. Another possibility could be that it starts to feel uncomfortable and unhappy with the living conditions. Studies have proved that unhappyness and a demanding attitude at a young age can 
make the child depressive during adulthood and prevent it from performing his or her function in society.

To summarize the problem, it is clearly visible that advertisement can have devastating influences on a toddler. However it is also very dependent on the amount of time it spends in front of the television and how closely it is under the supervision of the parents. Banning advertisement targeting young children probably would not solve the problem since they are also affected by those who have adults or youngsters as a target group.
