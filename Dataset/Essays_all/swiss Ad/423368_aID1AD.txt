The subject over which I'm going to write is the television advertising towars young children and if that shouldn't be allowed. 

One reasen for arguing this these is that the raise of the children at this age, should fully be under contol of their parents. It is very dangerous showing children stuff on television, because a lot of children do what they see, so if there is someting showed on televison, it must be sure that children don't come on stupid ideas. 

On the otherhand if its something about food for children or something like that, I suppose that it then would be okay, perhaps not an advertisment about a fast food restaurant or unhealty food at all. 

Advertisments can also be thaughtful and can wider their knowledg, for example showing parts of the world or things on the hole which they never saw before. There are always "good" advertiments, for example some years ago there was one from Coop with the singer Stress, he was talking/singing about our world, and that was the first time I was thinking about our world and that our world has to be protected. 

But most of the Companys which make advertisments on televison for their product, just want to make money and that has most of the time not such a good influence on the children who are looking this advertisments. 

To conclude, I think it would be better if there aren's special advertisments directed to young children. It is to dangerous and to be honest, children at this stage of life shouldn't be watching television, so economicly it would also soesn't make a lot of sence.
