The little children sitting on the couch in front of them a huge, bright flatscreen. Wild conversations are coming out of the speakers. The eyes of the kids are wide open.
The children are watching the advertising of the new shoes from the Geox company at her prefered channel Nickelodeon. Those were the shoes the kids had seen all day while their watching television so its possible that these kids want to buy a pair of them.
But should advertisings directed towards young children not be allowed?

On one hand the children learn something. The volontear to buy something that they had seen somewhere is a step in the direction of growing up. To have a own opinion what I want and what I dont want makes out your caracter. Also the advertising industry earn mutch with those wishes of the kids. On Christmas and their birthdays alot of their gifts have their origin in those advertisings.

On the other hand the children are to young to understand the meaning of those advertisings. This huge industry is not made for  those young candidats.

In my oppinion the children at this age shouldnt even watch television. TV can be a relly big addiction.
