Advertising like this, is a very new and modern problem, young adults are confronted with. Over all it should be their own decision, if they want to raise the children with such influences like the TV or not, but here are some arguments for and against the advertising directed toward young children.

First of all, it's a good idea for the parents to see advertisments like this, not for them, but for their child of course, because even though it's not meant for them, by watching these kind of commercials, with or without their child, they'll get an idea of what their child and other children at their specific age want to play with. Also it's a good source of finding out, what's new on the young children toy market, without having to leave the house and wander around toy stores.

But it's also not that good of an idea for the child, because already getting influenced by the media at such a young age, and watching too much TV, or even getting addicted to watching TV at a young age, has never been a good habit. Problems like constant crying because of parents not buying their child the toys or things they want, or rather, they saw on TV , might also occur. A big question would also be, if they actually understeand the things they see on the commercials, because if they don't, it's just a big waste of money directed towards someone, that doesn't even understeand any of it.

So overall i think it should be allowed, because it's the right of the channels to choose,which kind of commercials the want to use, and because it's also the parents, which are responsible for their child, and checking on them like the things they like, what they watch on TV or what the do on the internet, should be a very important part of parenthood. So if they don't like what kind of advertising there is on TV, they can just turn it off, and let the child do different things, other than watching TV all day.
