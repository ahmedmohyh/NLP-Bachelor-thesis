The television is present nowadays more often than ever before. Not only parents are watching regularly TV but also children in young ages are getting used to it. One thing that always has been present in the TV are advertisement, but they used to be adressing older people and not young children. But these young children are easy to influence what's used by the companies. The question is weather televisionadverising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

Even though there are many ways of advertising affecting younger people there should be some restritction to protect kids from unneeded infuence. In their young age they are developing themselfe realy fast but also get influenced realy easily. Thats something which shouldn't be used for the profit of your bussines or to get extra atraction. They need time to determin themself and find out what they really want. Of course we are talking about children in the age of two to five years, who aren't going to decide realy importent things. But when I look back to when I was young, I wasn't playing with any electric devices or had the newest stuff. I was happy with the things I had got. Todays society, not only the young ones, are only happy with the newest devices on marked and there is no need to help this feeling already in this young age.

These are the reasons why I'm against advertisment directed toward young children.
