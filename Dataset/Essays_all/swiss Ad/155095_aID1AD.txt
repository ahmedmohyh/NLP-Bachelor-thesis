This text is about the arguments if television advertising directed young children aged between two and five should be not allowed.

Children aged beetween two to five cannot distinguise between important things. So the advertisment shwo a lot of things and the children have the feeling they have to need that. This could affect, how they buy things in the future because they couldn't learn which products are important because when they go to a supermaket with her mother she tells the child waht's important and what not ond the child lerans how to consume normally.

Children want everything and with thouse advertisment they see a lot of things the could have. It's like you go into a supermaket and they ask her mother many times if she could buy theme things. 

Companys have to seel their gods and when thier specialsied to produce things for children they have to use television advertising so that they can sell their things. Without that the company would not have enough money to pay the worker and many people would lsoe their job.

For children it makes fun to watch these advertisments because they are on the same level of understanding and it activate their fantasie.

In my opinion it should be abolished because children were manipulated so that companys can make some profit. They cannot distingusie between those things which are important and thosue wich aren't.
