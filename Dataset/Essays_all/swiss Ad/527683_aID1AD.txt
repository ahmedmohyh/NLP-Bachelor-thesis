I think television advertising by young children is a problem in our society today .
On the one side it shouldn`t be allowed, because children are weak about they`re opinion and character.
So it`s very easy to influence them. SO if they see something in the Television they believe it. In they`re world lies don`t exist. Caused by that the companys use the children as perfect victims. That`s a big problem for families. So they`re children believe the Television more than they`re own parents! That`s incredible!
On the other side in todays economics with no limits, why should this be forbidden? If a family has a problem with that they shouldn`t allow they`re children to watch Television, easy solution.
But can you todays children taking the Television away?
They`ll watch it anyways, with friends, at school. 
It`s a difficult situation. 
Is money more important than the humanity of our next generation?
Do companys which pay taxes have more influence and are more important?
I think that are points which we should make clear and discuss about it. In politics, with families, with schools, Kindergarden etc. And after discussing these points we can talk about the real problem and find a solution.

My opinion is that it shouldn`t be allowed at all. After the age of five you will have enough time for Television advertising for your potential clients. And at this point they will have they`re own opinion. So why already start that earrly?
