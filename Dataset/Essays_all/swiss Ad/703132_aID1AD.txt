in my opinion, I agree with the statement. I find the children in the young age should better play in the nature. CHildren should go to the school and after that at home, they should go play in the garden or something with friends. I don't find it goot, when children go home and watch for the whole evening tv. I think also, that today are more and more tv programms, which aren't make for children. I mean, when you scroll on your tv programm, there is sometimes only things witch the subject war, suicide, horror, thriller and something like that. I think, these aren't subject for children. And as I know the children, they would watch these series and films, when they are alone at home. So, the children should play in the nature and don't watch Tv the whole evening. 
I also think, that children, who plays regulary in the nature are healthier as these children, who are only at home. When they are in the nature, they are also in contact with schmutz and thats good for them. 
Another reason why tv schouldn't be allowed is that the children would be more outside. There, they would play many games. So, they would always be moving and fit. Today, more and more children are fat because they have to less movemement.
When the children play outside, they play a lot of games with other friends. Or other children, they don't know. So, its perfect to start an new friendschip with others and you have more fun, because you know everybody. 
The children should better go outside to do sport and have fun with friends.
