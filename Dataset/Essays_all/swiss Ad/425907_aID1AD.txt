Everything has an effect on small children. They want to imitate their surrounding. It doesnt matter if its their parents, strangers they meet or Television advertisment. All in all they are very easy to manipulate.

Advertisement is made to make a product more attractive. Children are a good way to get their parents to buy your product. Some parents can say no if their child want to have something and wil buy it for them. Children also dont know what they really need. They just want everything they see and dont have. Thats why advertisement directed to young children is very effective and commonly used.

In america for example only one out of 200 food advertisments on television is for healthy food. But the other 199 are for sweets and fast food. Children will think that fast food and sweets are the main nutrition. If the parents allow them to have these kind food then they could get addicted to it. This problem would get out of hand and there would be child obesity like in the USA.

I agree that bad television advertisment directed to young children should be banned. But I think all bad advertisment shouldn't be allowed for children not just television advertisment. With bad advertisement I mean everything that doesnt benefit the childs life. But good advertisement like the healthy food one should be allowed because it shows the children how to live a healthy life.
