Advertisements can be utterly exasperating when watching one's favorite TV series. But even though we might think they have no effect on us, they fill us with considerable subliminal information that influences our ways of seeing this specific product and other daiily life matters as well. And if it does that to us adults and teenagers, we can only fathom the effect it has in our youngest generation. My personal opinion is that children in such an early stage in their lives should spend as less time in front of a rectangular screen as possible and figure out how everything works, be it a toy or their own body. Now, coming to the matter of television advertising directed directly toward children of that specific age group. Such ads can have a rather negative effect on the children, they see some older kids playing with toys or presenting the product of the ad, and they crave for that very same item. Children can become extremel spoilt once they see children slightly older to use the product in the ads, or even worse when they see that even their friends now bought that very toy. If the parents don't agree on buying it, the child will be offended and it influences their character in later life. I'd rather have the chlildren find out where their interests lie, gaining a few experiences that makes it clear to them what they like and what they don't, and knowing that then deciding on their own what they'd like to buy. I've seen plenty of children on which such ads have had enormous effect on how they act and think, and I feel like we should move towards a world in which we try to prevent such things from happening. What parents could do now is to lessen the amount of time their child spends with the television, maybe even let them watch DVDs instead of TV shows.
