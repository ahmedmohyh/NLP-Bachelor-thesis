A child aged two to five isn't able to make the right decision for themselves, often they aren't even allowed to do things or buy things, without their parents permission. Furthermore shouldn't children of this young age be confronted with consumption of any manner. Moreover it's bad for their developement if they think, that pretty much everything can be bought with money. On the contrary, is a child, no matter which age, a human being, who's allowed to have toys, to have clothes or eat the candy they want, so why prohibid the advertisments of these kind of stuffs?
Furthermore children nowadays are being spoiled from their parents with gifts and stuff much earlier than the last generation used to be. So if the parents decide wether what's good and what's bad for their particular child, there's no problem helping them with it. An other point is, that if parents let their children watch television, at this age, it's their resposibility of what their children actually get to see and advertisements are just part of the television business. I think there is worse stuff in television children could get to see, than an advertisement towards them, which would be toys and stuff. Furthermore, just by seeing an advertisement, it doesn't have to mean, that they buy it, use it or consume it. Most of the kids in this age haven't even got money, so it's still in their parents hands. And if those parents feel pressured by their three year old kids so that it influenes their idology of how to grow up ones one kid, then their just useless parents. 
So to sum it all up I would say that unless, it's a sextoy advertisement on a child programm, there's absolutely no harm of directing toy advertisement and similar advertisements to young people, whose parents still are the ones taking the shots.
