Advertising

I think it's not wrong to show children televisoin advertising. Because it is not something who destroys the children. Maybe for the parents it isn't so good beacause if the children watching the advertising of games, for example playmobile or barbie, they want this things so bad. So they talk to her parents and talk and talk, till they say yes and buy the games for there childrens.

Also I think some TV-Series are more worse than friendly television advertising, because some comics and other stuff in the tv are so bad. They are so sexual and terrorising, so they make the childrens dumb.

Otherwise it gives so many other things whitch we should protect our childrens therefore. For example the internet or the streets, which are very dangerouse. So i think the adevertising is the smalest problem of all. 

This are the reasons why I disagree with the statement, which says that television advertising directed toward young children ahould not be allowed.
