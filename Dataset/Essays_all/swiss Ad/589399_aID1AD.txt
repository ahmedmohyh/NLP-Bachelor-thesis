Many parents said that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. There are many reasons which are supporting these statement. It could be helpful for young children if television advertising should not be allowed. In the following, I will explain my point of view.
However, television advertising is an entertainment for everyone, it does not matter which age you are. It is mostly better than sitting around and be bored. But there is also an other important point. Young children could use television advertising to learn something.
There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.
First, television advertising is mostly unhealthy for young children. For example they can get very sick and they cannot get any friends if they are television advertising. But there is also an other arguement which do not support the statement. Children have to make expiriences in the world, and television advertising do not bring any important expiriences. 
At last, television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. The health of young children is too important and television advertising could be like a wall between the children and the society.
