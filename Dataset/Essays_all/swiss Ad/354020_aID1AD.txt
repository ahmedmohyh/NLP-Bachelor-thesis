So first of all, I think children, between two and five shouldn't look that much TV that they have to look the advertisings between the movies or the serie.
But, okay, in our time nearly all 10 minutes is a break between a serie. And of course, there are advertisings for young children as well, because the company has to mark themself as well.
So it would be kind of hart, when you would them not allow, to do their marketing.

But children have (not in all cases) not a big known, and not so much experiece in life. When they see these advertisings, which seem to present the coolest thing in the world, of course they want the product, which they have seen. They don't know, that the products in reailty are sometimes not that special.

But would it be fair, to disallow them their advertisings?
No, I don't thnik so. I think this is kind of a job from the parents, to look that they learn that not everything, what it seems to be, is what it is. When the parents let their children watch TV for the first times, they should, maybe sit next to them and explain them the situation.
Because, not every advertising is a bad one, which tells them a fairy tale. When a child wants something for Christmas, or his/her birthday, TV adverstisings can be helpful.

And I think, when you wouldn't allow their advertisings, athor advertisings should be disallowed as well. Because, there are a lot of adults which fall for the advertising-tricks as well. And in Difference to the children, they gonna spend their money on the product.
