There are channels with films and series just for kids so these cannels must show their advertisments for kids. It doesn't make sense when the adverts are for older people, because this could be a reason to switch the channels. This would have consequences like less views and people would search other channels for their kids to watch. 


Kids have a difficulty to accept and to understand. When they liked for example a new lego house form an advert, they will go to their parents and tell them that they want these things. It could be that the parents have no time or no money to buy this. This would stress the parents also. 
 
Adverts can danger little kids  (age 2 -3). We all know that little kids like to have something in their mouth like the finger or something different. When they put a liitle subject in their mouth like a little lego weapon,The kid could not get oxygen. It can be the reason for the death.It is the job of the parents to look after the kids and that the people who made that advert can't do something, when something is happenng to the kid.

Little kids with the age 2/3 are also easy to trick, because you can talk about something different what they like and make that they forget what they wanted to. An older kid who has not a good education would talk everyday about this game until the kid gets it. It depends also on the education of the kids and who the parents handle with the kids.
 
When they show programms for little kids everything must be for kids as i said. The people who do the adverts can just look that the adverts dont get too voilent or agressive.
