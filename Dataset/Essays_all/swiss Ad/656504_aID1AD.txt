We often hear about the discussion if it is right to allowd children to watch televsion. 
On one hand we know that too much television is neither good for our psychical nor our physical health. If we wacht television all the time we get antisocial and we do not exercise enougth and this will lead to a non healty life. So first of all if we know that it is bad for us to watch too much television why should we let our children do it? Children should go outside and play in nature. Secondly they should use their own imagination when playing and to only watch something imagined by someoneelse. We should not allow our small children to watch TV so they could learn to be with themeselves and to play even if there is nooneelse. They should live their childhood without too many electronical devises.
On the other hand why should we allow it? We urselves watch television and if it is not done too much there are no bad results. Anyhow there should not be any general rule or law against it because it is in the hand of the parents to choos their side in this discussion and do as they think it is right. It is a personall question witch should not be taken away from the parents. They should have the posibillity to make their own desicion. 

In my opinoin it should not be prohibited. It should be the parents desicion how they want to raise their child. I just think that it is not good for a child to watch too much television. The child should have an alternative to this. For example the parents could say yo can watch TV as long as you have read a book or that after watching a little TV the should go outside and play with others. In this senario the child would have a balanced life. It would not be onesided. A child's life should have many aspects and it should not be always the same.
