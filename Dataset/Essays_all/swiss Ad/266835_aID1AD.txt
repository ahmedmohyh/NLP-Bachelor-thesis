In this day and age advertisments are all around us.Everywhere we go, we can either see them or hear them. With the use of hoardings, banners, internet, media, radio or television it is almost impossible to avoid them. Advertisments can play a big part in our lives, hence, they can influence one in a negative or positive way. But is it really a good idea to let young children be influenced by it, especially through televison advertising? 
Young children haven't developed fully and aren't really educated yet. Televison advertising has a bigger influence on youngsters then on adults. Children tend to believe everything one says on televison. There are many children who spend a lot of time infront of the TV and parents do not really pay attention to what their children are watching. It can be quiet dangerous and it could also have a long lasting impact on the childrens future life. Advertisments can be alluring and come over as really good, but sometimes they are just a trap, a sham to make the companies rich. Advertising child toys is probably one of the most succesfull ways to make loads of money. When children see a new cool toy or game on TV, they automatically want it. They could start to beg their parents for money and it   could put families who are financially unstable in a corner, because they want their children to be happy. 
Televison advertising or any kind of advertising could be dangerous for small children, so I suggest that they ban it or at least make less advertisments for children.
