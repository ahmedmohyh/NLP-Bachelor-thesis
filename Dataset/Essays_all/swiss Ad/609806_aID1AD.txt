Is television advertising for young children good or bad? This is a question for parents which is realy important in the education of their children.

First of all I have to say, that young children in the age between two or five shouldn't watch television alone in general. For example, children in the age of two. They have better things to do as watching something in the TV. They can play with toys or they can go outside with their mother. But they shouldn't sit inside and watch TV.

If the kids turn older for example in the age of five, than they can watch sometimes their series which they love. But only the series and not the advertising between them. 
I think often the advertising in the TV isn't for so little children. Because mostely the advertising is for older children or for parents, so this isn't good to see by the young children. On the otherside this children see the advertising and after that, they want the thing who they have seen. For example, they see a new toy and after that they go to the parents and want that they will buy this toy. So the parents have always this nerving children which want something. 

The advertising in TV is often on a deep niveau and hasn't much background. Also it isn't very intelligent. So for the education of the children it's not very helpful.

Finally I would say, that the children in the age of two or three shoudn't watch TV and the older kids can watch TV but only one serie of propably twenty minutes and after that they have to turn of the television. So they stop watching, before they can see the advertising. So I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
