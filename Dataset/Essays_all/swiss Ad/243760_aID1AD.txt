Nowadays children get influenced by television advertsiing very early. This is because of the habit that already  children of a young age could watch TV. But does this advertising influence them too much and should it be forbidden?
First of all young children are really easy to influence. This is also why such a lot of advertising is faced towards young children. Because they believe everything. And if small children see something they want ist is hard to tell them that they're not going to get it. So there are some arguments in favour of not allowing advertsing towards children from two to five. But it is the resposnibilty of the parents to decide wether their child can watch TV or not. And they have also to inform them how to react to this advertsing. In the end the parents buy an advertised product for their child and they're old enough to decide if it is a good thing or not. So the child can be influenced by advertising but it doesn't harm them straight away. Last but not least it would be difficult to decide what advertising is for children between two and five years and what not. Because it's different from child to child what they like and what not.
In my eyes it isn't a good idea to forbid television advertsing for children between two and five because it would be hard to regulate. And I think the parents are able to inform their children and take responsibilty of them.
