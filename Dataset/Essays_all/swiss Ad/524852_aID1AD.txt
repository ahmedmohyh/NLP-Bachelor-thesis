In the media we can hear from time to time that the consume of television is not good for the developpement of young children. One thing which can influence the developpement of a young child could be the television advertising.

For the companies who launched the advertising campain young children are an ideal group to influence. The children haven't a basic knowledge about a product and because of this, they are easy to manipulate. After the television show, the children tell their parents what they have seen and in the ideal case the parents buy the product. But it's clear that some psyhologes observed this developpement very critical. This is positiv for the industy because more products were bought.
But some psychologes are very sceptical with this developpement. The young children were very easy to manipulate. A child who is under five years old can't built his own oppinion about a subject, and can't wage the pros and the contras of the product. The child believs all, which the advertising has told him.
In my oppinion is that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed, because in our time a big part of the parents are working during the day. Because of this the children are watching television without a adult person who explain the advertising to the child. For this reason the children are easy to influence.
In my oppinion it's nut just only the television industry who have to change theyr programm. Also the parents should suport the children when they watching television.
