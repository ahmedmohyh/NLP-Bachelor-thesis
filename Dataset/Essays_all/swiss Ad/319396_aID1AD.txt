Advertising directed toward young children on TV is an undiscussed subject in the modern society of Europ. But I think, we should look more critical at the very popular "good-night-story" for children. Of course, there are many pros on this subject. I am sure that most children like to watch TV. So children have fun and have something to do. Thats a quit qood reason for parents, because this way they have some free-time and can let the child alone. It's also good for parents if the child has a blessure, so the child can forget his souffers in front of the TV, with Mickey Mouse for an example. 

There are also cons on this topic, and these cons I don't hear them very often. It comes from my originally suspects to all media work. I don't believe in any news messenger or social media. I think that most media, especially TV is an instrument of political influence. And most influence you can take on the life of young children. And children also lose their interests in other subjects. They only play on sub So it's logical that I am suspicious on television advertising directed toward all the people but especially toward young children. It's my opinion that television advertising should be forbidden
