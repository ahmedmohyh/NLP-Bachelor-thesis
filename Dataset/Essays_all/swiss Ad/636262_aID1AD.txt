The question in this essay is:"Should television advertising to young children should be not allowed?" Televison advertising is made to give the impact to buy the product. So maybe the advertising can have a big impact to the small children. But is that not the choice of the parents?

Televison advertising has a big impact to the people who see it. Children can be impacted much easier than adults. It can affect children to do things that they would not do if they have not seen the advertise. Think about that. There is a advertise with a young child. This child is playing with the televison and the cables of the televison. When young children are seeing this. They could do it aswell and playing with cabels and elecrticity. This is very dangerous.

When you look at the other position, there is an other arguement. Why should the gouvernement should make a law when there are parents that have to help the children growing up. The parents should look that their children are getting a good character and they have to decide themself how they can do this. So why should the gouvernement take that responsibility away from the parents? They can also decide how much televion they should whatch

At the end you can see, that both side are respectable, but when you weiht the side up we can see, that it is not nessecary to interdict the televison advertise for young children. It is in the responsibility of the parents.
