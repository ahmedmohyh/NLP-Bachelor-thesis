People of all ages are interesting for advertising agencies. But especially young people are easy to influence. A very popular way to advertise today is the television. And already young children watch regularly tv so they are also victims of manipulative advertising. 
Advertisement is produced for specific groups. For children they use for example a lot of colours, pets and children as actors. All things that children like. They are instantly fascinated of the advertised product. An exhausting thing for the parents who have to handle the whishes and annoying insists of their kids. They obviously can't fulfill all those wishes and buy all the mostly unnecessary products.
In my eyes it's cruel to manipulate young children who are so influenceable.
