Advertising in general is already an actual topic about which many peaople have many different opinions. We already pay taxes to whatch television so why should we pay even more with our freetime, which is used while whatching advertisements. Obviously it is a fact that there wouldn't be as many private programms as we have now to whatch and that's why already this is a controversal topic. Even though it is not the question already this could easily fill a whole school lesson to talk about. But the actual topic is if advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
In my opinion it's not about the question if it should be allowed or not. If I was a worker in an advertising company I would need to ask myself if it is even worth it to produce advertisements towards children at such a young age. Because normally these children are not even allowed to whach TV and when they are, I feel pretty sure that they won't focus on the advertisments. In fact they would just focus on other stuff in their environment during the advertisments. 
But there are people who could be affected by these advertisments. For example parents or family members of children in that age who want to make a present. But again as a worker in such a company I'd have to ask myself if it is worth it to produce advertisments for such a small amount of people who could feel affected by these advertisments.
For conclusion I have to point out that for me it's definitively not a question about allowing or not allowing. It's about the value for the company if it's worth it to advertise it or not. In general I would also say, that where we are able to not use any more laws about allowing or not, we should try to avoid crating them and just leave every human being doing what he feels like.
