In today's world television is omnipresent and there's almost no household without at least one TV. Companies have made use of that by advertising on television as much as possible. We often see advertisment directed towards infants. It is known that advertisement can influence people, especially young children. But should we really, in a free society with freedom of opinion, forbid advertisement that is directed toward kids between two and five years old?

As a matter of fact, we can say that young children are very influencable. We can for instance see this with kidnappers. They offer kids sweets or promise them puppies or kittens. The kids just have to hear one of these words and all they can think of are puppies and kittens and sweets. Almost without thinking they will follow the kidnapper. You could thus argue that a similar thing happens with ads. The infants will hear the advertisement and they will accept them as truth. It can blurr or even fake their view of reality.

On the other hand we live in a free society, where people can have their own opinion and even spread their opinion. We see this all the time with demonstrations, banners with political messages, satirical cartoons in newspapers and so on. So why shouldn't companies be allowed to direct their advertisements towards younger kids. It is the parents' duty to make their kids "immune" to these kind of advertisements. With their education they should prepare kids for situations like that and they have to say no if a kid wants this stupid product that was advertised for.

To conclude, I think that you cannot forbid advertisement that is directed towards young children, because it is part of our free society to spread your opinion. Companies should be able to make use of this. I think that it is the parents' responsibility to prepare their kids for situations like that, so that the kids aren't influencable so easily.
