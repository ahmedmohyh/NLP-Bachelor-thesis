Television is in our society a common way to influence people's thinking. Therefore can specific advertising have a big effect on our actions. Adults usually have a lot of experience in telling wether someone's trying to manipulate them or not. Most children though don't have this experience. That makes it very easy to convince them that for example a certain product is essental to have. 
Also, today, television is a common way of entertaining young children. Because of that it is very likely that many children will see the advertising, which has the power to spread it's message fast. Depending on what the message is, that might not be a welcomed effect. 
On the other side, advertising which is directed toward children usually isn't intending to cause any harm. Mostly it deals with things like toys. The only real effect this would have on a child is, that the child has the desire to possess this item. Except for some arguments between the child and the parents, there shouldn't be many othe effects. 
Also children often don't even think about what they had just seen on television and it's likely that the advertising has hardly any influnce at all. 
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children isn't dangerous in any way. Therefore I don't think that it shouldn't be allowed. 
Besides that, I think putting up laws against that kind of "problem" seems to me like a waste of time and resources, which we should use on more important subjects. I belive that we should trust our society enough to let everyone deal with that kind of problem on their own.
