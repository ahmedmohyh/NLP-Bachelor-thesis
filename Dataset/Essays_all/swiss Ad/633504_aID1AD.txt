No I dont agree because the Electronic is the future. Besides that young children love to watch TV. I would say that the children could watch max. one hour a day. There arent many arguments for that statement. 
On the one hand side,  as I said before, kids like to watch Tv. On the other is it not good for their brain to watch too much Tv.
