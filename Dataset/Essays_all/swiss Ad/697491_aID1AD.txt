Many peoples in the world couldn't live without television. Because there are newsflashes, films, series, documentation, and much more. So, should watch young children with the age two to five television. But the big question is, should television advertising toward these young children be allowed.

The positive effects of advertising to children, is that they may learn what they like. Often children like the same tihngs in television as in their real life. Another effect is that they learn the language while they listen to it  and they also learn many voices of the life, like animal voices.
Negative effects are surely that if the children see and like an advertising of a television programm, they want to see it immediately. They seat before the television for hours, if the parents don't do anything, instead of going out and playing with other children. Television may also make the children unsure of what they already know, because not everyting in televison is true and many things are invented, The children may also have fear from some TV programms an due to this they might sleep bad.

In general I think the parents of the children should decide if television advertising to their children is okay. So, it's all right from the television company, if they make television advertising to young children, if parents want that, and in this sense it should be allowed and parents who didn't like this advertising to their children shouldn't let them know that. Because up to five years it isn't necessary to watch television, they can learn much more, while playing with other children or reading some books with many pictures and noices.
