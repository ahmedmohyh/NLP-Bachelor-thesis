Television advertising that is directed toward children seem usually harmless, since it is there to promote products and other things that seem harmless, as well.  However, what a young child doesn't notice is that commercials tend to be or normally are manipulative. Of course do young children want the toy which was presented to them in a commercial which shows how awesome that toy is and how it's going to impress their friends, even though this product will never live up to their expectations. Advertising is manipulative in general, but advertising that is targeted to children is often extremely exaggerated, too. Of course you could say that products that are made for kids don't cost a lot and that the company needs money, though there are a lot of commercials for different types of candy which are unhealthy. Television advertising generally presents sweets in a way, as if it were glorifying them and it's terrible that children think that unhealthy food is valuable. 
In conclusion, I have to say that I'm not against television advertising for kids in general, but I'm against the exaggerated ones which trick children into thinking they really need the aforementioned products. The problem is that children probably wouldn't want to buy them without such a commercial
