Advertisments for young childrens are very controversial, should they be allowed or not? I will explain the pro and contras in the following paragraphs.

Young children can be manipulated very easy, when they see something that looks nice, or toys which other children play with they want to have it. They believe everything which is showed in television. Such young children should't be influenced by advertisments. It is bad for the children if they are faced with all the advertisment, it can influence their learning and growing up process badly. Young children can't buy things themself so the adverisment shouldn't be directed towards them. The advertising should influence the parents through their kids. It tells young children to ask their parents to buy them things, this can influence the children-parent connection.

Companies which produce children toys also need to make advertising to sell their product. It is not fair to prohibit them to make any advertisments. The advertisment has to be directed to the people who use the product and if the poduct is for children the adverisment has to be directed towards children. It doesn't influence them to buy things because they are to young to buy so the adverisments can't make people to buy things. At the end the parents decide if they want to buy it.

I don't tink it should be prohibited to adverise towards young children but it should be controlled. Those advertisments should have special restrictions for young children. For me the bigger problem ist that the young children watch to much television and programes which aren't for their age.
