Young children nowadays spend their time in front of the TV more frequently than in the past. During this time they are confronted not only with the television shows directed towards them, but also advertising clips geared towards young kids. Some say, these television adverts should not be allowed. 
On one hand the television adverts give the children the opportunity to find toys that they would like to have and that they could wish for for their birthdays, christmas or other holidays. It broadens their knowledge of things they otherwise wouldn't know about. On the other hand these advertisings can lead to the young children developing a need that they otherwise wouldn't have for those material things. They create a sense of importance for material things in the children's minds. This can go as far as to children getting jealous of and starting fights with other children for having Toy "XY" that they saw in a certain television advertising.
Television advertising is always a manipulation and deceive of the viewer to some extent. Adults and adolescents are able to see past the appealing aspects of the product being advertised, young kids however lack that ability to judge and are thus bombarded with information that they can't properly comprehend. A child viewing for example an advert for popsicles in rainbow colours will want these popsicles just for their colour, while adults and adolescents will be able to tell that the rainbow popsicles will taste like any other popsicle of the same flavor.
I believe that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because of the negative effects it can have on the child.
