"Tlevision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" thats the topic today. First of all I have explain what I understand with the expression "young children", "young children" are kids aged two to five.
Is it okey to let the children watch televiion adversitising? Somepeople are strictly against it. But why?
A child is easy influencable it can see a toy adversitising on the television and it really wants it. Finally the mother has the decision between a child which cries the hole week long or to buy the toy. An other point is that the child can get a wrong idea about a product e.g something to eat which seems to be healthy but in real it isnt.
Eventhough how can we know on which server all those children are? How should we be able to bann the advertising exactelly at the time and the program where all the kids are? That sounds impossible for me. Wouldnt it be unfair for those who wants to sell the products for children, whereals should they make advertising? And dont forget, the child sees the product at the television and he fall in love with it, but his parents are the one who buy it.  Personally I think advertising is good, the child can see toys which he might whish for the next birthday. That means it makes children to decide by there one what they want. And the most important thing for me is thath the parents still have the final word.
