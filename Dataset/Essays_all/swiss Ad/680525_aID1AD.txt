In the last century advertising evolved into a new level. Through digital media it has become fairly easy to direct advertisment towards a certain social group. It is common for even young children to spend time watching television and thus being exposed to advertisment. This essay will discuss wether or not television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Young children do not yet have a sense of what is true and what is a lie. Because of this reason they should not have to deal with advertisement. If a child watches a person telling him that this is "the best toy in the world" it will certainly want one. At a young age a child will believe most of what it is told. The child is still learing about the structure of this world and having to deal with a person telling you what is better will influence the development of his liking drastically. To remain objective advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.

In contrast raising a child can never be objective and wether the child is influenced by advertisement or by his parents does not matter. In fact it might even be better if the child gets influenced by people other than it's parents. The child will then not grow fully according to the will of the parents which will grant it individuality. This is the reason why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.

In conclusion advertising can be a risk because it affects the thinking of a young child. Yet even though it is clear that the child is influenced this way, it can never be fully shielded from the influence of the outside world and this has to be taken into consideration when asking the question wether it truely makes sense to frobid a form of advertising which is onmnipresent in todays society.
