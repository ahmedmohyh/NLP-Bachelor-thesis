Little Max. Three years old. Hanging around the television all the time. He is really into it. His mum is a really busy woman. Her time for little Max is limited. So when she has to do important things for work, she turns on the television for little Max. Max's favourites are the teletubbies. He can't get enough of this colourful dudes, who are hanging around in a surrealistic house. He just loves them. Teletubbies is a nice programme for young children like Max. However during breaks in the programme, there is made lots of propaganda of diverse things.

Young children are really into playing with things. They like for example lego or playmobils. Imagine when they see the newest playmobil in TV. After seeing that propaganda, they just want that awesome playmobil! As a result they go to their parents and ask them to buy it. And not just one time. The young smart lovely children ask them until the parents say yes. And then the issue is by the parents. It is a quesion of: Raise the money or a continued asking and nerving period of the children. It is up to the parents.

Although I think television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Children are hungry to learn, try and descover new things. The world should be open to them. No excuses. Children have to learn. And the only way they are able to learn is when they make mistakes. And such mistakes can be made by watching television. 

To conclude it is a question of how parents react to television advertising. Because parents decide for the children. Television advertising is nothing bad. It could help the children to learn. So little Max is allowed to still watch his Teletubbies.
