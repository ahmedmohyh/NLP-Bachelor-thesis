Absolutely! Marketing should be made available to all customers subjecting themselves to the medium used to advertise the products. If parents have trouble with their toddlers demanding "Tracy's Fruit Blast Bubble Gum", then the appropriate solution would be to turn off the TV, or have their kids watch a different programm. After all; it isn't the kids that will end up buying the advertised products, so by targeting their age-group in advertisements they are not being exposed to anything that could affect them economically, nor are they prone to bad judgement (that would be the legal guardian). 
One of the few situations in which I would advocate for controlled advertisement is when it comes selling potentially addicitve or hazardous products to young adolescents, because this age group already has the means to buy the products, but lacks the judgement to decide whether or not that it's a good idea.
Where young kids are concerned however, it's up to the parents to decide what they want their children exposed to. At any rate, the only means of advertising products to toddlers and young children, are through a tv or (potentially) a radio, seeing as most kids in the targeted age-group will not have the reading skills (and will very probably lack the interest) to decipher the offers on billboards and posters set up in their immediate environment. So all means of advertising to small kids, are very easily controlled by their parents, and can easily be turned off, if the content is deemed unsuitable.
Also; how then would companies exclusively selling children's toys advertise their products if not to children? Sure...adults can be targeted too, but they will not always be "inspired" by the same products, as their squealing counterparts that always seem to know exactly what they want whenever they see a colorful picture of a toy. I mean...how on earth would My Little Pony have gotten started, if adults were the only ones who knew about the product?
