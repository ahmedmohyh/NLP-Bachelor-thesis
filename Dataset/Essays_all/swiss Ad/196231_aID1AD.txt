First I have to say, that i't's an interesting question. It's a new problem, that we don't know for a long time, because i'ts a new century with the televisions, smartphones and other electronic gadgets.Also the companys which make advertising are growing very quickly. Below I want to write about some pro and contra arguments and at the end I want to give a statement.

I'ts mean, because the kids can't handle whith these advertisings and the aren't able to know the value of money. That's an argument people say, who want to forbid the advertisings. They say that the childrens are very small and the can't protect from the advertising. Also they say i'ts not fair for the mother, because when the kids see something in the television they really want it and that's for the mother a hard time.

Now the people who think i'ts television advertising for these kids is correct. They say, that the mother can say no and when she once said no, the kids know that. So the mother has to be very strict the first time and after that i'ts no problem anymore. And these young kids don't have to watch television that often, they better play outise with other kids. Then the prolem is solved.

At the end my opinion. I think, that i'ts the responsibility of the mother and that she can handl it. Also the kids should better play outise, because they met other kids and i'ts more fun for them. So the televison advertising should be allowed.
