Televison advertising is definitely one of the most frequent forms of advertising because it reaches us in an easy way. It catches even more the attention from children than from adults, as adults are already informed about the function of advertisement in general and have therefore a more critical view on it. Children though might take it more seriously and get easily manipulated by it, mostly if it is a product made for children. As a result, they ask their parents to buy them products which have been in the advertisement. This of course is a problem for the parents, as advertisements may hang all over the place, not only are they found in television. 
On one hand, from an objective point of view we could say that aready watching to much television does harm to our children. Advertisment is not only the bad component of it. But still it makes already young consumers out of our children. Instead of doing more intellectual activities, they are manipulated and influenced negatively not only from advertisements but also from televison in general. 
On the other hand, what can we do about it? If parents dont allow their child to watch television, but the others do, then it may be excluded from the group, because the other children talkt about it and may get the newest products. So this can not be the solution.
In conclusion I would suggest that there is actually no way out of our consumer orientated world. We can not even protect our children, because nowadays, every child has an electronical device or is confronted with it at a very young age. In computer games there are advertisements too. And of course, going to cinema is a cool thing also for children. There, logically, we can not avoid a confrontation with advertisement.
