Should it be allowed to watch televison for young children? All parents can decide themself, but what are the arguments? Young children like to play, they are developing their creativ thinking. To be to long at the televison is also not good for their healthy. For me, it should not be allowed.

The hobby of little children is playing, playing everywhere they are. With food, toys, flowers, with every thing they have. If they are only watch television, they do not play. It is not normal.

Also because they watch to much, they can not develop their creativ thining. They have no exercises in makeing handcrafts. The young children watch sometimes a creativ programm, but can they do it also? 

Finaly if they do not go outside, their healty will not be very well. Children need the sunshine, the rain or cold weather to have a better immunsystem. But not only in this aspect is waching televions not good, also if the litte ones can not sleep because of the programm they wachted. Expecialy in the evening is not every programm useful for children. It is not good to have nightmars because of unrealistic or horrible things. Waching television to long is also not good for the eyes.

Still until now, we have no television at home. I did not miss it when I was young. I think, all parents how decide to not allowed their littel ones to watch TV do a great decision. If I am I' am not going to allowe my young children to watch televison.
