The time when a child is growing up is common to everybody. But in this society the children are confronted earlier with the media such like on the television, mobile phone or on the computer. While the parents let their children to watch childfriendly series on the TV there are also a lot of advertising. But is it good for a two to five year old kid to look at so many advertisements?
Nowadays the children are being raised with much more attention and love than in the past. It's known that parents usually want only the best thing for their child. For instance when a kid sees something interesting on the Tv like a toy, they want it. And the parents buy this toy because they know the child is going to play with it. So the parents have some "free time" and the kid can play with the toy and also with the creativity of themselves. 
But on the other hand the advertisements have an big influence on the children. Not everything that appears on the Tv is also good for your child. Today the opportunity to buy something is so big that means that the kids are constantly being confronted by advertisements on the Tv. It's clear to everyone that children are children and don't think the way that adults do. If they see something they want they're going to do everything just to have that thing. And with that behaviour they're going to want everything they see. They'll grow up with that behaviour and will be careless. So the television advertising has an bigger influence on the future life of the children.
Nevertheless are televisions a part of the todays society children. But we have to be carefull with how much time we spend or let our children spend with it. The technology is moving forward but we should not forget that we have a real life to live.
