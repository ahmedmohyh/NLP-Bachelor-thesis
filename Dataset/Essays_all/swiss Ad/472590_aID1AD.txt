At the moment the television is a big problem for the most children. So some people think that is better to not allowe the television advertising.

First the television isn't helpful for the children, because the childeren more like to watch televison, than play with other children. The social contact with other children isn't importent for the children. The biggest problem is, that they haven't any idear what to play in the nature and what to play with other childs. The children should have the option to be creative. The social contact is also importent, because they should learn how to handle a discussion. For a discussion they have to form an own oppinion and this is important for the graduation. An other point is that a television is expensive an not everybody can buy one, so the children become jalous of each other. Finally when the television isn't longer allowed, the children could play more outside and with other children.

One desagreement is that the televion shows also good things, from which the children can learn something. On the television are also documentations, which are very useful for everybody. Another point is that the televison brings up a lot of jobs. Every program on the television needs people who produce the series, the news, the shows and the documentations. One least point is that the television shows the news and the oppinion about diffrent subjects.

I think it's importent that the children play with each other, they could learn so much about everything, when the look where and why they live. But I think the television is another world, where the children can dream and do something else than everytime think and learn. So I thnink the television adverising should be allowed.
