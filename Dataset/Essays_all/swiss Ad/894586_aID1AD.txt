Television advertising is a very effective way to sell a company`s products. People will recognize one special song or slogan which leads them to remember the product of the television advertising and eventually buying it. But is it really appropriate for all the people who are watching TV? What about the younger generation, children from two to five years old? Will they be affected in any way by these advertising? In the following essay I will show the pro`s and the contras of television advertising directed toward children.

For the parents will it be very difficult if television advertising presents products like toys. Because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it for sure. But not all the parents can afford it.That makes it for them very difficult to explain it to their children. But if there are television advertising some special kind of healthy drink or food it can have a positive effect on the children. Maybe they are more aware of healthy eating habits and that helps them to stay healthy. On the other hand there are a lot of bad foods and drinks which are promoted in television. Like all the sugary soft drinks and creasy foods. That can have the exactly oposite effect.
I personally think that it really depends on the products which are promoted.There are a lot of good stuff but also a lot of bad stuff which can influence the children.
