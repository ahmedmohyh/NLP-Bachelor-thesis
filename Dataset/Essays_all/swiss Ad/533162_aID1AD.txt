Young children are not able in differentiating what they really need and what is good for them from what is not useful or fun at all. Neither are they able to decide if buying that toy is worth it regarding to the quality. 
On the other hand children have to make their experiences in life and first of all learn so many lessons in advertising as well. Kids aged two to five cannot really get what is said to them in television. What happens only is that they are like: "Oh I really want that". 
Children these days are watching TV more than they are playing in the woods. Making them seeing all these things like toys, movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse. They may even spend more time in front of a display.
But because of that trend that young kids want to watch more TV marketing functions on television. 

My personal opinion is young children may should not be confronted with direct advertising. We live in a time where marketing works like that. I think it is the responsibility of parents to protect their children from possible danger on television and internet. As long as television advertising is not too much and manipulating it is alright with me because our system works that way. The question of what is too much is hard to answer but I really think parents of their children are responsible for what their kids watch.
