Nowadays, if you watch Television it offen happens that you come across an advertising directed towards kids. I think these ads shouldn't be allowed.

First, they could be annoying for some grown up people, and in my opinion, the television belongs primarely to them. Kids should be playing outside, have fun and eventually do homeworks, they shouldn't watch TV all day long. That's why it is unnacessary to run commercials directed to little children.

Second, it's no secret that ads make people  want buying more things, that is their purpose. Grown-up people can ignore this strategy, little children on the other hand can't. They want to buy nearly everything they see in the TV. No wonder that kids are being spoilt nowadays, because their parents want them to have a good childhood and buy their children everything they wish for. They need to understand that working is an important thing in their life, and that, unfortunately, money doesn't just grow on trees.

Third, a big part of the commercials are food ads. They advertise all kinds of foods containing sugar and other harmful chemicals. Kids need to learn in their young ages that a lot of fat and sugar are not good for their health. If they watch plenty of ads in which other kids seem to have fun while eating unhealthy food they'll think it could also be a good thing for them.

I can understand that it isn't possible to permit the kids watching television, but we need to teach children in their young ages to be healthy and to handle their money well, they surely shouldn't buy everything they see, their parents work hard for the money, so should they.
