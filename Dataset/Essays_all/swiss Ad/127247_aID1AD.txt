"Mommy, daddy, pleeeease, can I have this?" Every parent knows the struggle. As soon as the child spots a cool teddy bear or a new doll in a TV commercial it has to have it. This often brings parents in difficult situations. They don't want to spoil their kids with new products but often can't handle the following drama when the kid doesn't get what it wants. So wouldn't parenting be so much easier if television advertising toward young children weren't allowed?

A big pro argument is the already mentioned situation. As soon as a kid sees a new toy in the TV, it wants it. Parenting would be much easier without these commercials because the kid wouldn't even know that these toys exist. People that are against this law claim, that the kid always sees new toys. In preschool, in kindergarden... there are always other kids with different toys. Their statement is that the TV commercial doesn't make that much of a difference and shouldn't be forbidden because ot that.

An argument against this new law is the fact, that children have to learn to deal with commercials as soon as possible. Nowadays, advertisements are everywhere. It is better if the child starts seing them with three and can learn early how to deal with the fact that there is an endless amount of toysand that it can't have everything.

In conclusion, there are many different opinions about this subject and not a simple solution. The problem is real and a new solution is needed.
