In my generation, we often talk about the developement from technology. It is no secret, that people today are more connected to technologys than ever before. The TV`s are getting bigger and bigger, it is no surprise, that children in young age are watching television about an hour or more a day. The world i going foreward, and today, watching television is normal, even for young children, but are we one the right way of our developement? When I was four years old, I playd the whole day with my toys and I think that experience is important. We learnd what it meant to be bored, and we learnd to do something on our own. I remember the first time I built an Lego house on my one. I felt like the king of the world, and is not that the experience, that children who only watch TV are missing? Another reasen, why I think that watching television in younf age is not good is, that the mother - child relation is not as good as if they would play with theyr children. Advertising Television should not be forbidden, but maybe it would be better, if parents would only let there children watch television about an hour a week. Maybe sometimes we should listen to the old people, when they are talking about "the good old times".
