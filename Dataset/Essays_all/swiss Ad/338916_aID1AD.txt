Should television advertising be allowed toward young children if you consider that they are not able to handle them yet? There is a lot of evidence which speaks against it because children of that age don`t really have the judemental possibilities as a grown up does. 

Imagine your kid sitting in front of your television, watching cartoons and there is a commercial break, which shows the newest toys, including this great little stuffed puppy, which can move and talk. Probably most children run up to their parents begging them to buy this new toy. Of course most parents don`t like to see teir kids disappointed and also don`t like the situation of a crying child begging for a toy, which is totally unnecessary. Another point is that it`s just not fair to produce television advertising for children because they are so easy to convince. They are not able to decide whether this is a trashy toy or not. As long as the commercial looks good and there is a nice music playing in the backround or even if it is just some television show related toy they want to have it. So it is not right if big companies try to use children to sell their toys. These companies make some of these kids unhappy and make them feel frustrated when they see this great toy commercial but they can`t get it. Also television advertising is something that kids can`t learn anything from by watching it and is pretty useless.

Over all I think it`s not correct to use yound children`s naivity for your business strategies and too sell a lot of toys. Parents should not need to handle their begging kids and there are still going to be enough sold toys because these children see them at other kids houses and on the playground where they get their wishes and tell their parents.
