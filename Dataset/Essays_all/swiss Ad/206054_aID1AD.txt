Advertising nowadays is something really important. The economy to a huge part would not function without advertising. A big part of the  money-making egame are the kids because if they see something they want to have it immeadiatly, it doesn't matter in whichway. As a birthday present, as a christmas present from the their grandparents, or even from their own pocket money. So that's why the children from the age two to five are a huge target in the economy.That leads to the reason, that the economy would never want  the advertisment to be bained.On the other hand the mother's don't have it easy with the advertisments, because the children would become spoiled, if they got everything, they saw and wanted. So in the end not only they would not lettheirchildren see  the advertisments, it would lead to not letting them watch television in the first place. What would bother and harm the TV channels which are specialy made for kids in two diffrent ways.For example none of the children would watch tekevision so they would haveless viewers which would lead to less companies that are ready to pay their channal forrunning their advertisment. I think that everything should have a balance, so that everything can work whilethe other is working.
Like the kids should not watch that much television and desire for everything they see, but chose one thing that they like. Meanwhile the chaannels for kids should not show many diffrent kinds od advertiesment ina break between to shows. They should alwasy show the same three advertiesments. One for boys.one for girls and another one for food. Lastly the thing companies could do is not bring out.
