Television advertising directet toward young children

Nowadays nearly every child has the opportunity to watch televison and use laptops, tablets and smartphones. On each of this electrinical devices advertising is directed toward young children. They show the newest toys so that the children get attractet to them. But should this and mostly television advertising be allowed or not?

On the one hand, 10 years ago children didn't watch so much television like nowadays. So if a child, which is a lot at home, sees television advertising with toys and it despritly wants them, it could be a possibilty for the child to go and play outdoors and do physical activity. Children had to learn to be resistent toward television advertising because in the adulthood the situation will not change. They should learn to see which other things exists but also to say sometimes no to them.

On the other hand, it's the responsability of the parents to look after their children and to pay attention that they don't watch too much television. Children are influented by the television advertsing, for example if a child aged five is in the kindergarden and it sees another child with the latest toys, it could get an impression of beeing lower than the other child. It gets a wrong impression of himself and the world. For single parents with finanical problems, television advertising could be a problem, because their children want the newest things which are mostyl very priceful and maybe they can't afford them. So parents are also influented by advertising and are put into pressure because they want to give their children everything they desire.

In my opinion the arguments against television advertising toward young children are more important, because children are too young to decide what they want. They don't even know that they are influented by advertising and they have no chance to escape from them because they are everyhwhere present. Children should be more protected!
