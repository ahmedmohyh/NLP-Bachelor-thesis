We see advertising nearby everywhere and all the time. In the newspaper, on big walls in the city, in the bus and also in television. Companies invest a huge amount of money to present their new products in television advertising  to us, but should it be allowed to make advertising directed toward young children?

Firstly I want to consider, that not many children aged two to five are watching television. Children are often playing with there new toys or with their brothers and sisters. Therefore they will not even see the adverts in the television.

Secondly children are confronted with advertising the whole day. They can see adverts in magazines, hear it in the radio and there are many other examples. So why should it be not allowed to make advertising in television? It would make more sense to either forbid any advertising for young children or just allow advertising in any form.

On the other hand, advertising can influence young children. If they see stunning products in television they want them too, instead of playing with their old toys or with their brothers and sisters.

All things considered, I think it should be allowed to make television advertising for young children. There are adverts nearby anywhere, therefore it woud make no sense to forbid television advertising for young children.
