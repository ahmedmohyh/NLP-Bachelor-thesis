I agree with the fact that the children should not be influenced at such a young age by television advertising, because the advertising could have a bad influence and it could be a promise of something the children could never get to. Firstly I think that from television advertising only the people behind the advertising profits and almost never the people who watch the advertisement. I also ask myself what these advertising should be about for children at the age of two years. They wouldn't even understand any adverstisement. I found that they are way too young at the age of two to really understand what an advertisement is about or they would get it the wrong way. For the people who make those advertisements it is for sure a good invention, because children are very quickly excited about things. So when they see a new thing made for them on television most of them would get their parents to buy it. On the other hand I think it is best when young children just watch some series or movies made for children. Because with advertising for instance for a new toy, the child wants all this stuff and has high hopes. But in realitiy a majority of them wouldn't get it. In addition to that, the advertising could also be used for bad. With that I mean that there may be a new product, but it is for example not good for the environment or the child's health.
