In Switzerland people watch tv three hours a day on average. That's quite a lot of time. Even in young children's life television is very present. A tird of the time people watch tv, they watch advertising. The following essay is going to explain why advertising should not be allowed toward children aged two to five.

At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising. If children are young they are very good-beliving. They think that everything people say in tv it's true. That means that they are very easy to improve. That's exectly what the advertising companies want to do. 

At the second place, advertising learns young children a false way to see the world. Well, advertising is all about material things. It learns that your cool or popular if you have a lot of stuff. But that's totally wrong. It's all about your caracter and not about what you posses.

Not to forget is, that not all of the families have a lot of money to use for their childrens toys. That can be very stressing for parents if they aren't able to buy all things their childrens wish. Other parents maybe are able to buy their children the newest toys, they saw in advertising spots. That couls cause that children are jealous of each others. 

In conclusion, advertising towards young childrens causes lot of problems. Not only because of jealousy, it also shows the good-believing children a fals way of life. Thats why it shouldn't be allowed.
