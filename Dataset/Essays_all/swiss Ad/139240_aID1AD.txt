A reason for such television adverstisings is that it may as well be funny for the children and that they could learn a lot. If a little child for example loves television advertising it can have a lot of fun. 
Another advantage is that it can give the parents more free time. If the parents have a lot of work to do or would just like to relax and not always look after their child, the child can do something "alone" (without the parents). 
It can also be very helpful for young children if they see a lot of different things which is the case with television advertisings. 

A reason against those television advertisings is that young children usually do not really understand what they are doing. This is more often the case with younger children which are for example two or three years old. 
Furthermore, are many young children forced by their parents to do something they actually do not want to do. A young child who is for example two years old can not decide what it wants to do because it is too young and the parents would not listen to it anyway. 

I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because young children should play outside and have an adventurous but calm childhood. If they spend most of their time with television advertising they have less free time in which they can do whatever they want. Surely, there are some children who would love to do this but most of the litte children just want to play with for example lego or barbies. Then the parents should not force them to do anything they do not want to. I think that the children have enough time to do something with television advertises when they are older but when they are young they should be able to play outside with some friends and just enjoy their free time.
