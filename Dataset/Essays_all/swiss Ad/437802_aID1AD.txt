Advertising

I'm absolutely not ok with the fact, that there are so much ads in thelevisions for children. And I think it would be absolutely ok if the gouvernment would forbide that. It's really a shame, that such young children are confronted daily with televisionads that want to influence them to want for example this new baby born or the fastes toycar. Children can't decide what's necessary or good for them. They just see that ad and suddenly they want this new thing really bad. On the other hand we could say that we're living in this new kind of world and that we're confronticed with these kind of things on a daily bases is just normal. So because of that I think it should be much more important to inform parents about these subjects. When we have to accept the worl as it is it's much more important to make a change there, where it acually helps. There are a lot of parents, who leave their children (expecally in the holidays) for hours in front of the television. This is probably the biggest problem. Because when they wouldn't do that the children wouldn't be confronted with such television ads and then probably the producers would stop to produce ads for children because none of the chidren whold watch them. So maybe it's not the right way to forbide these ads but change our habits and expecially help the parents who just don't know it better than leave their children in front of the tv. I think these would be absolutely the better way. Maybe it could also be a mixture of both of them. When we could minimize these ads and also help the parents to be with their children and go outside with them to do things together and things like this would probably be the best solution of all.
