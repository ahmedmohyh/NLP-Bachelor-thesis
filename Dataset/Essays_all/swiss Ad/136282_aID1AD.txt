The importest argument for television advertising directet toward young children is that the chlidrens should learn what they should do and how to react with these television advertising. It's a important thing to learn in the young age to not be infulenced by something. With television advertising the children can also see what for new stuff to play are coming out and so can decide wich play they want to wish maybe for a birthday. Children television also have to win money and thats impoossible without television advertising.

Argument against television advertising directed toward young children is that it's to dangerous. It's possible that the children want every month new plays and just beacouse they see it on the television. And is it really okey during a children television show to see a television advertising? Another point is that television advertising influence children often in a negative way. In the view of the parents it's also a point of saftey and responsbility who must to be there or even not.

For me it's to dangerous and a to big responsibility for the parents. It's complicated when television advertising show things that children shouldn't see in this age. I think also that it's important to grow up without to be influenced with television advertising. It's not a good point to be influenced in the aged of two to five. They would be enough influenced in a older age.
