First of all, I think it is quite difficult to direct advertising towards individuals that haven't yet learned any language to a degree at which they completely understand the advertising. You could only make ads about toys in which you just show the object you are advertising. Because this does not correspond to the "guidelines", to which ads are created in order for them to be as effective as possible in finding new customers for the advertised goods, it would not be very efficient to show lots of ads directed at young children. If this statemnt is true, the density of child-directed advertising is quite low in public television. Why does this matter? A person defending the original statement would probably argue, that those ads may "brainwash" a child. It could be influenced by the ads in ways that do not correspond with the principals of the parents or the daycare of the child. However, in my opinion, this is not a realistic problem. A child between the age of 2 and 5 is in the process of learning to behave according to its surroundings. Television is a quite widespread form of entertainement right now, and so the child will also be exposed to television and its advertisements. The chance of a child being badly influenced by the ads directed towards it is extremely low. Even the ads not directed at the child may pose a bigger problem than the ones who were made to be watched by children. 
Personally, I don't see a reason why advertising directed towards young children should be prohibited. Especially if the normal advertising directed towards adults would still be shown to children.
