Television Advertising And Children

First of all, advertising isn't any good at all, but for the advertisers. But how much can advertising harm little children?

It is known, that it is easy to manipulate little kids. This is because they don't know as much as older people, therefore, they only have one choice: Believe or not know anything at all. An easy question for most. For example, if you tell your little brother, that a lion is about three meters high, he probably will believe you. But what does it have to do with television advertising? Often, even adult people get manipulated by television, because modern psychology and technic are much better and also much more dangerous today. Today, people just know better how to manipulate humans and in advertiseing, it is all allowed that isn't not allowed. But when even adult people can't defeat themselves sometimes, then little children can't at all.
Also, children are learning the most in their first years, so when they learn that advertising is something good, and that they should by more, than they grow up as big consumers, and it's known, that humans already consume more than the earth could ever give in time. The world doesn't need more consumers.

But on the other hand, if they watched the advertising with their parent, then probably the could learn how to react and think of it, so it wouldn't do any harm. It's just bad luck, that parents don't have enough time to observe children's television the whole day long.

In conclusion, advertising isn't that dangerous for children if they watched it with their parents, but as long as the don't have enough time, it could harm them and transform the children to little consumer, wich of course nobody need. Because it is more harm than good, I'm definately against directing television advertising toward young children.
