The first thing that comes in my mind reading this statement is that there are only toy companies which advertise towards young children. Advertisement are here to attract a specific group of people to buy something. What else  would a child desire than toys? 
We all now young children like to scream and cry if they do not get what they want immediately. It would therefore be a nightmare for parents if their child wishes for a toy  it just saw on the TV and starts to cry because the toy does not magically appear.
But the parents should not just shut down the television for their child. Nowadays the TV plays a major role in our society especially during the childhood. The cartoons and the early-morning serie cheers every child up. The advertisement shows a child what is up and popular these days.
There may be some conspiracies that advertisements have hidden manipulative effects and are therefore a bad influence on children. It might be far fetched but humans in this young stage of life are the most influencal and they can easily be convinced to something. That would be one of the greates fears for over-protective parents.
In conclusion people should be less paranoid about the advertisement having a bad influence on their child. Most of the advertising are for toys and there is probably no evil mastermind behind the screen who tries to manipulate the child from an ad. Parents should be more concerned about their child browsing the internet.
