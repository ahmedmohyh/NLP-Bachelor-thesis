I think that children aged two to five are to young for advertising. They can't decide what they need. If a child sees a toy in an advertising it want this toy and it wants his parents to buy it. And young parents perhaps can't say no to their child and in the next day this child sees another toy in the tv. And when this child is a little bit older or when it is a teenager it could be that it is very polished. And it's also possible that when these children are older they only have to buy all these things which they have seen in the advertising because they got everything they want when they were a child from their parents. 

In my opinion telvevision advertising should only be allowed to adults or teenager. Because children not even have money to buy this things. If a teenager sees something in an advertising it could work and do a job to earn money. Like this also a teenager could earn money and buy something they want. That's the only good aspect of the advertising  in the tv direct toward teenager. So a teenager don't get everything simply from his parents but it works for it and learns to fight for the things they want. 

So I think televison advertising should not be allowed to young children because like this they don't learn to deal with money and for them it's normal that they get everything they want.
