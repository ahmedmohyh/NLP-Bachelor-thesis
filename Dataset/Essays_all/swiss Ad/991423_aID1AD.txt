I personally disagree with this statement. There are important argumentations which should be considered.

First of all the negative aspects. Parents should not force their children to do such an advertisement. When the children grow up they could be ashamed of themselves. If the friends of the child is seeing him on televison, he or she could be treated badly for some reasons. Parents could leed them to a TV-star career, as well as the child did not want to. So it will not be happy for the rest of his or her life.

Now we move on to the positive aspects. If the family is poor and they need money urgently, this could be the only way to escape from their financial situation. Another reason could be if the child wants to be in the advertisement and the parents cannot reject it. In addition not that intelligent children can be used to complete such an easy task or if their school has not a good education level. 

To sum up,in one hand I would not let my child play in an advertisement but in the other hand it should not be forbidden. There are some good positive aspects and every family should decide itself.
