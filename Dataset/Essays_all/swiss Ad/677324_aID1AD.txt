Today a lot of children aged two to five watch TV.Shoud that be forbidden? Why should this be forbbiden or why not?

Children aged two to five shouldn`t watch tv, because thy learn a lot of things in this years like how to climb on trees.But wen they watch TV they don`t go in the nature and don`t make experience for her lfe. They only sit infront of the TV and do nothing.They don`t do sport,they don`t learn how to make a fire or how to swim,On the plus side you learn the language when you watch TV and you can learn a lot of new words.When you watch TV aged two to five years you could see thing who could destroy your fantasy or things who could shock you because as child you live in your world and you never have seen blood. Then when you see blood you could have nightmars.When you watch TV you do nothing dangerous so it could be good to watch TV aged two to five years because you don`t hurt yourselfe or do other bad things when you wath TV.

So you see there are a lot good and bad things about watching TVaged two to five years.You can`t say it`s very bad or it`s very good to watch TV in these years,but in my opinion it`s bat to do it because in my childhood my parents did a lot of things with me. I always was in the nature and everything was a new experience and made me very fun.I guess you feel afraid if you look back to you childhood and you only watched Tv all the time,because you haven`t done somthing real and you haven`t got a lot of beautiful experience.
