Once upon a time not long ago there was a girl. Her name was Rose Van Wood. She'd  just finished High School. One day she got a letter from a special college. The name of the college was HellDeep. In the letter they told her that she's a special teenager and that HellDeep is made for those special Students. She was so excited and couldn't believe that she made it. The next day was the first schoolday in college. Rose couldn't sleep because she was to excited for this new special school. At 8:00 am a big yellow bus stood infront of her house. She took her schoolbag and her jacket and went outside.The inside of the bus was quiet normal and it didn't felt special. She sat down and waited. After the bus picked up some other students the bus driver warned us to stay in our seats and put our seatbelts on. Suddenly the bus started flying. She couldn't believe what happend but it just felt right. Then they arrived. The school looked big and modern. A guy appeared and made a tour with them on the campus. He was quiet cute tall with blue eyes and she thought she could have lost herself in those eyes. After morning lessons they finally had lunchtime. She thought about her class and she really liked them all but there was this one girl, Raven. She wasn't the yellow of the egg but it went. Rose took her vegan avocado-chicken wrap and she just wanted to start eating but this other girl Rave came to her and took it away from her. Rose was so perplex but she knew this girl should be her new best friend for life.
