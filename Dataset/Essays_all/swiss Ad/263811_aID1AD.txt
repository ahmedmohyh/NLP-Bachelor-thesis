Some companies use advertisements specially directet toward young children. They may do this for a lot of even understandable reasons. But still, some poeple don't think this is a good thing to do. It's a very discussed topic, and especially parents are against it. But why?

Television advertising allows you to do a lot with the thing you want to sell that would not be possible in real life. Using this type of advertising, one can basically lie to the people with saying, for example, that a tv or a computer has this or that function, while in reality, it's actually not true. This is something you learn while growing up; every advertisement is totally exagerated and you should not believe all of it. Small children don't get this, they believe in the things they see. So, on one hand, tv advertisements can kind of manipulate children very easy.

On the other hand, these kinds of advertising, the ones that manipulate the children, can also be used in a positive way. The children can be made to do something good. For example, if their favourite movie character tells them on tv to clean up their room, they will more likely do it than if their parents told them. Even if the whole thing is an advertisement for some kind of trash can, it leads the young ones to do something that is good for them.

As for my opinion, the first point seems to have more importance, since I don't think that small children should be manipulated in any way. Very little or even never are advertisements meant to do somethiing for the children, they are all made to do the same; to make people buy the product. I can also understand why parents are against it. It must be very stressful when their kids beg them to buy something every time they watched tv.
