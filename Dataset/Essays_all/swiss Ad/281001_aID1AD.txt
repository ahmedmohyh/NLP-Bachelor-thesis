Should television advertising toward children between two and five be allowed?

Here in Switzerland you are allowed to make advertisments towards people at all ages. So in that case also to young children between the age two to five. As far as I concern, these adds mostly contain toys or fun activities.

Toy companies or companies who sell products for children wouldn't be to happy if their kind of adverts would be forbidden, because they live off their products and it would influence their selling-quotes a lot. They also find that it's a good idea to start influencing the kids at a young age, so they get used to it and continue buying stuff from TV adds.
These adds are also good for our economie, because more gets sold and therefor more money's around. 


I think these young children aren't old enough to decide what they want or need to buy, so the adverts influence the a lot more as you would think. Parents with young kids often have the problem that their kid want's to buy the newest and coolest stuff from TV. That will mostly end in tears and nobody likes situatuion like that.

In my opinion parents who have a problem with their children wanting to buy stuff shouldn't let them watch TV all day. I think advertisments should be allowed for
