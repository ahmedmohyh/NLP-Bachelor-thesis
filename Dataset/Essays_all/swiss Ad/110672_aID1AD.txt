In the following I'm going to show the pros and contras to the topic: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

First of all I'd like to say that this is a question of faith and also of the way parents raise their children. For exemple there are a lot of diffrence between the Moslems and the Christans in the way of what they eat or what clothes they wearment could be that it's important for the kids to learn early about what life is really about. But in the most of the hollywood films a situation is shown too bad or too good than it really is. The only thing that matters is having a big audiance. The problem is now when kids are watching television or making a film they don't know what is realistic and what not. In this case it would be good if television advertising directed toward young children were not allowed. But on the other hand there are also positive aspects if it would be allowed: The young children can early learn the language corretly and this is a thing they thankful their whole life.

I think the environnement around the child is the thing that matters the most. That means that the parents can influence the child significant. If the parents think it is a bad thing giving their permission to the kids to watch television it should not be allowed and otherwise is should.

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be forbitten because it effects the child in this young age of only two to five age badly.
