When discussing about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not you can choose between two different points of view. There are several arguments that speak for and against it. 
Nowadays, young children are already watching television. Their parents prefer to let them be entertained in front of the television instead of raising them up properly. Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching. They can't distinguish nor memorise the information they receive from the television. On the other hand, allowing children to watch television advertisiments may lead to damage in the long-term as they start requesting the advertised products.
In addition to this, a young child may not even be capable of thinking on its own yet. It may not link the idea of seeing a product on an advertisement and the idea of going to the store to buy it. Also, children aren't even capable of going to the store on their own, so advertising for young children on television may really just be a waste of money. In comparison, one could also say that in the long-term young children may really feel the urge of buying advertised products as they were introduced to advertising very early in their life.
In conclusion, I want to mention that, in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be prohibited because it probably doesn't affect the children in the long-term. I would even go so far as calling it a waste of money because it won't be the children who buy the products but their parents.
