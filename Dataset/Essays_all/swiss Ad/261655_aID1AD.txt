Television is a good way to advertise new things. But the problem is that a lot of young children watch Telvesion and are influenced by those who are directed to them. So should this be forbidden in the future?

I think that it does not have to be forbidden. In the age form two to five you do not have a lot of knowledge and you do not understand everything you see in the television. So I think that young children don't even realize what they are seeing or hearing in an advertisment. They only want to see their show and don't care if an advertisement shows up.

They maybe only realize something when there comes an advertisement for a toy that seems funny and interesting. Then they ask their parents if they could have this toy but the child does not have a say in that decision. The parent decides if they go buy it or not. So even if they are influenced by the advertisement they can not go buy it themselves and probably forget about it a week later.

So the question should rather be if it is worth making an advertisement that is specifically directed to young children or if it is just a waste of money and time. Because I don't think that the children get influenced by advertising in a bad way. Maybe they even get used to it for later and don't get annoyed that easy when they see an advertisement later in life.
