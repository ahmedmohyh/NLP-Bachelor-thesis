In our generation where we're  srounded by media, there are different ways to make advertisements to  increase the selling of a product. One exempel is the television. From this media we constantly get informations, also from brands that are trying to reach the highest sellings. Not only adults are confronted with this type of aim also children are not save from people who want every little space to fill it with their advertisements. But, is it okay to speak to children this sort of message?
In the one hand, I don't think that this is the right way because than the children learn in their smal age to consume and to spend money.For instants, when the marketing manager are advertising with barbie, than they do it in a unhealthy. That means that they put barbie in a better spot. From her body till her image, there are many  ways. In the other hand, the children learn to get used to this stuff and they learn, with the help of their parents, to be wide awake of manipulation.
