I think when someone wants to make television advertising toward young children he should be able to do it.
Maybe some parents doesn't like it because the children don't stop asking for the thing in the ad. That could be annoying for the parrents but I think, children in the age of two to five ages shouldn't shouldn't be allowed to watch television anyway. So it is the fault of the parents, not of the ad.
But when it wouldn't be allowed, what would stand in the law? There is no definition of advertising for a two year old. And what is the difference between advertising toward five and advertising toward six year old? It wouldn't be possible to control this law.
For example: There is a game and the game would be for 6 year old childrens. But also younger childrens would like this game. So the advertising would be for six year old childrens but also the 3 year olds would like it.
