I thing that it's hard to say if it's good for little kids to watch television or not. Because we people grew up with the social media.
It depend for how long we watch and for how many times. 

Pro: If you want to do something for example cooking dinner you can put your child in front of the television and he is looking at the programm. It's very helpful beacause we can do oure own things without looking or playing with the child. The child would be concentrate on the Tv show.

Pro: There are lot of intelligent Programm. The young childrens can learn a lot of things. For example: The moves or a melodie of a song. It's good that they are doing "healthy programm"  because it's less dangerous to become stupid. 

contra: Maybe two years it's a little bit to early to put his child infront of the televison. Of the age of four it's the best older to start.If we put them with a early age infront of the Tv the child would be used to watch it too much. That's really bad because a young person should have other interst for example playing games or drawing.

Contra: There are a lot of stupid Programm and a little child could copie this bad things and could become stupid as well.

I think it's bad to watch every day television but if it's not every day and not to long it would be fine.
