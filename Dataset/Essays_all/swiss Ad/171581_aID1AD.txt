Young children get fascinated way faster than older people do. Often they see things they like and than they want them immediately. They do not consider if they really need something or if they just want to have them because it looked cool in the television. So if they see an advertising they like they go to their parents to ask if they could go and by it. As many parents can not restist to fullfill their children's wishes, they have to go and buy the stuff. Sometimes the children literally have to beg their parents to buy it, even though it is really unnecessary or they do not even need it. 

In my opinion you can not say that it should not be allowed because than the parents would have to forbid their children to watch television and we all know that this is never going to happen. But in fact many companies nowadays try to promote their new products by showing them in the television. It is a very good thought of them because everybody who owns a television is able to see those advertisings . And who gets easier fascinated than young children?

Of course there will always be people who say that it should not be allowed because it is not fair for the parents to disappoint their children if they will not buy the things shown in the television. I do can understand those people but I think you just have to let your children watch television and we have to consider that there are also channels especially for children with way less avertising than on normal channels.
