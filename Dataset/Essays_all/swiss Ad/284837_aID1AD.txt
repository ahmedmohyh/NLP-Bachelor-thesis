When you watch a movie with your child, the worst thing that could happen for you is, that your little son or girl stresses you all the time, because he or she has just seen a new advertisment of a huge and expensive Lego-castle. The children always want to have it. So should it be allowed to show television advertising directed towards your young children?

For the companys the best thing to sell there toys is it to show them to the children. If a little boy watches the advertisment of for example a Lego-castel, the chance that he wants to have it imediately is very big. And after he has seen it, he would go to there parants and stress them with the new Lego toy, up to the moment, wherethey go together to the next shop and buy that castel. Another point for the advertisment is the TV-sponsoring. Every child likes it to watch TV. But who acctualy pays the TV? A big part pays the sponsors. They pay money for that they can put there advertisment into the breaks of the movie. And without that TV-sponsoring, we couldn't watch movies on TV.

On the other hand children become manipulated by the advertisments on television which is not good for there development. In addition to that, a child should not see disturbing advertisments like them of a shootergame or stuff like that. So the advertisment should be at least filtered. Another point is, that the children like it more to watch there movies, then the advertismentof a f.e. cupcake store. 

Although there are some positive aspects to the television advertisment, I am against the television advertising directed toward children, because it might desturb the childhood and it manipulates the children.
