Watching Television today isn't possible without seeing lots of adverts, which are trying to convince us to buy or do something. People seeing said adverts can either resist them or not. This goes for people of all ages. My question is, shouldn't we teach young children to resist their wishes to buy something they saw on television?

First off, I want to list some arguments which might be bad about television advertising directed towards toddlers. 
Children are said to be more gullible, we all know it; someone told us a fantastic story and we instantly believed it because we couldn't know why this shouldn't be true, why this person would lie to us. It's the same with television advertising. If someone tells toddlers to buy something for example a game, because it's funny and super cool they would want it, because why not, but then they can't have it because their parents might say no and they are sad.

But I mean, why shouldn't they see those adverts about this game they like, the parents still take contol over their child and it's not like a five year old could even grab his purse and go buy his beloved game. No. The parents can still say no and teach their kid to not listen to the adverts. Worst case scenario would be, the toddler throws a tantrum, but in most situations like this, he will calm down and forget about this game.
And the parents could even profit from television advertising directed toward their toddler. They might see the reaction this game got out of the kid, and they know what to buy him for christmas.

In my opinion, we should educate our children and let them watch those adverts, teach them how to resist their urges. And, it's maybe even easier for the parents to know what to give their little one for his birthday or christmas.
