I think television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. Children aged from two to five years are just in the beginning of their development as humans and do not understand the consequences. Teenagers and even adults have often problems with getting influenced by advertises so how could we think they would not even more harm to these small children.

In these days when there is advertising everywhere it is almost inevitable that the children see it too. But the advertizes directed straight to them are the probably the most harmful. As an example a commercial from fast food restaurant in which they offer a free toy with the meal can be really damaging to these young children. They do not understand consequences of eating unhealthy food. 

There of course advertises of positive things as well and it would be hard to regulate which advertises are allowed and which not. I still think we should try to do our best to not get the kids influenced by advertising because of the numerous bad side-effects they cause.
