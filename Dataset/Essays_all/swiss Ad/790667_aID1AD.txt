Advertising:

The television advertising which is for example about "pampers" is not for the young children self. The advertising is for their parents that they have to buy this article for their children. The advertising need little children for this video because in my example the adults can't wear "pampers". It would be very funny but it wouldn't be their idea.
After watching this advertising the young children often want everthing. They want every playmobil and lego and everthing. It must be very hard for the parents to disapponting their childern again and again. 
I think that the people who makes this advertising for young children article doesn't directed their advertising toward young childern because they don't buy it. They have to do it for the parents. They want that the parents buy this article and so they use little sweet children for their television advertising because every adult think about them "oh they are so sweet" and this could be a good idea. After watching that the adult buy the article. But I also think that in this age the children have to play something outside int the forrest oder something like that and not watching TV. So it wouldn't be a problem when every child in this age doesn't watch TV because I think in this age the children need to play and they are not allowed to watch TV. My opinion is that the television advertising could be directed toward young children because it's the problem from their parents when they allowed their children to watch TV.
