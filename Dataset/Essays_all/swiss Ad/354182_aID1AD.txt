Many parents know the problem. They let theyr young children watch television and after 15 minutes they start calling you and are shouting "I want this, please mom, can I get one?". The mother than looks at the advertised product and is looking for a way to get out of this situation.

I think everybody can remember a situation in his or her childhood where he or she bought something that was cool for a week or two but afterwards was just laying aroung and was never used again. Children don't have a relation to money yet. They don't really know what they want too and change theyr mind felt every five minutes. On short term the effect of advertisment on children ist just that the parents buy more but longterm it supports the consuming society and the waste of things. Children learn to get everything they want and just buy it. This situation will change a little when getting older but they will still buy much more stuff than they need and they probably have money for.

On the other hand, how do you want to change this. It istn't possible for the television to notice if there is a two year old or a six year old watching. But if you want to change something it had to be controlled because just airing no advertisments is no option. The television company has to finance themselfe and there is not really another way than doing this with advertisments. This whole situation depends on the parents if they really want to buy this or not. It can also be a chance for the parents to teach theyr kids how to handle money and that they don't have to get everything they want.

For summing up I would say that the present sitation isn't the best but there is no other way to deal with it and the parents should make the best out of the situation and use it for them.
