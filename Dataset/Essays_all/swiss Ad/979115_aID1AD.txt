Young children are influenced a lot, especially by television advertising. They are very interested in things that move or make noises. So television advertising which is about some toys and is directed toward young children is an extremly clever move from the company. When a Child sees some of these advertisings it is fasctinating by the object or the product they want to sell right away. They tell their parents what they saw and that they want them to buy it. Most of the time the parents buy it because they want to make their child happy. In this case it's very good for the company and they sell a lot of their products. 
But on the other hand if the advertising is not about a product but about a place like Disneyland, it's also good for the company but not very fair for the children.  Because not all about an advertising is true. Often the company exaggerate a lot and try to make the thing, they want to sell, look nicer. 
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children, doesen't make any diffrence to advertising which is directed toward adults. Of course children are a lot easier to convince but in the end the parents have to be convinved by the product because they buy it.
