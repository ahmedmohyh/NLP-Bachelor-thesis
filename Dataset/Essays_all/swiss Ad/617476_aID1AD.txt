The question is simple, like a monster is disguise,
should child equipment be directly advertised?

It doesn't matter if the families are wealthy,
we all agree that televivion is unhealthy.

But does the young age of toddlers affect
the television's unhealthy effect?

I've never been a good essay writer,
but when I write raps I appear brighter.

We all agree that there's no recipe
for right behavior on TV,
you know it's better not to mess with me,
'cause I can be your worst enemy.

A negative part about advertisement
is that in TV there aren't many wise men,
because all they care about is finance,
when I think about it I get frightened.

Not to mention that it's all a big contest,
and that the black boxes are like bombshells.

We can see the result in their notes,
how the stupidity explodes.

But in the end it doesn't stop the evolution,
I think about it writing my conclusion,
Forbidding it seems to me very useless,
so I'd allow it actually undisputed.

I don't know who I wrote this for,
but they can never enter my door,
where I keep my core,
my holy source of rhymes, that's for sure.
