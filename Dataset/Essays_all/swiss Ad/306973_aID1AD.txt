The television is a good thing, when you are bored and when you have nothing to do. Unfortunalety parents give childreen the permission to watch TV, mostly when they have not very much time for them. So the childrens have soemthing to do and the parents won`t be disturb by their childrens. With the time young children came much earlier in contact with the TV or also with computers or smartphones. 
But what are the consequences of the children, if they look to early TV or thing like that?
If the partens are stressed they can say to the childrens that they have to look TV, so most of the childrens are quiet calm and they are very focused on the TV. It depends of cours, which program they watch. Sometimes there are really good programms for kids which be very informativ. The kids can learn things from docus about animals or just thing which are important for the world. But there is also a bad site. In the TV programm are many thing which childrens should not watch. If young childreen watch very often TV they know only this and maybe their social behaviour will be not very good after. 
My oppinion is that young children can watch Tv but not very often, maybe one or two times a week for one hour. But the parents should be there and they have to controll what the childrens watch. Kids should play with their games and with their friens, this is much importer than watching TV. But I think that kids which are younger than four should not watch TV often or weekly because they don`t realise really what is happening there. 
Finally I say they should not be allowed or not. It`s a thing which the parents should say and they can make a desicon how often they want that their childrens watch TV. But I think they are also interessted that their childrens play with the games and their friends and not only watching TV.
