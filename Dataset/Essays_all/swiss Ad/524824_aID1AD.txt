When I think about television advertising directed toward children aged two to five I think about adverts for toys. The purpose of these adverts is to awaken the interest in these children for asking their mommy or daddy to buy them these toys. So they begin to want to buy things at a very young age and crave for material things. The idea behind this may be that companies want to integrate people into the economical system already at a young age so they learn how to have the need to buy things and therefore will contribute to the constant cicle of production and consumption, which keeps our economy going. However at a young age we do not understand how to handle money, so we obviously always have to ask mommy and daddy to buy these toys for us. This shows the importance of the parents in how they respond to the children watching these advertisements. If they constantly buy you all these toys we get used to living in a world of overconsumption and the constant craving for material things, which is good for the economy to bloom, in other words, we carry a major importance of the contribution to the economy. If we would not watch these advertisements, what so ever, I do not think it would make that big of a difference, to be honest, because when older people who didn't watch much television at a young age will consume as much as people who did.
So conluding these last statements I do not see any reason why television advertising should not be allowed for younger children.
