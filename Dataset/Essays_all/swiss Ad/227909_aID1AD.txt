Education depends on the parents. Following, a freedom of advertising should be guaranted because the parents should know what their children should watch on TV or buy at the gasoline station. Especially when they are under 5 years old they have to be watched. The government cannot take a part of the responsibility of education from the parents away. A law in this direction would be a statement against the liberty. Furthermore, it would mean that the governemtn does not trust its parents, the people. Television advertising should concern every group of consumers how they people behind want that. 
Clearly, children are more affected by advertisment than adults. They do not have the ability to evaluate as much impressions than the adults yet. Although, the adults are not resistent against commercials too. The opposite is the case. Moreover, the advertisment for products which are thought to be used by children concern in almost every case the parents. The parents buy the toys or the shampoo with the unicorn-smelling foam. 
The interdiction of advertisments conercing the under five year olds would not satisfy the needs of its initiants. They want more than that. Whats next? Will it be forbidden to make television advertisments for people over 65?
The children should better go out instead of watching TV. The best weapon against television commercials for children is a playground.
