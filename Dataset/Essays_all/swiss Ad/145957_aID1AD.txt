Almost everybody has a television at home. When you ask somebody about his childhood many people remember the series, they watched. But is childhood really only about watching TV?
At the age of two to five children are supposed to learn a lot for exemple how to walk or to speak properly. Is it really good if they are watching TV at this time? 

The learning process is important and TV hasn't any influence to the this. They are only sitting there alone. Bettter would it be if they are socialising with their parents: They would learn new vocaburlary and more. Or playing at the playground with some friends. Little children enjoy of course the fantastic unreal word, full of adventures, but it's difficult for them to see a difference between real and unreal.
If they watched TV with this young age, they would probably become kind of hooked on TV series when they are grown up. 

When I was a child, I wasn't allowed to wath television. And I was fine with that.Because then the childrern are forced to use their own imagination to have. Or do some kind of "logical plays".

This are only a few reasons why television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. It's the best time to learn about essential skills and better were not to miss this important steps in life. 
Going out there, exploring the nature and being fascinated by the possibility of climbing trees is the only thing a child should care about.Having fun with your parents is so easy when you're little and this time should be used.
