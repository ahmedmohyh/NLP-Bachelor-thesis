Who really raises the generations that were born in the era of computers, roboters and self-driving cars? 
This is a good question to start to analyze the given quote.
The quote might be very controversial to some of us since there are people who are more interested in the economy than with the education of young children. 
Obviously, television advertising is a good way to boost the economy. Thanks to the big influence that the media has over our society, many young children will be watching television. And if children see the ad, they might want watever is shown in there. Many parents will give in to spend money for them. 
For me, there is an issue with television advertising that targets a group of such a young age. Advertisements are not meant to support whoever is watching them but are purely self-interested. As we all know, advertisements are full of details that crawl into our minds and get stuck there to manipulate us. 
So if the ads are directed towards such a fragile audience, they will have a big inpact on them. The ads might not just make the children want something but they might start to shape their personalities and the way they reason. The children will be used to have the same opinion as the advertisements. 
To be honest, I strongly agree with the quote. Manipulating people that cannot yet have a real opinion is just unfair and kind of corrupt.
