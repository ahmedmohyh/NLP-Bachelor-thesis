I disagree with this statement, because in my opinion, television advertising directed toward children under 5 years, should not be allowed.I think there are many reasons. But why?
Firstly I think, it's not such a good idea to let young children watching TV in general, because in this age, there is so much to do. They should go out and learn how to interact with the natur and to discover it. Also young children should not be under influence of the meaning of others, for example of the meaning of a boss of Nestlé. The young children are to young to decide, whats is true and possibe and what is impossible in an advertising. For example an advertising of RedBull says, that you can fly, if you've drunk a RedBull. If a young children don't know, that this is impossble, the child might try it out and fails. Also most of the advertsing things are not healthy, but a young children don't know this, and ask the mum often, to buy this product.But I also think, that the solution is not, that children now just should watch advertising for parents.I think children shouldn't watch TV in general, and it should be forbitten to ad an advertsing between, before and after a child-TV-Programm.
