Television adverts for the youngest generation

A four year old boy is watching TV in the afternoon. This days, the new set from Lego Kingdom will be released and the TV speaker announces the new Castle with 15 knights, 4 horses, a wizard and a dragon. The boy is amazed and he wants this set for every price. Is it legit, the Lego Company shows adverts in TV, or isn't it just horror for the poor parents with kids who want the newest toys.

Despite lots of poor parents, it will be difficult to get a law which forbids those adverts. Most of the discussed spots will be about toys. A toy is not dangerous, it doesn't lead to being fat, it is important for kids to play with etc. All those arguments speak against the headline. And isn't it better to show toys on TV than letting the children watch people smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol on TV. Before interrupting toy adverts, they would better forbid the alcohol and tabac adverts.
An other aspect is, that the children aged two to five maybe won't understand what they hear and see. In this case, it isn't as important to stop showing toys on TV.

On the other hand it is not easy for the parents, to bring the children doing something else than watching TV and press buttons on their phones. No toys on TV might help them a bit. Additionaly the kids wouldn't insist on having this and those toys from the spot last night anymore.

In the end, it is important the parents educate their kids well, so they will face less problems with their children dreaming on the newest Lego Castle. First, it is more important to forbid dangerous adverts for things like alcohol and tabac.
