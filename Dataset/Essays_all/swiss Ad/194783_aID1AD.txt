I am convinced that television advertising should not be directed towards young children for moral reasons, but there should not be law against it, because I assess this kind of advertising is not effective enough to be made. It is quite easy to influence young children between the age of two to five, but first of all, those children are not able to buy stuff, they are too young to have an influence large enough on their parents. Second, those children are not involved in the buying process, their parents do not consider them as reasonable enough to make a choice for themselves and often, they are not even taken into the shop. Finaly, I assume that the children do not watch enough TV to be strongly influenced. The majority of children watching TV are way older, for example six to ten years old. 
On the other hand I think it is moraly unacceptable to influence children, advertisement in this part  of the could strongly influence their developement. c
