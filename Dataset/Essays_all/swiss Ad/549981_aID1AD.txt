I agree with this statement, because I think young children could get irrealistic views of the world if they watch advertisements in TV, for example like the one in which a person tries to stick their thongue into a ventilator just because he`s bored, if a children would watch this, it might would also try it and this could have a bad end.
For us, the television advertising is about unimportant things and just boring, but no one really knows how it affects children, the stuff they see in TV could be really important for them and if they see those things it could affect their thinking.
In general, the children are easily going to believe what is said in those advertisements because they can`t make a diffrence between what is real and what is unreal and just acted for the advertisement because every child is kind of naiv.
It could be that they react totally excited about a product they`ve seen in an advertisement, which isn`t as good as they thought it would be when they finally get it and then be extremely disgusted and sad?
Television advertising tries to makes us buy things we see in there. I think it isn`t good for children, especially if they are in such a low age, to see all those things they could own in an advertisement, because they going to want them as soon as possible. In my opinion, we should concentrate on the things we have and learn the children to be happy about those things and not get them to want everything they see in those advertisements.
I`m against television advertising toward young children because it could affect their thinking.
