Television Advertising directed toward young children

In racent years the amount of advertising young shildren greaw enormously.
the reason for this is the big influances of Television advetising.
Some people think it will be good to stop Televison advertising towards young children.
If there is a lot of advertising for young children, they will watch a lot of television.
The brain of young children isn't that smart yet.If there is an advertising,the children wants to have everything for their home themselves.This will lead to a big problem for their parents.
Not Only this is the problem of advertising towards young children on televioson. Televison it selve is a big problem for young children.The eyes of young children can be damaged because of several things.
The big companies are not interessted on thhis informations. They only see the money owned by the children parents.
If there is a company who directed advertising two years old. they will realise that the advertising is more annoying than useful.because the children are to young to understand something.

From my opinion I completely agree with this statement.I do think Telesion Advertising towards young people should not be allowed too. Its just very unusfull for bouth sides the companies and the young children.Last but not least 
everybody should do what they want to do
