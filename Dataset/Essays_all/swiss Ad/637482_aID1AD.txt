The theme of this essay it pretty strange. And i don`t really know something but i will try to give my best.

It`s possible that the advertising on the television have a bad influence to children aged two to five but for me the better question is if these children at all should watch TV at this age. Shouldn`t they play with they`r toys in they`r rooms? They are still so young and got already confronted with such medias. It can`t belive that this is a good thing. So I think the advertising isn`t good for the as well. On the other side it`s possible that if they got confronted already soearly they learn how he world is doing and that the truth is that u have always to watch advertising if u watch TV. Why should they have a better like than it is in reallity. It would be a lie. Another thing is that they are able to learn many tings from the advertising. For exaple all the diffrent things which you are seeing at advertising they ot to know. 
So the advertising have for young childrens a positiv and as well a negative influence. For me there are more positiv ones than negativ so I agree with advertising for young childrens from age two to five pretty much. If they are allowed to watch TV it don`t makes a big diffrenceif there is advertising or not.


By the way I think if you ban advertising at television for childrens (aged two to five) no chanel will continue to show broadcasts for young children because they aren`t able to earn some money without advertising.
