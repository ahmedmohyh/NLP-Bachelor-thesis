It is out of question that advertisments influnce our brains. But the whole theme about television advertisements is a theme which divids our opinsions. Some people think that it is the problem of the person who watches the advertisement and others say that it should be not allowed to show for example smoking advertisement or in this case advertisements which are dircted towards children. 

On one hand it is proven that advertisement influence our brains and our acting, even if we do not want it to. And if children watch television advertisements it also influences them. And due to their not fully developed brain it may be that it influences them more than one thinks. They do not look from a critical point of view how it adults (should) do.

On the other hand one can say that the parents are responsilbe for their children and it is in their responsibility to allow the children watching television advertisements or not. So it is in their hands and not in the hands of the government.

In my opinion, parents of children under four years should forbid their children watching television because I think that it can conclude a negative effect of their developement. And if I would be a mother of a five year old child, I would allow him or her to watch television, but not too much. All in all my point of view is that I think it is in the hands of the parents and not in the hands of the government.
