Children always want nice things. As  we can see in the store there are many sweets at the check-out. This is a strategie to wake hunger in the children, them will ask the parents and to satisfy the children, they buy it. Is it the same in the TV-publicity?

The publicity is pointed toward children, they will have it and they will ask theyr mom or dad for it. I understand when this is annoing for parents. But is it worth to be forbitten? 
Why? Yes i hate publicity too, but it is the money that suports the TV-show financial. And the children will probably forget it up to the next time they are in a store. The younger of them won't really understand the publicity and that you can buy this stuff in the next store. At all parents could also shout off the television when publicity is on-air, when they don't want the children to watch it.
  An other argument could be, some publicity makes the children feel in a unrealistic world with just sugar an toys.
But thats probably the world they are mostly in with that age and in the TV-programm is a even more unrealistic world. So when they watch TV anyway, that shouldn't be the problem. 
The publicity could show the children products which could hurt them, for example LEGO, they could eat one what is not very good for theyr health. But in the end there are always the parents who buy this stuff. It's their matter what the children have and what is forbitten for them.

I think advertising toward children is not worse than make publicity towards adults. It makes us phantasie about what we could have and feel bad abou't what we don't have. I don't think it's bad to make this publicity, becaus parents could switch the TV just off during this period and it pays the kidsshow they are watching. The question is for me not if we should make publicity in TV for the children or not, it is more questionable if we should let them watch TV and at all what we should let them watch?
