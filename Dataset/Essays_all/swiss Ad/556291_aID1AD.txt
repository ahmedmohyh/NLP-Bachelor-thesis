Should television advertising directed to young children be forbidden?

In this time, children of young ages already watch television. Mostly because the parents want to have a "quiet minute" or the kids just cry or scream to get what they want. When they are watching tv, often nobody is supervising them, so they get in contact with everything which is showed. Days later they maybe want their mom to buy this delicious chocolate snack or the talking doll, which the advertising showed in the best possible way to impress children. There are even psychologist, which are looking for this best way. Children in this young ages are very naive; they don't really care about the prize, the healthiness or the usefullness. If the other child in the advertising has fun with it or if it says that the chocolate snack is very yummy, they spontaneously feel the need for it. As a consequence of that, they are the best audience to merchandise something. But is that fair? The people should be able to do their own decision about buying something or not, but children aren't really able to do that. On the other side you could say, that the parents do the finishing decision, even if the children are praying to get it the whole day. Additionally they are responsible of their children watching television. If they let them, they have to be aware of what is showed and they have to handle the consequences.

In my opinion, it wouldn't be correct to forbid to show such advertising. Advertising is the most important way for the industry to sell their products. If they are clever enough to find the best way to sell as many products as possible, they should have success. When parents decide to let their children watch television, they also decide to let them see the advertising. And if that influences their children's wishes, they have to be consequent enough, to not buy it, if they don't want to.
