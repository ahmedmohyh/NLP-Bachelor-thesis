It is well known, that little kids are very easily influenced. Either by oppinions from their parents or also by advertises in the TV. But should we forbid television advertising?

As I mentioned before, kids very likely to be influenced, because they want to learn. And they want to learn everything, but they haven't got an understanding when arguments are only one-sidet. They don't think about it, they just pick it up. So, when they see someone flying in the air in an ad because he wears those special shoes, they don't think that this is impossible.
Certainly, they also haven't got a feeling for money and they don't compare the price to the value, they just see the thing that they want.

But is it in the end, who buys the product? Sure, it's the parents. When the child asks for something, who is he telling it. It's also the parents. So the parents are the ones who have the obligation to say no.
An other point is, that when you forbid television advertising directed to young children, not only the kids see it any more, also the parents. So, when they want to see, what the new things are, that kids could like, they don't see it any more, and it's harder for them.
Than, there are also to many things, where you should have a discussion aboutt, if they should be allowed. The Lego-Land for example.

In my opinion, it is unnecessairy to forbid things like this, because it's the parents fault when they haven't raised their child to accept a "no" as an anwser.
