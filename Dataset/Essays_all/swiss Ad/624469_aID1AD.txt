Don't you remember when you were young and sitting infront of the television and then there comes this really amazing advertisement of this really cool toy which you just had to have to play with? I can remembre these times just like they happened yesterday. And everytime when I asked my parents and they finaly said yes and I had the toy in my very own hands I was disapointed because it just wasn't the same as it was shown in the advertisement. Every child really likes these awesome advertisements which show the product in its greatest way but should television advertising directed to young children be allowed?

These organisations whose product is directed to young children do have to advertise so they can sell their products better. Every organisation has to advertise. The whole reason of advertising is that the people who see the advertisement buy the product. Young children don't have any money so the reason of these advertisements is that the little girls or boys go to their parents and tell them to buy the product. The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them. With this advertising-strategy the organisations are abusing exactly this problem. So the young children are an easy target to sell stuff to. 

In the end I think that television advertising which is directed to young children should not be allowed because it abuses the lack of knowledge that children have.
