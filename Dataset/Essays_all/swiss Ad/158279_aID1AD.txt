No I don't agree with the statement. I mean it's not the job of the enterprises not to try to reach kids, it's the job of the parents to say "No honey, not today."
It's normal, that there are television advertising for condoms or sex toys and nobody asks "Is it okay to make television advertising just for adults?", when there's a tv-spot about Spitex, nobody asks if it's okay just to make television advertising just for elders - what I want to say is, that kids are just another customer group and shouldn't be questioned. Well, I understand that some people say it's not okay, that you try to reach customer groups who don't even earn money. But to be honest that's just business, like a lot of other stuff - I mean the UBS hangs up some posters with the writing on it that children should come and bring their "Sparbatze" to the UBS and they'd become a toy - I think this isn't okay, to let kids bring you their money just so you (the bank) can invest it and hope it works out. 
So from my side, I wouldn't ban television advertising for kids from the tv, I mean in the end, if this concerns sells more stuff, they pay more taxes and Switzerland gets money, if Switzerland gets money, we can keep this county clean, pretty, just like we know Switzerland - isn't that worth these maybe 15 seconds of television advertising for playmobil?
Television advertising directed toward kids is nothing else than just usual television advertising and I think it's definitely okay.
