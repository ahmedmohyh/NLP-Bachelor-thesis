Even young children these days watch TV a considerable amount of time. While some watch films from DVD others enjoy the different programmes on TV. And there is the problem: On TV there mostly are adverts, some of them even directed directly towards young children. Should this be allowed? 
Yes of course, one could say, there are adverts for good things like educative games or toys. A child could see a game for learnig to read and then get interested in reading. They would then ask their parents if they could buy it. The parents still have the opportunity to say no. But this way their attention is drawn to something that they had not known otherwise. 
One could say that adverts directing towards young children should only be allowed for a certain product. It makes sense to advert for an educative game but it is rather harmful to advert for sweets or other unhealthy stuff. The children could get the impression that everybody eats a lot of sweets and they are the only ones who are not allowed to. They could get a wrong impression of what is normal or what other people do. 
There are strong arguments in favour of  restriction of TV advertisement. Children, and even more young children aged two to five, need protection. They can't decide what is good for them themselves. As already mentioned above, children could get a wrong impression of their surroundings. As they are very young they would then adapt to these patterns and get used to it. This can have positive effects but, e.g. regarding sweets, also lead to problems like overweight. 
Personally, I think TV advertisement directing towards young children should not be allowed. It influences them in a wrong way since companies are mostly interested in making money and not necessarily in the well-being of children. Anyway, young children should not watch that much TV, they should rather go outside and play with other children.
