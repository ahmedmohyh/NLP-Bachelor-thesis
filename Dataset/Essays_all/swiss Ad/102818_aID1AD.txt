First of all what is declarated as a television adverising? TV, I think that was not that hard but what about smartphones, computers, consoles and so on. There's basically no difference young children sitting in front of a screen or a monitor. The main problem is that you can't really stop it because everybody else is doing it, Elders have a bad influence because we watch TV and use smartphones, so the children want to have this as well.
There's no international limit for TV or other electronic devises so how can you say it should not be allowed. Sure it's sad that there's basically no longer a childhood without those things but I think today it's normal that you have a TV at home. Don't get me wrong, it's sad to see like two are three years old children just sitting there and watching TV all day and for older generations that not normal but the world and technology are changing.
Today you plenty more options that you haven't like 30 years ago or even 10 years. It's normal that todays activities are different then those back years ago. The main problem I see is who controls whether the two to five years old are watching TV or something like that or not. And what is the penalty if they do? It's really hard to control that, nearly impossible because almost everybody has those television devices at home and it's really easy to ge them so you can't just stop it.
In my opinion this statement is just silly because you can't execute it and in todays world television advertising is a part of our life. Some people don't like this but it is what it is, you can't really do something against it. I see the point of this statement, I think it's not good too when a seven year old already has a smartphone and three year olds watching TV all day but today this may be declarated as "normal".
