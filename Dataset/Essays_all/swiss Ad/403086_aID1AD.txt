Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Adverts towards children are a popular marketing stradgedy for many buissinesses that for example sell toys. It's pretty easy to use a childs fantasy and dreams to improve the own financial situation. A children of the age two to five is easy to impress and excite about a new thing thats on the market, unless it's colourful and there's music in the backround. After they've seen the adverts a few times they are are going to ask their parents about the stuff they've seen on Tv until they buy them for them. Successfull marketing has always to do with an emotional connection to the customer. That means if a brand is set in your mind before you've reached a certain age, as an adult you'll remeber the brand and connect it with good feelings or memories you've had in your childhood. In my opinion that's manipulation and shouldn't be allowed. But I'm not sure if it's that effectful, because the brands manipulate us anyways, it doesn't matter if we're 5 or 99. The princip of using our feelings for their marketing works for adults the same way as it does for children.
