I disagree, but I can understand why you could agree with it. First of all you can influence children much easier and as a result they then want to have this product, but on the other hand they don't have any money to buy it. So they have to go to their parents and ask them. Their parents should be aware of manipulation and really think really sceptically about buying this product. Because they lived their hole life with advertisment and its manipulation that they should know that they only try to manipulate you. A small child isn't aware of this and the bigger it is the better. There are some parents who can't handle this situation and want to forbid the advertisment toward young children. But then we have an empty slot in the advertisment and they are going to fill this empty slot with a diffrent davertisment It is very difficult to make a restriction to prevent it, but the easiest way to prevent it is: not letting watch television or look at the newest catalogue about for exemple LEGO. Of course you can't prevent your own child to look at a poster outside but you can take certein steps to minimalise it. As a good parent, who can handle money, I don't think you're gonna have a big problem. But to do all of this you have to be able to know about this problem  and you should not buy blind certein products for your child. Please don't missunderstand me, I don't want to say you shouldn't buy any advertised product for your child but you have to think about that and decide by yourself.
