This statement depends on which sort of advertising it is meant. But there is a very high chance that young children are more influenced than the older ones. But if it is meant for advertisings that influence people to buy something it isn't this bad as the statement is telling. Because the younger children are surely more influenced but they have less power. Power is meant that they aren't able to buy anything alone, they their parents ermission and often also their money because they don't owe on their own money. So the parents still are a big factor of the choice to buy something or not for the young children. But if the statement is meant for advertising that are not for buying but doing soething or going somewhere it is a completely other view. Because young children are very influenced by this. They think that very much things are fun on the beginning but afterwards they aren't happy. So if the parents try to be nice and offer something to the children they do what the chidren like and so the advertising influences them. The young children are also way easier to impress with something and the advertisings are made to impress people to buy something or do something and the young children are very influenced because of this. So my opinion on this statement is that there isn't really a ''good'' decision. Because everybody is influenced by advertisings. The young children are surely influenced the most but they have got their parents to tell them that that isn't right and can still decide. Also we are unable to control if a young children is watching television or if it is anyone else. So at the end the only solution would be to have no advertisisngs at all. Because if not then it could stil happen that young children see advertisings. But it isn't this bad as in the statement because they still have parents which normally are controlling them in this young age.
