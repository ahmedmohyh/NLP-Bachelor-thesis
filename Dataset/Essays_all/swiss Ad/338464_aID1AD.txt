Now a days you find television advertaising everywere. It is imposible to watch TV with out any advertising, especially on TV programs for children.
so there is the question,if television advertising directed toward young childern should not be allowed.
First I like to mention a positive argument, why it should be allowed.
Advertsing can help children to create new ideas, then a child likes to crate new stuff. For example the can see a new cowboy costume in the TV. So trougth this advertising`s manitulative way, they like to play cowboy outside as well. in this way it is not a bad thing. Normally then they do not have a costume at home, so they trying to create it on their own and will use their imagination. 
An negative argument is, that all advertising is way to manipulative, as I mentiond before. Children are easily influenzable. The marketing calcultes it really well. If they can not convinz the parents they try it by the children. So the children can later convinz the parents for them.
An other bad thing is that the children get really early involved in the economie. The economie lives from buyng and using and this is not a good way children should be pushed in.
so for me it is clear that televison advertising should not be allowed, because of its manupulativity and the bad education.
