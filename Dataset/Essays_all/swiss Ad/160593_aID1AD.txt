In this following essay I am going to discuss the advatages and disadvantages of television advertising that is directed toward young children.

Firstly, television advertising is quiet okay because nowadays we live in a world full of advertising. So why should young children not be able to expire television advertising toward them. We do not live in the 19th century no more. The young children have to build their own future and it would be helpfull if they get to know our world in their young ages.
On the other hand, television advertising toward young children is very bad for the thoughts of children. Through the television advertising de children do not think by themselves. They believe everything what tehy hear or see and with advertising they will not lern how they should have their own oppinion because they never had to think before.

In my eyes I would defenetely not allow television advertising toward young children. They should lear how to think by themselves and get their own ideas. I think advertising toward them is the worst thing we could allow if we want them to be creative and successfull in life.
