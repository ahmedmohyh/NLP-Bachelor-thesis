Young children nowadays are watching more and more television. It is a big problem, that marketing gets even bigger and the companies tries to sell everything and uses advertisemen for those reasons. But is it ok to direct advertisements towards children?

First of all it isn't good to use children for economic purposes. Children have a blank mind and they got influenced quite strong by those advertisements. For example if the children see something they want they will ask their parents again and agian till they will recieve it. 

Another big point is that children children don't earn their own money. The parents have to pay for them and all parents wants to see the child happy.They are quite likely to buy whatever they want to make the child happy and to use this fact to sell products is not right.

On the other hand if the parents wants to buy what the child want and it is good for the economics if things are bought. So it is good for the economics if advertisements are directed towards children. The cashflow won't get stopped and there won't be any bad incidents for the econimic.

Last but not least every singel child have theire own opinion of what they just saw and if they want this product or not. They can't think about the use of the thing. So if they like what the advertisement is about why shouldn't parents buy it to them? 

To sum up in my opinion it is ok to direct advertisements towards children. It is a part of marketing like social media markenting. And if the parents are willing to buy the products to make the child happy it is a good way to sell products. Many parents don't like it but in fact the parents could provide the children from watching so much television.
