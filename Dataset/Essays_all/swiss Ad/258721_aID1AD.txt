In my opinion this statement doesn`t make any sence. Why should television advertising be bad for young children and why should they even watch it? There are hundreds of channels nowadays so they or their parents can easily zap through the channels if they don`t want to watch something. The television advertising with erotic or brutal components aren`t streamed during the young children are awake, so they can`t see them. And why should those children want to buy anything showed in the television advertising? I think they wouldn`t even be interested. If they are watching their favorite series and don`t want to switch the channel, they have the possibility to make something else during the advertising. Since they are children, they can play with their siblings or their toys until their series will continue. Actually it doesn`t even take a long time. The longest advertisings are around 10 minutes. 
Another point is, that the television channels can`t control who is watching their program.
So they couldn`t stream any advertising no more just because a young child may be watching it. If they would have to stop showing advertising, they wouldn`t get the money of the advertising-producers. I`m sure some channels need this money to keep them existing. Otherwise there could be a channel less. This would make those people mad, who watched it and liked it. Of course the parents can control what their children are watching, but they have the full right to decide by themselves, what they want to show them and what not. To forbid television advertising wouldn`t make any sence to me then. It would create more problems, than it would solve. The best option for the channels, the advertising-producers and the people who are watching television, is to keep it up how it is at the moment.
