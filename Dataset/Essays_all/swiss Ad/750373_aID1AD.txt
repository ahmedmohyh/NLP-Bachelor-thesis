Televisions play an important rule in our daily lifes. Advertisings are a part of it. The longer the more young children use a TV. Children can be influenced very easily. That's why it's important to evaluate whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.

One strong argument for stronger rules of such advertisings is that you can influence children in a positive way. You could ban advertisings which lead to an unhealthy lifestyle and rather support education and sport.
If these advertisings were banned completely, the kids wouldn't be influenced, neither positive nor negative. They could focus on being a child, enjoying their TV show without worrying about new stuff and money.
The last argument for such a restriction would be that parents don't have to worry about it. They don't have to explain their children why they don't get a new toy or why the advertisings looks better than the it actually is.

On the other hand, there are several arguments for advertisings.
Selling advertisings is an importnant source of money for TV channels, also for channels with children as their main aim. By cutting children-oriented advertisings, they'd loose a lot of money.
If you just made stronger rules of such advertisings, many enterprises and factories would have a benefit over the ones that mustn't make an advertising. This would lead to unequal possibilities in the market.

Personally, I think that we should be very attentive what we want to show to children because advertisings can have many influences on them. A compromise should be found. I imagine something similar like the alcohol advertising-ban in Switzerland. Let them discover what new toys exist or what they could save for but make clear limits of what should be permitted.
