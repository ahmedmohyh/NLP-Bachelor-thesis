Do young children, aged two to five, understand what they see in Television advertising? Can they understand what the Television does want to tell them? And how are the children reacting towards Television advertising? Are there any significations that it shouldn't be allowed toward young children?

I think children with this young age aren't old enough to really understand what the television wants to tell them. Usually they have their children channels with shows to learn the alphabet or the numbers. Furthermore to connect terms to the proper items. It's a good source to give young children a way for easy education. In television there is a huge programme of different shows with specific reasons. You have programmes like Dora to educate the numbers, the alphabet, the colors and so on. On the other hand you have shows like Caillou or the sandman to give them some happy hours.

However, what do children connect with Televisions advertising? Studies have proofen that the brain of young children takes up a lot of information taught from television or other media sources. But should they be bombered with television advertising?

I would say no. In this young age, you should be taught about education. Education is so important for our community and you are never to young to start with education. But there is no need to allow television advertising.
