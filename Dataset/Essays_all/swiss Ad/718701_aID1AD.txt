It's shocking if you see all them young children watching television or playing games on the gigantic phones or tablets of their parents. Should it be forbidden to take advantage of that in advertising toward young children?
First of all, it has to be said that advertises are really important in our daily life. Even if you don't recognise it, your mind thinks about it and considers the quality and nessesarity of it. So if young people see products and thoughts for themselves, it's way better for their education and graduation. 
Secondly, and even more relevant: If it wasn't allowed, what would be the content of advertises? I mean one can't do advertise for men on a disney channel. So if you can't do either of it, there isn't any advertise. But then you have the next problem: How are you able to pay the whole channel? It just doesn't work.
Others argue that adverise makes little children even more addicted to television, but I guess if children wouldn't watch advertise, they would just waste their time on watching something else. If you want to change something, you should try to solve to problem in the education.
So in general I think it's a good thing. You can use advertising to give good information to the young generation, but you should use it wisely and barely.
