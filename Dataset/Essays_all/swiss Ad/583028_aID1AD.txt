Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

These days, adverstising is present everywhere. It is common that these messages are normally directed to a particular client group. But is advertising directed to young children really needed and also, should it even be allowed?

Children between the age of 2 and 5 aren't yet reasonable. Not without any reason decide their parents most of the time for them, they can't really distinguish if something is good for them or not. Therefore, advertising directed straight at these children isn't useful.
However, advertising company also want to reach this group of people, but they should direct it to the parents and not to their child.

Normally, these children can easily get a false idea about what this product really is about. Their imagination is great, and they believe at things which were just meant to make the advertising more interesting. They are innocent victims of false adverisments, if there's a fairy princess which makes dreams to become true, they are going to believe it. And if then reality came and they would become aware that this isn't true, their hearts would be broken.

And after all, the parents are those who have to pay the product. They are in charge for their child's health and well-beeing, and they have to say no to their child everytime when they want such an useless present. Many parents have to deal with their children starting to cry and yell because they can't have the desired thing. Although the product seems nice to the child, the parents really know if it's a real necessity to have.

In conclusion, these advertisings give the children a false view of things, they increase problem between parent and child, and sometimes, they just confuse them. So in my opinion, television advertising directed to young children isn't for any good, it just creates conflicts.
