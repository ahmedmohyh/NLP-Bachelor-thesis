In a few points I'm disagree with the statement because I think it't sometimes important that children can watch television to learn something about the wolrd or our culture for example the tales from disney are full of important things like moralism and that the feelings are more important than good looking so how it is in "The Beauty and the Beast". But there are some points I'm agree with the statement. For children it's very important to go outside and learn something from our nature and maybe to get dirty is also a part from being a child. They should find some friends and play with them to improve their social life. And I think when their outside the children learn more from physics and their see with their own eyes how the world functions.
Chidlren can watch television maybe when the wheather isn't optional for playing outside or when there's no one who they can play with. And there should also be a maximum given from the adults, they shouldn't watch television for more  than four hours a week. For children from this age it is also very improtant to have a lot of contact with their adults to make a good relationship. The children have to learn how to feel and how to react to other people feelings.
This is why I'm agree with this statement. I think the children would get some squared eyes.
