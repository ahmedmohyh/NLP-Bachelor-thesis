Advertising; It's everywhere and there's one for almost everything. On the television, on the radio, the streets, in magazines and even in our school books. One can barely imagine our society as we know it today without it. Advertisings have a huge influenece on our consume, often even without our knowledge. Sometimes an add is also very questionable, so there are people who claim that there should be more districtions for what's allowed and what's not. For example wether advertising toward very young children should be forbidden. Arguments reach from the question wether childern should even watch TV too often to parents deciding what they buy for their kids and the fact that the products the advertising companty is trying to sell can also be very good pructucts even when they are for children. 
At first sight, it's up to the parents, wether they want to buy a pruduct for their kid or not. Childern usually don't have enough money and don't know how they can buy something, for example on the internet.

On the other side it's also the responsibility of our society too make our next generation the best it can be. It's very questionable if it's good for a child i it's just brought to watch Tv the whole day. Children should read or play for example in their free time
