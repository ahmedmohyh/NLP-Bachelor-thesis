In my opinion you have to separate two different types of this advertising. There are often some who refere directly to young children but the most of them are just for the parents.
So they want that the children can see all the amazing toys and article. The children really want these toys and so in the end it has only an effect on the parents. They can buy them what they want or they can just say no. The most children aged two to five haven't money to buy them these things by there own. Even if you have to separate, I think it doesn't matter if the television advertising is directed toward young children or for there parents, because the resault is the same. Maybe the children react more to the advertising then the parents, because they are way faster faszinated of it. The parents are already used of all the influence of advertising, so often they do not even realize or they just don't listen to it. 
In general I would say it shouldn't be not allowed. But in my opinion it shouldn't be allowed before or after a show for children. In all the breaks of shows for children aged older the five it shouldn't be a problem because ether the children don't watch these shows or the parents could switch the channel if there is to much advertising.
My conclusion is that it should be allowed with some rules or laws. At the end it's anyway always the decision of the parents if they want to buy the advertised article or not. If the parents would have a problem with all the advertising, I think it would anyway be much better no to let them look television aged this young. They should go outside and do something active instead of sitting the hol
