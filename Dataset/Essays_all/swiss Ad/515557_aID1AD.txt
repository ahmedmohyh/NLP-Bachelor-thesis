The questsion whether children between the age of two and five should or may be exposed to advertising is to be discussed in the following. 

A argument of the pro site is that a bann of children advertising would mean less promotion for toys and other commodities for which children are potential buyers. This would lead to a lower demand in these commodities i.e. thes firms generate less surpluses. For example if McDonalds can't direct their advertising towards small children, the brand will be less popular in this age group. 

A argument of the opponetns is that directing adeverts towards chirldren is bassicaly equal to brain wash them. Since they are very easy to influence and eager to imitate their templates. They can't realy cope whit advertising because they aren't conscious that it is only an advert. They take it for real and respond to it by wanting to get the promoted product. 

In my opinion there aren't any good reasons to not ban advertising for children. The economy must not interfere whit the psyche of humans especially children i.e. brainwash tehm. Further brainwahsing people creats only an unreal increas in the demand of certain products which leads Adam Smith's invisible hand astray. For this reason I am for a ban of commercials directed to chirdren.
