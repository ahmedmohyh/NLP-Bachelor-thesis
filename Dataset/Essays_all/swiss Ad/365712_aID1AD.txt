In our society today we have the disadventage or the adventage of having so many medias. Already young children want to know things about them and want to use them. Now we have to think about it wheater it is good or not. 

It is not good when children watch the hole day TV and forget their real life. It can happen when their parents put their children in front of the TV to get them quiet. Children will not go out and enjoy the Nature, this can lead to a problem when they get older. But we can not forget the adventage of televison and our modern medias. You can watch documentarys and learn many things. In school it sometimes is also used as a media to teach kids.Because some people can learn much better in the visual way.

In my opinion television is not a very bad thing you can learn many things from it but it can also teach you stupid things or it can give you a strange way of our reality because there are humans who do not understand, that about keeping up with the Kardashians is not much real. Thats the main problem I think. So I think it would be good if it was not allowed for children in this age because they can not separate reality form TV. I have to add that I think the limit of five years is not enough. A good way would be, that children are allowed to watch TV at the age of 8 years and after this age they are allowed to watch TV for example 30 minutes per day but their parents check what their children are watching. 

To sum up I think it is a good idea no to let children watch TV in this young age.
