Young children can very easily be influenced because of television advertising. But should it be allowed or not, to influence children in this specific way?
Television advertising influences all of us. The adult and the younger ones. But children aged two to five are not able to make any diffrences between a good argument and a suggestive advertisment. If somebody in the TV tells them that they need this new toy, they need it. And they will start to annoy their parents with their needs until they get what they want. Like this, parents are put in a very bad position. On the one hand, they may not have enough money to afford the toy or they simply think that it is not good for their child. On the other hand, they do not want to upset their kids. So they might buy it anyway.
You also have to take into acount that a lot of adults belief in everything they see in the TV too. So how can we expect our children to be able to make any diffrences between the trueth and a lie? We can not. We can not expect something from our children that we can not do ourselfs.
So as you can see, television advertising in generall is a bad thing and it is even worse if it is directly meant to be for young children. Because of these arguments I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
