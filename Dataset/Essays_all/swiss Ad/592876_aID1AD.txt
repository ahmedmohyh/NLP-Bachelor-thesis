I do agree with that statement! In todays televisionprograme, there is no more chanel left who hasn't got advertisements in their breaks. I understand, that the people who work at the chanel need to earn money out of somewhere. The simplest way to get the necessary money is by stream advertisements in the breaks of their TV shows. Since a few years, television developed their advertising process. They set the advertisings at specific times or between specific shows. For example in the late evening. At this time, there are only adults or teenagers left,so the people working at the chanel only place advertisements for products which are used by theese kind of people. Or on Disney-chanel, there are specific advertisemnts for children.
I think chanels who stream children programe should not be allowed to place advertisement that could affect the children. The young boys and girls might get attracted by the products, so they start yelling at there parents and wont stop begging until they get what they want. In these cases the children win nine out of ten times. So the ones who placed the advertisements gain profit by influencing children. Thats a clever way, but not fair! 
I think that debate would loose at court, because its their only way to make a financial gain. Advertising will continue to be placed in TV, so there must be another possibility to let children watch their favourite TV shows. Thats the point, where Netflix comes in. Netflix has a wide range of TV shows for children and as a parent you don't have to worry that your child gets affected by advertisements.
