Many young children now a days watch a lot of televison. And also there are a lot of advertisnets towardas young children. Even some children from the age of two to five sometimes are watching televison about three to five hours per day. But are these advertisments good or bad for the child and should the be allowed or forbidden?
There are many advetisements which are directed to very young childrens. That is good, because when a mother dosen't has enough time for her child, then she can just put her child in front of the televison and the child and watch some movies which are made for his age and for which the child isn't too young. And every mother knows that a child includes much time and sometimes they need time to relax and maybe for some women it's not easy to find a place where they can give their child during the day so they can relax. 
On the other side, the grandmother could watch after the child because she would be happy and she has enough time to play with the child. And only watching television isn't good for the child because in this period of his life it's necessary that the child can crab and touch things and only looking at different things on a televison is not enough for the healthy growth of the child and in a extrem case they can even get addicted to it.  
I think advetisments towards young children should be forbidden because it only leads to problems. The temptation for the mother is too big to just put the child in front of the television. And this is leading to, that every child watches television the whole day and don't play with real toy. And maybe later they get addicted to watching television and then they have some problems in their later life.
