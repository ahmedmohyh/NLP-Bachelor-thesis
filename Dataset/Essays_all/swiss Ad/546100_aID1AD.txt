"Television adverising directed toward young children should not be allowed." This statement may shock some parents because they do this all the time. But is it really bad?
One opinion is that it is. It is not so good for especially young children always sitting in front of the television. It could have bad issues to the creativity of the child. But it can be productive as well because the children could learn and see things through the television that they would not see in reallife at this age.
Another opinion to this statement is that children should learn, even in young years, to deal with technique so they will not have problems to understand how the modern world works. But they also do not know a world without televisions and stuff like that. The children can no imagine that in the past nobody had a television or that even today not everybody has it or even knows what it is. 
And a last opinion that is also my opinion is that parents will not do things with their children, as example go out to see somethig or to a parc, they just let them stay in the house and watch the television. I find it terrible that the parents of today just let their children watch the television when they cri or when the parents are to tiredor are not in the mood to do tings with their own children.
