this text is about my meaning about the statement, Television advertising directed toward yound chidren (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I think, that young children can't even know and don't understand what the meaning of the advertising is.with the new technologys, the most televisions can skip the advertising, because nobody cares it. I think it isn't that dangerous for children (aged two to five), because they can't deside something. For example, there is an advertisnig of an barbie in the television and my ittle sister want to have it, my parents can deside if my sister get this barbie or not. Also they can play outside and don't have tobe the whole time inside and watch television.
At the other hand, little children can cry about something they like and maybe the parents have to do what the childrens want, because it isn't that funny to have a child who always cry. 
For me it doesn't matter if there is a television advertising directed toward young children or not. When i don't want to watch it i can just skip it. But maybe when i get older and have children by myself, it can be bad to always have unhappy children, because they see something better in the television that at home.
I think it is a stupid desition to make that not allowed. In the world we have bigger problems instat the television advertising directed toward youing children.
