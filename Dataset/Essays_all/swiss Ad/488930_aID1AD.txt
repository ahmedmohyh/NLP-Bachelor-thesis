Nowadays, advertising in television is a big part of advertising and marketing for companies of any kind. With television it is possible to reach a big audience and timed at the right moment - for example during a particular show - it is even possible to direct advertisements towards your targeted audience. This applies for audiences at any age, including children. 

Directing advertisements towards children is a clever move, one might say. Children are easily influenced and get overly excited very quickly. So for companies that produce, let us say toys, it is a good idea to broadcast advertisements on television channels with a young audience, such as the Disney Channel. This might lead to a boost in sales and will support a flourishing economy. 

From a moral standpoint it is a bit difficult. Taking advantage of children, who are - as mentioned above - easily influenced, is pretty ruthless. Children might pressure their parents to buy product that their families do not need or - even worse - can not afford.

But does a ban of advertising directed towards children aged two to five really make sense? Children from five years and upwards are neither harder to influence (in some cases it is even easier due to peer pressure), nor are they more conscious of what they need. Also there are a lot more children watching television above the age of five than before, since most of the parents  will not let their children watch television too often, when they are in their early years. 

So to conclude I would say that a ban of such advertisements would not really make sense beacuse not that many children aged two to five watch television. A regulation of some kind would make sense though, because morally it is arguably wrong to target young people who are easy to influence and do not really have a sense of what they can or can not afford or what they really need.
