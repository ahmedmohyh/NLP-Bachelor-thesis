In this statement I am going to discuss about the Television advertising directed toward young children.
Nowaday We humans can't imagine our society without any electronic devices. Computer, iPhones and of course television became a very central subject in our world. It is not easy to decide wether this huge technological succes is good or bad for this world. 
The majority of western worldpopulation owns elevision, iPhones Computers and a lot of other electronic devices. Let's focus on the Televison.
On the one hand a Television can be a practical device. Watching television you have the possibility to  be always informed about the accurate happenings and events around the world. Secondly having a television at your home can be very entertaining. The TV programm has a lot to offer. For example Series and Movies in all genres and sometimes also in diffrent languages.
On the other hand being a owner of a television has also its bad sides. Firstly watching television often robbs your time away. If you have to get some really important things done like homework or studies, you waste your time with watching TV instead of focusing on the essential things in life.
This is also the case with a lot of other things as relationships or creating your own lifestyle. Not only does Television waste television your vulnerable time, it also has the ability to brainwash humans mind. Especially for the younger generation. When children in young age watch for example all this advertements, they grow up wanting them. So they are being practicly thaugt to live in a capitalistic world which has the consequnce that their values will be about buying things and getting more and more things.
 So eventhough television may have a few positve sides, I think that it is time wasting and leads to brain wash.
