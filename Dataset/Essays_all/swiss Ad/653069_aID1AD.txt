Advertisement which is targeted at children has quite a big influence on our children and their lives. When they see an advert on the television, they often want the products which are advertised. Consequently, some people say that the children's opinions are altered by television advertising and they believe that our children should be able to make up their own opinions.
Additionally, it is argued that since advertising almost always presents a product, such as a toy, it makes the children believe that the material wealth is the most important thing. Instead, they should be taught to value the immaterial things in our lives more.
Another interesting idea is that due to television advertising children in poor families see what rich parents can afford their children. This can lead to the children's beeing unhappy about their family situation. 
On the other hand, children should learn to cope with advertisement since they will encounter adverts all the time when they are adults. It is therefore important that the parents teach their children to cope with television advertising, which leads us to the next point.
It is not the State's responsibility to protect our children from negative influence of advetising, but rather the parents' task. They are the ones who should ensure that their children learn how not to be influenced too much by the adverts.
Last but not least, it would be hard to find a economist who would vote in favour of such a proposal. This is for a good reason, because a lot of companies rely on selling kids' toys. As a result, such an advertisement ban would have negative effects on the economy.
Because of the negative impact on the economy and the principle that it is the parents' responsibility rather than the government's, I do not agree with the statement.
