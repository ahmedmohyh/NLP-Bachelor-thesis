A lot of people say watching television has a bad influence on children. Especially the advertisements between the programms could harm the children. 

Television advertising directed towards young children is not that effective as advertising towards adults. The main reason for this is the point that children can't buy their own stuff. In the end the parents decide what they want to buy. So for this reason, advertising should more target adults than children anyway.

But the thing is, that without the advertising the children wouldn't notice the product, because they never go shopping or read magazines. So the only media where the companys can place their advertisement to reach their target is the television.

However, the television advertising makes the children believe, that they need what they see. So they start begging their parents for it, until they get it. This is good for the product, but the parents won't be that happy with it and the children, who probably don't get what they want, neither.

Where it all boils down to is that we just get spoiled children, with too much toys, who can't be satisfied anymore. And for this reasons, I figure that television advertisements targeting childern should not be allowed.
