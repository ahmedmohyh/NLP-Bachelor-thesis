Has advertisment a bad influence on young children, so that it should be permitted to air it on TV?

I think so. First of all it influences the opinion of young childen so that they don't grow up in the way that their parents teach them but instead they see what's new on the market and, just like children are, they obviously want it. Where as without television advertising the parents can take their children to the stores the want and trust. 
Second of all, in my opinion, children aren't supposed to watch TV at all, exept for some films a month or rarely some Pokémon or similar series. If the young generation spends enough time in front of the television to see commercials often enough that it pays off forthe conmpany I think we should do something against it.
And where will the sense of adventure and exitement go that we had when we explored the cool stuff when we where shopping with our parents? I think it's much better when someone brings something new to school that no one knows about and surprises all of the other children. Then they go home and tell their parents about it and slowly the trend establishes. If the kids already know it from the television it's just not quite the same experience.
Advertisement just supports children to buy way too much things and all of the conversations on the schoolyard are just about what they've seen on the television.
