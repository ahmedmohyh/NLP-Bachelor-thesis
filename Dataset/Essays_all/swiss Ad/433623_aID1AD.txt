I'm going to write about the use of the television from young childrens. Why should young children (aged two to five) already use a Television? Would a Television advertising direct toward young children be a problem for there developpement.
It became something usual or nearly normal, that a Television is a kind of basic object for the ideal home. But it wasn't everytime like this. The Television came up in the las century and now it is a part of the humanity. A Television is ideal to check the news, to kill boredom ore just to enjoy a lazy evening. Why should this be forbidden for young childs, a Television is harmeless.
I remember that I used to watch Television with my parents when i was younger. It was a giant grey maschine which looked like a square. I grew up with looking the "Schlümpfe" ore "Flipper" and so on but just because my parents had chosen those channels wich I "had to watch". Now, about 15 Years later a Television is much more easyier to use and because of the comming up of the Technology in humanity a lot of parents don't even check what there childs are watching. There are a lot of chanals wich I child might not should see. There is a reason why all those Film have a sticker on them on wich the adult for the watchers is written.
A child should not be allowed to chose the Televisionprogramm in such a young age. The parents should spend more time with them and also not that much in front of the television. It is important that those child gain progress for there Delevopment and it isn't the ideal way to let them gain there progress infront of a Television, because we all know there is a lot of unnessesary stuff in this "world".
