In the age of technology every thing change. Nowerdays you can watch five minutes of tv and you have seen about 10 advertisments. Many informations witch the brain has to understand and deal with it. As my father said "your are getting stupid if you watch tv. Is he right? How much are the children influated with all these advertations especially the adverts for the children. 

why shouldn`t there be ad`s vor children, whyshouldn`t company be allowed to make ad`s its their right to try to sell their products to it`scustomers, without advertising companies will make a lot of losts and couldn`t survive. Especially in the age of technology, how should Playmobil and Lego survive when children are only haning out on the smartphones ore on the pc.

The tv is dying out, because of the internet. There is less ad especially for children and when children uses Computers the are playing games or watching youtube. The children themselves can choose what they wan to see and that they`d like to buy,

The problem with the advertisments is that they passively influent the children, The ad`s influate children to buy and buy more stuff. The children are raised to be the perfect capitalist. With is imagination they will have problems to handle money. It takes them the usage to think allone when somebody tells you the whole tim eto do something.

one more point is the children can be addicted to the tv, they might sit there only to see the newest products. The ad`s are presenting fun and colors and a happy world and changes the way of thinking of a child.

in the end i don`t mind ad`s for children but they should stop being that passively influential, i fortunately never liked watching tv but when i sometime watch it, i can`t stand it. Sometimes i get the feeling getting a epileptical attack.
