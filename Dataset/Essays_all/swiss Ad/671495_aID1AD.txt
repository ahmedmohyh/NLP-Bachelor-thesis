As a matter of fact, nearly every child aged two to five watches tv from time to time or mostly even on a regular basis. Children orient themselves on every sort of idol they are in touch with. Thats why the influece of television advertisement shall not be underestimated. Still, it doesen't get children in any danger. If you have a closer look on advertisement for toddlers, its almost exclusively about toys, a tv show or gross looking colourful cereals. In the worst case, the child has a screaming fit, when it's parents won't by them that transformers roboter or the new barbie house they saw on tv. In comparison to the effects that advertisement has on younger women and teenage girls, the toddlers are far better of. While 14 year olds pressure themselves about not looking like the angel from the Victoria's Secret ad, developing a completely sureal picture of the ideal woman's body, toddlers just desperatly desire that new gameboy that now comes with every happy meal. The only risk I see in toddler advertisements, is the toy machine gun, the battelfield game or the fake granade. A potentionally handicapped child could develop a wrong image considering weapons and war. But on the other hand, children have awlays been playimg with squirt machine guns, water pistols and some centuries ago with slingshots, so a connection between playing with guns in an early chidhood and later misuse of weapons is highly questionabe. In conclusion I think that w certainly have bigger, more important issues to talk about and give our attention to, than advertisement for chilren in an early age. If a person has the opionion that advertisements have a bad influence on his or her children, this person should just simply not let them watch it.
