As a componie that sells products adressed to children its quite an efficient way to present their products to children trough the television, As jung children get those Products presented interstingly, theiy almost instantly want to get them. And as soon as they have heard of such a product they run to their parents and ask them to buy this prop seen in the advertisment. The first time the parents might resist to the demanding of the child but as it has seen the advertisment a few times they almost need to buy it to ceep their child happy. 
Whith this method the industry is able to get rid of every rubish they have produced an make profit whith it. And as a consequence families do have to handle with hundreds of unneccessary things which the children have found in TV-advertiments.
Seen like his it ise quite obvious and understandable why parents want to get rid of those advertisments directed to jung children, but on the other hand there is the question if it isn't theyr own fault that the children see all these adwertisments, I meen how much television should a child aged two to five whatch? If the parents would prevent theyr children from watching TV all the time they would not have the problems with the advertisments nd the companies would not have the possibility to mack such deals whith this and so they would maybe stop dooing this advertisements. 
In my oppinion TV-advertisment is one of the most annoying things in the world and I would love to get rid off, but I does not have to be vorbidden to make advertising especcialy for such jung children because if they do see to much advertising it's not only the fault of the companies but also of the parents. Children in this age should not wach too much TV.
