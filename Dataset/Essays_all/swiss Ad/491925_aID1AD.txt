This essay is about television advertising directed toward young children. It will be talked about if it should be allowed or not.
Television advertising is a common topic nowadays. There exists a lot of differences in opinion about what should be allowed and what not. Advertising toward children is a good way to get their interest. For parents it can be hard to get their childs attention to teach them useful learning games with letters and numbers, but when they see it on TV they often think it's super fun and they often ask their parents to get it for them. As long as the commercial is appropriate for children it should be considered something positive. 
Television advertising should be allowed as long as its content is appropriate for the age of the children and as long as it is advertising something useful. As soon as it gets to toys or games that a parent doesn't want their 4 year old to have, it shouldn't be allowed to be advertised on TV. It is important to consider what comercial is shown after or before a TV show. There should simply not be any comercial about aggressive computer games after a show that is watched by little children. At the same time I think it is each parents responsability to be aware first of what their child is watching and secondly that commercials aren't always made to be seen by everyone. Children, especially the younger ones that are only about two or three years old, don't care what they watch. Often you can turn on any TV program and they'll happily watch it. Children that young don't get what part is the actual show and what part is commercial in a TV program. It is almost impossible for a television advertisment to reach young children. 
In the end my opinion is that television advertising should be allowed and it's each and every parents responsability to let their child watch shows that were made for that age and to be aware that there can always be advertising that is not appropriate for the age of their child.
