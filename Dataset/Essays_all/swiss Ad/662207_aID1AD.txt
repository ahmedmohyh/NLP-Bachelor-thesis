In this essay, I will discuss, if television advertising directed towards young children between the age of two to five should not be allowed. 

Everyone living in western civilization is confronted with advertisements, that influence us and what we will buy in the future. The difference between an adult and a young kid is, that an adult can think critically about the products being advertised. A child has not developed this way of thinking at this age. So marketing strategists design their ads, so that the children immediately want to buy the product. Parents, that want to avoid confllict with their offspring, just buy them everything being advertised on television, so they stop annoyingthe thir parents. And of course the companies make a lot of profit. Good for the companies and bad for the bank account of the parents.

On the other hand one could argue, that the parents could just turn of the TV and let their kids play in the garden. And if the children want to watch a movie or TV show, they can play them a DVD or use Netflix. Because like this no advertisements will bother anyone. But some think, that advertisements directed to children are not that bad. The parents will know, what they can get them for birthday and christmas and with great parenting skills the kids will not constantly annoy their parents with their wishes.

Finally I would say, that no law should prohibit advertisements directed to young children, because it would disturb the principle of free market and the parents can decide on their own, if they want their children to watch these advertisements. The ones, that do not like the ads can just turn of the TV.
