Television advertising is as popular as never before. As we know advertising wants to make us buy products. What most people don't know is that they create ads which stay in our mind unconsiously. This means that we can think of a product which occurs to be silly but in the end we buy it because one saw it in an advertising before. This strategy is dangerous espacially when it is directed towards young children. They are influenced easily and get obsessed with something before you know it. Should it  really be allowed to play with childrends minds just to enhance the profit of the industry?

Advertising is probably one of the most important aspects in terms of selling and promoting a product. If one set boundaries for certain companys it would create an unfairness. A free market is what most of the people are looking for. 

We must consider that we already have some products which are not able to be advertised in televison, for example cigarettes. Why is most certainly obvious, it harms people. Directing advertising to children could be harmful too, doesn't it? Maybe not physically but mentally. It gives them an unrealistic illusion and can lead to problems for parents too. They have to deal with their needy children. 

In my opinion advertising directed towards young children mustn't have a greatinfluence. It is the wrong way to make people buy their products. The causes of this should be taken into consideration.
