Essay about television for young children

Every child want to watch television, but is this really a good thing? I mean there are a lot of series only for young children and this series say, that the children will learn something with the television. But is it really better to sit at home and watch television instead of playing outside with the other kids? I dont think so. In the first years of our life we learn how to integrate us in the sociality, how to make friends and how we should be to other persons. All these things do we learn during the playing outside with the kids from our neigborhood. We learn so much for our future and i cant believe that the television can relpace this things. And today there are a lot of teenager who arent social and arent well-bred, because they never learned it. They werent outside with the other kids and didnt learn how to make friends and so they dont know how to treat other kids in the same age. 

Another problem is, that the science have found out, that television is bad for your intelligence in the first years of the life. Someone who always played outside is better in school than someone who always watched television. The television watching children cant stay concentrate a hole day, because they never learned it. Children without television have to engage with themselves, because there isnt always a programm for them. So for these kids it is easier to stay concentrated even if the lesson is boring or they dont like the subject
