There are arguments for and against this topic. And both of them are understandable and reasonable. 
Children between the age of two and five do not remember a lot, there is no tomorrow for them and they do not have any time feelings. They do forget a lot and if they see something that could be bad for them they will not remember it in a while, for example a three year old will not remember an advert with war content a couple of months later. Television advertising is mostly about cars or shampoos and a young child will not be able to use this information or be influensed massivly like a grown-up. Most children will watch childrens programms and in most cases there is no advertisment shown and if, mostly for the programm itself or the next show. 
On the other hand children do learn fast, especialy in this age category. They hear and see things and they repeat them, this is how a child learns, it is totally natural. So if a child, by any chance joins in its' parents watching some programme on television and there is an advert for a game that involves guns the child may see this as a normal thing. Or if there is an advert with bad or rude words the child may repeat them. There could be adverts with content that is for adults and a child should not see that. 
So there are two sides to this, depending on the adverts shown and how mature the child is. 
My personal opinion is that children should not watch to much television anyway, it is bad for them to sit in front of screens for hours and if they watch something it should be child friendly and not agressiv or with adverts. But because of the fact that a lot of children television programms do not show adverts a child can watch television alone as well. If that is not the case there should be a adult watching the child. In the end it is the dicision of the parent if they would like there child to grow up with adverts.
