Television advertising directed toward young children is for some parents a problem. The kids become angry and sad if they don't get what they want. This get on the nerves of the most parents. It's a shame that even the young children in our world are used to get the big money, they say. Mostly exact these parents aren't just a little bit better then these people who made the advertisments. Why do they let the kids watch television alone? If it really is a big problem for them  they should be sitting next to their kid and watch with them. Some other people say it has some advantages. The children learn that they can't have everything they see. Something that is important in their future life. The people that never learned this are often the people who couldn't handle even with their own money. If they see something in the advertisment or any where else that they like - for them, it has to be bought.
That means that there are two sides. On the one side the children could have a problem with the parents because it thinks that they never get what they want. When the parents never speak to them and tell them what the problem is it coud end in a bad relationship between them. But on the other side they learn something that is really important in our life today. They don't always get everything.
In my opinion this problem isn't that bad. The most of the parents think their child just learns bad things if they're alone. They aren't able to learn the right things. Sometimes that's right but even then it's not that grave. The parents forget that children can forget some things really fast. On the next day they've already forgotten the problems of yesterday. But the adults who are responsible for these children should learn from this. If they can't handle to not always give what they see and want they shouldn't let the kid watch television all the time.
