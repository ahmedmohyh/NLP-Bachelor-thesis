A child which is aged two to five years old is a young child. A young child who should playing with other children in the country. So they have connected frienships and be outside. To be outiside is a important point. Television is a electric device that is coming soon, so the child looks soon as posibile televison when they grows up. 
It's also a question what the child look's. When they looks childmaternity films it be ok, despite it's important to looks how long your daughter or son show television. If they show a very long time it isn't well or when they looks horror films or other not childmaternity in this aged. The child is in a phase that they learnt much of things which is very important for live. Play with children, have friends, be outside with a lot of nature things, etc.

My mind of this statement is that child which is aged two to five years old is a important age to connect with other friends. When they playing with neighbours the child is outside, should connect friendships with other children and a good way to have a very well childhood. For me, children shouldn't shows television in this aged, maybe a little childhood serie at evening for sleeping.
