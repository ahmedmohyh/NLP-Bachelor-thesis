The discussion about advertising directed toward young children is very difficult. The following essay will show and collect some controverse points and will try to figure out which one is better.
First of all it's important to save young children from bad influences like violent videogames or stuff like this. Advertising for young children counts to those bad influences. In the end those advertisings and TV-spots manipulate young children, they aren't ready to decide what's bad and what's okay.
The second reason why those TV-advertisings shouldn't be allowed anymore is that children should'nt watch that much TV they should play outside and search friend and television shouldn't destroy this possibility by using advertising towards children.
There are also arguments against this statement.
First there is the point that parents should also learn to save their children and they have to learn how they should teach the children how they have to behave, and what is good and what is not. Advertising in the TV is perfect for that. It's an easy way to learn separating beween good and bad.
Furthermore children can't understand much of those TV-spots so they would'nt have any grave psycholocical problems. It is much worse for the children if they get saved from everything, then the won't learn the important things and it is ways easier to learn stuff at the age of two or five.

After this arguments I think it's clear that it would be wrong if we forbid advertising in TV. I saw that children could learn very much with those TV-spots in an very easy and risk-free way. They can learn to seperate good stuff from bad stuff. It is clear that the parents should show the a good balance between TV an real live, so those advertisings wouldn't be harmful if the parents hold this balance and allow the children to learn but show them the right way.
