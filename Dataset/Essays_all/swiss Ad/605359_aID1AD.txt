In the weekends, I take guard to my five year old niece and sometimes, we want to watch some TV escpecially the children's programe.Before the climax of the plot ,we are interrupted by annoying advertisers. The problem is that they are not for children's eyes and I have to cover them. I feel ashamed because it is not that late. I would propose that children in this age should not be directed advertised because the content is sexualized. 


The advertising has changed, they are more sexualized content also in the children's program.Cartoons aquire costumers for their toy and the appearance is not childlike. That could be a danger for the growing up of the children because they children are in these phase naive and see a model in them. That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control. 

Second, the language is developping in this time and if they hear for example curse words from the ad, it could have consequences for their language skills in the future. The direct communication between children and ads is powerful and influences the language. The produces use it for their profit but forget the impacts for their young costumers. 

At the end, it would be my advise to the advertisers to make theyproduct more childlike becuse it could have serious impacts for their later consumers, the children. I think censoring is not effective, to fit in for the childrens growing up would be much more sustainable.
