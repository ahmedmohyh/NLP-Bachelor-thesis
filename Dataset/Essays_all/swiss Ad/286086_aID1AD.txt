Nowadays,every child aged two to five, watches Television. There are so many channels for children in our time, but as we know, a channel can't stay alive without showing advertisments on TV. But does this affect the children to buy something?

Firstly, children grow up with their parents, and the parents always teach their son or daughter what they should do or believe and what not. So now when they see an advertisment on TV they should know, if it is something essential or not.
Secondly, the owners of the TV-Channels are very smart and they know what kind of advertisment they have to show to children. They show them advertisment of new toys coming out soon, or trailers from disney films. They try to force them to ask their parents to buy this or to go to the cinema to watch this movie.
Finally, showing these advertisements on TV is rightly correct. Theres nothing like a law against these advertisements, they should only content stuff for the variety of people who are watching. For example, it would be a crime to show on a channel for children an advertisment with sexual content.
In conclusion, my point of view is that advertisment toward young children should be allowed. I think children are smart enough to know that they shouldn't believe everything or let themselves misslead by an advertisment for buying something they don't really need in reality. The Channel Owners just should know, what type of advertisment they show to the children.
