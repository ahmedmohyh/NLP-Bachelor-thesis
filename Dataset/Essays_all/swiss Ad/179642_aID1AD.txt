"Advertising"

whats my opinion about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." So, for me it makes especially mo matter. Such young children can not be affected of a television advertisment or not, because they to young to think about this things. they sit on the sofa and watch into the screen of the television and they only think about amusant things they see in the screen, so i think the aimgroup of television advertisment are children with the minimal age of ten years, and there won't be a law of showing these things to children aged two to five. Another aspect is that the main goal of a advertising will take peoples interesting to buy some things, and the statement, that parents of two to five years old children buy them all things they need, so this reason also makes the statement on the top unorrect. I can also understand, that there is a discussion about this topic, because young children often watch TV and to much is naturally very bad, so there any many reasons to make this statement correct. I am not good enough informed to say if these sentense is correct of false or if i agree with it or not, but i think it's important to look that children don't look to much TV because in younger age it is better to make experiences outside and not the hole time before a screen.My opinon is, that it makes no matter-
