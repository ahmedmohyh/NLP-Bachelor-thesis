Nowadays an increasing number of families leave their children in front of the television for several reasons. This circumstance results in different effects, whereby this essay will specifically focus on the influence of the advertisements on these kids. 
The science of commercials has become a huge field of interest for today's society and, if not acquinted to the topic, is largely underestimated in it's manipulative effect on human psychology. Unconsciously numerous gadgets are used to catch our attention, using colours, emotions etc. As one's maturity grows, you gain the abilty to distinguish between desires and reality. It takes a lot to put your realistic judgement over your will and it is that especially young children struggle in realising what lays within their possibilities. They see other kids laughing on TV and wish to be in their position - leading to the parents having a hard time explaining, why they will have to find their luck without these toys. On the other hand side Psychology states, it stengthens a kid's self-confidence if he/she can see their acting having a direct influence. They see something, aak for it and half an hour later they might hold it. Knowing there is action potential emphasises their self-esteem, nevertheless for example incresing their ability to get over frustration. This argument can easily be weakened though since parents can also emphasis this characteristic by for example simply playing games with their kids - without spending any money. 
In my opinion I find it unnecessary to display commercials on TV to small kids because it is not them that will have to live with the 'consequences', thus paying for the gadget. Commercialists are taking advantage of kids and them being easily biased and this should nowhere be allowed.
