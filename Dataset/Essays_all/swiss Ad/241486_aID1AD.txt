Should we allow televison ads to be directed at younger kids? This is a very controversial question, with no definite answer and a lot of different point of views. The main problem with advertisement to very young kids is the fact, that they are extremely susceptible to it, and that their brains are not yet fully developed. Should we let our kids be controlled by television ads, or is the whole discussion unnecessary, as older people are influenced on the same level?

The question we must ask ourself, is are these kids really so much more susceptible than we are? On the one hand, kids at this stage in life have still a lot of things to learn,and are more susceptible to influence, but on the other hand the ad is not making them buy it, it is just showing them a product that they want to sell, and the kid can then decide if he wants to buy it. We know that we can influence kids very easily, and we can steer them in a direction. You can tell a kid how cool a soccer club is, and he might just start supporting that soccer club. At their age, kids might not know what they want, and bombarding them with  ads will only confuse them, and they will want something new everyday. But we always influence our kids, no matter what we do. No matter what you tell a kid, you are influencing him. One can argue that if it's not a televison ad, it will be a poster, or a toy that you see in a store, and that it is just a different way of advertising. 

In my opinion television ads to under five year olds should be banned, as these companies are just trying to make a profit. If a child sees so many ads a day, it will influence him, especially at such a young age. It will have an influence on him, and I cannot see, how this influence could be positive. The only positive is that companies make a lot of money, and I think that is not a good reason to negatively influence our children.
