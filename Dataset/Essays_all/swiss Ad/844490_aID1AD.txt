Children at the age of two to five years should not already be watching television. In that time period children learn to talk, to walk or start to play with children in their age. So the parents have to be responsible and should not let the child watch television. It could have an huge impact in the child's evolution. For example a child who watches television every day or a child who goes and socializes. Which child will have the better social connection when they are older.

Another reason why children should not watch advertises on television is that, at their age they can not understand what ads are for. Ads are for parents who buy the stuff for the children but it is just a waste of time if a kid watches advertises. Last week I went to visit my uncle and then his child was watching television as why arrived. There was an ad going on about a new Mercedes car. I asked myself why did my uncle not change the channel because now the kid is talking about this new car but my uncle did buy a new car not so long ago. Also advertises give you that feeling that you have to be the same as this celebrity on television so children should not be thinking like that already in their young years.

A contradicting reason could be that children who watch advertises on television may notice earlier that it is just a huge money buisness. So as they get older they can handle it better than children who did not watch ads. Noticing that ads just want you to buy everything is a good notice. It can give you another way of thinking. 

At my point of view it is better when young children aged two to five do not watch television advertising because nobody should watch it. It is just a huge buisness of making money on stupid people who believe thing on television.
