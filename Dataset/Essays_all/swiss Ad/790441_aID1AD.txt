I don't think that television advertising toward young children should be forbidden. Because the companys who make teslevision advertises toward young children, they mostly also sell things for this young kids. It would not make any sense if they want to sell a toy for children and then they would make the advertise for adults. Because the parents don't want the toy. Television advertises are often made for young children because they want to impress the kids, and if they are impressed, they directly go to their parents and ask them to buy the toy or whatever. If the advertise don't impresses the child, they don't even ask their parents to buy the toy, and then the company would not sell many toys. And thats not what the company wants, so they better makes talevision advertises for young children.
But in the other way, i don't think that it's good to make televion advertises for young children. Of course, I understand the companys and the magasines why they're doing it but i think it's just not good for the young children. Because when they watch the advertises the always think that they need this toy or whatever it is. And so they are never confident with what they already have. Maybe they got a new toy yesterday, but then they watch television and in the advertise there is another toy, maybe a newer one. And so they directly think that this toy is better and of course they want the newer one.
So my answer to this question is, that i still think that television advertising is not only a good thing but it is quite normal nowadays and you cannot forbid it, so we have to get along with it, and the parents just have to be strict and don't buy their children everything they saw in the television advertising. So my conclusion: No i don't agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should be not allowed.
