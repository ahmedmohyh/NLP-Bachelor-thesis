If adult people see an advertisement on television, they often don't watch to closely, they aren't interested in the majorty of the advertised products and even if they are, they are only influenced in their purchasing decision by some degree. Now a child, especially a small one views advertisement completly different, it often can not differenciate truth from lies and is way easier influenced in general. If for example an advertisement of a specific toy is shown, in which all the children posessing it are happy, the child will think its own life would definetly be better if it posessed this specific toy. This can even lead to a point where the child envies the people shown in the advertisment, even though they are only characters playing their role. The children then often try to force their parents to buy this specific toy by crying or even beating them. This is even worse if a company promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. If for example Mc'Donalds is adverstising their products beginning at a young age, many will often eat there for the rest of their lives and damage their health. So to conclude, I am against advertisement for young childen, because they are to easily infleuncable.
