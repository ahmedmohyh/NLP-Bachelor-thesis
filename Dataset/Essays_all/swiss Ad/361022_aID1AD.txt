Some people might say that directing adverts to children should be forbidden. 
However why would it be bad for kids, who do not have any money to buy something, to see an advert about a toy. It might make them want it and what is so bad about that. In my opinion the adverts are probably not even adressed to the kids rather to the parents so they get inspired what they could give their toddlers for Christmas.
I think most people are scared when kids are confronted with advertisements too early they might get as 'consumption needy' as our society. But as I see it there is no escape out of this mentality because we are their idols and as long as we do not change our way of thinking there is no way that the next generation grows up differently. So if you do not want that our children grow up with the same mentality as we have you could say we should ban adverts from the television in general. But what sense would that make. I mean most of our companys rely on advertisments so they can sell enough products. By banishing adverts we would just ruin most of todays factories.
As I see it the only reasonable solution for people who want advertising directed towards kids not to be allowed anymore is that they should not let their children watch telly. This might be harsh but in my opinion it is the only option which would work for most or rather all.
