Advertising directed towards children has always been a controversial theme. In the last couple of years the age of the children advertiser try to get to is dropping more and more. The main reason for thar being that young children are getting more access to digital devices. Since the goel of a lot of people is to earn money, they try to find any way possible to do so. And the market for small children is fresh and new. 
But a lot of people are against the advertising towards young children. The mainargument is that they are too young to understand what the advertiser actually do to them. They just see a new toy and therefore they want it. Because they are so young, they are easy to manipulate. They are unconsious of most their actions. Thats why most people find ist morally unexceptable to do that. Small children don't know what they are doing.
But on the other hand they are also very smal and have no money or any other way to actually buy anything. They don't earn any money, so the only way to actually buy something would be through their parents. If their parents don't want to buy something, they don't have to. 
So i personally find it morally bad to do advertising towards small children. But at the end it is still in the hands of their parents if they actually fall for a advertisement.
