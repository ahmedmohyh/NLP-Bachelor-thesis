Television advertising, wich is directed towards young children, should not be allowed. 

Television advertising is actually a very smart thing. They are made in a very smart way to make you buy things, even tought you probably do not need them. Especially young children are very naive. One can manipulate them very easily. Young children do not know anything about smart shopping, about what to buy and what to not buy. When a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising, it does not think twice. The child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy. A young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use. Television advertising has no other use than making people buy things. It does not show one anything usefull. Television advertising is using young childrens naivity. The people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television. They know that as soon as a child wants something, it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants. And the parents kind of do not have another choice, than to buy their children what they want. So moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child. And most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and also a huge waste of time. People and young children are forced into watching television advertising, because the television advertising always shows up in the middle of a movie or tv show.

Personally, I think television advertising towarts little children should not be allowed, because it is not fair or right to manipulate and trick them into buying things.
