First of all, it could be a problem if the children don't watch television. In todays society it's sure quite impossible but some parents do still have a quite conservative mind and don't want their children to watch television. 
Secondly, children can be manipulated very easily. So if they see an advert, which is for sure an exaggeration of the actual product, the children will scream and shout until they get this, probably very expensive, product.
On the other hand it's a quite good idea for kids to see all the new products they could learn with. Like this, the producers don't have to wait until a miracle happens and the kids or their parents will see the toy in the shop. 
Also it could be a good way to teach the kids that they can never have everything they want. Sure, for this the parents have to be quite strict, but if they are like this I'm sure the child will grow up an adult which has a lot of self-esteem.
Last but not least, todays children have so many difficulties to accept a no. So many parents would do and buy everything for their kids and like this the child wants the parents to buy everything they see in the television. Even if they will play just one time with this toy because after they already want another one.
In conclusion, I can say that I am against television advertising directed towards young children.For me, the best argument against these kind of adverts is that the children can be manipulated this easily. Grown up know this for sure and that's why they do this kind of advertising. And because of that it shouldn't be allowed.
