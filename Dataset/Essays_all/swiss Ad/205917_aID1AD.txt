You can look at this statement in a lot of different ways. Firstly, let's look at why these commercials shouldn't be allowed: Many children in that age don't understand the principal of buying something. The can't quite grasp yet that they can't get everthing for free. Secondly, children can be manipulated quite easily. They belive almost everything, especially when it comes on TV or an adult tells it to them.
Now we will look at why these commercials should be allowed: At the end of the day, it's not the child that buys the toy, it's their parent. It is the responsibility of the parent not to buy the child every single toy that comes up on the TV screen. If the parent doesn't buy everything in the first place, the child will learn and will not always beg for more. And surely, children can be manipulated very easily, but so can adults. Look at all commercial for womens undergarment, for example Victoria's Secret: Just by putting beautiful women in your underwear and putting them on huge billboards, millions of women drag their husband to your shops to spend a lot of money. This shows it is even worse with adults.
In my opinion, childrens commercial should be allowed, because it's responsbility of the parents, and they are as naive as their children.
