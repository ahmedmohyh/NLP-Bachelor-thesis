Television advertising is a medium, that can be used to manipulate people. For example if a product is presented as a speial deal, so you get 2 for the price of 1, a lot of people will buy this. A simple explenation for this is, that people think that they make a good deal and buy lots of it just to save money. In reality the company selling the products is just profiting of the whole situation and the people buying the things are loosing their money.

Now the problem with children is, that they don't have a lot of experience and are there for more manipulative.
If a girl sees a commercial for "Pink Fluffy Unicorn", that is sprinkled in glitter and covered in light rays, then the kid feels attracted to it. Or if a boy sees the new "RC Speed Car" he will ask his parents to buy it for him. The parents loose more and more control over what their children are watching due to the rapid technology enhancements. Children learn earlier and faster than ever before to use electronic devices and may also find a way to use dad's creditcard to buy things online. These payments often aren't refunded and therefor a problem for the family.

The rude part of the whole thing are the companies producing these ads. They are looking for children, which beg their parents for a new toy. And if a todler accidentally buys something of the internet that costs much, the companies simply don't care because the only thing they see is profit.

My general oppinion is, that companies still should be able to do ads specifically for children, but its not okay to just gain from their misshappenings.
