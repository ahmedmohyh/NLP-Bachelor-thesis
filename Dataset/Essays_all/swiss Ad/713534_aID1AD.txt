Advertisments are everywhere these days. Companies wnt to make money and concluding they put their advertisments everywhere. Newspapers, billboards and television are full of advertisments for every age group out there but should there rally be advertisments even for chlildren? 

Children lets say from age two to five, do they rally understand that what they see is really an ad? The whole point of advertisment is that the viewer sees the product and feels inclined to buy it but children are not able to buy what they want so in the end it doesnt rally matter if they see the advertisment or not. 
What is actually important is the parental advisory. If the parents themselves dont want their children to be watching all of those advertises on television then they should cut the the TV-time for their children. Its not the companies fault, somehow they need to make money.

On the other hand ads are everywhere and it is impossible for one individual to avoid them. They influence uf into different thinking and are there to make us want things that we didnt even knew existed. Why would we want the chlidren to be influenced at such a young age? Children are supposed to be playing outside with other kids and to enjoy childhood but it is inevitable that sometimes a little time on televison is also needed. But in that time they get influenced into wanting toys and games that get advertised. They dont get to enjoy their favourite show or programm because after some ads they wish to have a product or toy that got promoted some time prior. 

Concluding to all this i agree with the statement that TV-ads should not be allowed for children younger that five. Companies should stop try and influence children at such a young age and we should let them be children becaous there is enough time where they will get influenced ba ads.
