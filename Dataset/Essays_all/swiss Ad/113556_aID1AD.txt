In the first years of your childhood you creat your future. Parents who are working a lot and don't have much time to look after the childern are using the television to entertain their children. By watching television you can learn a lot and it's good for your mind to educate more things. You have to plan it so they will have something to look forward to. 

In the age two to five your child needs love, attention and time with his parents. This three things are more important than anything. So spend time with your children outdoor to have fun and make some experience. They will remember this and it will make them happy. Sure you don't have to look to good after them because they also need some time to figure out things by themselves and have fun with friends. But they need you as a parent and in this age they learn to walk, to eat, to talk and in every way they're making their first steps. It's important you are there with your kids when these things happen. 

I think that it should be allowed but you need to plan it. So that the kids have regular sleep times (if this is possible) and eat a lot. It's important that you spend as much time as you can with your children because the time will be gone and soon the will be 17 and have their first boyfriend, have sex, their heart get broken and all that stuff. Time runs fast so you have to live in the moment and enjoy it as much as you can. Some day they will leave your house and sure they will always be your children but they will be gone (not forever of course) but you're no longer directly responsible for them. They bild their own lives and you have to be proud of them. Teach them as much as you can they will remember the important things you said to them. And maybe they will take some things with them and do it just like you.  Make the time that you have with them memorable and give the best you can give.
