Television advertising directed toward young children between two and five should not be allowed.
I agree with the statement above for the following reasons.
At first, advertising on television will cause that children want the things they see. A good example for this is, when they make promotion of a game, the young will show it to their parents. This leads to finally buying the game for their daugther or for their son.
Furthermore, children will learn at such young age that the world is full of promotion. This is how they get to know todays world. Maybe this will help them to think intelligent in school and in their lives.
In the other hand, the two to five aged need to watch programmes specific for their age, for example ''Dora Explora''. This is a television show where the young are able to learn new things. It is way better for them.
Moreover, it could be possible that television advertising will cause a lot of more questions than answers because they are very young aged.
In my opinion, the two to five aged don't need to watch a lot of TV at all. Of course they can learn something but there are better ways for that. Television advertising can also give parents problems when they don't have enough money for everything their child sees in the promotion. That is why I agree with the statement above.
In conclusion, it is a fact that advertising on TV is not very relaxing for young aged and for the adult because it takes a lot of their free time.
