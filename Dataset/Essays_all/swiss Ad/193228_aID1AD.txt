Advertising has always been such an important thing to make people buy their products or follow their business. Television advertsising is especially in our the days the most important thing for a business to get new customers. But in this case we have a little dilemma because it is fact that there are adverts which direct children aged from two to five. And here we have to ask us if it is essential to make television advertising for young children. Are they mature enough to think about adverts or do they just watch an advert an ask their parents to buy them this product?

Firstly, young children can't have an useful opinion towards adverts because they don't have any idea of the real life. They are just there enjoying their childhood and living their life. Secondly, they do not really understand everything they say in the advertises and so they can't decide if a product is good or not. It could be that a child watches an advert and just sees all these happy children with these toys and so they really want to have the toy too. But in fact the product isn't good for a childrens' grown but they can't know thaat because of their lack of knowledge and lack of experience.

On the other hand, all of the television adverts are nowadays so important because of all the new technology. Children nowadays grow up with all these electronical devices and they might watch TV everyday. An advert for children is not just an advert it is also an inspiration for a child and could make a child dream of something. A child doesn't want to watch TV if in the pause it has just adverts for adults. An advert could also be a good distraction. 

To sum it up it is important to say that cutting of television advertising toward young children wouldn't change a big thing. Children would always see some adverts, for example in a journal or somewhere else. In my opinion it is essential nowadays to have adverts for young children, also to have a little switch to the other adverts.
