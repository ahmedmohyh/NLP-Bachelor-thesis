Like always there are two possibilities to answer this question, but neither of the two answers is completely correct or wrong. It is a matter of opinion wether youare for or against advertising towards young childre. In my eyes however advertising towards young children should be allowed. I can not think of many reasonable reasons lead to the answer that these adverts should not be allowed.

I do not see this adverts as a bad influence on children, neither do I think that these adverts harm anyone. My main argument for that is that these adverts do not contain products that are dangerous for children, all they do is make children want their product which should not be a problem as long as the adverts are not for cigarettes or alcohol. Children wanting a special toy they have seen on television is not bad for them, it might inspire them for a new wish for their birthday or as a christms gift. Some people may think different and are concerned for parents which have another opinion of these adverts, but then I think it is in their duty to make sure that the kids do not get to see these adverts. This would lead to children not sitting in front of the television which is better for them anyways.

So as a conclusion I woud say that it is impossible to answer this question with yes or no. There are good arguments speaking for both sides that can not be completely right or wrong. In my eyes the arguments that speak against these adverts are not strong enough to beat the ons on the opposite side
