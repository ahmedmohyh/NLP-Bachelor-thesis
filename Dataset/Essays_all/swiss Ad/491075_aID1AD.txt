If you turn on your television in the morning, you will most likely see a show for kids, like Dora, which teaches children a foreign language. But as the show ends, commercials start and you'll see ads for toys, dolls etc. If your kid is watching this with you, he or she might get very excited and will want you to buy the item for them. But all you wanted to do was for the kid to get some education while being entertained. Now you ask yourself: Should television ads directed towards young kids be prohibited?

In Switzerland, freedom of any kinds is highly valued. Freedom of speech particularly, as one can oppose what the government says openly. Now if someone wanted to air a commercial, they have the right to do so. By prohibiting television ads towards young children, this would definitely be a violation of the freedom of speech, one of the main values of the western societies. 

In western societies, another main value is critical thinking and developing an own opinion. This has to be taught at an early age, or the kids will not have those skills. By watching commercials directed at them, they get so easily influenced in liking or disliking something that they don't really develop their own opinion. They just follow the people and things that seem cool or trendy, but don't try t analyze what's happening to them. When those kids grow up, they believe everything they hear, they don't think twice about anything. This is exctly what has happened in the USA where everyone believed all the fake news in the internet, which lead to the election of Donald Trump.

Is that what we want for Switzerland, the election of our own Donald Trump? For me, the answer is a clear no, and the first thing we can do against this future is prohibiting commercials on television directed towards kids. They can be so easily influenced, and in the time of fake news and alternative facts, it is important from a young age on to be able to think critically and develop one's own opinion.
