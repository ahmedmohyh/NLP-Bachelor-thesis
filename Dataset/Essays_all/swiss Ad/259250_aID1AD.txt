Todays television is full with adertising. Mostly they are about toys or food for kids. They affect them in positive and negative ways and scientists now claim that this advertising should not be allowed.

As soon as kids see a new toy in television tehy want to have it. As consequence their parents have to buy it because else their child will not stop crying. Most of the parents do not want to buy their kids so many things and want that this advertising stops.

One positive aspect of advertising for young children is that the brands which are selling those toys gain a lot of money because every kid wants this new toy. And also the televison companys are gaining a lot of money because lots of brands want to make their advertising there.

I think that this advertising should be allowed but maybe their should be less of it. I think parents should learn how to say no to their kids and children should learn how to accept that "no". That is an important thing to learn in live and if all this advertising is not there anymore those children will not learn it.
