Young children are supposed to do something, because they want to learn new things and if you don`t have the time to play with your children it`s very helpful to let them wathing television. They learn new things like counting or learning colours. And it is a really good change to see a film an after play a game, ... 

On the other side for young children it is not good to see too much television, because it is better if they play with real friends, because they talk together which they don`t do by seeing television. And they are in a real life not only in a virtual life.
It is also better to play something outdoor with other people, because the fresh air outdoors is really good and it makes your head free of stuff. And if they are too long in front of the television they become stupid, because it isn`t very helpful to sit on the floor and watch and listen therewhile for a long time. 
I remember when my parents said me: "If you watch a too long time television your eyes become four ecked."

I`m not for or against it, because on my opinion it is not good to see too much television, because you need some fresh air and talking and playing with friends otherwhise you loose touch with your friends. But it is also helpful to watch a bit television, because they learn new things. And they are occupated. They are not annoyed. The television programm is most always interesting. But all in all iI think it should be allowed. If you don`t want that your children watch television you can switch off your TV or you can simply don`t by a television.
