Television advertising directed toward young children is a often discussed topic. There are different opinions. On one side you have to understand the company because they want to sell their products and earn a lot of money. They know how the children react when they see something in television what they like und then they want to have it. Their parents want that their children have all what they want and be happy. So they buy the product. 
But you have to look at the cons too. It is not good for children in this age to be confronted with games like that. And with games it is not meant a normal game, it is a psychological game. In the televison advertising they tell the children that they need that product and only with this one they could have fun. So they make a hype around something. The children are too young to understand that it is only a hype because of the television advertising and in the end they want it. But that is really unfair because they do not understand that all is based on psychology. But when you think about it, then all of us see that the companies are really mean and they use the children to sell their products. 

I think that television advertising directed towards young children is nothing what should be done, because it is not fair. The children cannot handle the situation and they do what the companies want them to do, they want that their parents buy the product.In the end the parents want that their children are happy and they  buy the product. It is like a robery, only in a legal way.
