Nowadays, it`s quiet common that little children are contacted with electronical devices at an early age. Parents give their children their smartphones, so the pupil stops crying. At an early stage of childhood parents just give the smartphone to the child and play a little video. 
Apparently, not every parent out there plays their pupil some videos on their phone. There are also parents who are very protective and don`t want their children to be contacted with devices like smartphones or tv at and early stage. Children are believing what the are seeing, it doesn`t matter if it`s in nature or on tv. This advertisements on tv are giving the pupils the false impression of the world. Futhermore, young children are influenced with advertisements on their true meaning of wrong and right. Everybody can imagine a child which has just seen an advertisemnts for sweets, the next time the child goes shopping with his parents the pupil is bagging for those sweets it has just seen in the advertisement. 
To sum up, television advertising shouldn`t be allowed for young children, because they are influenced too much by them. As a liitle child can`t differnt good or bad, true or false, it just interprates what he sees as right and that is in advertisements not very wisely. If advertisements would be banned for youngsters, parents wouldn`t have to handle bagging children, who are wanting to buy something just because they`ve seen it on tv.
