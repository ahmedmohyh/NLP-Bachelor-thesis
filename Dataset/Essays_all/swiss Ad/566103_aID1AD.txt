Generally I really, from the bottom of my heart, do not like any statement that wants to ban something because I think the greatest treasure we have these days is our freedom to do or not do what ever we want and we already have enough poeple and aswell as laws that want to tell us what to do. The same can be said for this statement although I have some more arguments especially for this one. 

I get that the advertisments could influence the children in a bad way and you might think that because they are so young they can not do anything against this influence, which you are probably right about, if they are alone. However the point that I want to make is that the parents are responsible for what their children do especially at that young of an age. That way if the parents allow their kid to watch tv they should accompany them if they think there might be controversial content in whatever their child is watching. If they do this they can talk about that content, might it be advertismnents or just a topic in the aired programm. Another thing is that I did not grow up with tv all around me because I didnt feel any need to watch tv until I was probably around 8-10 years old. Of course this is not regarding movies that I watched with friends or family. Therefore I think that this is the same for most kids however I do not have any evidence of this and even if it is like that there are for sure exceptions. 

In the end my opinion is that these advertiments should not get banned because of personal experience aswell as my opinion that everything about media and advertisment that you can learn so early on is a very valuable lesson for life in modern society. I also believe that parents should get more responsible again when there children are in contact with modern media.
