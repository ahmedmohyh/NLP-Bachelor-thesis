A mother and her daughter, aged four, are sitting together on a couch and are watching TV at six o'clock in the evening. The favorite TV-show of the girl has finished and an advertising about a princess ben shows up. The girl is fascinated but forget what she saw. Her mother is shocked and turns immediately the TV off. She is angry and calls the channel. This Television advertising did show a normal situation in our lifetime. Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or is it just a dumb thing?

First of all almost every child watches TV. Maybe a mother or a father is sitting next to them and they develop their dreams in several advertisings. They see what they want and they can look forward to telling their mothers and daddies what they want. It's in the eye of the beholder but I think they are learning to have dreams and to follow them. 

Also important is that a father or a mother can inspire itself of buying maybe a new birthday present for their child. Advertising can be inspiring even if it's for young children. 

On the other hand, against television advertising directed toward young children is that humans without children are bored if there shows an advertising for a young children aged 4 up. They want to see advertisings for themselves and not one for children. It also depends on what time it is. If there is eleven o'clock in the evening there should not be showed an advertising for young children.

To concluse, there are positive and negative aspects. I think the positive ones do overweight and I hope there won't be less television advertising directed toward young children. If you come home and you were stressed, maybe caused by work, watching advertisings is a good thing to cool down and relax a little bit.
