It is widely maintained that TV advertisements are seen every day on the TV program. More and more brand are getting used to know that advertisments who are directed toward young children are more efficent than advertisements who are directed to elder children. Studies have proven that young children aged to two and five years will insist on buying the things they see on TV than elder children who are more elevaged. Due to this reason the advertisements are economical more efficient.

On the one hand most of the parents will agree that the adverts should be forbidden. These are mind tricks to get the children with the parent to the shop and buy all the things they saw in the advert. Even if the parents deny on buying all these toys and foods the children will insist and even cry. So the parent has no chance and he must buy the things his child wishes. The argument of the parents are understandable the adverts are really mean, these young children don't have an understanding about money or other possesions if they want something they'll get it.

In the other hand these adverts are very efficient they are directed to the young children. Most of the money from adverts come from whom who are directed to young children. They are the one you can easily influence. They will
instist on everything and the parent will buy them everything to make their child happy. Until now there aren't any laws opposing to that, the brands can make a lot of money until there will be made a law from the government.

All in all it is to say that these adverts are really good on the economical side. The brands can make a lot of profit since they are advertising directly to the children. The parents and other activists aren't keen on that. These adverts are really mean because they are directed to children. The parents can't say no the hole time they can't deny to their young child who insists the hole time. These adverts should be forbidden.
