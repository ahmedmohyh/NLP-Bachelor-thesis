The biggest income of televison companies comes thrue advertising. In these days the advertising is immense. There are no borders from baby food to expensive sport cars you find everything. But shouldn't it have some limits? Especially young kids often are influenced by the advertisemts. In the following essay I'll analyse this question and tell you my opinion.
It's obvious that these kinds of advertising in televison often puts a lot on the parents because kids want things when they see it and often they're impatient. Let me ilustrate this with an example. A young guy, he is 5 years old, sees a toy truckin televison. The guy really likes it and want it immeadittly because he is impatient. Because of this the child asks his parents if they can buy it for him and if they don't do that he'll rest asking. So this shows that these advertisements can pressure the parents. They can be a pain in the neck.
On the other side we have to understand that the goverment should't make even more laws and limit our liberate system. In Switzerand there is a free economical system which shouldn't be interrupted rhrue laws, which aren't really essential.
Furthermore I'd like to present one last point. There are advertisements which can disturb young child and aren't good for their mental development and health. They sometimes shock them. 
I come to the conclussion that the advertisement in televison directed to young children should'nt be limitated because we live in a free land and every company should have there right to advertise their products and it shouldn't matter if it's directed towards younger childrens or seniors.
