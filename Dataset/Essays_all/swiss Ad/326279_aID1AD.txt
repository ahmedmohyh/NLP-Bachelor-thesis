Well this is a very important question. My opininion is that it depends what the content of the advertising is. Toy advertising is very harmless and somehow they have to sell there toys. It is normal that a kid should have toys, but we have to watch out wich toys. Ipads or Iphones aren`t toys. When you give a kid an electronic device he or she can`t handle it. So you should watch out witch toys you should buy. 

But things like food or drinks can the kid let think that he can gain superpower as a example. So they spred lies in the advertisements and so the kids want to buy this things but they dont gain any superpowers they just become fat. 

But for me the main problems are the parents. If parents control their kids than the problem is solved. A lot of parents just want have some quiet freetime and for that the kids must be quieted. And so the parents give their kids some money and the kid heads directly to the grocery store and buys some unhealthy stuff like chocolate. 

I should now this, I did stuff stuff like this. But my parens didn`t gave me money. So I stoled it and this was one of the causes that I became fat. But the bad parents combined with the advertisement are dangerous for the healthy environement of our future. Espessially in the United States is it a problem. A big percentage of the american people are fat and this is mainly the fault of the food advirtisement. 

But today there are luckily some limits and we can say that the world made some progress. When you watch commercial of the 90`s than you can see that the sugar cornflakes are on the same level as fruits. The people thought that evryithing was healthy wath the television said. But today it istn`t anymore so extreme.
