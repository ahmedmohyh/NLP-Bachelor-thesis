If parents do not know what they can do with the childrens, they sat them in front of the television. This has disadvantages and also advantages. In this essay, I will discuss if the television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Young childrens are boy and girls in the age of two to five. 

The childrens in the age of two to five are learning much easier to speak a language. Movies in Switzerland are often in standard german, while we are speaking dialect at home. Later, in school the people have to learn standard german. If they look television as a child they can better and easier speaking standard german.
A negative point of looking television is that the childrens do not play anything at this time. They do not explore and they do not make expermients what is important for getting intelligent.So they loose many important skills like going on with materials like sand.
Furthermore, childrens are inactive while they are looking television. Many people in industriated countries have a problem with overweight. On one side it is because they eat too much fastfood and sucre. On the other side it is because many people are to less active. 

In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. The children can not learn much things while looking a movie. The only thing they can learn, is to speak standard german but this they can also learn in the childrengarden.
