In this essay I am writing wheter I agree or disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Television for young children offers many different shows. From Bob the constructor to Shaun the sheep a child can find anything it desires to watch on television. This does not only help a child to widen its knowledge about the world it is now living in but also helps it decide what it build his or her own oppinion and lets it decide what it likes or dislikes in the wide range of shows on television.

On the other hand a child can also experience all these things showed on television by itself in real life, whish has many advantages. One for example is that it is outside in fresh air and has a way more realistic view on the world than it would have in a living room. 

All in all I think television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) should be allowed just to help a child grow. I mean it did not hurt me.
