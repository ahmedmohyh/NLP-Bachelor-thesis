In today's word in our society everybody is in front of a screen every day. Even young children. In television there is even adversiting that is directed toward these young children. In this essay I am going to talk about whether this should be allowed or not by mentionning manipulation, the responsibility of parents and people producing these advertisings.

Firstly, I think that it is not ethic to try to manipulate little children. They cannot even think for themselves and that is why it should not be allowed.

To avoid this manipulation, the kids' parents should not let their children watch these advertisings. It is the job of the parents to look after their two to five years old children. So, actually the advertising should be allowed, because the parends shouls simply have control over how much advertising their child is watching and if it is not too much, it is not that big of a deal.

Finally, it is the job of certain people to produce the advertisings. Their goal is to get the children to want what they are advertising about and there is nothing wrong about this. How could they otherwise make the children want the toys they want to sell? So this is another point why advertisings directed toward young children should remain allowed.

To sum up, there is something wrong about manipulate little kids, but finally their parents should be able to control how much advertising is seen by their children and people trying to sell children toys should be able to get to the children by television advertising, so I think that it should stay allowed.
