When it comes to advertisment and the way corporate companies try to trick people into buying their product, I`m usually very pro consumer. But at the same time I try to give the free market as much room to work with as possible. Unnecessary regulations and restrictions are inevitably only going to be a hindrance and don`t really give us any other benefit other than a false feeling of being protected. Television advertising directed towards young children is rarely harmful since most children aged two to five don`t watch TV the same way adults do. For example if I watch a TV show my attention span is way larger than the actual time span of the program and so once it has ended I`m still hungry for more entertainment and my brain is still consciously watching TV, which makes it easy for advertisments dircted towards me to get my attention. But on the other hand if a four year old watches a show like "Fire Man Sam" he can`t even pay attention during the whole episode, let alone during the adverstisment afterwards. Another important thing to consider is the fact that advertisment for products for young children are actually directed towards their parents since three year olds are and shouldn`t be allowed to have their own money to spend anyway. Ultimatley the parents have to make the decision to buy the product, if they consider it appropriate for their child. Even in the case of a five year old who watches an ad for an action figure or some other toy, being exposed to it can in the worst case only teach him a lesson, if he doesn`t get what he wants.
