I wasn't in this situation, that the TV made a problem for me. But now in our time, many people or almost all people have a TV. For the children and young children is TV very funne, because there are funny fils and series. But it a also advertisement. I have no proplems with the advertisement in TV, but for young people is this not correct:

Young children are for all object and situations interessted. Television advertising can use this situation and can lead in his "Richtung". The children can be interessted for a thing in the futere, which produce a company, which had made this television advertisement. 

Also is the problem, that we don't know the "Auswirkungen" by te television advertisement in the childhood. It could be manipulatet us or it nothing happens. But for me is important,that the parents know, what the children are showing at the moment and on TV cames things, that's not correct for the young people (example War Games and weapons).

The company can make little massage for the children in the television advertisement. Example the state make this and say that your country need you and you should go to the army. - Yes is a little over the top with this example. :) But I will say, that people in young years learn a lot of information and the life is based on the childhood. It is a good instrument for the state to lead the young generation.  

That television advertisemt directed toward young children should not be allowed, is for me correct. I am agree with with this statement on based of the different arguments.
