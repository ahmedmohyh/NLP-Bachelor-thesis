Advetising is amazing in our country, because we should do anything. Advertising is good, because the owner of the programm in the television raise money to pay for the movies or pay for the work to make a soup or anything. A lot of young poeple watch very often tv, because they do not have other things. 

Firstly,I think there are not very advertising for young children. Nevertheless there are advertising for sweets or something like this, but I think the young children do not understand. If the young children understand the advertising, they will go to the parents and say that they want this thing. However the parents can say no, because sweets are very unhealthy.

Secondly, It's normal to do advertising for young children, because they want that the young children watch the soup or the movie. The advertising for children soups is very friendly and not bad for the young children. Sometimes there are great advertising for young children, because the advertising explain a very good thing, that the young children have to learn.

At the End, I think it is allowed to do advertising directed toward the young children, because they have to make money that they can pay the television programm.Also the young children do not know all about the advertising. The parents have to explain to the young children and if the parents do not want this, they will not do.
