Nowadays a lot of children watch Television.But the things you see there are not just movies or series.There is always a lot of advertising in the program.And as we know advertising can be very manipulative.So the question is if Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.

Advertising isn't always something negative or manipulative.It can also inspire people.For example a child sees a very cool bag made out of jeans in an advertising in Television.The child asks his mother if he could have a bag like that.His mother answered with a clear no and so the child starts to think of how he could get a jeansbag.He comes up with the idea to create one by himself.A creative idea and clearly a good investigation of his time.So the advertising had a good influence on the child.But advertising can influence a child in a negative way as well.For exemple that the child wants everything to own by himself and to have more and more things and games.The child could get unthankful and unhappy.

In my opinion children in the young age shouln't watch TV too often but when they watch it for once it is okey to have advertising.Advertising is not only in Television visible as well in the newspaper or on walls in the streets it has a lot of advertising so why should one forbid advertising in Tv when it apears in the daily life as well.Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
