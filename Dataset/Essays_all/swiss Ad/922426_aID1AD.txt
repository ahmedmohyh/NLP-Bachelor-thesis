I think television advertising directed toward young children isn`t anything bad as long as the advertised stuff is harmless like toys or food.
The worst thing that can happen is that the child wants it and asks his parents about it. a child can`t afford anything because it doesn`t own any money.
it wouldn`t be too good if the child is obsessed with something it wants because it sees it all the time on TV. But maybe then the problem is that the child is watching too much TV.
Maybe it`s also not fair, if the TV is manipulating the cildren with certain techniques in the little spots for children toys.
Or maybe the parents get annoyed by what the children now want next time they go shopping. And if they don`t get what they want right away they cry and scream until they get what they want.
So maybe then its not that good to have televisoin advertising directed toward such young children. but i think as long as it is in a reasonable amount and reasonable things it`s all right.
