"Today, most of the children aged two to five aren't interested in playing outside, because they prefer watching television though." That's what most of the people think now a days. But is it better to forbid the TV?
I see the point about the missing time outside, playing with other children, running around in summer, building snowmen in winter or playing with animals. It's very important to children to make friends. But without going outside, it isn't possible. But why forbid watching TV at all? I mean, when I was little, I was allowed to watch television, but I had a limit. And that's what children today need too. When the have a limit, they can go out too and make their expierences in the real world. By the way, not all shows in TV are dumb. There are some really good shows, for example Dora. The children are learning english while watching the show. Also, children can learn much about freindship, helping each other or being courageous. Some people think, watching television is bad for the childrens eyes. Well, I'm not a doctor, but I don't think it's that bad. One more argument against the forbid is, it's the today's world. The world is full of tecnic! So children should be allowed to live modern too. 
I think my opinion about that statement is clear. Children should definitely be allowed to watch TV, even in young age. As long as it's not the whole day, I can't see the problem.
