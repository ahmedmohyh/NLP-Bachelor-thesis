I'm definitely against direct advertisement towards young children.
If little kids see advertisement for a toy, they think it's cool just because they saw it on TV. Which leads to them wanting to buy it. But if a toy is shown on TV, it doesn't automatically mean that it's "better" or that each and every child should own it. It only means that the company, which produces the toy, spend a lot of money on the ad, but if that means that kids must own the toy is questionable.
This leads to the little kids becoming materialistic at such a young age.
Young children shouldn't have to worry about what they should buy to be "in", but instead  buy the toys whith which they'd like to play. 
The kids begging their parents to buy them a certain toy can also lead to unnecessary feuds at home. 
To conclude my point, I'm of the opinion that the governement should officially forbite advertisement towards young children, so that they don't grow up feeling the pressure to buy stuff, they wouldn't normally buy and that they don't already step into our materialistic society at such a young age.
