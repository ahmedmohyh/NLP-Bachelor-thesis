Children in the age of two to five are nowadays often exposed to advertisment from different sources, one of them being the Television.
The following short Essay will state some pros and cons about this topic.

Even if the statement disapproves advertisment towards young children I will start with the pro side.
In this century one is constistandly surounded by adds, thus it's important to get used to it as soon as possible. If young children learn that they shouldn't listen to the exaggoration which adds often include, they will be more resistant towards adds and the influence of media as a whole when they grow up. They learn that nothing is as it seems in television and begin to criticaly think over the whole situation and in the end decide if they e.g. want to buy the new bike which is displayed in the new add or rather stick with an older more trustworthy exemplar.

The negativ side is, that if the young children don't learn that adds aren't always saying 100% the truth, they are exposed to all those hidden traps and influences. If they see their favourite cartoon character smoking in an add, they want to try it as well. And if an add shows them which role a boy should take in life and which roles girl should take through the toys, those children will be pushed towards a stereotypical lifestyle without ever being able to lean themselves what they want to be and want they want to do in the end.
