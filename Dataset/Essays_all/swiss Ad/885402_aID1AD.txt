Advertising has always been a big thing in our society and there has been millions of arguments and discussions about it. In the following text, I'd like to share my feelings about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"
First of all I want to explain the reasons supporting this statement. In these days, children should be better protected against the news and the internet. They get so much information about things that aren't supposed to be read or heard by litte children. It seems like they're getting driven over by all that information and they can't handle that since they're so young and I think advertises directed to them makes that problem even worse. 
Another reason is, that the advertises can push people in our "consumer society" and I think it's importat to protect the childrem from becoming part of that at an age, where they can't really build an own opinion about the world. 
On the other hand, one could say it's nonsense to forbid advertising if the children can access the internet so easily and that the advertises aren't any bad for them.
