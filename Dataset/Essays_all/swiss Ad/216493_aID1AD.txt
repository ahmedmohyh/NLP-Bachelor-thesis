Social media grows. These days everyone has a cell phone, a computer or a television. Many young kids come home from school and watch television the whole afternoon. There are funny cartoons for children but also a lot of bad things, not ment for children eyes. And from time to time there comes a advertise for a unnecessary product. The kids see this product, for example a toy. They see how cool it is and what you can do with it and then of course they want to have it. So they go to the parents and beg until the parents allow them to buy it. Then the kid plays with it. Maybe for some days and then they'll forget the new toy. 
I think that the parents shouldn't allow to watch television more than twice a week. The kids can do so many other things. I used to go outside, play with friends or do homework after school when I was young. We never had a television and I am happy about that. The young kids shouldn't see the horrible movies on television. I'm not against television advertising directed toward young children. I think the parents have to resist and say no when the kid wants to buy the products which was presented in the advertise. In my opinion kids shouldn't spend the time in front of the television so they also wouldn't see the product. I think it can be allowed to make advertising toward young children. There is advertising everywhere.
