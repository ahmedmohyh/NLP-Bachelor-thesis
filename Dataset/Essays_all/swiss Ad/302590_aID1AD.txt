I think, it depends on the advertising. There are advertisings which are not good for children because they are sometimes too young to understand the backround of the advertising. It could be that they are overwhelmed about an advertising because there are things they don't understand because it is too diffucult for them. Every child has his own level of understanding things and so it is very difficult to produce an advertising which should be understand by a child who is two years old and a child who is five years old. Because a child who is two years old has other abilitys than a child who is five years old.
I also think that advertisings for children can be a good thing but they must be handled in a good way. It also can be that advertisingsfvor children can get understand wrong because the children can get a wrong view of the world. For espessialy when they see an other child in the advertising which is playing with very much of things from LEGO. They can get the feeling of not having enough or it could also be that the little children don't have the feeling that they have already enough of things and so they want to have more and more stuff. They can have the feeling of  never have enough. This could also be a difficult theme for the parents because not every mother or father can buy all the tings on the television for their child and so they could have a bad feeling about that because they want just the best for their children.
I think it is okay when advertisings for children exist but they should be easy to understand and they should not be all the time about things you can play with but about pets or things you can do with your parents.
