Yesterday my parents and me metted  a friend  from us in a cafe.  So we began to speak. The person said it should not be allowed to give the young children so much of television advertising . My mother tought different and then they began to discuss. Should television advertising to young children be allowed or not?

There is always advertising in TV. There is some for old people and theres some for young people. The guy who wants to sell the things they produced realised that children are easy to manipuate. So the children wants to have these things. There are many people who think, that this is bad for the children but the children are growing up and they have always advertise in TV. So if the children begin wth it young they have later no problems, because they know how to life with it.
On the other side could children get manipulated by this and this could be bad for the mental growing of them. But if the parents look for their children and do not let them just in front of TV this should not be a problem.The children could get real damage from this and get many sicknesses ot this. 

By the time i was in his age i looked as good as never tv. I think the parents should play with theyr kids or give them real things to play with it and do not let them sit in front of tv. So the childs have not a advertising problems. Then these children who have this problems would have other mental problems because theiy parents. So the key are the parents.
