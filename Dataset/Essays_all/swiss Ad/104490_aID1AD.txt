I agree with the statement. Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. Because I think that televisions for itself have a bad influence. Children don't learn anything useful when they watch TV, they get lazy and television advertising directed toward them is very bad. Aged two to five are not able to think like adult people and they could get the advertising wrong. It is likely possible that they are, after they have seen it several times, convinced that they need to have for example this little car. Then, parents are pressurised to buy the child the car or the child would be very sad. Also his or her friend could make fun of him or her because the child does not have the car. The marketing industry takes advantage of the normal behaviour of young children and I think that this is not very human friendly. The only reason why I could disagree with this statement is that the effect of televison advertising direced toward young children is not very well known. Maybe there is also a positive influence. Maybe the future children can handle money better than we do now. Over all there are better things to do for young children than sitting around and watching TV. And if they are not watching TV they can not see the television advertising. Problem solved.
