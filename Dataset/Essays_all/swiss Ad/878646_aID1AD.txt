Advertising

Yes, I agree with this statement. Because the young children aren't the ones who will buy it, the desicion isn't in the hand of the children, it's in the hand of the parents. The advertisment woudn't realy make sense, becaus why would you advertis a product to a customer who isn't able to buy it. Also a big problem, if we don't let advertisments be allowed, is that this children televison channels wound't get money, becaus the most channels life from the money throug advertisment. 
On the other hand, the advertisment could affect the childrens, in the way how they will spent money when they're older. Also it could affect, that the childrens will start to argue with they parents, if they could have this product. This would maybe manipulate the parents, wich will buy this product in the end. 
My oppinien, is that advertisments should be allowed, becaus without it, the most children channels would disapear. But the parents have to teach there childrens about advertisment and how to understand theme.
