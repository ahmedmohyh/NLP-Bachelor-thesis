Today advertsing is one of the most important point for the success of  companies or for someone who offers something. On each corner we colud find an advertisment about a product or service. The advertisment on television has much influence on the people who watch a film, series or an other show. There are advertisments about every things and for each age of a person. The television  advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Often the young children couldn`t buy the thing in the advertisment on his own. They don`t have enought money or they are still not able to buy it alone. So the televison advertising for the young children are more directed to the parents of them and they can decide if they want to buy the thing in the advertisment or not. The people don`t need this sort of advertising because young people don`t watch that much television. Children  see an advertisment on television about a toy and then they really want it and thats annoing for the parents. 

I think television advertising directed toward children should be allowed. It doesn`t hurts someone. Sometimes it could be annoiny but it is still legal. And the people who don`t want to watch it can swap to an other channel.
