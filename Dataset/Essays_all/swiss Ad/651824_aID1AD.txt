The question of this essay is, if i agree or disagree with the following statement. Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

First, I would like to point out that children as young as two to five will not remember this time later in their life, maybe except very traumatsing experiences. Furthermore,young children should watch channels which are specifically made for them in order not to scare them to death. 
Also, they should not watch advertisement for adults. For example women in the advertisement of Gilette shave their legs, which does not sound bad at first. But if you look close it already teaches them the role of men and women in the society and children shoud not deal with that. 
In my opinion it is better for them to get an advertisement for something to play with. If they liked the things on television they can ask for it as a present for christmas or their birthday. The parents can then decide if it is worth bying.
In the end the parents decide anyways, what their children are watching. If the parents do not like advertisement for children, t
For those reasons I disagree with the statement.
