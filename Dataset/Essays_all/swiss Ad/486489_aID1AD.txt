Children watch television to enjoy the afternoon or the have good dreams during the night and advertisements just disturbe there. Cildren do not know how to handl money and they do not know consequenses of the things they do. Advertisement is influenting children on a level they do not know at the age under five.Children should anyway not watch a lot of TV and if there are advertisements the programs last longer so they have to spend more time watching TV. because they want to watch a program to the end.Children should spend time outdorrs or playing and enjoy there time with no or just few dutys. So TV for children should just send a program during specific time slots.
Advertisments are often unreaistic and led to wrong impressions especialy when seen by children because they do not know what you can do and what is unrealistic or imposible. So childs try things that they should not and would never do if they hadn't watched TV-advertisements.
Also Advertisements are corrupt! Rich companis can do a lot of it and get more costumers so they get even richer while poor companis can just do a little and will only reach a few people and won't get a lot of money so they stay poor and often get bought by a rich company so that in the end we only heve one or two very rich companis who dominate the market and no other company can rise because the rich ones can lower the price without lossing much while the small one can't exist at the low price.Because especially children don't kniw what other companis exist and when the see a advertisement for product X from company Y they just want product X from company Y and not from company P.
So all in all the advertisement to children makes them wanting things they do not need and makes them spend more time on-screen while the big companis get even bigger and bring small companis to give up.
