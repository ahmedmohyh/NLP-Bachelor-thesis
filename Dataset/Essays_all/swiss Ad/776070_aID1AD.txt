Television adverstising directed toward young children (aged two or five) should not be allowed.

Even though the television doesn't exist since a long time, it plays an important rule in our lifes, especially if you grow up with it. There are a lot of parents who put their children in front of the television and make them watch it for hours. The children will not only watch different shows, but also the adverstisings that are played every 20 minutes or so. But are these advertisings bad for your children?

When I was a child I really enjoyed seeing all the different toys, that were displayed on the tv. Even if I knew I wouldn't get all or even one of the toys, I liked seeing how they looked because it exited me. I think that there are a lot of children who feel the same. Advertisements directed towards children are really entertaining and that's a reason why they should be allowed.

There are also children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way. These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them. But it's the parents job to make their child understand, that it can't get everything it wants and to be carefull about not making it spoiled.

The other question is the one about morality. Isn't it bad to try to influence a human, who doesn't really understand that it was influenced? Yes, actually it is really bad, but on the other side it's a way to make them get in touch with these kind of things and to teach them how to handle these situations.

My general opinion is, that the advertisings aren't bad. They can even be good. But it's the parents task to control the level of influence and to manage how their children will react to them. Parents can even use this experience to teach their children important things about life and to teach them that they won't get everything they want. And besides the advertisements you shouldn't let your two to five year old child watch too much television anyway.
