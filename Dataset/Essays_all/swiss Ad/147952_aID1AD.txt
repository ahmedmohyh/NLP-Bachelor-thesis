Every company tries to get their product to the group of people who could be interested the most in buying these things. So with any advertisements, does not matter if it is a television advertisement, an ad on the radio or adverstisements in form of print media, the seller of the product tries to hit a specific group in the society. So some ads direct toward young people and some try to convince old people to buy products of the company.

The statement critisises television advertisings heading toward the youngest of generations aged betweed two and five years. It says that adverstisements like these should not be allowed to be sent out by any television channel. The very young kids are not able see through the advertising. They just see the video in their TV devices and think that this product must be amazing. They cannot build an own opinion on the product that got presented to them because their brain is still in such a young state so it is not possible for them to have some controversial thoughts on the clip they just have seen. 

On the other side the kids somehow have to learn how to look at things critically and not just believe the first thing they see or the first sentence they read. They will get confronted with this topic at any time in their life. So why should we hide adverstisements heading towards this part of society when they get to them in a certain point of life anyway?

In my opinion banning television advertisings that are specificly going to young children is just something to hide the reality from them. But it would definetly help if parents try to tell the kids what the advertising is trying to do and how it tries to manipulate them. So the kids have a basic knowledge on how adverstisements are made and how they work so they do not just believe everything they see in their television device.
