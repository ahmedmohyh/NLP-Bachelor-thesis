Nowadays television is a very important topic. Especially when it comes to small children watching TV. Along with the TV program there comes a huge amount of adverstising. Many people say that watching television in young age should be forbidden anyways. Some parents let their kids watch TV too early nevertheless and the kids are confronted with adult advertisement, especially late at night. Few may have the opinion that a regulated amount of TV a day does not harm their child while watching TV with their children. Like that, parents can control unwanted advertisig and channels and turn of or change the progam if the content is inapropriate. 
Todays advertising is full of things that might let kids get in touch with social media too early. Dating websites, computer game advertising can often be dagerous ang kids can get wrong ideas of social life. 

Talking about problems with advertising, i personally think that kids should not even watch television with five or six years old, except for child programs. 
Those do not show any inapropriate content that might scare or disturb kids of young age. I would not let my four year old child watch TV unattendedly. Just because i know how weird advertising can be sometimes.
