Advertising 

The advertising, especially on television, is always in the news. Is it good for us or should it not be there? Many studies at universities in the United States have searched an answer, but none of them ever had a well solution. With advertising many people make really much money. So they and also others, maybe us, can not live without it. But should television advertising directes toward young children (aged two tho five) not be allowed?

Firstly, the advertising should deffinitly be allowed. The children schould live in the same world like the other people -the adults. Why should you forbit the advertising there. Then other questions come like: With wich age should the advertising be allowed? Can you control that younger children do not see such thigns? Moreover the whole cities are full of posters and televisions, wich want to sell something. 

Secondly, this young people are just to young to get overflushed with so much advertising, that we see every day. Now they just sit more on the television, instead of being outside and play with peers. Furthermore they see so many toys and things they want to have. One one hand side it is great for all the shops. They have then much more income. but what about the parents? It is difficult to tell a child, that they do not get this toy or this game. 

Finally, is to say, that television advertising directed toward such young children should not be allowed. They are just too young to can get on with this whole material. It is best they can just watch their one or two favourite series a day without this breaks.
