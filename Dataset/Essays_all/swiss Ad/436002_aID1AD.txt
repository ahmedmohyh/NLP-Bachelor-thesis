My personal opinion on this subject is that it should not be forbidden, even though I don't think it's a good thing.Young children, especially from the ages two to five, are easily manipulated. Once they see something in an ad, they instantly want it. This can be extremly annoying for the parents of these children as often the minors don't need the advertised products but they feel like they do. Many parents aren't financially able to buy there kids everything they want and many also believe the don't need it either. 
My opinion though is that you can not forbid advertising for such a specific target group. If you want to ban advertising for younger children then you have to ban advertising completly. I think it would be alright if some broadcast companies decided they don't want to show ads for minors becasue of their companies morals. I do not agree however that they should not be allowed completly. The whole idea of advertising is to influence people and motivate the viewers to buy the advertisers products. If anything, advertiments for adults should be banned as theyactually have the financial power to buy what ever they want or what ever they think they want. And what else shoud be shown on television channnels dedicated to children; ads for shaving equipment, tampons and washing powder? No, children should be allowed to watch ads directed at them. 
bI also remember when I was younger that I liked to watch ads, even though I knew I could never have the desired product. Kids like to dream and imagine and part of that is fantasising about birthday and christmas presents and of toys they will never have. You could also argue that these young children learn that they can't have everything they want in life and it also forces the parents to be a bit stricter with their children and not give in and buy them everything, meaning it teaches both discipline.
