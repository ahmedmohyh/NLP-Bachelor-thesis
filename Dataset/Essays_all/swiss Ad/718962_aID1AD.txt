In my opinion, advertising towards young children is actually a very mean thing. Because children at this young age are not capable of knowing the consequences of their action if they'd eventually buy the thing which is made advertisement for. But still ... We're not there yet.
First, I think it is important to discuss whether or not the child even gets the message of the TV spot. Because I doubt that a toddler at the age of two really realizes what is happening on television. But, let's assume that the child gets that it is needy to buy the certain thing which gets constantly praised during the commercial breaks of its favorite TV series or show ... What would this fact lead to?
Well, the child will ask its parents to buy it. But that's where - if you ask me - the education of the child gets to count. Because if you tought it well and if you as a parent were consequent, then, in my humble opinion, the child will accept your "No". But here's the problem: Many parents (no offense) are stressed or even annoyed of their child(-ren) at times so they allow them way too many things just to keep them quiet for a little longer ... And that's WRONG! And that's what the people behind the advertising use for their advantage. And you have to admit that they are actually quite genius to do so.
So, I'd say, that advertising directed toward young children is bad and should be forbidden for the protection of the child. And honestly: The child would better go outside and play instead of being inside and watch TV.
