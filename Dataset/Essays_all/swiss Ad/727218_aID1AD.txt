Television advertising for young children should not be allowed because the young children don't really have the ability to understand and to think about the things that the ad communicates. The children just think:"oh I want to play with that" and are saying this to their parents. But often the ad is not something good and manipulates the child. It manipulates the will to play and the will for adventure. But at the end it can be a bad product and not worth the money. The parents then have to buy it or make the child sad and to ignore the wish. Just because the children cannot yet analyse and think through the advertisement. I think that an advertisement for the child but directed toward the parents is the best alternative way to advert a product for a young child. With such an advertisement the parents can analyse and see through the advertisement and can make a well decision if the product is good for the child or not. As an example we see something to play from Toys'R'Us and it is made to attract young children sitting in front of their television. Now the child just sees the fabulous design of the thing and wants it immediatly. But if Toys'R'Us would make an advertisment for the parents it would also show the good funtionality and the safety that the thing brings or not brings. And then the parents can analyse that and not just buy it because the advertisment tricked the child with its design.
