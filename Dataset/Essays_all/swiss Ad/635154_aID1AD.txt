I neither agree or disagree with this statement, because television isn't a good or a bad thing. You can learn so much with just a flat screen but there's also very much nonsense on it. But for those young children, who are just 5 years there is a high chance, that they just look some stupid shows or things about animals wich can talk. So they don't watch popular shows like "Galileo", where you can learn so much about the earth and how things are going. They more watch shows like "Spongbob" or somethinig like this. But if you look at the books for todays children, it's not a big difference to those television shows. Another thing you often say about the TV is, that your eyes will get very fast worse. If that statement is true than I think it's miserable if you let those litte children watch TV. 
But there are also many positive aspects like you learn how to use electric things, you fast know many things about live and you can better keep them in your mind than if you red them in books. I think you also need less time to learn the things because you hear and see them, so they stay more easily in your mind. And if the statement, that your eyes will get worse from watching TV, isn't true, than the negative side lost a big argument against the positive side. Or maybe this doesn't even matter, because earlier or later you surely will get a handy and a computer, wich is today necessary to live and work. 
So for me I don't think it's a that bad idea to let them watch the TV, because as I said you can learn so much about the life in a very short timelaps. And about the eyes it doesn't matter that much if you start watching at displays with five or ten years. So all in all I think it should be allowed to watch TV with the age of five years.
