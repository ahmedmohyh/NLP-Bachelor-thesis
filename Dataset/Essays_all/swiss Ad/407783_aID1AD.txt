If advertising in the TV is for children aged two to five it supports watching TV for children in this age. I think in this age you shouldn't watch very much TV an better go outside with friends or play games, read books. If a children watches TV and see an advertism they wanna see more of them an their parents begin to have troubles with allowing watching TV. In my opinion it's not fair for the parents because kids are always fascinated by the things who are showed in TV and they can be easier manipulated with good advertism.
The second problem could be that poor parents can't buy their children the toys which they see in the television and then the parents can begin to feel bad and the children thinks their parents don't like them because in this age they often don't understand what poorness is. 
An other problem could be that the children always want to have the newest toys and that they never will be happy with the toys which they have because it always exists a new toy. It's not possible for parents to buy their children always the newest toys because it's too expensive and it exists always a new one. 
In advertism are the toys often showed better than they are and be too expensive for the quality that they give.
I think the magazines of toysrus or franz carl weber are enough for the kids and can show them the newest stuff.
Advertism is not bad but it's bad for children aged two to five and not necessary. In the television they show too much advertism and often bad advertism.
So my opinion is that advertism shouldn't be allowed for children aged two to five or even for children aged two to ten.
