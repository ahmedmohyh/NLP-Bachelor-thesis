It is common knowledge that Televion advertising or adverts in general do have an influence on our subconcious for we then tend to make different desicions without us actively noticing. So should this be not allowed for children aged two to five?

Given the fact of what I've mentioned on top I think people who aren't concious about that fact shouldn't watch to much advertisement, therefore most of the children but I think you should raise the "restriction age" at least up to eight or ten for children below the age of five hardly watch any TV with adverts (if the parents are responsible). 
Another point is that "adverts influenced children" (if that's the case) almost never make any desicion on their own, I mean a 5 year old won't go to the supermarket to buy that cool toy he saw on tv, wich is something that the parents should prevent in my opinion.
I could imagine the opposite to be the case more often. People who really could do such things (with more serious stuff like expensive shit or their food) should be warned. So I'd rather suppose you prevent such people from being subconciously influenced, by maybe having a warning sign show up whenever adverts are shown that says somthing like: "Warning adverts can subconciously influence your later desicions" or something like that.

I'd find that more helpful, than banning "children stuff" adverts.
