There are many advertisments directed towards young children. Those usually include adverts for kids TV shows, pre-school necessities and toys. The question of, if it should be allowed or not, is debatable.

With advertisements directed at kids, it is usually meant to give them more incentive to ask their parents to buy it for them. People in marketing know, that parents usually can't say no, when their daughter or son is begging them for whatever it is they saw on the television. The only real loss of this, is the money that the guardians of the child spent. But there are other consequences of advertising for children. If kids see more of what they enjoy being displayed on TV, then they will be more likely to watch more of it. The concern here is, that young children should not be spending a lot of time in front of a screen, because their minds and bodies are still developing. If we take that into consideration, then there should definately be some regulation on advertisments for children.

On the other hand, people have the right to advertise their products on television, even if they are for young children. If the products were harmful to the children, it would be something different. But all that the toys and other products do, is give children more entertainment. Since young kids are known for being hyper active and very easily bored, this is very benificial to them.

In conclusion, I see no real reason why advertisments directed at children should be strictly forbidden. I could, however, see the logic behind regulating them to some extent, so that kids do not feel the need to sit in front of the TV all day.
