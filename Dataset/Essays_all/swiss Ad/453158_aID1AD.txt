Today, nearly every swiss-family has its television. It is common that children start to watch movies and series on television while they still go to kindergarden or even earlier. With this in mind, the idea of creating shows for children is obvious and not very far from the idea of television advertising directed toward them.

Young children probably do not really understand television advertising, but it is a matter of fact that they are pretty open for it. On one hand, the point that children are too young to understand what television is able to do should support the thesis that television advertising directed toward them should not be allowed. An other point is, that it may makes children sad to see what kind of intresting things other kids have but they do not.
However, there are also some reasons which speak against the statement. On one hand, the parents can decide by themselfes wheter or wheter not they want their kid to sit in front of television. They know that there will be some advertising and they know best how their kid reacts if it wants to have something.
On the other hand, kids often are not really interested in advertising, which makes them go away to play something else. And if they do not, they may even learn something new while watching television advertising.

All things considered, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, but the parents should keep it in mind.
No matter if or if not there is advertising, I support the statement that young children should not be allowed to watch television.
