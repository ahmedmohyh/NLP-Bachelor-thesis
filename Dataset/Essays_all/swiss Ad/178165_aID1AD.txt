For many people television advertising directed toward young children should be banned because it affects them to much and they do not understand that they are being manipulated.

Firstly, the advertising can affect and influence young children very heavily for example when there is an advertisement about a toy they most likely want to have it and they will not give up unless they get this toy, but when they watch this much television that they do not give up until they get this certain toy one should blame the parents and not the advertisements.

Secondly, the children do not understand that they are being manipulated in being or liking a certain toy or cloth et cetera but the parents have the responsibility to explain the use of advertisement to the child in an of course simple way so that they understand that the toy they saw in the television is not that great as they expected it to be. 

Furthermore advertisements directed toward children or just business strategies which are aimed a young children that their parents have to buy more products are not only used on television but also for example in supermarkets with the stickers which they can trade with each other and glue in their album, but the parents only get these stickers when they buy products for a certain amount of money which results in a big profit for the company.

In conclusion I do not agree with this statement because the responsibility lies by the parents and they should make sure that their child understands what advertisements are and that their child does not watch to much television and because there are much more ways where young children are used to make mor profit so you should either allow all or none.
