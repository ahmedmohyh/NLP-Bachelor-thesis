I must honestly say that I never saw an advertising directed toward children aged two to five and for me it also doesn't make sense to produce such advertisings, because children don't or shouldn't spend more time watching television than their parents. Moreover, children can't really react on the advertisings, because they don't have money to buy something by themselves so the goal of an advertising isn't reached anyway. But if it should be allowed or not is the other question. In my opinion it's a bit mean to show children things they would like to have or like to do, but they have not the chance to buy it by themselves. But I wouldn't forbid it beacause it's the parent's exercice to "control" their children while watching television. Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings. 
All in all I think this isn't a subject, that is important to discuss because like I said in the beginning, I've never seen advertisings directed toward young children.
