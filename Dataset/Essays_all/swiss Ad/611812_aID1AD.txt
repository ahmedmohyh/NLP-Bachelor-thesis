Whenever we watch any kind of show or tv program there are alway a lot of advertisments. Depending on what time and channel you watch they are directed toward another age group. There has always been criticism about adverts containing alcoholic beverages, but what about ads directed toward small children?

Advertisments directed to younger children often show toys or sometimes gadgets to encourage learning from a young age. But why put these adverts on TV? Children from age tweo to five often aren't the ones to watch tv, hence no advertisments, and if they are, they probably won't be the ones to buy any toys or evenan educational device. Parents who let their very young child watch TV so often they get to see such adverts wouldn't buy anything like that for them, because on one hand the children aren't intrested in anything else than watching television or play a game on a tablet and on the other hand these parents are happy if their child is occupied with an activity that is relativly silent. 

Toy advertisments should be directed toward the parents and not the children, since they aren't the ones to buy them so it would make more sense this way around. 

But if there are advertisments like this, they should be a real representation of what they actually look like,because children at such a young age can't distinguish between real and fake. So it would only lead to disappointment if their toy isn'table to do the things they've seen it do on television.

I think the reason behind companies doing television advertising for kid's toys use how gullible children can be. They want the children to  persuade their parents into buying something they've seen on TV. 

So myfinal statement is that television advertising directed toward young children should either be banned or havea stricter law on presentation.
