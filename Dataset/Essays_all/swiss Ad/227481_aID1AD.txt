Television advertisement has always been very important for different companies, but nowadays there are a lot more people watching television, including young children. A good advertisement can have a big influence on people and an impact on companies.

On one hand I think it is okay to direct television advertisements toward young children, because every company does its best to earn as much money through products or offers as possible. If parents don't want their children to be influenced by television advertising, it is their job to educate them and to maybe not let them watch television as often. To be honest, i don't think that television advertisements can have an impact or influence on a child at that age, because they probably don't understand everything the advertisements talk about. Young children aren't able to buy something on their own, so it's not a big problem if they see products on television that they want to buy. 

On the other hand not only products are shown on television. Children should not be confronted with advertisements at a young age because I suppose it can have an impact on their thinking. Advertisements also influence a teenager's mind by always showing skinny people or the newest trends on television. If young children already get to see these things on television and hear about different problems, they grow up with it and they immediately think the same way if their parents don't educate them differently.

To sum it up, I don't agree with the statement because I feel like it's the parent's job to educate their children and to show them the things that are important in life. Parents can let their children think that the advertisements  don't always tell the whole truth and that they only let us see the things they want us to see.
