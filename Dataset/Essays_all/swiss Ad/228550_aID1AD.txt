Young children aged under six are very manipulatable. If you tell them the story of the easter bunny they probably will beleive you. If they see a advertise  they would beleive everything what is sait and shown in that spot. Companies which produces toy do want to catch the childrens atention in theyr advertising. 

Why shouldn't it bee allowed to show children some advertising. As it was said, toy-companies also want to get attention on theyr products. Obviously everyone who is a teenager or older whouldn'g give any antention on such spots, so they had to show them to small children.
Thats just the since of advertising, When a little child sees such a advertise and they like the sertain product, they want to have it. They will tell their parents how cool the product is and the parents doesn't have to search long for a christmas-present. So why not?

There ar some peoples that want to buy and own nearly everything. That begins almost in the childhood. When the parents of a child buy them everything they want, i's going to bee normal for that child to get everything what it wants. That all begins with advertising. When a child sees something it wants. it will stress the elders as long as it will get what it wants. If the parents are annoyed enough, they will buy it the toy. And if that goes on long enough the child once will be such a collector.
That all wouldn't happen if there were no advertising for children, or if the parents were strictenough and doesn't buy theyr children everything, or if the childrens woudn't whatch tv the whole day.
