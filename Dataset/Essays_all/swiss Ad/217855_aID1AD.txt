Television advertising has got a lot of influence on our society. It gives us needs or wishes we should have. And since more than three quarter of the population owns a television, we cannot deny the big range of influence one single advertising can have on us. 

Especially young children can be easily manipulated, that's why in my opinion, telvision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

To start with, television advertising gives the children very straight ideals about how they have to be. Advertising dictates gender roles. It shows exactly what a girl needs and what she doesn't (and of course the other way around for boys).
And children under the age of five are more manipulative than anything! At the age, they are looking for idols, people to follow. And they should find those idols in real live, not in faked television scenes.

Secondly, to make advertising for young children is a very "mean" thing to do. Since it's not the children themselves who will spend the money on the product, but their parents (or some other adult). Advertising makes children wish for things they did'nt even know they existed. It creates needs that aren't there. It's just a trick to sell things more easily, beacause children can quite annoying and persistent if tehy want something. And in the end parents give in.

To finish, I'd say that television has a bigger influence on our lives, gender roles and needs than it should have. And by not allowing television advertising directed toward young children, we could minimalize this influence quite a little bit. 

But in the end it is still about us, or more, the parents of the children to regulate what they want them to see or don't, since they are the one who give them the permission to even watch television.
