The question is if television advretising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not. There are reasons for both sides.

Firstly, kids shouldn't watch TV when their aged two to five. So there's no problem with advertising, because they won't see it anyway. But here's a possibility that they have very bad parents. And when the parents don't care about their children, or spend the whole day at work, the kids watch the whole day TV and then they want everything they see, because their easy to manipulate.

Secondly, for the parents it could be helpfull, but only for the bad ones, we shouldn't support. For example when they have no idea, what their children like for christmas or birthday, they could get inspirated by the TV spots. But the kids could also get a bad influence, when they just want what they see on TV and they don't have an own opinion.

Finally it shouldn't get a habit to watch TV and then buy the things presented in the adverts, especially not when your a young child aged two to five. Because then we buy a lot of thrash we don't really need.

In conclusion, there are a lot of arguments wich say that TV isn't good for young people and we have to protect them from what they think they want. 

Personally, I think television advertisint directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
