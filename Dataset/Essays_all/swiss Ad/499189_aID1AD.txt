I agree with this statement. These days all children at the age of two to five watch television which is actualy very bad. A child in this age should be playing outside with other people. They should have interactions with children in their age to develop their selfs. In this way they learn how to treat and respect others. They learn how to behave and also very important, they learn what they should do and what they shouldn't do. This is also very important for their future. Playing with others or just do something at home by your self is also good for your wealth. You are active and develop your brain with diffrent kind of actions. Watching television couldn't be seen as good for your wealth. While watching television you are very passiv. You do nothing but sitting the whole time which is very bad spacially for children in the age from two to five. You watch television on your own and don't interact with others. Children who start watching television in this age prefer to keep watching then play outside with other children. Watching television makes them happy as playing outside does too, but interactions with children doesn't meen always happines. False actions can lead to anger, so they prefer to watch television.
