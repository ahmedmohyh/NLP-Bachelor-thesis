These days we can see eâdvertisings everywhere. Mostly on television. But young children can also see these advertising. Does this really make sense, or shouldn't it be allowed?
The first point is, that most of the young children in this age, cant think rationally like an adult. They think, that everything what they see in the advertising is real. But a lot of the advertising are fake. So its really easy to manipulate the children with the advertising.
The second point is, that its boring for the parents, because they have to buy most of the things, which their children have seen in the advetising. And mostly of this things arent really cheap.
But on the other side, its good for the economy, because of the fact, that children are easier to manipulate than adults. So these sellers make a lot of profit with their toys.
An other argument is, that the parents know exactly what their childrens want. For example as christmas present. They dont have to ask, what the childrens want. And the parents can see in the advertising what it is exactly.
My opinion is, that television advertising directed to children isn't good. Because the young children cant make a difference between fake things and real things. They think everything what they see is real. So they are a kind of "victims" from the advertising and are really easy to manipulate. And its bad for the parents too, because they buy most of the toys for their children, because they don't want that the children are mad. So these advertisings don' make sense for me and I think that they shouldn't be allowed.
