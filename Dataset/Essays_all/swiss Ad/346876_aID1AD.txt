These days these is a lot of televison advertisements. Some of them interesting, some funny, some just straight out lame and some of those advertisements are directed towards young children. Should these advertisements be allowed? Many young kids mights find that advertising is boring and they dont really pay attention. But then when thy see toy advertisements or something similar in that way they completely fall in love with this toy or whatsoever and they want to have it so bad. Witch results in them asking their parents for the toy and if the parents tell them no, many kids snap and make the lives of their parents a living hell by criing or screaming around and constantly asking them again and again. No loving parent wants to see their child sad, or they just can't stand the screaming anymore so they end up buying this toy from the advertisements. And this results in children getting spoiled and a spoiled child can be a bit of a problem. This is why many parents don't allow their younger kids to watch television at all because of these advertisements. Buts this might not be a problem at all when parents are strict and are consequent in their decisions. If these parents can stnd tough and don't budge under the weight of their childrens constant pleases they should not be worried about such advertisements because if your child know it cannot get what it wants through screaming and crying it will stop on its self and give up. All you need as a parent is a bit of a cold heart and some discipline. They need to learn to say no to their sweet little children. I think that television advertisements directed towards young children should not be banned because it's not the advrtising that is doing anything wrong, it's the parents. And parents saying that such advertisements are bad and should be banned are those kind of people who don't have a lot of control over their children. So I think that banning TV commercials for young children won't solve anything.
