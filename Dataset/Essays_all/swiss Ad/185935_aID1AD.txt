Televison advertising directed toward young children schould not be allowed, is the thema of this essay.

So why shouldn't it be allowed, whats wrong about that? Agreeing or Disagreeing? The problem is that kids are really easy believing and also easy to 'beinflussen'. Next negativ part is about generaly watching TV in young age, the kids are sitting in front of the desktop and don't have to have own ideas or don't even have to play somthing. The TV has something really magnificant, even for older persons. Altough there are negativ parts, there are as well many good parts, if there is Televison advertising directed toward kid.  Shows which learn you words or things about animals can be a great oppertunity for the kids to learn by themself even they haven't been yet to elementary school. When kids see things on the TV and choose that they want for exampel the toy what's wrong about? Also you can't have to be in fear that your kid will hurt him because he/she is savely on the sofa. 

In my oppinion it should not be allowed because i think that these kids shows aren't what the kids will help in further live. They should have own ideas and should chose by themselfs what they like and what not. I agree on the statement. There are so many overweight kids as never before. Also a negativ 'Auskirkung' from watchin TV.
