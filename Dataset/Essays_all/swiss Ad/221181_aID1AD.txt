The question, if television advertising directed toward young childer should not be allowed, is a often discussed thing. Advertising for young kids becomes more and more popular, because the quantity of kids watching TV was never so big. My first point is that kids are more interested in other things than gaming and cellphones, when they watch advertising for kids. They want to buy smartphones instead of toys, if they watch advertising for adults. I think kids are there to explore the world and test everyhing out by themselves. Advertising for kids can also be a good thing, if they sell books or intelligence games. 

On the other hand, kids were also seen as money and profit. The advertising lobby may take advantage of the kids and earn more money. When kids want something they have seen on TV, they ask their parents for money and, as we all know, kids are not silent until they have what they want. This could be problem, if some kids get everything they want from their parents out of the TV advertising and then loose their feeling for money. This could cause a buying addiction in young years already. 

In conclusion I think that the advantages overweight the disadvantages and that we can not give up advertising for young kids.
