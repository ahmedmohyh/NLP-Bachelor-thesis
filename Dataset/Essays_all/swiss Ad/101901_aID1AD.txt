This statement is a very important question for the whole world. It contains the whole earth and everybody is guilty for that. At first I would say that television should not be allowed to young children, because they are to young and they should not sit next to the television. The television could damage there eyes and that's not healthy too. They should go out and playing, they have a lot of time in the following years to watch television or to work with the computers. They should enjoy there childhood without the electric things. But otherwise they can learn a lot in the television. They can learn some new things with fun. Especially with cartoons you can learn lot of new things. There's no child who didn't likes to watch cartoons. On the television you can learn something about the live, and you can be prepared for school. Surely they are contra arguments. The children can learn with other things, for example with puzzle or card games. There are lot of other possibilites to learn something new. At the age of two to five you start to explore the world. You want to learn new things and you especially like the colours of the television.

My opinion is that the children should watch television, because when you are at the age of two to five you start to explore the world and the television is a really good possibility for do that. You can learn a lot in the television, for example with cartoons. Every child likes cartoons as apes bananas. Surely it isn't so healthy to be next to the television all the time, but when you watch it regullary at many periods of time, than it can be really good for you. I am definitely not agree to that .
