Today nearly all houses in switzerland have a working televison access. Televisons are very useful. They can show us interesting documenteries, the news or other interesting things. But there is one thing that many watchers do not like. 

Right, it is the advertising between the programms. This short spots are composed for the right group off people and tries to manipulate them. The whole day we can see such things, which want to manipulate us. When we see one of this spam pictures we can decide, do we really need this things or shoul we ignore them. That is sometimes may a bit birecte but sometimes we can finde very god things and we will buy them and use them for years.

It is an other situation if children can see this kind of advertising. The short video clips in the televison are special made that they manipulate the mind of the childrens, and they want to have this toys. After the program the children search the parents and ask them to buy this stuff. Imagine your own young child have those wishes, would you ignore them? Exactly that is the reason why the advertising for children is a such bad buisness. The people who works in the television get richer and the parents get poor. 

To make a point under this subject, I think advertising is not only bad thing it can help you, to find new products. But I think advertising is not on the right place if you try to manipulate young children, because they are very easy to manipulate and the consequence is, that the parents have to spent their money in usless toys. I think we should ban the advertising out of the children chanels in the television.
