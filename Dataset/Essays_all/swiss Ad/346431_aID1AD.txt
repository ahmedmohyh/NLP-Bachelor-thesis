In our every day lives, we are confronted with advertisements probably more than we are aware of. 
Unconsciously we lean towards brands we have somewhere seen in an ad appearing, when we have to take a decision. But what we do always have, is the decision to buy whatever we want. The ads only try to influence our will in some way, no matter if its a child, teenager or adult. 

Some parents think their child can be protected from the big, dangerous world until they one day turn into adults and can make their own senseful decisions. This protection may be possible for a little while, until it reaches the point, where the child eventually will want to step out out this protected world out of pure curiosity. The parents no longer have the control to decide what the cild will see and not see. The ads we have around us, will maybe influence us somehow but we still have to learn how to control our minds on our own. And even if we do not learn this from an early age, life will not necessarily become easier. A child who really wants something, will not want it more just because they liked the ad so much.
Somehow it does sound unfair to do ads for an age group, who is not even able to earn their own money. To make them convince someone else, in this case the parents, to buy things for them because they sound so exciting.Children are very vulnerable and may even think their life is not complete without this one thing which leads to them being upset at their parents. Doesnt sound pleasent for anyone except for the shop, who maybe benefits from it later. 

Shortly summarized, we arent able to protect children from the society and its norms even though it would be an ideal thing to do. It is the attitude of the child that has to be worked on, not the restriction of advertisements. Keeping them away from the world, will not make it easier for them in the long run.
