We are living in a world where we are constantly under the influences of the media. Especially advertising belongs to our everyday live and there is hardly anyone who does not get affected by it. Because of that there is a lot of critism going on. Where do we have to draw a line? Shoud it be aloud to direct adertisement toward all people? in this essay i will display the advantages and disadvantages of television advertising directed toward young children

A salesmen would say of course. It doesn`t do any harm and on top of that there are many perks to it. Young children should see what the world holds and they should be able to grasp the wealth and luxury that adults do. Also they are easily influenced to buy something and can talk their parents into purchasing things. 

On the other hand we have concerned parents and caring grandparents who say that their children and grandchildren shouldn`t be constantly on the line for such things. children should be protected from those influenes that pressure them into buying things that they don`t necessarly want or need. 

I think that television advertising directed towards children shouldn`t be allowed because as a child you can`t really differenciate between you wishes, desires and necessities and therefore it is unfair to pressure them or their parents into buying things. On the other hand I think that it is over all the parent`s responsibility to protect their children by limting their vulnerability and setting rules to the usage of television as well as other medias. But those parents could be easily helped by setting a law.
