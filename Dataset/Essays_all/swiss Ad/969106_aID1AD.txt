I agree with this statement 

The reason is that young children are very "easy to catch." That means if they see something in the television they want to have it, because they can't make the difference between something they need or they don't need. They don't have to work for money the parents have the money and normaly they get everything they need and want. The children are the weak point of the parents and they want to see their children smiling or laughing and not crying.
Big companys with products that are for the consume are so brazenly that they make advertising where you see some nice teddybears or some cute animals and stuff like that. The problem is at this point, small children make a links between objects and feelings. For example if they see a teddybear they want the hug him or if they see a ball they feel happy and want to play with it. If you look at a old Mc Donalds advertise there was Ronald Mc Donald the friendly clown who played with some people and children who were in a Mc Donalds restaurant  and if a small child sees that he or she want to go to a Mc Donalds too because they think they can have fun there. In videogames advertisings for small children not Call of Duty something like a racing game you see small children who sit at the TV and play the game they laugh and have fun together and if someon sees that who is not very old thinks that is the only way to have fun and he or she want to buy it.
At the end I think that it will be hard to make a law that says it is forbidden to make comercials that are for joung children because who has the right to say this advertise is for young children and this for children over five years?
