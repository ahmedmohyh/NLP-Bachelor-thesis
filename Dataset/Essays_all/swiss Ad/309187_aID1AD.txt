Television adverts directed to young children are no problem. The children can see what is new on the market and maybe they find their new birthday present by watching the adverts. If there is an advert for a my little pony in television that does not mean every little girl does want to own it. If they see the pony in tv or in walmarts is no difference, so they will find out anyway.

Another good point about children advertising is that you can make a good influence on the boys and girls. You could bring a television spot about WWF and that they could join the 'panda club' to help the nature and animals. 

Last but not least parents can be thankful for the adverts because they make a break between their childs favourite show. If the series on nickelodeon would play non-stop, parents would not be able to take their child away from the television. 

But while some people think adverstising for children is harmless, you can argue with some points that show the contrary.
When children spot their favourite toy in television they immediately want to have it. You can not argue with them and by watching television they really get confronted with new toys. While you are able to avoid these parts in supermarkets.

Additionaly, adverts can make a big influence and there are not many 'good adverts' around. While your five year old son would like to have a lego star wars battleship, your two year old daughter is not that happy about seeing little lego figures shooting at each others heads. 

To sum up advertising directed to young children should  not be allowed. A child aged two to five is defenitely too young for adverts and could be influenced badly. I understand that most of the television channels do not function without adverts, so if there is no possibility to prohibit advertising on kids channels, you should not let your child watch television in this young age.
