In our days the products which are sold in the daily market are also seen in the television.Not only television publicity but also the daily mail or poster who are seen in the city are ways to support selling diffrent products.Television advertising  is in general the easiest way to sell a product.But it takes a lot to make the perfect publicity.You have to think about a slogan which is easy to remember so people have this slogan on their mind if they think of that specific produtc.So the positive sides of television adversiting ,no matter which age class, are that the procuts are seen more often and with a good slogan the prand and the name of the fabric get memorised faster and more easily.
On the other hand, why should a brand make television advertising for children who are not even ceapale to buy this product? Their parents are the ones who buy the procut in the end. Something that also needs to be said is that not everybody watches television. So if the procuts for children are only seen in television advertising,not only some parent aren't going to buy these procuts but some others don't even know that these products exist!
 So in conclosion I personally think that it doesn't matter for which age class a publicity in television is made, it is a strong way to sell a product. In fact it is easier not only for parents but for everybody to watch television so you get a little bit an idea what is popular on themarket in the moment.The only thing you have to do is lay down and watch tv and if you find something intrestic you know exactely where to go and buy the product you want.It is an easy way to avoid the long shopping hours in the city. Thank's to television advertising life get's a little more comfortable.
