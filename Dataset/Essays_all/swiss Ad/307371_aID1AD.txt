Advertising is one sort of earning money nowadays. After every TV programmes will be time for a five minute break and this break will be filled with advertising. Adertising are made to cover the watchers eyes and to buy a product. But since the Television streams cartoons for childern, the advertisement agencis use the attenion of the childern to sell even more products. The unknown child will fall in to this trap and annoys the parents to getthe toyor whatever. This strategy of the agencis are very quetionable and leads to dicussions nowadays. Here are some argument which will show you why the advertising should not be allowed.

Firstly the children do not know anything about money or the even the world and how it is working. It will see the advertisement and will not stop crying until it gets the toy. At first it will probably forgetit but a advertisement will come a serveral time during a day on TV. So the children sees the toy and can not stop thinking about it. And this can happen with plenty of other advertisements.The parents have no choice and they will buy the product for the baby so it can stop asking and can be happy.
Another point is that children are in their growth process. If it gets confronted with advertising daily after every TV programe thechildrenwants then everything and if the parents are not strict it will do that in its teenager years too and then probably for thewhole live. Children have to be educated thatif they want somethingtheyhave to dothings before they can even imagine of getting something.
The last point is that advertising for children is unnecessary and it is just a psychological way to earn money which is really childish. A child watches TV to learn the language or to understand the situation in the TV programs,not to get attracted bya toy.

In myopinion advertisingon childrens TV channel should be prohibited. Some programes have already shut down the advertising on childrens programme.
