The television advertising directed toward young children is a critical point. Young children can be influenced easily. If you show them an advertising of a toy with many special effects and stuff that children usually like, the children will run to their parents and tell them to buy the toy. But in my opinion this argument is the only one which is negativ.

The advertises for young children aren't anything bad. And I think it doesn't have a bad influence to them. Well, it is an advantage for the industry of toys and children stuff, but it is nothing bad for the parents or the children. Because if a child goes to his parents and wants them to buy something, it is in their own responsibility to decide yes or no. Another argument that speaks for the advertising for young children is, that children in this age have to learn not to buy everything they see in the television. I don't see any other reasons why advertising for young children should not be allowed.

I remeber when I was young and I saw those advertisings. I always ran to my parents and asked them to buy those things for me. But they often say no but told me to put it on the llist for my christmaswishes. So there was hope that I maybe would receive what I saw in the television.

So with the all those arguments I totally disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
