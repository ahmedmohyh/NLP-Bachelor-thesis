Many children watch television but in the advertising for playthings the children also won't that. Should be television advertising not be allowed directed toward young children (aged tow to five)? This question I'm disgusting in this essay.

If young children watch television, they don't has to watch the advertising, so it is okeay that they diricted advertising toward the children. The parents can take their child away from the television when it has advertisment, if the don't wont that their child watch the advertising. 

It's not good for children and their parents that the television adertvising are directed toward the children, because I think it is exhauseded for the parents when the child something from the adertising will and it didn't get.

If the children wacht the advertising they learn something. If the children watch the advertising and they didn't get the things from it, they learn that they don't can have everything. So it can not be bad for they.

The television advertising can transform false inpressions from life. Because in the television advertising the reality is manipulated, so the young children think that the advertinsing are the reality, but it isn't. For exaple in the advertising someone can fly, so the young children think that humans can fly, but it's wrong.

I think, it isn't alright that they directed the television advertising toward the children. But I also think that two to five years old children doesn't have to watch television. So they also don't have to watch the television advertising.
