It's quite hard to define the directed spectator group of an advertisement. Not all people are educated like the others and not all people are in the same mental stage when they are at the same age as others. Some children aged two to five can already decide about some easy questions and situations, others can't. When young children aged two to five are watching television, there's only advertisement ment for young children and nothing that isn't meant for them. 
        Young children are quite good in getting what they want, so they can easily get the things they have seen in television. Advertisements directed toward young children work well, if they are built attractive for them. It also wouldn't be fair, if only things for older people were allowed to advertise in television. Every toy store wants to sell his toys as well as every wine store wants to sell his wine. If just the wine store would be allowed to advertise in television, the toy store wouldn't make enough money. Toy stores can't exist that well without advertising, because most parents don't buy toys for their children, without having seen these toys before. When young children are watching television advertisements, they can tell their parents exactly what they want. For sure, young children are more likely to want everything they see but as long as you have to pay for it, the parents can decide whether they want to buy the product or not. You shouldn't be able to buy the products for young children by a phone call, because maybe the young children already know how to use a phone and how to make a phone call. But as far as I know, products directed to young children can't be bought by a phone call.
        I can't see any problems in television advertising directet toward young children aged two to five, as long as it isn't something dangerous and as long as the young children can't get it without convincing their parents of buying it.
