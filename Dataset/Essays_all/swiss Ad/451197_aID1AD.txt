Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be banned?

Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) has caused a lot of controversy among concerned parents, advertising agentures and child protection agencies. Many people believe that this kind of advertisement should not be allowed. I disagree with this for several reasons.

First of all, those who are in favour of a ban argue that by sending advertisement to young children, the children are used as advertisement subjects despite their young age, which should not be. 

Against this can be said that any human being who is being sent television advertisement is an advertisement subject, and that simply deciding an age at which television advertisement can be sent is not reasonable.

Secondly, supporters of a ban claim that young children do not yet have the experience to find out which advertised objects are useful and which not. As a result, they simply want to buy all the advertised objects, no matter if they can use them or not.

This claim is true, however, the children cannot buy whatever they want as the children have to ask their parents for the money. This assures that they cannot buy on their wishes only, and that the parents decide what to buy or not.

To sum up, it can be said that television advertisement directed toward young children should not be banned as deciding an age at which television advertisement may be sent is problematic and as children cannot buy whatever they want.
