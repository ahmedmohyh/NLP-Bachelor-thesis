Television advertising, one of the most annoying things in the world. Whenever you are watching a movie, you can be sure, that in the middle of the most nerveracking scene there will be a commercial break. But what happens, when companiess direct their advertising towards a new, younger age group? 

Honestly, I do not think, that advertisement directed towards young children should not be allowed. I disagree with the statement above. First of all, I do not see the problem that should be caused by advertising. Secondly  I think it does not matter whether young children see a commercial for a new toy or not, because their parents are the ones who can decide whether their child will get it, because they have the money to buy it. And thirdly, I do not understand what could possibly be so bad about these commercials, because if they are directed towards young children, they certainly have to be suited for young children.

Of course, I am not a parent so I do not understand their point of view, but I think that it does not matter if companies direct their advertising towards a younger audience and I certainly beleive, that this is not a controversial topic.
