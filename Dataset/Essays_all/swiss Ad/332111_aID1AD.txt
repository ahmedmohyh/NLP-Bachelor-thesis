Television advertisisng are always worth a discussion. Much more if it's about young children. But in my opinion parents should decide wether they like to try out the advertising product.be a

Firstly,what is the perfect age to start to advertise and moreover which is the perfect age to start watching television.We all should be able to take resnsibility toward ourkids and it's enviroment.Moreand more trynot to face responsibility the htey get.

Furthermore does it not matter or would change aaything because however they would decide,there're always other dangers or possibilities of still seeing advertisment towards young preople. Genually it's worth a shot because if  you others into it, which could have a bad influence on the kids you don't have ad's for little kidsj

On the other hand could it be a good idea, just to prevent their young eyes won't be manipulated.
In the end our world is gettinh worse and worse everyday we live by.
