Watching TV makes people stupid. This common saying may contain some truth. Especially television advertising bring people up to buy strange products as media shop shows us every day.Children in the age of two to five may not understand statements from television, yet there are some dangers which might explained why television advertising should not be allowed . However a child could also be the door to sell different material things.

On the one hand side television advertising is good to intrduce new products to a person and for kids aged two to five it is optimal to buy toys that are used by the kids.It might prevents to buy things they are not interested in. With Television advertising they can easily decide what they can use or not. On the other hand side children cannot decide what they need. In my opinion children want everything they could have and a few parents buy them, because of their love, all things they want. Therefore it is the door to sell toys, because the parents want the best for her kids.

Another point against telivison advertising is, that a child have to learn to read and with waching TV they only sit on the couch and see some pictures. According to a current survey television makes really stupid. This act is not good for the education and their health too. In contrast to this point of view we have to realize that it included also a sense of music to understand a few television advertises and they have mor imagination and creativity.

In conclusion the television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, due to the argument that the children do not need many toys or other material things to be happy. There are a lot of other possibilities not to sit in front of the TV and to create the free time.
