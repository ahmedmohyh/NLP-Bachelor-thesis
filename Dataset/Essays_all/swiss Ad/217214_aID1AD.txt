In order to be able to answer this question we have to differentiate two different kinds of advertising for young children.There are ads that are advertising products for young children but the target group are the parents.For example pampers are for young children but the targent group of papers are the parents and not the children.And on the other hand there are ads whose targent group are the children for example hot wheels cars.

A aspect that says that ads for children are totally ok is that even if there is an ad whose target group is the young children its still the parents buying the product in the end because children from two to five years old normally don`t have money.
An aspect that says ads for childeren shouldn`t be allowed is that the ads give pressure to the parents because their child is talking about this cool new hotwheels car the whole day until the parents buy it.So this leads to parents being under pressure to buy certain products for their children in order to satify the needs of their child.
Another aspect that says ads are ok is that children are confronted with ads all the time on the way to school on the way to the soccer training in the internet and so on. So in the end it won`t make any difference because children are confronted with ads anyways.
One point that says ads for children aren`t ok is that ads have a huge influence on peolpe especially in the early stages of life. That means that if the ad is about sextoys for children in kindergarden this is for sure not a good influence for the children.

In my opinion ads for childfren are totally ok because children are confronted with ads anyway in everyday life so they are used to it and because of that its not a problem at all.
