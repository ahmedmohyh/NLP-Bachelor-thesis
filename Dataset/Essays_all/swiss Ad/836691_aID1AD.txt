It really depends, for example, what does the advertisement wants to show?
It's obvious that if they show inappropriate content for children, it's no good. But the statement is "directed toward young children", so clearly, they are going to show them appropriate content. Whether it is a movie trailer for children, or a product advertisement for children. It doesn't matter, as long as it's safe for the children to watch the advertisement and not giving them some weird advertisement, which then gives the children the urge of trying it out, it's all good. In the end, the parents get to decide whether the children get to watch some television or not. I mean, some parents don't even care what their children watch, so how are you supposed to forbid something which you can't even control. Yes, you could add a password to the television, but in the end, that's going to end up being a pain the neck. Usually children under the age of 4 cannot comprehend what they're watching, they can only stare at the screen and watch the pretty pictures. I'm not saying that children are stupid, no, but if an advertisement has text in it, they will not be able to read it. And what does advertisement want to succeed? Usually the products they sell aren't even allowed for children under the age of 4. Then again if it's a movie it would make sense. But you don't take a child to the cinemas under the age of 4. As I said before, they don't understand what's going on. You can show them a video of a dog running around for hours, and they would not get tired of it.
Now that I listed all my "points", I came to a conclusion. I disagree with this statement. There's no point in forbidding something they can't control. So why would you forbid this? 
This idea of forbidding the advertisement toward young children is pure garbage, in my opinion.
