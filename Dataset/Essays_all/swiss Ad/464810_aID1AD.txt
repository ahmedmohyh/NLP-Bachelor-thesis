Now a days so many children are watching TV even when they're still very young. It is the reason, why more and more commercials are directed towards children as well. But are theyt acually only directed to children and should they be forbidden?

Acually, it is true that there are many advertisments witch are made for reaching children. But most of them reaching the parents as well, what i think is the main reason they do it. An advertisement does only work, because the customer gets to know the product and later when he is at the store, he will probably choose the product he has seen before in the commercial. If you directing advertisments to children and at the same time to the parents you will reach a higher percentage of one of them remembers it at the store and wants to buy the product.

On the other hand are children not yet smart enough to get what an advertisement actually is. They just believe what they see and they can't overthink what the reason of the commercial could be. As you can see, it is a lot easier to manipulate children than adults. 
If you look at it this way, advertisement directed toward young children is manipulation and a wrong use of its power. 

In my opinion it's not nice to manipulate children, but at the same time children shouldn't be watching TV at such very young ages. I don't think these advertisments should be forbidden, because it's just an advertisment as every other one. Furthermore i'd say, the problem aren't the advertisments but the parents. If the parents would stop letting their children watch TV, the commercial toward children would stop as well. Because why should they reach children if there aren't even any watching TV...? 
In conclusion I don't think these commercial should be forbidden. At least it is your own desicion what your watching and it's your own responsability what your child watches.
