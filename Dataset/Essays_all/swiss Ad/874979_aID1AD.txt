Television advertising toward young children has advantages and disadvantages.
One advantage is that they learn how to deal with advertising in a young age. They get used to it, so it won't be a surprise when they grow older. Another point is that they get ideas for birthday or christmas present wishes. They don't have to walk through a shopping center with their parents (and the parents don't have to spend a whole day on it!) to find a present. They see it on television and can tell it to their parents.
But there are also disadvantages. Because they are so young, they don't have the money to buy the stuff they would like to have because of the television advertising. That could be the reason why they are sad and maybe even mad and angry at their parents. They start crying, because they don't get they toy which they have seen on TV. That's not good for the parents too. They don't want to say always no tho their children, so they get forced to buy at least a few of the stuff the kids would like to have, even if they think it's not really good for them. 
Moreover, there's the risk of wrong advertising, that could have a bad influence for the children. If the advertising spot isn't made for young children it could be dangerous. 
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, no matter what kind of product the advertising spot wants to sell.
