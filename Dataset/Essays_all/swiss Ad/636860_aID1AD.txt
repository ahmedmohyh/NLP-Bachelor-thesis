On the one hand side, is television advertising generally legal. every Television channel has the rigth to send adverising. Also is it unpossible to hide the advertising from young children. I mean how should that work? A televions channel has do send advertise, otherhand they can't survive, so it's they're own incoming money. Otherwise how will they decide if children or adults sitting in front of the tv. they just can make advertise or not. 
But on the other hand, i think is makes not really sens to show advertise to kds. if they see a product in the television they don't go in a store and buy this stuff. If they want something, it's in the most cases the parents which decides if a child get it or not. The most of the advertise is build with an hidden sense. so a child can't really understand what it really mean or they understand it wrongly. so the chance that a child get a bad influence is much biggger than the chance that the kid goes to a store and buy the stuff the see in tv. 
so all in all i think it should not be allowed to send advertise for kids. it mekes no sens and is in the most cases just a bad influence. so if it would be possible to separate kids from parents in frot of the tv they sould not send advertise for kids.
