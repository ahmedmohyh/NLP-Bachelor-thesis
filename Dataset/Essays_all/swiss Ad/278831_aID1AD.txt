Should one prohibit advertising toward children?
This is a question that must come from different groups in society. There are the parents and also the advertising companies. The parents are most probably against is. Firstly, advertising uses manipulative methods to gain the attention of their aim group. The message "buy this product immediately" is commonly used, even though the advertisers do not directly indicate this in their commercials or advertisements. However, advertising is also a billion dollar industry, and can make the advertisers extremely rich. The more people see it, the more people are going to buy the product. Children's attention is easy to get, so it's even easier to make them or their parents buy products and so it's easier to make money with them. 
Advertisements also have bad aspects, especially for children. They feel the urgent need to buy the product, and if they see someone else buy it, they get under pressure because they want to be like them. My opinion on this is that one should not start advertising towards young children. Sitting in front of a tv in your childhood is one thing, but then being encouraged to be materialistic and greedy by ads is even worse. Kids should not want to buy things that they actually don't need. Wanting to have a toy, for example, is different from wanting to buy a toy that someone said is all fun and games. I think that kids should express their real needs, and not those a company made them think they have.
