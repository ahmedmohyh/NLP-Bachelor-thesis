Nowadays multiedia like radio, television or computer has become dayly stuff. There is everywhere advertising. It is possible in every kind of way to make publicity. Some Advertisments are even for young childern aged two to five. They watch tv and become influenced by the ads. Should television advertising directed toward young childern not be allowed?

Firtly,young childern aged two to five don't understand what advertising really is. they see the ads about maybe diffrent toys for children, they find them cool and want them but finally they don't understand what this toys really are and why they're seeing them. It is always the parents' desition whether they by something for their children or not ans not the childrens' desition. So advertising hasen't a great influence on little kids.

Secondly, young children shouldn't watch television at that age! They should play with other kids and learn things and not stay hours infrint of a screen. So it isn't the companies' fault if a child wants a toy or if the child crys because it dosen't get it. Parents should't let them watch tv if they don't want that teir kids demand toys.

Summing up, advertising is something you can avoid if you really want to. It is a parents' job to make sure that their children do not become influnced by television advertising. And also if they get influenced, the parents can always say no and decide ifthey want their children to get inclueced. Personally, television advertising directet toward children should keep being allowed.
