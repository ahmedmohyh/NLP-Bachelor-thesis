Young children between two and five years often watch television because they like the little cartoon series or are fascinated by the moving pictures, the bright colours and the funny music. When an advertisement pops up, they often don't even understand what it means and what it wants to sell.
When I was a child, I was always really bored when a TV show was interrupted by an advertisement. I often just walked away from the television to play with my toys as long as the break took. And I only returned to watch TV if the advertising sequence had stopped. 
I believe many children feel and act the same way as I did when it comes to television advertising, especially nowadays wher kids are bored so quickly. 
And what I personally don't understand is the fact that companies normally advertise a product to a specific age group because they want to sell it to exactly these people. But when they advertise for example a toy, children can't buy it by themselves. They first would have to convince their parents and only if the parents agree, they maybe receive that specific toy for Christmas or as a birthday present. Companies therefore shouldn't advertise their products to little children because they can't afford to buy them anyway. 
Television advertising for children aged two to five can't be efficient in my opinion. And I personally don't think it is appropriate to advertise during a children's movie or show because children shouldn't be used to gain even more profit by advertising to them, they are just too innocent and shouldn't be waisted with such things.
So I totally agree with the statement. But we wouldn't have to argue about this if children would just play outside in nature instead of watching television. If they were doing this, they wouldn't be a target to many companies.
