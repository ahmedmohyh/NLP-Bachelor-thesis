In my opinion children should not be able to watch advertisements in television. One explicit reason is that the influence on children is much stronger than on an average adult. Children tend to soak everything up they see. And every thing they see can change their personality or influence their personal developement. Kids who experience terrible things in their childhood are more likely to get into any kind of addiction. That is why a child who sees some advertisements aldready starts to think in a way that takes consumtion for granted. But this is not true. Consumtion, as we do it today, is not eternal and therefore should not be promoted, especialy not in front of a child who is not able to think critical yet.

These advertisements directed to young children may even be a danger for their parents. Because the persons who produce these advertisements do not care about the children, they care about their parents' money. So if a child wants something out of an advertisement, he starts to beghis mother to buy him for example a new toy. This scenario can have two different ends. Rhe first end would be that his mother doesn't want to buy him a new toy. This might cause some troubles. The second end would be that his mother buys him his toy. So she supports the consumtion promoted from people who make a living out of abusing our world.

In conclusion I think that unless you are a person who does not care about children you shouldn't allow advertising directed to young children.
