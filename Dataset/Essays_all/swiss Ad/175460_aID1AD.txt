Nowadays it is much more common to advertise with some hidden messages than 50 years ago. This hidden message is often based on a sexual meaning. For example the new "Pneu Egger" advertise. It is about a snowman with spring feelings. But I think that kids do not get the sexual meaning of the advertisement, so it is not that dramatic. Advertising on a sexual base is so common, because it wakes people up and makes them to pay attention on the product. 

Children are really honest but also insecure. They often believe everything what the company tells them about the product. Sometimes children can get confused and dissapointed, when the product is much worse than the product in the advertisement. 

To my opinion, it is really important to take care of the time, when these clips are shown on television. If there is a company who advertises for sex toys in afternoon, a lot of kids will see this, which is totally negative for their developement.
 
On the other hand, kids will be able to learn about new products and know how to use some toys. They learn how it feels to have a desire and get taught to wait until they get these products. 
In my childhood there was a song of the toilet paper "candoo", which I loved to sing with my mother and my sisters. In this case I was able to learn something from television advertising. It is really important to create television advertisements who are funny and easy to understand.  

After thinking about the pros and cons of television advertising for young children, I can say, that it is totally okay to advertise toward children, as long as they are suited for the age of them. To my opinion, there is no need to forbidden television advertising directed toward young children.
