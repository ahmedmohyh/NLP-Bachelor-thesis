If a child is difficult to handle, the parents nowadays just put them in front of the TV and then they are quiet. It is a absolut unstressful solution. Because this is so well-known, the television business produces loads of advertising towards the children, which are hold quiet at the TV. In these advertisings, the children are beeing spoken to directly: They see things for example toys and afterwards they are going to stress the hell out of there parents to get these things shown in the advertising. So it is contra-productive if the children just get more dickheads if they watch TV. The only reason to protect children from this huge advertising business, is to do it like the old way: Never let them watch TV at all. Just go out with the children in the forest or to the playground. Children have to move themselve, have all the "children-illnesses" and get really tired in the evening, otherwise they are going to be fat and become autistic or they have other disturbances. So my personal opinion is that you should never let your child watch TV advertising and do it the normal way somwhere outdoor. I've never watched TV when i was young. We didn't even had one.
