The first thing I thought when I red this statement was why young children are definited by two to five years? What is, when younger children watch the television? Or when they are six or seven years old? It would be a problem himself, if babys watch television, but thats not the question.


My oppinion is, that it should not be allowed to every person, who could not already think critically about, what they see.
But a big problem is, that this is also a problem itself, because you can't think critically about things you see in television as long as lesser; also as an adult.
Do you know that the television is able to publish some clips from coca-cola, mc donalds or what ever, which you won't see (because there are published in a few milliseconds) , but your brain remainds? In the future, it will be more and more that the television or other "new" tecnological would change your mind, without thinking about it.
For children, it would maybe be more important because they are getting there minde and personality, but also for adults, because this are the people, which buy this products. For children, there should also be an affect, that they learn something while they are watching, which is also a big point in the discussion about children and television.
Another problem is, how long do a "normal" person watch the television or playing with their smartphones?


I think, it is an interessting statement, but it would be very very hard to change something (politic, people, ...), and if there would be something, it would not be hard to cheat.
All people (children and adults) should watch less television and "consuming" smartphones etc., they should go out, do some sport, meet some friends, and love their lives, so you may would not talk about this question.
