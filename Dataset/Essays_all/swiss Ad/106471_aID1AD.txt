There are various reasons, why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Nevertheless, in my opinion a prohibiton would have more disadvantages than advantages.

First about the advantages of not allowing television advertising towards young children: Children aged two to five can be manipulated very easiliy. This leads to a wrong upbringing. They learn to have a constant need for new products. As adults, they may not be able to destinguish between what they realy need and where they have been manipulated by advertisements.

On the other hand, there are also seversal disadvantages: A big part of the income of TV channels for children are the advertisements. Without them, a lot of TV channels can not survive. In addition, a fewer number of TV channels decreases the growth of the economy. Furthermore, it is the job of the parents to protect their children of the harm an advertisement can possibly have on their child. The parents must not buy everything the child wants. Is this the case, the child will learn that it is not possible to recieve every product is likes.

Eventually, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. The probability that a child is harmed is too small compared to the disadvantages it would cause for TV companies.
