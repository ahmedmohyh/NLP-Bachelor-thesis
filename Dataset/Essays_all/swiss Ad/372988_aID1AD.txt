Television advertising for children could be a way to more independence and responsibility or it could be a bad influence for them.

Firstly television advertising is a method to influence people into buying something. So that means you need money. Now, if you make television advertising directed toward young children you want them to buy something, right? But for that they would have to understand what it is about. I'm not sure if a two years old undertands that. Even if the child would understand it, how will it buy the product? It can't. The parents would have to do that. I don't believe parents would want to buy whatever the child wants.

Secondly when you have money to buy yourself products you are more independent. If we could and would teach this earlier to our children maybe they would use their money more responsible later on. They would learn how to use the money given to them and not to throw it out of the window, for example using it for drugs, alcohol, etc. It might help them to focuse on other things and not to feel controlled all the time by their parents. 

In conclusion they could turn out to be more responsible but if they have that much independence early in life they wouldn't get to know the limits. They just learn how to buy things, whatever they want. It's a possibility to get addicted to this, and I do not think that parents want shopaholics as their children.

In the end I do not believe it's a good way to learn how to be more responsible with money. Children that little do not understand all that is going on in the advertisers. And they could not buy the product. The possibility of them getting addicted to shopping or just being irresponsible with money is just to high of a risk for me. So, no, I do not think it should be allowed.
