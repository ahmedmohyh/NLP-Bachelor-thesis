Advertising in Television is becoming more and more clever. Lots of those ads invade our subconsciousness and try to make us buy the product even if we do not actually need it. 
When it comes to children, lots of them don't have enough money to afford these products. They don't even understand the concept of money. Even if they wanted it, they can not get the thing they were told they need.
Also lots of children that age are prohibited watching television by their parents. That way they don't even see the advertisements thus the feeling of needing the toy is not created.
And also children of that age do not have any intentions of actually buying these things. For example when I was little, i used to watch an advert of a Lego set all the time and then choosing another toy for my birthday. I was not influenced at all by the ad.
Those were some points pro advertising. Although they seem good and reasonable, there are also lots of contra-ad-points.
For example if the feeling of needing the toy is eventually created, the children will harass their parents until they get what they wanted or they got somehing else. This is quite annoying for any parent as my mother herself can agree.
Even more convincing of a ban of such advertisements are that when the child does not get that thing and other children get it, it creates the feeling of missing out something that should not be missed. For example I always wanted to have a scooter because all the other kids had one and I thougt I would have such a great time had I had it.
And even more so is that children this young are much easier to influence than adults are. They can not see past the triks these people are using. Their minds are still developping and should not be filled with unnecessary ads.
In my opinion, advertising towards children should be banned. The adverts should rather be directeed towards the parents of the child.
