When I was a child I often watched TV. There was often advertising for children of my age, and I loved to watch the advertising. For me it was very intresting to see the new toys and games. But is it good for the developement of a child to see alll the time new toys and things ?

The advertising is extra made for children so the actors use expressions whichchildren use in this age so that they everything understand. The pctures are made for the kids eyes and after every every episode there is at least one advertising video.

First I think it is cool for the kids to see new toys and games in the television. But when I was a young child I always wanted new toys and I never stopped asking my parent to get them. In my opinion it can be very embarassing for the parents if the child never stops asking for a new toy. So at least the parents buy them the toy and  the child is happy. But some days later the child sees something new in the television and asks his parents one more time to buy this thing. The parents don't want to tell the children off for asking for that and as a result they buy the new thing. So it is a never ending thing.

Advertising is for the seller a very good possibilty to show the kids the new toys, beacause the kids have to watch the advertising more or less. Without advertising it is very difficult to present the new games and toys.


In my opinion it is normal that there is some advertising for adults and for children. Maybe it woud be possible to show less advertising because sometimes it is getting on my nervs when there are 30 minutes of a TV show and then 10 minutes of advertising. But without advertising, watching TV would not be the same.
