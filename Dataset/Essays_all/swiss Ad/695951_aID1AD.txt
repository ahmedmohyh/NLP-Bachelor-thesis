Advertising is nowaday a very important method to distribute information about a product and to convince people to buy a specific one. Everyone knows the feeling of wanting something really hard. 

You can't turn on the TV and watch a movie without having some breaks for advertising. Some advertising are especially for young children. They see some toys on TV and afterwards they want them. It is very easy to manipulate children and that is a reason why advertising for children is normally successful. In my opinion television advertising directed young children (aged two to five) shouldn't be allowed because so young children should learn to play outside and shouldn't be dependent on to much material objects. We should protect them from advertising. The parents have to teach them how to play alone or with other children. Interaction is very important. I know that a lot of children in this age already spend a long period of time in front of the TV but I think this is wrong because they should do other activities. Even young children are nowaday addicted to mobile phone and want to play games on the tablet. This is very dangerous. Almost every app (for children as well) contains advertising which influences the children and their opinion. You can't do anything against it.  

Children need to learn how to deal with the tecnology and advertising but I don't think they should learn it by the age of two or five. Soon enough they know how to handle with smartphones and computers. They grow up with the tecnogoly and are digital natives. But they shouldn't start by the age of two.
