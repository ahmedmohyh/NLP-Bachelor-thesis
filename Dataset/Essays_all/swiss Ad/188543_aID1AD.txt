A big problem in our social life is television advertising. Many politicians critc that television advertising manipulate the children to buy something they have watched in the TV. I agree with the statement for the following reasons.

A main advantage is, that the children do not want to buy new toys, because they do not know which toys exist. They are not able to ask their parents, which new toys the store sales. Furthermore, the television advertising tries to manipulate the children with the new toys and the shining colours. The makers always invent new statements to buy something. Nowadays the children are not able to see the advertising, because they see it everywhere. You can't intend your child to watch TV. When you are a child you just have to watch the cartoons. But, today this is very difficult, after every cartoon follows some Television advertising. Therefore so many children watch the advertising. A other adventage is, that it isn't very nice to use the children, that the parents buy something. 

On the other hand, the children could learn some new words. In a advertising they use many useful English words. At second, they see how the world is, which toys exist, what they can do with them. It is a good measure to rise up our economie. When the children in other coutntrys watch them as well, you could expand your issues.

In conclusion, in my opinion it should not be allowed to direct toward young childrens. The children should be able to watch TV without advertising.
