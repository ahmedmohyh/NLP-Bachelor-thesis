The television and the big concerns use promotions and television advertisings to get the attention of people. The promotions show the product and for what it is used for. They are often loud, coloury and catching, so you want to have the product too. But should televison advertisings directet toward children be allowed? 
Adults, if they se a promotion, know what they need, what it is udes for and if its unnecessery for their life. They have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not. 
Kids or children dont have this expierence. They want to have things that are loud, funny and coloury. So they feel very attractet to things wich are promoted in the television, espiecally things to play with. Children dont know what it means to earn money and to have the contingency to buy things you like. 
They are bored with old things and alway want to have new things And then, if they see a product they want to play with, they are going to ask their parents for it. If it isnt a big thing the parents would probably say yes to it. But if they feel like its unnecessery, they will say no. The kid is going to be crying and disappointed. 
So the concerns used it to lock the childs attention and the feeling to play with it. The concerns dont care if the parents have money for it and if the family has a good wealth. They want to earn money and thats it. 
I think promotions for things like musicals, festivals, films etc. are allowed because its more easily to decide if someone likes it or not. But promotions for kid products usally dont tell the truth. They are over produced and just use the naivity of children.
