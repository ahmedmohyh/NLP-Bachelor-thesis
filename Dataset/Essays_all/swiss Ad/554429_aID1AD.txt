I do agree with the following statement even though I do not think that so young and juvenile kids would understand the television advertising. They are too young to know what they want and they would not realise that people just want to sell things. But they do not know what is important in life. They have no idea that they will not need the things the may want now in the future. So tv advertising would catch them.
Kids do have too many things and plays anyway. They do not need hundrets of plays. They can not use everything at the same time. Parents and friends should not waste so much money on toys just because they can not tell their kids that the things they have seen in television are not necessairy. 
In addition to that kids should not watch so much television in that age. They also should not have got so much money to buy things with. In that age the kids should be playing on the street with other children. 
The parents who are going to buy the stuff they have to buy should see the advertising, and only them. Childs are not mature and wise enough to decide what they really need. They may react angry when they do not get what they want. This problem could be solved if they were not seeing the television advertising.
