First I thought why should the television not advertise towards young children? Television advertising is the to make people want a certain thing. You make them believe that they really need this new thing that they always see in the television. A lot of kids are between two and five and they also want to play with the newest things they see on the TV. On one side this is not bad, because the technology goes further and with selling things to play you can make a lot of money. Money that they can use to produce cooler and newer things to play and also for themselves to feed their families. On the other side it is bad to show this very young kids all this things. They can not decide what they just want or what they really need. So they want their parents to buy everything. For example if little girls see horses to play in the TV they want one. But the producer are smart and they produce horses in every size and colour. Now the girls ask their parents to buy them one of this horses. The parents ask: "Which one do you want?". Now the girl has to decide if she wants the pink one, the purple one or the red one. Every horse is beautiful in her eyes and she wants them all. Often the things they show children in television advertising is very expensive. Not every family has enough money to buy such things. Now we have the problem that some children always have the newest and coolest things to play and other have their standard doll to play which are not bad, but it's not as cool as the purple, pink and red horses. Sometime this is enough to start bully other children in kindergarden. 
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children is not a good idea. Mostly it is too much stress for the families and also for the children, because they alway see what the other children have what they not have.
