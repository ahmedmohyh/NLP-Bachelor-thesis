Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Concerning the "shopping behaviour" children are equal to adults. If they see something cool they want it. Television advertising directed toward young children uses this. But in some cases it seems to be more like a misuse. According to this therer's the question if this kind of advertising should be forbidden.

When children see the adverting in the TV, the parents can't influence what they see. So the children generate wishes and the parents have no idea where they come from. The problem here is the fact that children see so much different things. The result is that they want everything they see there. They don't learn to see those things with their own eyes but only through the eyes of the seller. The most frequent sentences are for example "You should have it" or "Get it now". The sellers calculate with the grace of parents buying what their children like to have. In this case it is a kind of misuse and should not be allowed. But it could have also o a positive effect: If children see the advertising parents can act and show how to get on with that. So the parents coud prevent their children. In this case it's equal if there is Television advertising directed to young children or not.

I think this sort of advertising is not good at all and not helpful. But I think the parents should also take care of what their children watch and not let them watch anything on TV. And if the children do not watch TV all the time, which seems to be another problem, the television advertising directed toward young children would not be a problem because they have not so many possibilities to watch it.
