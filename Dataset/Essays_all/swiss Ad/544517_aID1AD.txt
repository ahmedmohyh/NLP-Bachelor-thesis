Yes, i totally agree with this statement, because if young children watch television, they shouldn't waste time with advertises. I think that children shouldn't watch TV all day and if they do, they should be concentrated on the informations that they learn with the things that are in the TV. They're uninteressed in advertises and maybe the children can't even see the difference between real TV and advertises. Young children want to learn things, they're curious and want to learn and understand everything they see and if they watch advertises, maybe the children's growth gets slow down. Another point is the regular TV, what I've named a little bit at the beginning of the text. Young children to the age of three should nearly never watch TV and children between three and ten should have the permission of the parents if they want to watch television. The consume of medias is a problem that nearly every mother and father has. If children watch TV, they should learn something about the world and how things are going. If they have to watch advertises, they might unsee the important things. Advertises should be only for young adults and adults, because these are the people who have money to buy the things in the advertises. That's another point in this statement. Young children want everything that they see, if it's in real life or in the television. And if they see a toy in TV that looks funny and the woman that representates the toy looks also very friendly, they want it. The parents couldn't and shouldn't buy everything their children wants, but children don't unterstand it, when the parents say no, because they are too young for it.
