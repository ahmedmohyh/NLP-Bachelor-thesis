Nowadays television advertisements increase rapidly. Many channels often make advert breaks after a short time of a movie or a show. Channels for children mainly advert toys or some free time activities like adventure parks. But does it make sense to show children in this young age these advertisements?
Children are very easy influenced by TV-spots. MAinly children between two and five years old. When they see a cool new toy, they want it immediately and ask their parents to buy it. Sometimes this desire gets so strong that the parents are forced to get it. This ads don't just influence the wishes of the children, but also the decisions of the parents what they're buying on a psychological basis.
The kids are affected in a very early time by advertising-strategies. They grow up with pictures of a perfect world and stereotypical things. Those adverts can support stereotypes of gender roles, for instance there are girls showed with pink dresses and dulls in their hands having fun. 
On the other hand: would those toys be bought if there weren't any TV-spots? Television advertisement is a good platform for companies to show off their new products.
In my view television advertising shouldn't be forbidden for children in this age. It's a thing of the parents if they allow their children to watch TV or some channels which show many ads.
