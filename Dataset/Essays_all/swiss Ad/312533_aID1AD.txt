We all know these kinds of advertising. When you ar sitting on the sofa, watching TV, maybe even a good film, there is of course a block of ads. For example one of Toys R Us. They show happy children at the age of four with little cars, figures or other kinds of toys. But is it okay to influence young children already at this age?

If you show a young boy a picture of a toy, maybe a car, he of course wants one. But is he able to buy one? No, he`s not, so the influence of the television advertising is zero. Due to this, the advertisment is just for the parents, who maybe want to buy their kids these kinds of toys. Because of this, it should be allowed to show advertising directed toward young children, because they aren`t affected.
Well, on the one hand it`s true that the parents are influenced by these TV ads. But on the other hand, the child also sees these ads, so it is also affected. Of course a three year old girl can`t buy barbies, but she can talk to her mother, who hasn`t saw the advertising. Maybe she has to ask more times her mother to buy her a barbie, but after a few weeks, the mother will eventually give up and buys her daughter a barbie. Then, the toystore has reached their goal, the selling of a barbie. In this example, the mother is only indirect affected by the advertising, but the little girl is the direct victim of the toystore. If she hadn`t watched the advertising, which is directed toward her, she hadn`t asked her mother, and she hadn`t bought the barbie.


Because of these arguments, I think it is better to prohibit the advertising toward young children, at least until the age of five. It is not okay, that the big toy concernes use the young children to make even more money. we should safeguard the next generation against the bad influence of the toy industry, where only the profit, and not the children is important.
