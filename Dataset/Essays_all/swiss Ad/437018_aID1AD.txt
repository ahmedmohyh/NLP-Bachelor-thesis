Most of the television advertising that is directed to children aged two to five is about toys. Unlike adults, most children enjoy the advertisings between the shows as much as the TV show itself. But is it corect to direct advertisings to little children? 

A colorful and funny created advertising can influence a child a lot, especially a child in such a young age. Those children will beg their parents for unnecessary toys, make their parents buy them, realize that playing with those toys is not as exciting as shown in TV and beg their parents to buy them the toy in the new advertising. It becomes a vicious circle. 
Additionally, the child possibly enjoys those advertisings since watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys. This could make the child want to watch more and more television and can lead to antisocial and lazy or even obese children.

On the other hand, those advertisements have no direct harm. If the parents can control the amount of their childs daily or weekly hours of television watching, there is no risk of addiction for the child. Plus, the advertisings are also a help for the parents to know what goods are on the market and which toys can actually educate their child. For example the colorful pianos that have numbers and letters and each tile and make a sound with each button pressed help the child to learn in a funny way. 
Toy companies want to make people buy their toys, so where else should they show their advertisements other than on childrens TV channels?

All in all, I think it depends on the parents. If they manage to control the influence the advertisings have on their children, their shouldn't be a problem. Advertisings can also help the child and the parents to learn things or to know with what object the child can learn efficiently. As long as the advertisings are appropriate there is no harm in entertaining little kids.
