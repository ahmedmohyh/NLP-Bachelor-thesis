I agree. Why? Because it destorys the children's brains.
Every time they watch television ads, they scream and shout. "Mom, Dad, buy us this or that" "No son, you have no use for this stupid shit", is my usual answer. 
Those Dudes that produce the ads are usually loosers in my opinion. All they care about is the cash they get. 
It doesn't matter how weird and pointless an Ad for children might be, aslong as they get their beloved money, the're happy. Now why do I agree with this? Because I watched lots of television back in the day. And I'm fucking mental!!! Bi-ba-bop. Every time I see a rainbow I immediately think of Skittle-shitting giraffes.
Like is that normal in any way?
Definitly not. Thats why I wanna start a petition to take down those money-hungry sharks. I'm gonna sue them for every penny they've made with the selling of their useless products.
Well, anyways where was I?
Usually im really calm when it comes to things like these. 
But we gotta protect our little babies right?
We don't want them to have square eyes after all. Also. Why is it forbidden to make Ads for Alcohol, now nobody cares about Ads for icecream?
I mean it's not like 1/3 of the population is already overweight?
But who fucking cares? Children that are obese aren't affected at all later on in the life am i right?
Ohh nevermind they are.
Most of any diseases have something to do with being overweight. Heart failure, problems with your joints later in life, breathing problems, even things like getting bullied, because of their weight, are just some of the things you're going to encounter when watching Ads! Definitly those things should be banned from TV. For sure. No other way is possible, to save the world from drowning in rainbows and giraffes. And icecream.
