It is not a secret that advertisement can be manipulativ.People who are the most confronted with this manipulation are teenagers and adults. But it may be also possible that childrens are manipulated by the television. But is it so bad if young children see some advertising?

First of all we have to make clear that only a few young children are allowed to watching television. Most of the two to five aged children are outside to play and their parents keeps an eye on them. So not many children are confronted by advertising. 

Secondly we need to consider that children not are able to buy anything. So if they see something on television for example a toy which they want, they can not just buy it like an adult. So what can be the consequence if the see some toys on television? 
Of course they desire to get this toy, they want the parents to buy this toy. 

But is this such a worse thing? It is fact that children need some toys to play and learn thing with playing. Furthermore they learn to appreciate things. One toy they get but the other not, the parents not just buy every toy their children wants. So the children have to learn how to choose and what is important. Besides the parents also can show their children that the television is not right everytime. There are toys which are not as great as it seemed at the advertisement.

In conclusion adversitsing is not as worse as we thing if we use it the right way. The children can learn much about the television, advertisement and the world outside. They learn to choose only the one thing they want and not to desire useless things.
