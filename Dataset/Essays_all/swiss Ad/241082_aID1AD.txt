I partly agree with the statement because I think television advertising has a big influence especially on very young children. The advertisings on channel for children often advertise for quite expensive products like Lego. It's very easy to manipulate children of this age and it`s very difficult for the parents to decline something their children. Also, the childrens brain develop very fast at this age and this process is very complex. It's important that there's no negative influence on the children created by the advertising. 
On the other hand the television channels somehow have to earn their money and advertising is the best and easiest way to do this beside product placement, which has an even bigger influence on the viewer. We live in a capitalistic worlf and without the money earned from the advertising television channels won`t be able to produce any new childrenthemed shows. The channels wiich aren't founded by the goverment are normal companies and have to bring up money to pay their bills.
I don't agree with statement because I believe there`s no necessity for a law against televison advertising. The channels somehow have to refinance themselves. In general, young children shouldn't spend too much time in front ov the tv what could have a bad influence on their development. I personally think, it's the parents duty to watch out for their children and decrease the time spent in front of the tv if they recognise a change in the character of the child after watching television.
