Many young children, aged two to five, watch a lot of television. Because of that some companies started to focus their television advertising directly to this young children. This started many discussions about advertising and our society. Should the gouvernement interups / stops these type of discussions? Should it forbid television advertising to young children? Than, of course, the problem and the discussions are away. However is this the right way? That are the questions I will look at.

It is absolutly true that television advertising directed toward young children is profitable. Not many parents can say no to their children if they want something new to play, like a new Barbie or a little car, especially if the children wish that for Christmas or for their Birthdays.

However that also has bad aspects. For example that the children want to many of new things to play or if they want something, which is not good for them but the advertising said it is good. That is the thing I will look at in this paragraph. Young children can be easily be influenced and they change their opinion rapidly. When you use something they like as a help for example a comic figure like ''Olaf'' from the movie ''Frozen'', you can sell everything with this help to children. Parents use this method when their child does not want to eat broccoli, but it work with everything.

When the gouvenement forbids television advertising directed towards young children than the companies will search another way to contact these children, because they do not want to lose this financial source of profit.
