Today it is normal that also very young children watch television. It is just a simple way that the children are calm and parents have time for other things. In the TV, there are advertising directed toward young children. But is it a good thing to put little children on the couch and let them learn something in the television and then they were influenced from special advertising?

To sell toys it is a good way to show them in the tv. An argument for the advertising is that it is the opinion of the parents to let the children watch tv. If they don't like the advertising, they should use the time with the children without watching television, then the companys need commercials to sell the products. 

An argument against is that in the tv children could learn a lot with special series. But there are breaks and a lot of influencig of the children with commercials. They have to watch it and it isn't fair that so young children are already influecend from the television advertising. They can't have an own opinion and this is bad for our society.

In my opinion, tv advertising directed toward young children is not a good thing but the companys need it to sell their products. I wouldn't support it, but when you don't want the influence of it for your children they shouldn't watch television. But the parents should think abour it and make how they want. In the end it is just an opinion of the parents, because the children are to little.
