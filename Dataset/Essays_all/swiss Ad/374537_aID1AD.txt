Should television advertising be directed toward young children (aged two to five)?

Television advertising is advertisement on the television, which can be broadcasted any time a day. Advertisement is used to inspire people to buy things or to react to politics,or so. Children at the age of two to five are not able to build up their own opinion because their to young. Children do what they want or what they are told to in these young years of their lifes.

Advertisement is only good if the content is also helpful for these children. For example: what every parent wihes for is an intelligent child. So if the kid watches television and an advertisement for a laptop comes on and they see how much fun these children in the atvertise have, they want to have it too. What the child doesn't realize is that the laptop has the function to teach how to count, how to read and has games to train addition of numbers. In 
the best case: the child goes to the parent and they buy it.

But as you can tell in the former example, the child just wants to have it because he sees how much fun other childern have with it and not because of its functions. And that's the problem. Cildren at the age of two or five can be easily influenced by the background of an advertise. They just want to have what looks fun. So instead of a laptop, which teaches you useful things, it also could have been a violent game.

I agree with the statement. I think children shouldn't be watching a lot of television. They should be out and play in the sand and their friends. Children shouldn't be influenced by andvertisement so young. First of all, they need to learn to have an own opinion.
