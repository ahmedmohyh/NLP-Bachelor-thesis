Advertisement is all around us and we are exposed to it from a very young age. Most tv channels depend on adverts which are addressing different groups of costumers. One of these groups are infants as young as two to five years old. This is a controverial subject.

First of all, young children are easily influenced. They may not question the benfit of a product if someone else is evidentely happy with it. They learn through copying others and thus are drawn to want the same toy as the fellow child in the advert.

Children of this age who are exposed to commercials and are often unable to choose whether they want to watch the adverts or not. As an adult one is more aware of adverts and can ignore or skipt them, whereas children who watch tv usually do not differ between programmes or adverts. This again makes them more vulnerable.
Nowadays though tv consumption is decreasing due to the availability of programmes on the internet. The internet often containes more adverts which may not always be appropriate for children, therefore tv adverts are a better option.

Furthermore, infants are usually cared for by their parents who will buy them what they think is best for them. It would be logical to aim adverts towards parents and not the children themselves, since the parents will be the ones who might eventually buy the product.
However, children should have a certain influence to what their guardians buy for them. Adverts may help them to recognise the diversity of products.

In my opinion adverts aimed towards young childern ought to be appropriate and ther should only be a limited amount. I think it often depends in the product that is advertied and above all how it is presented. Children may be made aware of the existance of the product but should not feel compulsed to own it.
