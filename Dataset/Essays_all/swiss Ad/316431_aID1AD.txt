Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed?

Im my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because television advertising can be informative for something the children wants, and the parents shouldn't allow everything when his children wants something.
 
Not every television advertising is bad for young children. If there is a advertising about a special toy, why should that be forbitten for children? It is clear that the parents aren't happy when their child wants everything what they see in the television advertising. But they can learn something about it and the parents know what is fancy and what not.
Another point is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the TV. And if there is something what the children want, the parents shouldn't allow everything. They should say no and must be consequent. 

So I think that television advertising directed toward young children shoul be allowed. Because you cant permit every television advertising. Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong. In the end I think the parents have to decide what the children shoul watch and what not.
