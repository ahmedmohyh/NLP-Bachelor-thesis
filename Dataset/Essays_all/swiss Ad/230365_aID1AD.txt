Television advertising toward young children:

Nowadays the television programs are often interrupted by advertisments. Young children between the age of two to five often lack of experience and do not know how to interprete them. The advertiser takes this fact as an advantage and produces adverts just for young children. The aim of the whole process is that the children make their parents buy something, as soon as they see the product in a supermarket. It is quite mean to produce advertisments like this, so should it be forbiden?

Personally me, I can see the problem in spaming those children with television advertisments to make use of them. The children are so young but they actually already get to know the preassure of manufacturers. The television advertisments give them a feeling that they have a lack of something, beacause they don't have, what the children in the television are having. Obviousely not everyone needs such things to be happy but an advertisment always looks so nice to young children and the people in the advert always seem to be so happy so that they want to experience this feeling themselves.
It is also kind of stressfull for the parents. For example, when you have a child which is five years old and it comes shopping with you, it maybe starts to scream out loud in public just because it saw something that was recently in an advert. If you can't stop your children crying you maybe ponder to buy the object, just to keep your children's mouth shut.

In conclusion, the adverts aren't good for children, neither are they for the parents. It would be the best solution to just not allow these adverts to exist. If they are forbidden, the children are able to go into a magazin and decide on their own, wheater they are interested in something or not. Without the influence of television advertising.
