In my opinion a child aged two to five can't decide if an advertising is especially directed towards them. A child has to learn that it can't get anything it wants. For sure, the advertiser wants that the child goes to his parents and tells them that they want to have this thing that it saw in the advertising, but for me that's no reason not to allow it. But yes, i think it can be ennoying for parents when their children do this, but it can also be a good point for a good parenting. When I was a child I was bored from advertising neither, so I think they didn't influented me and I didn't ennoyed my parents too. 
However, I don't see the point to direct advertising toward children aged two to five, because they are too young. I think it's worse to direct advertising toward children aged seven to twelf. In this age the children understand what they see in the advertising and they are more influentable. But this isn't a reason not to allow them.  

Another problem is to decide which advertise is directed toward young children and which not, if advertising directed to young children would be forbidden. In my opinion it isn't decidable to say if an advertise is directed for children aged five or for children aged seven, so it would be very difficult to decide if the advertise should be forbidden or not.

In conclusion I think it may not be good for some children that companies trie to influent them whit their televison advertsing , but it cant be forbidden because it would not make much sense and would be pretty difficult to say if the advertise is directed to young kids or not.
