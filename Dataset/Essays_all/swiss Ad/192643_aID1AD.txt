Advertising directed toward children is in my opinion one the biggest branches related to advertising. But what an impact do these advertisings have on childern? All advertisings directed toward children are commercials in my opinion.The only reason for that we have such commercials is because it works. Children seeing a spot about a new game or toy and they go completly crazy about it. The child starts to want this one toy and every time it sees the commercial again, their want for it gets bigger. But i rather prefer, that children see these commercial instead of the commercials beeing on Tv on midnight. Where does this leads towards? As I said the children sticks toward the thought that without this toy it is not happy. And that leads us towards the point were we all know it: Parents and their children standing at the shoppingmall and the parents try to explain to the kid why it cannot have this toy. But the kid is not able to understand why. The only thing it realises is that it cannot have this toy. The kid starts screaming, crying and throwing things around in the store. I think this was also the reason why this quote makes sense. Children that are really into something but their parents do not want it to happen are mostly going completly crazy.
In my opinion we are not really able to prevent that there are these commercials directedtoward children. There are many TV-Channels that are making so much money out of these advertisings. But i dont really think that thesetelevision adveretisings directed toward young children should not e allowed. If you really want to do something against it as a parent you should better sell your television because there will be this situationof you standing in the shopping mall andyou dont know what you should do about your screaming child.
