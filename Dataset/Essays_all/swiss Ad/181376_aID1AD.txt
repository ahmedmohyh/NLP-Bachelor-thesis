Should young children watch television or not?

In todays society it is commun that young children are allowed to watch television during the day or even in the evening. For parents is it easier to put on the television instead of playing a game with their children. Parents are able to do some cleaning or some work at home, while the children are mostly quite by watching television. At the opposite it is also important that parents spend time with thier children outside. It's the only way for children to learn about our nature and dayly situations in real life.

Another aspect is to look at the health of young children. It isn't healthy to spend all day inside and never get in contact with dirt or bacteria. For young between two and fivenit is necessary to get a good immunsystem so they can't get easly sick or ill. 
 
As a parent you have to show your children animals, nature or a new environnement. On televison of course it is easier to show those things, because you don't have to leave your house, but it is never as good as in real life.

In my opinion watching television in young age is not a good idea to replace time with parents or other children. It can be a possibilty on a cold day but it doesn't have to become a habitant. Even though it is lot easier as a parent to put on the television, I'm sure that children appreciate spending some time  with their parents without a television or a mobile phone.
