Televisioin advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed:

There are a lot of difference arguments for this thema.

As example is it good for the firm because the children in the age of two since five years, are good to become. They belive all what the television or the parents said. When the television said, that in the aged of four years every boy have a Carrera cars and every girl mus have a Barbie, then every boy and every girl want that because they haven't it and all the others have it.
A second argument for the television advertising is, that it is allowed to have a advertising for some plays in the television, the firm can show us what they have and wehn the children have birthday or wehn its christmas its good for the parents when they have presents.

But at the other side it isn't good, because the children want all these thnings they sit more bevore the television and watch it.
An other argument, because the television advertising for young children should not be allowed is, because the little children can't know what they need. The parents want to do all perfect for his little child and when the child want something he become it. This is like a manipulation for the little children but they can't understand it.

My personality opinion is, that it should be allowed, because each firm must do advertising for his own things and when the firm sold things for little children, they should make this advertising.
