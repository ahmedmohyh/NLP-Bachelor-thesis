I disagree with this statement because it's impossible to forbit the television advertising for children aged two to five. If the parents let the children watch television they can watch advertising. So I do not understnd why I should write a essay about this topic. Children can not learn very effectiv by watching televioson so this wont be a problem for them. And if they are stupid in the futur and ruin theier life, this will be theier problem and not my problem, so I don't care. It's impossible for the state to controle every single houshold if a children under the age 6 is watching a television advertising. If they will forbit the television advertising they also should forbit the advertsising on the streets, radio, airplanes and others because if children were on the streets with theier family they see this avertising too and noone says something. This would not make a lot of sense because if teleadvertising are not good for young children then the other advertising won't be good too for them. So I do not understand why I have to write about this topic because there aren't good points for or against this topic.  My point of view is that there are no reasons against the television advertising for children under the age of six. Also advertising can be good for young children because young people can learn better the older people. So if they see advertiing in the television as an example about condoms they will know in the futur that they will need one to be save. As an other example chewingum so they won't smell bad if they have a date or a conversation with someone else. So there is a positiv aspect for television advertising. For me there are no reasons against it.
