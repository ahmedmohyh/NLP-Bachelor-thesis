Im not certainly agree but but not disagree either.However television advertisements generally misusing to recommend the thing that advertising from them for people to buyThey always try to show the produch more convinient and better to prefer for selling them.Advertisements which are directed by toward young childrens parents actually should have the responsibity that their children directing in advertisement that tries to show the product different.Advertisements makes people to want and buy the product.But its actually very common for example in children products that advertisers prefer to use little children to have their their parents confidence.Because when parents see a little children directing advertise something they think like its okay if i buy this product to my children.But actually its not a big problem that little children directing in an advertisement because when you try to sell something if its children product you have to direct a children tht can be used by them for have more request.In my opinion if the advertising product not trying to show what is actually like not misusing peoples minds it okay to directing a children in an advertisement.But some of parents which has no responsibity about advertisements they can direct their children because of for earning some money from there.But at 2-3 age of children cant decide what they exactly think what they have to do as an adult so thats certainly up to their parents.
