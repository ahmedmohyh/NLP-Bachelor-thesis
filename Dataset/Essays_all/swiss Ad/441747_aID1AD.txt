Every child starts to speak at the age of 2, so why it should not be allowed to watch advertisment ,which are dedicated towards the young among us. They can improve there visual and speaking skills, through those interesting advertisment.

 It does not seem like that they were capable to buy stuffs or even advertise for it, at this age. In many cases children are also trapped in a social media world. Every child nowadays has more contact with their tablets as with sport materials. For long periods it could also effect the brain and nerves. They will get quick furious and nervous if we would ban to watch televison or play video games. For a loner period it could also cause many diseases at this young age. Many of them will suffer from brain and nerve diseases, those are really rare cases but its also possible. Advertsiments are good prepartions for school. They can expand your vocabulary and your memory skills will increase. In those advertisment streaming time children also have the possibility to got to the toilet or help their mother for example. Otherwise they will stuck with the sofa and wont let their concentration rubbed by anyone. They will recognize something at the grocerie store  that they saw on tv and won`t let go until you will buy them whatever it is. 

In my opinion we should not ban the advertising for children at the age of two to five, because it`s unnecessary to do it and let them look what they want. Your job is to entertain them nothing else. In this century we do not know when the world is gonna end, so let them live their live. We have other problems to look after. All i can say is sip some lean and chill. It will take time to find back.
