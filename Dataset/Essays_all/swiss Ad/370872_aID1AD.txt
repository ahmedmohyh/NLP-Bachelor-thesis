It should not be allowed because television adversiting is made by psychologists and they're aiming at manipulating the consumer. A young child has not developped his mind enough to recognize the manipulation and so it has no chance to defend itself from the adversiting. It's very unfair towards the children because as they grow older they are kinda drilled to consume the products from the adversiting. As an example we could take Coca Cola: Coca Cola highlights the bottle by making the picture black and white and only the bottle colourful. A young child only sees the bottle, it's focused and the child has no idea why. So that's where the manipulation starts. If the child sees this picture over and over again it will get used to it and see Coca Cola as something normal, something that belongs in his life, something he has discovered and he/she now loves it. 

On the other side you could say that it's necessary for a company to manipulate its consumers if there's a lot of other companies dominating the market. It's a strategy to get the consumer used to its products and gain profit.

In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed. The idea of gaining profit and manipulating consumers only to achieve something that's motivated by the human greed isn't going to bring us any further. It's an idea straight from the capitalistic economy structures. It doesn't learn our kids anything. They even want our kids to be not thinking consumers. So why should we let the companies manipulate our children?
