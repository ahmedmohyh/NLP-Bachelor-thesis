Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. 

Advertisment is everywhere in our daily lifes. It's trying to trick us into buying stuff we actually don't really need. But is it right that we let advertisment influence our youngest children?

In their youngest years children can be manipulated and influenced very easily. If they see an toy ad, especially an ad full of colors and other kids having fun with a toy, they want it. They can't yet assess if they need it or have the money to buy it they just want the product. So they go to their parents and beg them to buy the toy for them and somewhen the parents agree. So television advertising directed toward young children basially forces the parents to buy useless toys. It's taking advantage of kids to make profit.

Secondly avertisement often goes specifically after gender roles. Girls should play with pink puppets while boys are shown with cars and weapons. This influences how the kids see themselves, how they think their life has to be. This is very harmful for such youn kids which still have to develop their identity.

Another important point is that this toys are often produced in poor countries under bad circumstances and horrible working conditions. So with making the kids wanting those toys and the parents buying them, they support this terrible circumstances.

A point in faviour of television advertisment is that it surely creates jobs and helping the economy but at what cost?

To sum up, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating, influences their development and harms the environment.
