I disagree with the statement, because they still see the parents as an all-known-person. So the last word from the parents is wright. The age between two and five is easy to influence but not enough that the children influence afterwards their parents. They still don`t have ther own opinion. They tell that they have, but in fact they just retell the sentense of ther parents. I know that a child, after seen something very cool in the advertise, wants to have it. But if the parents explain and tell them the contraire or show them something different they won`t be anymore interesseted. I have the impression that after the age of five the children start the make their own opinion, they have allready some money and they are able to go some where, for example walk away from their parents and buy it by themself. 
The age of two they don`t understand what the are talking in the television and they just look at the persones and their movements. The age of three is the age of saying "no". Everything is not good, if it is or not, but just the fact they can say the word "no". So they see something in the television and the parents ask him if he would like it, the child will always answer with "no". They age of four the start to thinking and asking always "why". Also if they don`t care they will say "why". Also the explanation will be answered with "why" and again "why" and "why". The age of five, it starts to get difficult as I wrote above allready. They start to have there favorites chanals and will discuss it with there friends. They will have a depate about it. They will always have the same arguments but that doesn`t counts.
My opinion is so, that I don`t agree the statement because the children aren`t able to have there own opinion and to fill out or to continue there mission to get it or recieve it. Also because after some time it`s not anymore interesseting.
