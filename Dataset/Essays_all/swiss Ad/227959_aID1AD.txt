We all know the feeling. The feeling of being in charge of children and having to look after them so they're protected without us hovering over them. Helping a person become a grown and able human being is quite the responsabilty. It's a feeling of power and uselessness at the same time. A lot of parents disagree on where to draw the line on situations that might change a childs perspective or behaviour. Situations like television advertising are escpacially controversial. Some Mothers and Fathers say that ads that are directed towards small children should not be alllowed because they create an unnatural urge to buy things that aren't necessary for life. That this urge could cause finacial problems that follow the childrens life until they die. 
The CEO of the Ellison Advertising Agency, Clayton Ellison, disagrees very strongly. He says that children of that age were not capable of understanding these ads the way we adults do. Children could not evolve an urge to buy things until later in life and that these ads were simply to show different toys that they could select. 
A study of the University of Oxford proved the opposite of Mr. Ellisons theory. Psychologist tested children and their behaviour befor and after watching television ads for toys. The study also documented the later life of children that watched or didn't watch television ads. The results state that televions ads do in fact have an influence on the later life and a persons finacial status. Children that watch televions ads are more likely to have money problems and an excessive consum later in life.
