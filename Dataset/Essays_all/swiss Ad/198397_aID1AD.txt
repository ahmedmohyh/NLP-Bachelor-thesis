Television is in our modern world an object, everybody knows. Some years ago there were not as much TV is as today. The world changes and we have to change our live to! The young childrens between two and five years are living with the family. They are looking much TV and between the films and documentaries there is coming more and more advertisings. The Television advertising leads the young people to buy things the actually do not need. It is a Problem!

We can say that the advertising leads the young guys to buy things they actually do not need. And they have not so much money and then they are getting in an situation were they are not able to pay. They should invest their money to an bank, and keep the money save on it to have much money for the live after they live by Daddy and Mummy. 

That is a problem, but we also have to see, that the family, special the fathers and mothers have to look that the childrens keep their money on the bank and don't buy the "rubbish" from the TV. Maybe they should take off the TV when the advertising starts. 

The shops want to buy as much as possible. They have to give attention to their products in the community of this new generations. 

The young boys and girls between two and five years are involved by the television advertising. The advertising on TV is more "dangerous" for childrens in the higher age. Because the teenagers have their one money and can buy such things. They are also not every time with the adults on the way and the adults have no involvness to them. 

The Television advertising leads young person in the age of two up to five not to buy these objects from the advertising. But for the teens it could be an problem. The teens can looking for themselves and the young children between two and five have to be "controlled" by their parents. In my opinion, if the young children are controlled by their parents, the television advertising could be allowed.
