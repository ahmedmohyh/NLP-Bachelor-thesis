Should the television industry be allowed to influence little children. In this essay, I want to consider about the influence of little children by the medias, especially the television and if it should be allowed.

That the adults are influced by media isn't a secret. Whenever you're listening music or watching the news, there's a direction which tells us something about the writer of the music or television program. So is it even possible to isolate a little child of all the influences of media? Maybe the different opinions or messages help them to think in different directions and to consider all different views.
In advertisings, the technology industry suggets young children that they need a mobile phone or another gadget to have fun. On the other side: The parents are free to decide if they're willing to buy them a mobile phone or not.
On the other side, there are programs like "Dora". Little Dora shows for example the children what a flower is and what it looks like. But nowadays, there are many programs which show us violence against others. The child could probably learn that it's okay to hit others without consequences.

In my opinion, little childrem shouln't even watch TV. They have to play outside with their mates and explore the environment. I wouldn't want that my child has a phone before they're thirteen, not matter if the other children has already phones. So there exists no longer a problem if the television influences our children. With our generations of technology, there's no longer possible to raise our children out of the influences of technology.
