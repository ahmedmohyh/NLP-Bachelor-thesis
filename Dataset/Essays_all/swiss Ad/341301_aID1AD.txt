the Television is now an object in our every day buissiness which will be more and more importent.It is very simple used and shows you interesting perspectives from unknown experiences.it also can show you things in complet different way as it in  real exists.

 Advertising is one of the simplest possibilities to take the visitor in this in televion showed beautiful and simple life if you follow the facts which were told. I think for a young children it's very difficult to filter out waht is real and what is fiction. It's an age where you live in a imaginationed world which can be forced by the televiosion. this will be dangerous and children will lose their thoughts in imaginaition.

The point is television uses advertising to bring success to a idee. which is mostly very lovely, coulourfull and kind made. 

it's an unecessary way to show unknown things
