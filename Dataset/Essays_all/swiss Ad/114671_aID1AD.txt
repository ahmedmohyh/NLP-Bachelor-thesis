In television there is a lot of advertising. From food to computers and everybody sees the ad. Each ad has its direction toward a specific group. But shold it be illigal to make ad directed toward young childern, aged two to five?
First of all I have to point out, that these young children do not even have the money to buy the advertised product. So the danger of young children buying products only because the have seen it on television, does not exist. The only thing they can do is asking their parents for buying the wanted product and throwing a tantrum, if they did not get it. So that is the worst thing, I can imagine, that could happen if a toddler sees an ad. So in that case I would like to say, that advertising directed toward young children, who are aged two to five, shold be allowed.
But on the other hand, children could be tempted to steal money from there parents in order to buy the product,which was mad ad for on the television. So in other words children could be criminalized through ad. But this has not only to do with the ad, it has something to do with education too.
