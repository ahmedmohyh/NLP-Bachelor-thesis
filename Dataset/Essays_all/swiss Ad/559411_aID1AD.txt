This little text is about my opinion about the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

I totally agree with this statement, because children at a very young age don`t know what is good or bad. They cannot decide what is better for them or worse for them. Even the law says that children under the age of 8 years cannot be punished from doing an illegal action, because they are to young to judge. The adverts show funny or happy thing in connection with the product in the advert. So children think that this product is good and they want to have it. However I think that this will never happend, because you cannot control what young children see. In the internet children can search and find what there want, because there are no age restrication. That is a big problem and a reason why television advertising directed towards young children will never be banned. Even on the streets and big cities are filled with adverts. Not all are directed towards young children but also the adverst for adults can influence young children.

All in all I demand the government to not allow television advertising directed towards young childern, because of the reason that childer at a very young age don`t have a judgment about things being good or bad.
