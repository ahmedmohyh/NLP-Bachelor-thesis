Since television was invented, people are attrracted by it and pay attention to it. Brands and advertising companies use that, to sell their things. Through television, people are confronted with adverts all the time. Especially young children, from age two to five, are drawn into the consumer world very fast. So should television advertising directed to young children be allowed?

Brands use young children to sell their products. Children from age two to five are a good target,as their are innocent and it's easy to sell them something. As long as the advertisement is held in bright colours with some pop music, the children will pay attention to it. Children will see a new toy in television once, and they will think about it all the time. In the first place, the advert reaches the child in front of the television, but indirectly it is also sold to the parents, grand-parents, aunts etc. who are willing buy it. In the best case, someone will buy the desired toy and the advertisement fulfilled its purpose.   

However, children get drawn in to the consumer world very quickly. Even if it works for brands and advertising companies, it's morally not correct to use naive children just to earn money. Children get materialistic way too early. 

In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, even if it is efficient for brands. Children shouldn't be confronted with materialistic thing and consumation in that young age - they should have other values.
