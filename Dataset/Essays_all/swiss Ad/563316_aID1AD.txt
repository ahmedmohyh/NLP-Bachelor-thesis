Towadays we have become used to seeing advertisements everywhere, especially on television, and as adults we are aware of their abilities to seduct one. But what about children? Considering their limited comprehesion of the objective of advertisments, should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?

First and foremost, a child does not have the ability to understand that advertising is just a means to sell a product and can therefore be strongly influenced by advertisements. Advertisments usually instill the notion that one cannot be content without a certain product, thus resulting in the child beig unhappy if it does not obtain it.

Another argument agaist television advertising is that children are being conditioned to aquiring a consumtionist's life style, where having a few toys is not enough and children keep wanting more of what they already have. It is this mind set that is destroying our environment and is being supported by advertisments directed towards children.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that the average child watches one hour of television a day, which prooves that especially advertisements on television can have a huge negative impact on our offspring.

All in all, television advertisments directed toward children can influence them strongly considering that they are easy to manipulate at such a young age. Advertisments can lead to a child's unhappiness and have a negetive impact on our environment.
