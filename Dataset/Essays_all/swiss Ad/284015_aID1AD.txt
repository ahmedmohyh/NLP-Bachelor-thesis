It depends on the time they took for watching TV, watching to long could cause you heatache or eyesache but the TV could also be a good way to learn a particular language. So the parents should have the choice what their children watch. A serial in a diffrent languages as the motherlanguage could help children later in their school days.
I'ts also important that the children have social contacts with other children by playing outside because the TV can be like a drug. Children don't know when they should finish with watching. The TV can isolate you in your room and you forgot to do other things like doing homework or other stuff. 
I think that bringing the children in a kita would be more hopefully, so they could also have social contacts in a diffrent language, so they can also speek the language they are going to learn.
