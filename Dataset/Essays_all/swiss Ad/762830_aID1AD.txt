I disagree, because if the television advertising shows products which are especially for young children (aged two to five) the young children know better if they would like to have those products.I mean why would a 30-year-old man would like to have a teddy that looks like a unicorn? But I'm more or less sure that his little girls would like to have one. So it makes sence to direct the television advertising for little children. 

In the end the parents have to buy everything, so I can't see a problem when television advertising is directed toward young children. And if parents don't like there children to see the advertising on the television they shouldn't let them see it. Those kids (aged two to five) are too young to watch TV without somebody who looks after them and who controls what they are watching. So again Idon't see the problem and if there is one, the problem is that the children watch too much TV and not that they could see television advertising. In my opinion children at this age shouldn't been showed television anyway.
 
I also can't see the reason why television advertising should be different to any other form of advertising. There's advertising everywhere. In the bus, at school, in the cinema, everywhere you can think about. So if you ask me, I would say that the discussion about this topic wastes time. It wastes my time and I can't see the sence anyway. I think there is nothing more to say about this.
