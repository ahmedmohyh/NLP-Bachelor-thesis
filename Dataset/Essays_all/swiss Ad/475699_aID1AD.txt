First it is important what kind of film or series deos a child watch. It`s better if a child (two to five years) watch films expecially for children. There are also some special series for young people, for example Dora. In the film Dora, there is a girl who speak quite slowly and explain every difficult word very easily. So if a child watches films with this topic it`s good to let them watch these films. But it`s not good and helpful, if a child watches actionfilms or horrorfilms. This can be 
rellay bad for a child. So it`s very important to find the correct subject for a young boy or girl so they aren`t afraid or feel bad afterwards.

A next important point to talk about is the time. How long should a child, aged two to five, whatch TV per day or week. I think its quite difficult, it depends on the special caracter of a child, but at least the parents should not allowed their children to whatch more 30 minutes TV each day! It`s more important for a child to play with friends or do some creative stuff, for example drawing. It could be possilbe, that to much TV could  change a childs caracter. When they can`t play outside with friends, maybe the woul not play outside if they are older. So they are often alone later. Then they could get into a depression or something like that. So if they watch 30 minutes or less each day and a series expesially created for children, it`s okey to let the children watch TV, but not longer because it could be bad or not helpful later when the child gets older.
