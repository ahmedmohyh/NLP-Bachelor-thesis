Nowadays, if you watch television, there are many adverts. Adverts for shampoo, cars, new technologies but also toys for children; even though the children can not even afford these things.

I think it is actually strange to advertise directly toward young children. First of all many of the children won't be able to even understand the advert. They just see something in the television like a toy and they want it. It is kind of manipulating. That is why advertising directed toward young children is actually pretty brilliant. Nevertheless, children aged two to five normally do not have money, hence their parents have to buy them toys; and I remember from my childhood that I was able to get many toys by just crying. And the interesting thing about it is, that I rarely played with the toys (which I saw in television) I received. So the television actually manipulated me too. The advert showed a kid playing with a toy. I somehow noticed that this kid was happy. And because it is in human nature to reach happiness, my brain connected the toy and the happiness. As a result I tried to get the toy too. However, adverts about toys which manipulate young children can also be useful for their parents. Maybe the parents are looking for a new toy they want to give the child as a present for birthday or christmas. In this point of view such an advert is pretty useful. Nevertheless, there are just few parents who watch these kind of tv channels (for kids), so they possibly won't even see the advert.

In conclusion, there should be more such adverts in tv channels for parents because I think that it is a better solution to show the parents what toys there are, because they have to buy them, than manipulate young children and give them the feeling of needing something they actually do not even need.
