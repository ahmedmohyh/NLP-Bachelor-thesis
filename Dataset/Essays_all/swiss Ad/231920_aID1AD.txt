Avertising
There has always been a great controversy about television advertising in todays society. Although advertising through television has declined due to the rise in the online market, Television advertising is still one of the biggest markets out there. But should there be an age limit to when companies should be allowed to advertise their products to kids?

Sales men know that the best ways into the wallets of parents are their children. It is such a big opportunity that some advertising companies focus on children only. But the advertisers go as far as promoting their products to even the youngest of the young. Television shows use the time between childrens shows to capture the attention of a kid to the newest toy and then the kids bother their parents with it. This is especially true when the kids are still too small to actively recognise an advertisment and maybe ignore it. Also Kids want anything that they can get as soon as they see it and it looks fun.

Although it might be an unfair tactic to show advertisments right when you know there are mostly kids watching, it still is an open market and parents have to decide when to let their kids watch TV and how to prepare their kids for the constant advertising that is going on in our world. Also this might be an opportunity for parents to show kids that they don't always get what they want and that they can't always have what they see on TV.

For my part I would not put an age limit on Television advertising. Mostly for the reason that a parent has to decide when their kid is old enough to watch TV and when it might be better to keep their children away from it and do something else.
