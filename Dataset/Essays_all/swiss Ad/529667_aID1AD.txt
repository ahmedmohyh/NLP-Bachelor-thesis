Television adevertising shouldn't take to young children. Because they don`t understand what it`s meaning. It`s the same when you go in e shopingcenter and somebody want to buy a little children anythink. I think also that is not very intelligent from the advertising maker because they don`t understand what the advertising mean. I think when people begin to sell little chilrden anythink is this stupid. I think that young children don`t watch alot of Tv. But the next generation is to play with an Iphone or an Ipad. And when you make ther an advertising little children touch this App or something like that and by it but they don`t understand that they spent money for that. Why you want to speak to her children they can`t spent money you must speak to her parents. But at the Iphone and Ipad is this possible. For me it`s ok when you make the advertising simple that all can understand the advertising but take not directly to young children. Because alot of the product are very bad for little children but the companys want to make money and that is not ok.
