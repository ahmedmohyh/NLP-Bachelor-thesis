The question is if it is allowed to bring people to think they have to buy what is in the advertise.  And is a company responsible for the impression on the people of her advertise? Advertisements can blow the mind of the consumers and influence them in her habitute buying some stuff. They also can bring the consumers to think they really have to buy this products. But is it the responsibility of the law to forbid that normal businness progress? Isn't it sad that people cannot stand against some few advertisement and need a law to protect themselves? Yes, it is sad because we cannot be able to stand against a stupid advertise and we buy their product just because it is told us in a short clip in the television or anywhere else. But now we talk about young children who do not have a strong mind like grown up people. If a young kid sees some advertises of cool stuff to play with, it is obviously that the kid wants to have this and do not stop until it gets it. But now that is the responsibility of the parents to be strong and either to forbid the kid to watch advertisements or television, which would be good anyway, or to be strong in don't buying them any stupid toy which they want to have. But it would be sad if the law will solve this problem and forbid the marketing progress from companies, because it is not that bad as i mentioned in the text here. It all depends of the amount of consumation. Some toys are good for the kids and why shouldn't they get a toy they want to? Right, they should get but not every single toy. If you get all what you want in your childhood you won't have it easy in your future life. So yes, it should stay allowed. It's a good exercise to be resistant against this influences.
