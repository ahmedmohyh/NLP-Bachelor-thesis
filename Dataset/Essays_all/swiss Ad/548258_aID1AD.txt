Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because they are not able to buy things themselves. Parents are verantwortlich and can deside wether they should buy the stuff or not. Maybe the children disagree with the opinion of their parents but it`s in charge of them to ceep their children calm and raise them right.
Advertising is more dangerous for adults. They normally have noone to set them rules and they fall more often for advertising. I think there should be more tv shows without that much advertising.
Advertising in breaks is often built up right for the persons who watch a show. For example: when you watch gntm, the advertising is about make up, zalando and skin care. When you watch a james bond movie, the advertising is about mens shavers and parfumes.
I would say that childrens advertising shouldn`t be banned because their parents can deside if they buy something.
