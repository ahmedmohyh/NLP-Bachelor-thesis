Due to the technological development  in the last decades, the possibilities and varieties of advertising have rapidly increased. Companies can target their customers more directly, more precisely and more efficently.
Out of all kinds of advertising, television advertising has been playing an important role in sale strategies since the very beginning of telvision.

The big advertising companies have not missed out the fact, that there are more and more children friendly channels on telvision. This opens a whole new world of opportunities for advertising: Know companies have not only the possibillity to influence their costumors to buy one of their products, they are now capable of 'raising' their future costumers.

Television advertising directed toward young children must be strictly controlled or even not allowed. 
Young children are very easily influenced: Their brain is still in the beginning process of development. In addition, they are not yet capable of recognising an advertisment, the tend to believe what they are told. 
This is why televison advertising has to be treated carefully: Children are very vulnerable to the companies' suggestions. And those companies have only one interest: to increase their sales, by any means possible. Telvision advertising is such an issue, because the children are often alone in front of the screen, with no adult to explain them what they are seeing. 
A very good example is the HappyMeal: McDonalds tricks young children to consume more fastfood by advertising their HappyMeal which includes litte toys. Little children are very liklely to fall for this trick, although the consumption of fast food has been proved to be unhealthy.

Finally, television advertising must be controlled or forbidden - we do not want our children to grow up a customer.
