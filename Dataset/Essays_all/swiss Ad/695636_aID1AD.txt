In this century the techniology is a good evelopment but also a risk. In this text I'll explain my opinion about the statement: 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.' 
Before the televison exsited children were often palying outside with nature things and with their friends or inside with plain games. But now, that the television exists they are more often inside and are watching television alone, or with friends instead of be creative and create their own games. Not olnly the creativity of the children is a problem, also the healthyness, you should eat a little bit dirt or bacterias that your body can protect himself from this things.
An other point is that if they are meeting less friends,when they can have 'fun' alone and so they have less relationships what is boring and depressing  in a long period of time. 
But watching television is also good, young children can learn about it and the parents have a little bit free time. But that shouldn't be the situation all the time. Because young children can also have fun with a pen, a rattle or with other plain things. 
So I think when partents make their children watching television is because they don't want to spend time with their children. Or don't want they disturb them.

When I was a child I liked to play outside and get durty in the mud. I always played with my older sister an my neighbours and later with my friends from school so I made a lot of relationships. When I look back, I would have regretted when I haven't been so much outside. But the children who are alsways watching television don't know, what they are missing. So I agree with the statement, but when they watch television once or twice a week it is okay. Later they can watch a little bit more.
