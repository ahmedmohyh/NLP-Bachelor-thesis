In my essy I write about the topic "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed." Television is a kind of entertainment. It has both positive and negative sides. So it could make people uncreative because if they lie the whole day on the sofa and watch tv shows they don't have a hobby and they don't do anything. They get lazy. At the worst case they could lose their social connections. On the other hand can television teach us because there are many documentary movies which show important stuff for example about our nature. But there are also some tv series which makes watchers addicted to them. And many movies show things which aren't realistic so the watcher could get a wrong picture of the reality especially children.

I'm agree with the statement that young children shouldn't be allowed to watch tv because they can't understand the documentary movies. So if they watch television they would watch some series which aren't teachfull. Instead of watching movies they should play with each other to make some social connections because that's important. If a child never watch a movie or a serie it doesn't know it and then it doesn't need it. It's a fault of the partents. The problem is that most of the parents aren't too busy to play or care about their children so they put them on the sofa and they are entertained. The result is that the parents haven't nothing to do. 

To finish my essay I would say that young children shouldn't watch television because there are so many things to entertain themselves.
