Television adverstising is a huge theme, that can have so many different sites. I think that children in the age of two can't really understand things that they hear or see. So in this case i would say it doesn't matter. It is another situation when the children are older. I think in the age of five years the children can be influence of television advertising. In this age children learn everyday new things and starts to find themselves as a persona. When they look much Tlevesion and also much advertising, i think they can influence from the bad things. But they can also influence from the good that's the other view.

It's important to find a balance in directed television advertising toward young children. As i said in the lines at the top for kids in the age of two doesn't matter or make sense because they doesn't really understand anything. But i think for a little bit older kids(five or older) could television advertising be very helpful. 

Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed in my opinien.
