Advertising in children`s television has always been a heated topic. The banning of advertising targeted at young children has been proposed by numerous parents. I think that a ban like this is a very bad idea and i will explain why.

First of all, the only people complaining about tv advertising targeted at young children are parents. Parents that allow a child to pester them into buying a new toy need to learn how to say no. Even if advertising was banned, the child would only have to see another child playing with a toy. Another important point is that childrens tv shows are funded with advertising money. Many well-made childrens shows would suffer a mayor loss in quality or disappear entirely. The shows that would remain in case of this ban would be filled with hidden advertising in form of product placement or other ways. But there is always another side to controversial things which I will write about in the following paragraph.

Children between 2 and 5 are very impressionable and thus vulnerable to advertising. They do not really know what they want yet which means an ad that tells them what they want is very succesful. The companies making these advertisments know this and fully use this vulnerability to their advantage, which is considered quite immoral. The children pester their parents incessantly until they buy them a toy they do not really want.

Even though there are many moral problems with advertising targeted at young children, I still think that banning it would not make anything better. The childrens shows would become absolutely terrible.I think that parents that cannot say no to their child sh just pay for a pay-per-view channel. These channels have no advertising at all!
