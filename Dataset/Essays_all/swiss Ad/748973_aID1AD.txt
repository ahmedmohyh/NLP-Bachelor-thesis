Advertising is used all over the globe as a means of marketing a product or service. Television advertising is an effective methode for companys to advertise their product or service and gain new customers. It is also a big income source for broadcasting channels. Television marketing in contrast to other marketing strategies is very effiectiv because it reaches people of ages due to the fact that many people watch television.

Everybody knows about televisoion ads that disrupt their late night movie or football match that their watching. This makes television advertising expected and catches noone of guard. Thus parents can switch off the television if they do not want their kids to see it.

Futhermore children do not take the decision to make a purchase. They can only influence heir parents decision. Then again it`s up to parents to decide if they want to get influenced or not.

However children of young age are very vunerable and should be protected from the aggressiveness of television advertising. If broadcasting channels had guidelines they should admid to it would be much easier to regulate everything.

In addition to that televsision shows aimed at young children should be a place of education and recreation. Advertising is definitely out of place here.

In my opinion television marketing directed towards young children should not be allowed. The governement needs to set up guidelies and regulate them. This would protect children when they are most vunerable and take stress off of the parents.
