The influence that advertising has on small children is huge. These kids don't know yet what they really want. So the advertising can easly manipulate the young persons. For example let's say it's Christmas time and a child does not really know what (s)he would like to have for Christmas. (S)he turns on the TV and watchs a show. The show gets interrupted by several comercials about toys or events. Now the  child would love to have a specific toy, that (s)he didn't want to have before the show, so (s)he just got influenced by the advertising.
Another point is, that the children just want to have more and more toys. This is not necessary. Suddenly the children don't just want to have that one toy, they also saw a cute teddy. It should be forbidden, so that we can protect our world a bit. And not raise our children more than necessary into this consume society that we already are.

But we can say that it is also useful that the children to see so many wonderful articles during the advertising. Because so they can learn to deal with money. Of course just in some way. For example they saw five amazing toys on TV, but their parents say, they are just allowed to have one. This concludes, that the kids have to make priorities. This may help them in the future. 
We also have to think about the channel. we don't really know if the channels still could afford famous movies without some advertising. And of course knowbody wants that, so we just can't afford to bang advertising.
I personally think that there is no particular reason to forbid advertising for little children. I also grew up with advertising and I still know my limits.
