A simple question that has a difficulte and complicate answer. I tend toward the answer that such advetising is extremely harmful for young children.
First of all should a child with that age not even be allowed to watch television. Because watching television at that age it is dangerous for the development of the language and the logical thinking of a child (as a german study showed). The results which were published were extremely frightening. The study showed that children who watched television more than half an hour were more likely to drop out of school and only ten percent of these kids went to universtity whereas children who did not watch television at all (between the age two to five) had a much bigger chance to make it to university. So watching commercials on TV at that age is automaticly harmful because watching ads includes obviously watching TV.
A reason much more important why advetsing toward children should be forbidden is that young children are more likely to be influenced by ads. These adverstisments are often very loud and colourful which implifies the need to buy the adverted thing. A child sees these kind of ads and has automaticly the need to get one of those things. So you can say that children get influenced easily by these ads. The decision to want something is made by the concernes which produce the adverted thing, because right at that monent as the child sees the ad it feels the need to get one of the things. This circumstance is improved by the sound of the ad. The sound, which is often the voice of a man with a deep and loud voice, is also a huge influence because of phrases like: ,,If you want to be cool, get the superblaser 1000" (this serves as an example). So it is vital to say that sdvertising toward young children should be forbidden and sanctioned.
