In my opinion the television advertising is a probelm for many TV-watchers and especially bad for teenagers or childrens. Young children are very influental and don`t understand the target of the advertising. I think young children should learn important and useful things and not be used to earn money. But it`s impossible to forbid the advertising, because the TV companies need the advertising to earn money. It`s also impossible for the TV company to control who is watching their programs. I think the parents of the children have to have an eye on their children and what they are watching. 
The parents should be more interessed in what their children do in their freetime. I think there should be some TV chanels for young children without advertising, because very young people are too influental. The products placements are very complex and try the customer to buy a product. Young childrens are also used for this reason. Certainly they couldn`t buy the things they want by them selfe, but the make their parents to spend money for it. The children may only realise how they were influentet years later, when they are adults or have their own children. In my opinion we have to find a way, which is okay for the TV companies, the parents and the children. But it`s clear everyone have to work.
