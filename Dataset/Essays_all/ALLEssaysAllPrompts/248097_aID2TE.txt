Teachers and schools are different in every country. In some countries, for example Switzerland, the school system is very good. Most of the people in Switzerland care about their education and the teachers are very well educated. But the important part is, how the teacher plans his lessons and how he treats his students.
In my opinion, teachers should get along with their students. They should at least show some respect for them by really wanting them to learn more and in exchange, the students should show their teachers respect by studying. Of course not all students have the same interests and there are always subjects that a student doesn't like. But if the teacher cares about his students and lets them feel that, the students are more likely to study and be interested in getting good grades, even if it's maybe not their favorite subject. On the other hand, if a teacher doesn't care enough about his students and doesn't show them respect, the students are not interested in learning more either and are more likely to get bad grades, if they don't like the subject. 
It is also very important that the teacher knows what he's talking about, because if not, the students are not able to learn it properly. In my opinion, it is most important, that a teacher really likes what he does and that he wants the students to like it too. Because only that way, a teacher can teach his students in an interesting way, which makes the whole subject more popular for them. 
Every student experiences different types of teachers, some that he might like and some that he might not like at all. But like this, they learn more about themselves and the teachers, what he is really interested in, how it is best for him to study or maybe he wants to be a teacher someday and learns, what students like and what they don't like.
