In this world, in which we live today, we are influenced by many things. Other people influence us, our work has an influence on us and all the little things like television can have a bigger influence, than we think they have. But through our experience, we mostly can know when something has a bad influence on us. Normally, we don't believe erverything and everyone.

Young children can't have the konwledge, which adults have .They believe always everything you tell them. Young children don't have the experience to know what is wrong and what is true when they see things, for exmaple in the televiosn advertising. The children are influenced by adults, the environement and things like televison. They don't see when something is not a good thing, they always try to act like that, what they see. So when children see a pretty princess in television, they want to be a pretty princess too. When they see a man with a gun, they want to have a gun too. It's a pretty dangerous thing. Young children are too naive to know the differnce between the real life and televison or fantasy.

I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. But on the other hand it's pretty difficult to stop that. Things like these are everywhere and we can't stop all of these. I think the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced.
