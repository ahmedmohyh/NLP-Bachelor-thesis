A good education needs good teachers. But what does that mean. Some people think it is important, that a teacher has good knowledge of the subject, that he is teaching. Others might have the opinion that the teacher's ability to relate with the students is essential. What is more important? An excellent knowledge or the ability to relate with the students.

First of all, a teacher has to be able to relate with his students, because students show more interest when their teacher seems sympathetic. Pupils are more likely to ask questions when they know, that the teacher gives a serious and gentil answer. Sometimes when sudent do not like the teacher they really do not have the motivation to go to class.

On the other hand, a solid knowledge is essential for a teacher, because he has to be able to explain the subject . He also needs to create exercises and solve questions. And for that aan amazing knowledge is not refusable. It would be fairly hard to learn something when you have a good relation woth your teacher, but he has absolutely no knowledge.

In my opinion, both of those aspects are no disadvantages, but I think that an excellent knowledge is more important, than the ability to relate with the students. I believe that the level of the knowledge defines how much you learn and I think that the relation with the pupils defines their interst and their fun. To me it is more important to learn something, than having fun during the lessons. The ability to relate with the students is an advantage, but a good knowledge is essential.
