First and foremost this essay is about advertising directed toward young children.
First there is no big problem with advertisment for young children if they are for them. If the advertisment is about toys or learning it is okay as long as is connected with their age. There should not be advertisements about alcohol or some thing like that. But in contrast young children are easy to manipulate so the companiese use this to sell more products which is really bad. 
Although advertisement has some freedom at TV, there should be a rule against advertising directed toward young children, because not all of them understand what is said or ment in this advertisment in such a young age. 
In conclusion for companies which sell toys or candy it is a great opportunity to sell more, but i believe it is wrong if you do this. I think it is against our moral these days. I can not support such advertising and although I said in the biginning there is no big problem there is still a problem. You can not forbid every single advertisement, because somehow the channel need some money, but I suppose the advertisement shown to children in this young age should be more about how they can be creativ and that learning can be fun. Something like this can at least help the children when they grow up. As long as the advertisement helps the children in their future I believe it is okay to direct them toward young children.
