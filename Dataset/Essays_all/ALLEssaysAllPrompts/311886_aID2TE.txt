Whether you like or understand a subject is often related to the teacher who teaches you in that subject. But what exactly does make a good teacher? Why are some considered better than others? A teacher has to be an expert at their subject while also being able to deal with students. But is one of the two qualities more important?

Good teachers have to know a lot about their subject. We don't want them to teach us anything wrong and they ought to have the knowledge to explain something in detail. Which brings me to my next point: they have to be able to explain their subject. No one cares if you are good at something if you can't show it or, in this case, explain it. In order to explain something you need to know who you're talking to which means that they have to know how to talk to students and therefore explain things to them. This comes with good chemistry and a sense of relatability. They have to know where students are coming from in order to teach them correctly. They can't expect the students to be experts like them. 

What I'm trying to say is that both qualities are required for a good teacher since everything in life is about balance. However, if I had to choose between the two I would say that the ability to relate is more important. Of course I don't want the teacher to be clueless, but as I said previously, no one cares how good the teacher is at their subject if they can't explain it to the students.
