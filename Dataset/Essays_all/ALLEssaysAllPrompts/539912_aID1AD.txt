Nowadays we live in a world where publiciti has a enormous influence at us. We have to protect our children in every situation. As an adult you can build your own opinion, but as a child between two and five years old this is not possible. So do we have to protect our children from televison advertising?

On the one hand, this should not be allowed, because we would manipulate our children. In this age you have to learn to build your own opinion. In my point of  view young children would just think what they hear and do not think about it. They would just accept it. As well in publiciti they just tell us the good thing and show us that everything is perfect. This would not be fair and would not help our children for their future working life. 

On the other hand, we should let decide our children if they want to believe in that or not. I do not think that televison advertistment would harm the children. Today we live in a world where everyone has a mobilephone or a computer. So we would just prepare our children for the future and show them that the media is a big part of our life. Little kids are better when they see something than hear it. So with advertisment on the televison children would remember it better and would learn as well something. 

To sum up, I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. I agree with this statement because I think that in this age they should learn to have their own opinion and are to young to be influenced by the media. Kids should enjoy their growing up and they should not be attacted by the media. This are all reasons why I am against televison advertising toward our children. Do not let the media take so a big part of our life, just let the children be young kids.
