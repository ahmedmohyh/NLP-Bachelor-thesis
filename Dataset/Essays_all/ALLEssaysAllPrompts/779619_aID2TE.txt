The subject is, if the relationship between teacher and students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt.
At first I think it is an important part, that the teacher should know very well about their subject, because students are more willing to ask the teacher diffiuclt questions, or questions the students are interested in, even if it isn't a part of the school programm. Also I affirm that teacher would be more happy or more encouraged to teach the students. I mean if I would know very well about a subect, I would tell them everything and respond them all the questions they have. 
On the other hand I think, teachers are more capable to relate well with students than teaching well about a subject. Because often teachers are idols for some of the students and they look up to them. I mean a big part of students life, they spent at school with teachers, I suppose also that teachers somehow raise the students up. For instance when the teacher isn't good at teaching and has no clue what he is talking about and also lost the joy of teaching the students, the students aren't interested anymore. Because why should tehy be enjoying the lesson, when even the teacher has no interest. The students automatically see that teacher as a fool and for now on they aren't very excited to go to class of teacher.
But if the teacher interacts with the students, if he is interested in what he is teaching and values that the students get the stoff, they were taught, students see him more friendly. The students don't seem anymore tired og going to school, because they know exactly today we have this teacher and he is very cool, it is going to be a good school day. 

I think the ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject, because teachers can influnce students quickly and teachers are there to lead us young people on our rigth way and help us tp find the subjects , we are most interested in.
