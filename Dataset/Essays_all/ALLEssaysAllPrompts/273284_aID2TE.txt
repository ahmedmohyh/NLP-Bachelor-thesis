I totally agree with this statement. I think that whenever a teacher has a good relationship to his students, they are automatically more intersted in learning. That means, when a teacher is full of enthusiasm and motivation, studendts are noticing that the teacher really wants to teach and that he likes his job. This enthusiasm gets then easily transferred to the students and their whole learning habits and experience can change. 
I often hear adults talking about some bad school experiences they have made and it usually is about a teacher they did not like at all. As I said it can change somebody`s view about school completely. Either to the better or the worse.

On the other hand, there are many people who say, that school is all about learning and that it has nothing to do with how well the teacher realtes with his students. I admitt, that the importance of having a good realtionship with his teacher, varies between the different subjects. For example in Biology or in Chemistry it is extremely important that the teacher has excellent knowledge of what he is teaching. For me it doesn`t really matter if I like the teacher that much. But for example in French or Maths, which I don`t like either of the subjects, it is more important for mw to realte well with my teacher, because if I don`t like the teacher and the subject it makes it almost impossible to study at home or to pay attention in class.

To sum it all up, it is really important how well teacher and student realte with each other.
