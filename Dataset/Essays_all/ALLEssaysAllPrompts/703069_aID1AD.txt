Young children often watch television nowadays. Because of that, there are more and more advertisements directed to children. But to what extent can we support advertisements directed to our children, since it influences them, withour them noticing?

In our modern world there is no way to fully live without advertisements. Sure enough, on television a great part of our advertisements are shown. However even if we go to a supermarket or just outside for a walk, we are exposed to many different kinds of advertisements. A huge part of it is directed to young children as well. Why should we ban television advertising directed to young children, while still accepting all the other forms of advertisements directed to our children? Another argument that television advertising directed to young children should not be forbidden is the fact, that once children hit a certain age, they will be exposed to advertisements anyways. So maybe, it's better for them to learn how to deal with it from a very young age.

On the other hand, young children most often don't understand, that not everything on television is true, which isn't a huge problem if they're watching a childrens show, but advertisements use that innocence, to make them believe that they need a certain product. In that way, television advertising influences our children badly, without them noticing. Because of that, television advertising is a disgusting way to make money from children who don't understand what's going on.

In conclusion, it is impossible to ban all advertisements directed to young children, however, not allowing television advertising directed to young children would be a start, at least.
