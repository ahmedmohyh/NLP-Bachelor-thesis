It´s not clearly to say which kind of teacher is the best. You need excellent knowledge of the subject as well as ability to relate well with students. But is something more importent than the other? For this it gives some pros and cons. 
The first point is, you need definetly excellent knowledge of the subject because if you haven´t it, you even can´t teach the students so they get big problems when they would do their final exams. When the students can´t learn some stuff from the teacher it´s not importent how well the teacher relate with them.
 At the other side it´s not good, if the teacher can´t handel the students and so can´t tell them the informations. A teacher should has something like a realationship to the students. For exemple, if the teacher and stundets are both happy and relaxed in the lessons, it´s easier to listen and be consetred.
So because of that maybe have more fun to learn something and when the teacher can´t give them enough informations, because his knowledges aren´t very ecellent, the stundets could look on websides in the internet and learn for themselves.
After this points of view I thing that I agree with this statement. In ever nearly ever point the teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Maybe the second part of the statement is also importent like the first
