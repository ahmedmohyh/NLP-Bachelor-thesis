I partly agree with the following statement because on the one hand I think that it is important for stundents to have a good relationship with the teacher but on the otherhand a student is at school to have a good knowledge in every subject. But obveously it is more important for the stundents future to have knowledge in every subjects. If you are at an university it isn`t interesting for the teacher if the teacher before related well with the stundents its interesting for him if the students know what they are talking about. In my opinion the student need an intersting lesson and a well known teacher because without an interesting lesson the student cant remind what was mentioned and forgot the information after a week. but otherwise if the teacher have no knowledge in his own subject the student have no knowledge to remember or forgot.
 the conclusion is that you cant agree or disagree with the statement because you need both abilities to be a good teacher an to motivate your students in learning and understanding. teacher have different things to teach their students, not only knowledge, they also have to learn to respect others an this isn`t incommond with a good relation with the teacher.
