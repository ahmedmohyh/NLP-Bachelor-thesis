Everywhere we have advertisings. A few people say, that advertising are a bad thing and lay to often. But not every advertising are the same like the other, we have they in television, newspapers, magazines or in shops. So young people maybe are more influenced then older. Should it not be allowed to directe television advertising toward young children?

On one hand young children haven't much money so when they see something in a TV-Show they want buy it and after that the children have no money. These people can't learn how to deal with money and later when they are grown-up they often have financial problems. A other problem are also that the products in the television often aren't healthy for the kids. For example cereals with so much diffrent tastes, I think you have never seen a advertising from a potato or a tomato.

On the other hand when children grow up they will confronted with all this things. When they already knew everything in this direction they are less influenced. It would be also really hard to forbite this. 

I think advertising isn't something realy bad how many people say, but it could be dangerous for some. Children betwenn the age two-five don't realize this so much. So I think this can be allowed for the children. If parent won't this then their children shoudn't watch too much TV.
