Knowledge is power, it is a saying. One cannot teach a subject one does not know anything about. So to become a teacher will have to study the topics you want to teach to qualify for a job. But is knowledge really all a teacher needs to have to be a good teacher? Is a teacher really as good as his knowledge of the subject he is teaching? Does it matter how well he relates with his students?

Obviously it does not make any sense to let someone teach a subject he has no clue of. On the other hand if a teacher has excellent knowledge of a subject but none of the students listen to him because they do not like him it does not make any difference wether he has excellent or no knowledge of the subject. His knowledge is wasted. So knowledge cannot be the only criterium for a teacher. Even though it is still an important one as there is no gain if a teacher has no knowledge of the subject and cannot answer any questions. Another criterium for a teacher is how well he relates to his students because if they get along well the students will pay more respect to him and will listen. But even if a teacher has knowledge of the subject and can relate well with the students it does not make im a good teeacher. Because no matter if he can answer all the questions and al the students listen there is still no learning effect if he cannot pass on his knowledge in a way the students understand it. Because often teachers hve excellent knowledge but they are not able to pass it on.

I personally think that both knowledge and ability to relate well with students are very important qualities for a teacher but not the most important ones. i think what is most important is that a teacher can reach out to students and really pass on his knowledge in a memorable way. otherwise knowledge is of no power and wasted.
