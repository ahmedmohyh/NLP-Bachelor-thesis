With all the mobilephones, tablets and computers you can watch television everywhere and evertime you want. Especially young children are likely to watch more and more televison as their parents often work full time and don't have time to play with their children. But with all the television there is also television advertising. It's something no one really likes, but you can't watch television without seeing a television advertising. Often there are always the same television advertisings and without knowing the advertising is saved in your mind. Young children tend more to save a television advertinsing in their mind, if there is a cool toy or something they would like to have. So if the children go shopping with their parents and they see this really cool toy from the televison advertising they want to have it. With adults it works the same but probably instead of a toy it's a new computer, a new hair curler or a caffemachine and when we see this new product in a shop, the chance that we will buy it is higher when we have seen the television advertising. I think this is like brain wash but thats how everything works, the companys need a way to present their new products and without television advertising the television company couldn't survive. I really don't like all these television advertisings and I also just bought something because I have seen it in the television, but thats just how our society works.
