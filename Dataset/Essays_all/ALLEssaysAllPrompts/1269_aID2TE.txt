My statement is about the question if the relation between teacher and students is more important as the stuff the teacher taught in his subject.

 I think this statement tells the truth because it is less important to understand the stuff which is been taught then the good relation between yourself and your teacher because if there is a good relation you can ask if there are any problems or things you really dont understand.Also you could be excited about the next lesson because you like your teacher and you dont have to get in bad mood and dont like to go to this lesson just because you dont like that teacher. Even if there are problems with the understanding because of the stuff you wouldnt like to ask for help if there isnt a good relation between the student and the teacher.This could lead to a new problem because if you dont understand the stuff or the topic and if you dont ask for help you could easely get out of the whole topic and if that happens you could maybe return the class or you have to learn so often and heavy that everything is running out and you get totally off.

 So its really important to keep a good relation and also to follow the stuff your teacher tries to bring you by heart because its important for your later life future.

My ending point is that i think this statement tells the truth because a good relation between the students and the teacher lead to a good understanding of the stuff the teacher taughts, this leads to good grades, to a good cetificate at school ending and in the future for a good and well payed job.And a good and well payed job is the most important thing in life.
