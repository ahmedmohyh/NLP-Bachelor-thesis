In the following text I will discuss the question, if it´s more important that a teacher relate well with students or that he or she has an excellent knowledge.

It is much easier when the teacher relate well with students because the atmosphere is much better and both have more fun in class. So the students are more motivated and and say more in class and recieve better marks.
But if the teacher is bad in his or her job because of a bad knowledge, the students won´t learn that much and the teacher can´t correct them and so they have a not very well education and have problems, when they write their A-Level. They like the teacher because they have fun every lesson but in their following life and before, when they write their A-Level, they realise that they have problems because they did not learn it at school.
It is bad too if the teacher has the best knowledge but he can´t explain the students what is he talking about and the students have to learn it themselves.
Moreover it could be very expensive if the teacher is bad because they need someone outside from the school, who will explain it to them and that would be very expensive.
Otherwise if the students hate their teacher and the teacher hates them because for example the students don´t understand what the teacher is talking about and the the teacher don´t know how he could explain it in an other way, both are very frustated and don´t want to go to school and work with each other.

I think the best thing is of course, when the teacher has a good knowledge and relate well with students. But this not happen all the time so I think it is better when the teacher has an excellent knowledge.
