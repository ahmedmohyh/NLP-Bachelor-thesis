A teachers ability to relate with students

A teacher should of course be able to handle students so that there is a confortable atmosphere in the classroom. But is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than his knowledge of the subject?

It is better for the learning atmosphere, if the teacher relates well with the students because their attention will increase if they like the teacher and the way he teaches. It also helps te class spirit if the teacher is chilled and helps them whereever he is able to.

But if a teacher does not have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, then a clown could also take over his lessons. Nothing is more important in higher school-levels, than a professional teacher. If a teacher does not have an excellent knowledge, then it is hardly imaginable that this teacher still relates well with students.

Personally me, I know teachers myself that are not having an excellent knowledge and their lessons are boring. In my opinion a teacher must only relate as good with students to create a concentrated learning-atmosphere. It is more important that he comes across with his excellent knowlege.
