Advertising 

Imagine your child comes walking up to you just to ask you if you can buy him this really cool toy he saw in the TV. At the moment it is allowed to make advertisment towards any kind of age. But if we prohibit TV advertising towards young children (aged two to five), this situation won't happen to you too. 

First it must be said that children younger tahn six shoudlnt be watching TV anyways. Moreover, that more advertisment boosts our economy, butyou have to keep in mind that it only brings more money to the toy companies and to be honest do we really wanna help them even more? In addition the advertisments help the children to learn to misstrust, but there youhave to think if this really is what we want, a world lead by misstrust and lies. 

However, i think that children are to young to decide for themselves if the things they see in the TV are true or false. Furthermore it indeed is very easy to influence a children i mean if you teach them a new word they will constantly repeat it and share it with their friends. Exactly the same happens if children see something in the TV. They will go to their friends and tell them about the great toys they saw in the TV  therefore they also make advertisment towards their young friends and the advertisment will even influence more young children to the worse. Children also want to buy whatever they see and alot of parents struggle with the earlier described situation which in my opinion is not necessairy to happen to them in there allday life.

In conclusion there are alot of strong arguments but some where better than otherrs. For example that the children annoy their paretns with unimportnt things. Therefore I think you shoudln't show advertisment towards young children.
