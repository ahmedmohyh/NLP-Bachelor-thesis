Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not?!

In my oppinion I think the use of the television or even other electonic items should be forbidden for young children who are under the age of five.
I suppose that young children, in the age of their growing, can easily influenced by sozial media and can gret an incorrect picture of life and beauty.
When you grow up which the influence of the television or the Ipad or even when you are five and you already have a mobilephone than young children are not able to use and understand simple things. For example when I was working on a pony farm I met a young girl who was maby three or four and I was upset when I sam that she was looking in a book and she could not turn the pages, because she used to read on her Ipad and she could not swich the pages over with her hands. 

On the other hand, when you grow up with the experiance of social media and co. You will grow up earlyer than I did. You learn how to life with social preassure in your young life and you learn how to handle it. When you are only watching intelligent television series and informative documentarys than you can learn important things who might help you in your adult life.

In conclusion I belive the influence of the Internet is so based in our world that young parents have no chance to hide it from their children but it is important to protect the adventure of growing up and let our children enjoy a well, pleased and protected childhood without the influence of electonic stuff as the television.
