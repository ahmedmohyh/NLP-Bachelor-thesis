The television is in our community an important topic. Everybody get informed about the news in the world and also everybody get entertaind.
But the television has also negativ aspects. Thats the reason why the topic of my essay deals with the pros and cons of the television. The statemet is if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First I will name the pros of television advertising directed toward young children.
In the Tv are many Tv shows and movies where kids learn something, for example counting ore reading. They learn this important things indirect so they don´t realise it. 
Another pro argument is that watching Tv could be an relaxing part of the day for the kids. 
On the other side, there are also negativ aspects. 
On the Tv are also many shows and movies that aren´t good for young children. Sometimes they use words that children don´t have to say. 
Another contra argument of tlevision advertising directed toward young children is that some kids sit a long part of the day in front of the Tv and don´t go out of the house and play with other kids. 
In my point of view children have to be allowed watching Tv, but there have to be some rules. 
One rule has to be that the childrens only watch special TV shows and movies, that are only for children. Another rule has to be that they only watch Tv in the evening before they go to bed, so they go outside with friends in the other part of the day.
