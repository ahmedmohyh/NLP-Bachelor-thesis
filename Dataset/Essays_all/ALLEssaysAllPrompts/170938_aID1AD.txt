Today the television advertising is directed to all people, no matter how old they are. Those advertisings have a big influence on what we buy or what we wish to have. I remember as I was a child I used love the things which were presented in the television because they seemed extremely magical. But when you finally got them, they're less special.
One downside of television avertising toward joung children is that, as soon as they see all those cool toys, they start to want more and more, which their parents maybe can't afford and nor the children neither the adults are happy with heir situation. Another contra is that the toys always look more special in the television advertising than they are in real. I remember to be very sad when I realised that it's not the same as it is in the television. For example as I wished for a farm from playmobile, the animals weren't that realistic as they were in the advertising and when you're a child you expect exactly the same because you don't have this knowledge which is essential. 
A big disatvantage is that there are also advertisings for weapons which are called NERF and even though it's only a toy it can cause harm. 
For sure there are also some advantages like the promotion of the firms. Their products are better sold and their income is highly raised. Anyway the whole awareness to the firms which present their things in the television is raised. The second positive point about television advertising directed toward young children is that they know better what to wish for and it's easier for their family to find a good present for their birthday or for christmas. 
To come to a conclusion, I think that television advertising shouldn't be prohibited because the fims have to promote their products to make money but it should be presented more realistic.
