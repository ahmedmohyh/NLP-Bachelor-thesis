Two days ago i was sitting in class and was listening to my math teacher. He knows everything about math, really everything. While he was talking about the new subject, i wasn't paying attention to him. I was talking with my neighbour. Then I heard a loud voice saying: ''Devran!''. I was shocked, he continued: take your things and leave the room. He was beeing a dickhead to me. I mean he could have used other words and he could have talked in another temprature. So I left the room and  asked myself: Is it more important as a teacher to have a good relationship with his students than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing thaught? 

First of all a teacher has to know almost everything about the subject which he is teaching the student because it's his job. 

Not only parents have to teach their kids how the life works also the teacher plays a big part in the life of a student. A student can learn from a teacher things which are really necessary in life.
