I think a teachter must have excellent knowledge of the subject. So I disagree most in this statement. But in the primary level a teacher may also be a little bit less educated. Because the themes are not so hard than in the secondary level. Also the importance of the education is less important and necesassary for the kids. The kids in the primary school are not so focused on their future like the students in secondray level. Thats the reason why I think that teachers must have an excellent knowledge of the subject. In primary school it is well that a teacher have a good ability to relate well with students. But I also agree a piece with this statement because a mix of both is important. When a teacher have good abilities and he has a good knowledge of this subject than the teacher is like a "dreamteacher". The students go also lovlier to school and they could have a little bit more pleasure in school than when the teacher have bad abilities or a bad knowledge of the subject. And when the teacher have bad abilities than maybe the little kids are afraid of him. Also we could say that a teacher must have a mix of both aspects. So the students like to go to school and have pleasure with the teacher. When the teacher is very lovely they could speak about the own personal problems with the teacher. The teacher must have a good education which is fixed on the students. When the teacher have a less knowledge of the subject and he tells it to the students then the students take this with them and maybe thats something false. And I think it's very important that the students learn at the beginning until the end true stuff so that they could connect it and take it with them into the future. So they could build up them and have a good chance for education.
