A teacher is someone who teachs students so everybody think it is most important that the teacher knows everything in his topic. But is this really the most important thing of a teacher?
It is important because he has do ive his knowledge to the students, so he has to know much. If students ask some questions they would like to have an answer. That is only possible if the teacher knows the answer. 
At the other point it is also important that the teacher is friendly, kind and well to students. Especially when a student has problems so the student has the chance to talk with the teacher about it and the teacher can hopefully help the student. When teachers are mean oder unfriendly the students do not like them and maybe the teachers lesson so they do not concentrate and do not learn anything. It is more fun and students learn much more when the teacher has a positive athmosphere and is friendly.
So it is important to have both sides. When the teacher is unfriendy but knows much, the students do not like the lessons and do not work but when the teacher is very friendly but does not high qualitiey, students neather learn something.
I think it is good to have both qualities as a teacher but I like more the theachers who are well to the students.
