The following text is an essay about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.".
On the positive side of advertising stands the fact that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys, candy, and so on. Tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing. In the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy. 
On the negative side stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in TV. So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because they´ll bag for it until they get what they want. In the first time that does not sound really bad in any way, but if you really think about it, it is. Because the first years of a humans life are probably the most important ones. We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy. Out of this facts are resulting a lot of problems, like people which think they always get what they want. And people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food, and then getting really obese and fat.
All in all I don´t really agree or disagree with the statement. I think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled. 
And that in a way that they won´t get affected by them in the wrong way, but still learn how to handle them; because they will always face comercials in their lifes.
