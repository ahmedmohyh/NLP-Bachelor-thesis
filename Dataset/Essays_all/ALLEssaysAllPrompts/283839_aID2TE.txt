I do not agree with this statement. First and important of all the jop of a teacher is to teach his students a lot of things and explain the supjects well. Of course it is important too that the teacher can relate with students. But it gets less important from time to time. For example in kindergarden the teacher has to create a good conection with his pupils so that they have fun. In primary school too because it gets easyer to understand some subjects if teachers can relate with his students. In high school teachers are mostly more distant to his students. A lot of high school teachers just try to teach his subject rather than be cool with his students. And in college most teachers do not even know the name of all their students. 
Second of all to become a teacher you have to study. So a teacher has to have knowledge of the subject he teaches. What can a teacher do if he can relate to his students but does not know anything he talks about? Nothing. The only thing is, that all students love him at the beginning because he does not give homework and it is easy until they notice that they did not learn anything. 
The statement is true for me if you talk about primary teachers. Because they teach every subject and its easy to learn what they have to teach. In that case its very importand to relate to yur students.
I would personaly say that the statement is absolutely false. But if a teacher can do both that would be the best for everybody.
