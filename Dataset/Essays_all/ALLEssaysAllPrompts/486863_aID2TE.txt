No, it isn't.

During our time as students, we get to know many different teachers. Some of them are likeable, others are more difficult to handle. Some know there subject excellently, others don't. 
As a student, I've always prefered the kind of teachers who not just know their subject but mastered the art of becoming a walking dicitionary, a stronghold of knwoledge. I'm not going to school to have a good time with friends, I want to learn. Well, one could argue that you learn faster if you get on well with your teacher, but I don't think so. I have often experienced that the excellent knowledge of a subject often comes together with a passion for it. Even if your teacher is as unlikeable as it gets, you won't mind if you just share a tiny bit of that very same subject. You will rather see the oppurtunity to learn than focus on the probable lack of your teacher's social skills.
Therefore:

No, it isn't.

Imagine the contrary: You really get on well with your teacher, you might even like him or her. But at the end of the day, what it all comes down to is what a teacher can teach you. In addition, if you know your subject not in depth, you aren't passioned about it. Sounds hard, but it's true: Excellence is the natural follow on of passion. 
So even if it might be easier to learn with a easy-going teacher, he will never be able to answer your questions as good and in depth as an excellent teacher. There will be this certain point when you ask your teacher a question, perhaps about something about his subjed that was not treated in scholl and he wont be able to answer it.

No, I prefer an excellent teacher!
