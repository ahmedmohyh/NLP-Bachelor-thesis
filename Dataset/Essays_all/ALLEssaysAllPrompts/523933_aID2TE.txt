A good teacher must have two abilties:
At first he must know something about the subjekt he teachs, that is clear, otherwise he can not teach it. But the really question is how much he must know. Is it enough to just know the basics, the things that he must teach his students, or must he also know a lot of details and have a fascination for his subjekt? The answer to this question isn't simple.
The second ability is to interact with his students, to keep the contact with them. Imagine a teacher that is speaking, but nobody is listening. He could know everything and tell it to his students, but if his words doesnt reach them, it is useless. It is easier to listen to somebody who you like, so it can help a teacher to relate well with his students, so he can get the attention. There is another way to reach his students, and this is respect. Making clear rules, holding the distance between him and the students and respect them to is a good way to achieve this respect. If the students accept that the teacher is in the stronger position, they will listening to him.
Which of this abilities, good interacting with the students or excellent knowledge is more important. I think both are essential to be a good teacher, and students wouldn't accept a teacher who doesn't what he is talking about. So for me this statement isn't true because a teacher can also reach respectwithout being the best frien 
Until I wrote just what makes a teacher a good teacher
