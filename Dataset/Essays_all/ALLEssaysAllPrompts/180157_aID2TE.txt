To answer this question we have to know what the aim of the school, of the students and of the teacher is. Because if the school and the stundents want the teacher to be competent to teach the specific subject he is asked to teach, he can not expect that the advantages of being able to relate well with the students will outweigh the fact that he has not the abilities the school wants for their students. Also when the teacher for example knows that some stundents just really can not learn from somebody who can not relate to them he has to react accordingly. 
Other criteria to decide which feature is more important could be the level of the lessons being held. So if a kindergarten needs a teacher for the art lessons his knowledge of the subject is more likely to be less important then his ability to relate to the kids. But at an university for example it is the other way round. At my school we have both kinds of teachers. In my case i score better grades in the subject in which we have a relatable teacher than in the subject where the  teacher does not even care about the volume of the class, she just continues the lesson altough anybody can barely hear her. I think when a teacher can really relate to the students then they start to like the teacher and when they like the teacher they pay attention to what he says. But if what he says doesn't make any sense or if the stundents notice that the teacher has no idea about the topic they will not pay attention anymore so the ability of the teacher to relate doesn't contribute to the quality of the lesson. 
In conclusion I can say that a teacher's ability to relate well with students can be more important for some schools and students than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. BUT the teacher still has to know significanltly more than the students about the topic.
