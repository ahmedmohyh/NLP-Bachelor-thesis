Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed? First of all, it helps the children to understand the world in a funny way. On the other hand, they aren't playing on the outside while they are watching television. Therefore, they are also missing the body movement while lying on the couch. Television can help in education, but only as long as it isn't too much!

Children are learning the most when they are having fun or are interested in something. While playing with their siblings or watching their favourite show, they are having fun and therefore learning something new. Most television advertising for young children are made for this sole reason - the educate the children.

But while they are watching TV and learning something about the colours, they are missing the trees and flowers outside. The connection to the green parts of the world is missing and that at a point in time where this could be humanity's downfall. When the little ones aren't interested in mother earth, who protects it then from global warming?

Not only are they missing a huge part of nature and memories. It is also not good for the body, when there is no movement in the childhood. The muscles don't build up and also metabolism is suffering. Also, they won't play soccer in the neighbours garden and probably won't be as interested in sports as the older generations where sports was the only free time activity.

In the end I think this subject isn't as black and white as it might seems. Yes, I think children are learnig a lot during watching TV and they like to learn something this way. On the other hand, you musn't underestimate the huge part nature and sport plays in all our lifes. Best would be, if parents and siblings are doing some advertising together in the garden which is fun, so the role of the television isn't needed any longer.
