Naturally, a teacher should know about his subject. That knowledge may not be excellent but certainly it should be on a level, where he's able to transfer that knowledge to his students. The difficult part about that process is, that every student is his own individual and will learn in a different way.

Any schoolar system tries to find a way to standartize that way to a certain extent. You may have a system expressed by rules and standarts writtend down on paper but then again that doesn't educate the students. Teachers and Professors do. It's their doom execute those rules but still have to find a connection to the individulas. If there is no connetion between teacher and student but hate or another negative feeling, chances for failure are high. The student won't invest time in learning things thought by a (in his mind) horrible teacher and in reaction to that, the teacher won't invest any time into such a student, who's might be interested in the topic but doesn't seem like it. I don't know about the studies and reaseaches done on that problem but I agree with the statement above and I'm pretty sure about researches showing the same tendecy. It's simply much easier for teachers to motivate a class, if he has a conecction to them. Therefore it's also easier to learn from that teacher and absorb the teachers knowledge. 

I haven't been aware, but in hindsight I notice it myself. For example: once i didn't understand something about mathematics at all. In my opinion, the teacher was horrible at explaining: He gave no legitimate answer to any question and demanded that we should just believe whatever he said. Anyway, I asked someone else, whose way of teaching i liked better; and tadaa
