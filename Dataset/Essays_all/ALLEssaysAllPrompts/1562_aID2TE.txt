Now it's my task, to write an essay about the statement ''A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.'' 

In my opinion a good mix of this is useful. A tecacher, who knows very much about different topics, but can't present them understandly to the students, is very unuseful. Also a techer, which can relate with the students very good, but don't have a good knowledge about the topics is not very good for us. 

An example to this aspect: We have an teacher, who is an autist. Many people, often also teachers, say about him, that he is very intelligent and very fit in his subjects. But he can't relate with us, so we don't learn so much from him. Often we have to repeat the topics at home for the exams. 
We also have an teacher, which can relate with us very good. So good that we can't learn so much from him. :D He is like a friend for many students of the class. 

So an mixture of both qualities in my eyers is very important. In addition private and school things should be devided.
