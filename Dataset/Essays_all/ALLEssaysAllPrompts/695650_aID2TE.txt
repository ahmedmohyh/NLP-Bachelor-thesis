I don't agree and I don't disagree.

In my eyes, it's a combination of the two. Although the middle ground of combining both is a very fine line.

 A teacher that can only relate well with students makes for an unchallenging, relaxed but yet sterile class. The teacher will take up feedbac from the students, which naturally is: "we want as little tests as possible, no grammar and no reading"..
The teacher will then create his class in such a way that he's only just justifying his role as a teacher, only just conveyeing the minimal amount of knwoledge he needs to pass down. That doesn't help anyone. 


A teacher that has excellent knowledge of his subject, is only interesting for the students that engage in conversation with him, one's that question what he says and make him justify his words. They tend to be the better students in the subject and their the ones the tests are guidelined by, which is not representing thewole class. For student's who don't look to pursue the subject in later life and visit the course to be taught what they need for their final exam, this makes for an overload of overly detailed information from the teacher but no teaching competence in going in on their specific wishes. This example becomes evident in a science subject like biology.


A teacher that combines both aspects can make students interested in a subject they don't particularily like just by having a relationship to them and through that passing down intriguing and interesting knowledge. He/She knows the content he/she has to convey throughout the year, and can vary ways of communicating it because she knows what the class likes and responds too.
