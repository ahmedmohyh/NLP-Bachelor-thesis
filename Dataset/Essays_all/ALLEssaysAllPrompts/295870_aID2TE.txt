The connection between teachers and their students is very important, because if the are getting along with each other very well, the climax of learning is going to be much better. Another reason for a strong connection is that the students in most cases feel more comfortable when they are close related to the person who`s teaching them and more comfortability is leading to more motivation and probably to better test results. It also takes the pressure from the students so they can more enjoy their schoolyears. For example, if you like a person who`s teaching you something, if you can laugh and have fun, but still learning the important thing you`re probably feeling well to write a test about it. 
If a teacher just wants to give you as much informations and knowledge as he or she got, you are going to be really under pressure to understand and connect all the informations correctly. You won`t like to learn all the stuff, beacuse you know that it is so much and so complicated that you are barely going to reach a good graduation at the test, so your motivation is just not there. You will be very depressed about school every day.
If you think that I`m completely for a strong relation you`re wrong. I think the best option would be a good mix of a good relation to the teachers and a little bit of a distance to them along with much informations. So, if the the entire question about the relation needs to be answered, I`m going for a balanced solution of both sides.
