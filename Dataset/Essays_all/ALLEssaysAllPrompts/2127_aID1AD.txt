In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn´t be allowed. 
Those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot. Advertising with the wrong content and images could also influence their later opinion and behaviour when they´re grownn up, beacause they listened to those advertising when they were younger. Promoting more and more wrong ideals and norms advertising has so much power and could so of course have a lot impact on the youth.
In regard to this advertising for young children may not contain wrong ideals and norms, because the content for young children would be more simple and just full of things that are funny and enjoyable. 
Further more you could say that all those advertisings are always proved so that they should be save for young children to watch, but still there could always be some hidden images that the children then get to know.
The question is just: Can we trust the people who design those advertisings? Can we trust society? As it´s known society puts so many wrong ideals and norms in the world, so that everybody thinks he has to follow those ideals and norms. So many grown up people are influenced by those images promoted in advertisings, that we should think about how much influence advertising than can have then on young children. They are growing up, developing an opinion and get then of course much influenced by those promoted images. 
As result advertising for young children shouldn´t be allowed. They could get guided wrong and grow up with wrong images society has given them. Especially in this young age they should develop their own opinion with things they experience by their own.
