Yes, we shouldn't allow young children watching television advertising because there are advertises,which are brutal or the children couldn't understand their real meaning so they understand it in another sense or they just see the objects without the real meaning of this advertise. So for example if their is a advertise where there are ghosts in a dark room advertising for a parfum, they couldn't think off the parfum and just see the ghosts. They can't see the real sense off this advertise so they get scared and just remember the gosts. In another case if they get shocked it can negativly influence the brain, because if you have a shocking moment as a child you will remeber it your whole life.
Otherwhise you can let them watch the advertises. This are all normal advertises, because if it's scary or not for children it will appear a sign which says that the following film is not for younger children, so until that point they couldn't send brutal scences. In some adverises you can learn things or they will get creativ if they see this things when they are young. 
In my opinion you can let them watch the advertises, if it's a childrens television programme. It is really important that if there will appear a brutal,scared or strange advertise the parents should turn off the television or explain the scene to their children. In the end its the choice off every parents.
