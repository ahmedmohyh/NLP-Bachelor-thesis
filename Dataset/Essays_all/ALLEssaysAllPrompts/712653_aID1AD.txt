Nowadays, information is constantly given to us. According to our behaviour on social media, we are being targeted to specific products and ads whithout our knowledge. We probably buy way too many things that we do not need but usually we realize this too late. This is what we call consumerism. At times, it seems as if we were held captive in a materialistic world where the brand of your shoes matters more than the ideas in your head. 

The consumerism of the Western countries is a very controversial topic, especially when we consider the fact that already younger children are the group of interest of certain television ads.

Children at the age of two to five do not own money nor do they have jobs to earn money, at least not by law in these countries. They do not have the ability to comprehend the concept of money yet. Thus, it can have serious consequences for them. If they start spending money they do not have at such a young age they might enter a downward spiral of debts.

On the other hand, showing them ads directed towards them could help them develop their own opinion and taste early on. This might contribute to them being creative people later in life. Creativity is a main part of developping ideas and starting new projects. Since we face various and unique problems these days such as the climatic change, gender ineqaulity, racial tension etc. supporting innovation could be crucial.

Nevertheless, I still agree with the statement above. Television ads directed towards children aged two to five should be prohibited because it is a misleading concept. The children would not understand the reason why the can not have the products advertised to them. In addition I think that many money related issues could be prevented this way.
