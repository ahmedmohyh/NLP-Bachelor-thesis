A teacher is a very important person to the students, he guides them through their school time and should helps them. Teachers build up our next generation, so it is of course important, they have the ability to teach well. To become a teacher, you need to know your subject well and the higher level you're going to teach at, the better you have to understand your subject, and often you need to study at university. What teachers do is giving their knowledge to the next generation and if some information gets missed during the lessons, it might be lost for ever. Of course you could do researches to find again what knowledge got lost, but this means a lot of work, money and even more time.
However, the question is, if a teacher knows perfectly his subject, is he a perfect teacher? In my opinion there is something else, that defines a great teacher. You must be able to motivate your students and show them, they can achieve success if they put effort into whatever they are doing. To motivate your students, it is necessary to have a good relation to your students otherwise they won't like you, in worst case they don't go to your courses and these students didn't get any of your knowledge. First of all there must be something like a connection between the teacher and the student, than the teacher can do his job. Even if he has not much to tell but the ability to motivate, the students get interested in the subject and start to  search for knowledge themselfes.
It starts already at primary school, when most children are excited to start school. The pupils need to get an impression of a school which can be fun and not only work. To make that impression is the teacher's job and from my point of view the teacher has done a good job if he or she manages to motivate already these pupils. So I do agree that for a teacher the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught.
