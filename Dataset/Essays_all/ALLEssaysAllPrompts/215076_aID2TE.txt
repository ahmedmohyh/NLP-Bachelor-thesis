Everybody is or was at some point a student in a school. As we all know that some teacher have the better ability to interact with students then others and some have a broad knowledge in their subject. It is just normal that individuel students enjoy some subjects more or less depending on the teacher teaching skills and knowlege, but what is more important? The ability to interact with students or to have a broad knowledge in a specific subject? I am a student from the college Baden and I am going to react to this conversial question.

On one hand it is quite important that a teacher has a broad knowledge in his subject. A broad knowlege also shows intrest from the teacher to his subject and this therefore helps him to make his lesson more intresting. Depending with subject it is more important to have a good knowledge then the ability to relate with students. For example history, biology or geography it is important that the teacher knows a lot of details to mhave more ideas to make the lesson more intresting.

On the other hand in some subject it is really important that the teacher can well interact with the students. For example maths or physics there it is really important that the teacher has the ability to explain theories and exercises. Maths or Physics are subject witch are complex theories. For students it is easier when the teacher understands their questions and can react to them.

In my opinion a mixture of both is the best way. Depending on the subject it is bettter to have more knowledge then to have the ability to interact and relate with students. In my view the most important thing is that the teacher has fun while teaching and has passion for his subject. Students can feel the passion and it can have a positiv learning effect and motivate them more.
