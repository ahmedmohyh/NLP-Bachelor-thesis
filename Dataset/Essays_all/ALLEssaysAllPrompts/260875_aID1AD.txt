Television is media which has been used for many decades. It had some bad times and some better times. Television programes do not have to be bad or deceiving for the audience. But it is well known that the media was used for many bad acts which caused  a lot of pain and made the times worse than they should have been.

Do I think that the television should not advertise? No, I do not think that advertising is always bad for me and other people but the people should be aware that the media is controled by the state or by large companies. In my opinion advertising towards children is not always bad. But perhaps the parents of the children have to surveile their children more often and better. If the parents do their job properly and interfere when the programm is not save for children the advertising should not be of any problem. But even if that works it does not have to be save or any good for the children because the parents make the decisions if the programm is any good or not and that might be a problem but it does not have to be one.

Personaly I do not think that I should be asked such a question because I have not watch TV for almost 7 years so I do not know if the advertising got any better or worse in the sense of beeing deceiving towards children without care. In my opinion the only down side of not wathcig TV is that I do not realise new trends at the same time as the other people do.
