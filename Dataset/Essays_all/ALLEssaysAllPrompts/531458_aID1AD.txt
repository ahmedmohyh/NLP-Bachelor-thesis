If you put children in front of a tv its not good itself, but if they watch advertising it's even worse because they get influenced by it. We also get influenced by advertising but as adults we can differentiate between good and bad influenc and can decide more on our own if we want us to get influenced by something or not. If a child watches advertising it just can't decide anything, it gets inflenced and maybe it gets influenced for the hole life and will stay loyal for all his life to the product it saw at young age.
Television advertising is really ennoying for us adults but for children even more. When they want to watch teletubbies or learn from good, intelligent televisionshows like spongebob and then this terrible advertising sequence is popping up.
It's also really annoying for the parents who have children who always cry because they want the product they saw in the television.
So what do we learn from this now? At first advertising in television towards children is really bad for the children because of the huge influence on them. Second the television advertising makes the children dumb because they cant watch more intelligent things at the time the advertising is running. Third it's very annoying for parents when children want products they saw in television advertising. So in my oppinion television advertising towards children should be forbidden, otherwise our society will break down sooner or later because of too many television advertising damaged children.
