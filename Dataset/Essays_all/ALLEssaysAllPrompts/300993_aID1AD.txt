Television advertising for young children doesn't seem like a bad thing to me since it can be easily influenced by the parents. However, when young children watch over exagerated toy commercials, for example the latest "Littlest Pet Shop" or "Playmobil", they can get easily excited and develop the wish to have these toys. This can be tough for the parents who have to deal with telling their kids "no". As we all know, most of the young kids don't take "no" as an answer just like that. They will start to cry and/or scream, which can be very hard on the parents' nerves. On the other side, as I shortly mentionned above, parents can decide whether they want their children to see these advertisements or not. If they just don't let their kids watch TV they won't have arguments about the commercials. Plus: children aged two to five shouldn't be watching a whole lot of TV (if any TV at all) anyway in my opinion.
It also depends on what kind of advertising it is but since young children don't do a whole lot yet it is rather rare that we see anything different than toy advertisements. I think there are commercials for products that would only be of temporary enjoyment but I also believe that there are advertiesments that can encourage us to do better. If there is a commercial for different types of sports for example it could develop an early interest in young kids to be active and play a sport, which would definitely be a more "longterm" joy than some toy. Another type of commercial that would encourage us to to better is from charity organisations like WWF, Red Cross, ProNatura, etc.

I don't think television advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed, especially toward children aged two to five. I don't think I even knew what TV really was when I was that young. I wouldn't have been able to turn on the TV, that's for sure. The only thing people/parents should be careful about is WHAT they let their children watch. I think it is all in their hands.
