I'm disagree with the following statement, because when I have a question in the class and the teacher can't explain my question then it's very bad. It's angry for the teacher and for me because at the examen came this example and I can't answer this and then I havn't a bad note only of the teachers don't knowledge. I think a good teacher should have an excellent knowledge of the subject. Then when he hasn't an excellent knowledge than he can't teach students or he didn't teach the corect things. A teacher should know more about a theme than he must teach because when a student have a question, deeper in the theme than the teacher will teach the class, so he should answer the question without any problems. I know a teacher is also an human and he can't know everything but in his area is he an expert and he should know more than other people. So I think when you will be a teacher you have fun at your area and you will learn more and so you have automaticlly a biger knowledge as other people. And an other thing is when you have fun at your area then it's easyer to teach other with your knowledge. I think it's also important as a teacher to have a ability to realate well with students. Because you work with humans and not with machines and so you must have a good ability to the students it's easyer to work with each other. But I think it's more important that you have an excellent knowledge. In fact I think it's not so easy to be a good teacher but when you be a good human and you have a big knowledge of the subject then you make a good job.
