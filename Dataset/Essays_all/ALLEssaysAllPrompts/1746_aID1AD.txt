In the following essay I am going to answer the question if television advertising directed toward young children shoudn't be allowed.
I only agree with this statement in some aspects. I dont think that children in the age of two to 3 should watch any TV at all. In that age they rather play outside or with normal toys. but on the other hand they would not have known about these toys without the adverts they see in TV everyday. The main problem is what and how much the ads are advertising. Often there are ads for girls that show babydolls that the little girls can take care about. This can be good and bad. For example it is very positive that the child is able to learn the first things a bout taking care of something or someone, so this would strengthen their feeling for responsibility. On the other hand could ads like this push these girls in the gender roll of the ''stay at home housewife''. The same goes for boys. Another positive point is that many of the toys really support the process of learning basic stuff like numbers, colours or even some letters.
A problem I want to criticize is that there are not only ads for childs on the childchannels in TV, and in these ads they could see content that is not good for them.
I think that adverts for children are not generally bad. I think the children can learn a lot of things with the toys they see in the ads.
