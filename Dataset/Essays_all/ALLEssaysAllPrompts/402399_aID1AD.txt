Channels with content for children aren't excluded from that need for money. But should it be allowed to advertise toward young children ?
 Well the television industry generates thousands of jobs in every country of the world. To keep those jobs channels have to make money. There are some national television channels in many countries, which don't have to make advertisment breaks because they are financed by some kind of tax from the inhabitands. But most channels are private and rely on advertising brands in the breaks. Channels for children of course show adverbs for toys. Without the money from the brands, they couldn't satisfy young children with their favorite shows. But young children are very easy influenced by their environnment. When they see an advertisment for a particular toy, they want to have this toy, but this can also happens without television. They can see the toy in a store and still want to have it.
