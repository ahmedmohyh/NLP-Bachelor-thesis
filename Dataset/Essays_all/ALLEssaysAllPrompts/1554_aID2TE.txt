In this essay i would like to talk about the following statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
My first argument against is, that you still have to teach the students some knowledge. It will be bad for the upcoming exams, if students have questions but you can't answer them.
The second argument against is that especially in the higher classes knowledge is more important than relating, because you have to get this knowledge to get ready for the end-exam (ABI).

After these arguments against the statement that the relating ability is more important than excellent knowledge I'm coming now to the arguments for the statement.

The first argument for the statement is that you can impress the students as a teacher, if you have a good realtion with them. The students will have more fun to listen to you and it is easier to teach them knowledge.
The second argument for the statement is that a good realtion is useful for the students to raise their hands more often. If you have a teacher you like, you will raise your hands more often which increase your grade than by a teacher you don't like.

All in all i don't come to a conclusion. I think both, a good relation and a useful amount of knowledge, are important. If you only have a good relation you don't get knowledge to the students, if you only have an excellent amount of knowdledge the students won't listen to you, because the lesson is awful.
A good mix between these abilities is in my opinion the best one for a teacher.
