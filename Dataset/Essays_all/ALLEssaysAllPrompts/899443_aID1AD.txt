It's allways a very difficult subject, if children should watch TV or not.
In the following Essay I will show you the pros and contras of Television for children.

The Good thing about TV is, that Parents with very loud and activ children can keep them quiet, if they let them watch TV. To get a quiet hour for themselfs.
Children can also learn if they watch show about animals, like I did when I was young, and learn alot of things.

But the contra is that if Children at a young age already watch alot of TV they will get used of it and won't stop watching TV if they were older. If you start watching TV at a young age you could probabely get addicted to it.
In the Television there were also many canals who were very bad for young children because they contend violence and sex. And it can always happen that a children switches in wrong canal like this.
Its also a pity that Television will get you away from going to play outside with your friends. And you will just sit infront of the TV instead and get fat.

For me personaly the contra's were much more important than the pro and I'm against that children watching TV.
