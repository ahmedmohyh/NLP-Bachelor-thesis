I´m going to dicuss the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" in the following text.

First of all one could say that the young children haven´t got any idea of advertising, so they would be (beeinflusst) even when the parents doesn´t want that. It´s possible that the children would own all things they see in the television but sometimes the parents haven´t got enaugh money to buy those things or it´s even possible that the children have got enaugh i.e. toys. So the children could get sad if the don´t get what they want and the parents would feel bad if they can´t buy the things what the children want.

On the other side the children could get new ideas for toys maybe as a birthday present or for christmas. 
And maybe they could share the toys with other children in their age which already own them. 

In conclusion one could say that the arguments for advertising in the television directed toward young children are (stärker)because in reality no children would own all toys they these anywhere. And for the (Erziehung) is it sometimes better not to (erfüllen) all wishes of the children.

My opinion is that television adversitsing directed toward young children should be allowed if it´s not too much. In my childhood I saw advertising of toys in the television too and I dident´t want to own all things. I found it even cool to look at these toys in the television because I weren´t interested in the most things I saw.
