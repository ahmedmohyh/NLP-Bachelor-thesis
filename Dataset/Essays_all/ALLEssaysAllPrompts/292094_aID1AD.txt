Have you ever wondered what is going on in a child's mind? Whether you did or not, you certainly noticed how susceptible kids are to temptations these days. Such temptations may include toys, candy, video games, ice cream and countless other things. All of these are mostly materialistic goods and are usually strongly promoted on TV. Now, is it ethically wrong to tempt children into things they do not necessarily need? 
First of all, whether a child actually gets the adverted good or not is mainly decided by its parents. It's really the parents that are the aim of the commercials. Thus, it is the parents' task to raise the kids in a way that prevents them from becoming too susceptible to temptations. 
Secondly, it gives the children a chance to deal with temptations in early years. Later in life they are going to have to resist to thousands of other temptations. TV commercials featuring toys and candy already give them a chance to handle such situations.  
On the other hand, the companies that produce the TV commercials clearly aim at vulnurable children in order to promote their product. In reality, their goal is that the adressed children will later tell their parents about the new amazing thing they saw on TV, and often, the parents have a hard time turning their child down. Turning down young children on a thing they really want inevitably leads to conflict. Unfortunately, many parents act too weak in those conflicts and eventually give in. 
Therefore, it is not the commercial companies that are the problem. It is the parents task to teach their children to resist temptations. Ultimately, TV commercials can in fact act as a life lesson for children. As a result, the facts arguing pro TV commercials directed to young children clearly outweigh the arguments against TV commercials directed towards young children.
