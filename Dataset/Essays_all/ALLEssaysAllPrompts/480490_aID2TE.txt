Students go to the school to learn something, this is nothing new.
While this time, they have to learn also other things than like just school stuff. All the time it's possibel to learn something new without to stop. Just keep going on to learn. It's possibel to learn during the lifetime, from the friends, family or at school from an excellent teacher.
Teacher knows usually a lot, more than a student can imagined. They studied long time, they are interessed in what they do. And that is it why we, students, go in schools, because of the excellent teachers. They help us if we can't going on. It's not just their job, they want to do this. This point is also really important. Nobody would like to go to the school if the teachers are like witches. The students are most of the time during the day at school, the students spent sometimes more time with the classmates and the teachers than with the familiy, so is it important that the teachers are polite. They have to make some exams, because is it their job. To be nice is more than to make any exams.
As a student you could say that you don't understand if this is the case. As a student, you should you feel good in the school and in this way is the teacher a big factor. 
In conclusion, the teachers are bigger part of the life than some people can imagined. The teachers should have the nowledge, teache you the knowledge. They also show you the way, and bring you to your aim. 
I can't say which factor are more important, for me they are both really important. It isn't possibel to be a good teacher without one of the abilities.
