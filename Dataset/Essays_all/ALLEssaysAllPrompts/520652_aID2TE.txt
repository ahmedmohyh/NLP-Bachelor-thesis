It is pretty important that a teacher relates well with the students because the athmosphere in a classroom is important to concentrate and if a teacher doesn't relate well with the students, the athmosphere will be bad. The students won't be willing to learn something because they won't be able to like a teacher that relates badly with them. But also a good knowledge of his subject is very important for a teacher. If he don't knows anything about his subject, he can't learn anything to the students. That means, that the students may be good at an exam made by this teacher but later, when they have to now these things, they won't be able to do something related to these things. The best case would be if a teacher relates well with the students and has a good knowledge of his subject. If he relates well but doesn't know anything about his subject, the students will have good memories at his lessons but they won't be good at the subject. If he knows a lot about his subject but doesn't relate well with the students, they will be frustrated but they will know more about the subject. I personally don't agree with the statement. In my opinion it is more important that the teacher knows a lot about his subject than that he relates well with the  students, because if you learn more, it might help you in life and you will get better marks at a higher school. But also would it be better if the teacher knows quiet much about his subject and relates rather well with the students, than if he can only do one of these things. Each teacher has to balance this for himself, so the students learn something and the athmosphere isn't too bad in the classroom.
