There are some good and bad points about television advertising. Advertising is like making people do or buy something by presenting the product or whatever it is. This should influence some people and let them buy or do these thhings. If that happens, we know that the advertisement was successful.

It always depends on what kind of an advertisement it is. But it's important to know that young children are very influencable. Television advertising can infuence these children better than adults. And like I said, if these advertisements are specifically made for children, these children would want to have these things ike toys.
Nowadays there are these phases where a specific toy is the "best" toy and every kid wants to have this. And that makes an entire group get these things.
Well that's the case if the advertisement presents toys. But its the same thing if the advertisemnet is about an activity. It well may be positive but also in that case it depends on the content of the television advertising.
I think that children aged to two to five are too young to even understand the intention that these advertisements have. They see the pictures and videos and that's it. 
But especially the fact that they only see what's on the screen is another negative point about that. They wahrnehmen these things other than teenagers. 

That statement above is generalising the advertisements. I can say (from my own experience) that not all advertisements have a bad influence to children. I've seen kind of "advertisemnts" that tell young children to go to bed early, to play outside and more.

Because of that I believe that it really depends on what kind of and televisison advertisement it is. More importantly what and how it represents- So, I can't really say that I agree or disagree with that.
