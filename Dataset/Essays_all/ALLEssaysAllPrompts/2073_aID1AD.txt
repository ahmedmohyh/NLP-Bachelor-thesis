I dont care if young kids see the advcertisments on tv, they have parents to care for them. If the parents dont do theire job right, its their fault if theier kids want some toys they saw in a tv commercial. the advertisment industrie also has to make money and we live in a luxury world where everyone just wants to consume and think about himself. Crying about the fact that many children are about to be roboters in the future is really funny because i think we should change our whole society and not only a bit stuff on tv. I hate to sit here in this room with all the so called students who are slaves of our society and are about to have a monotone life that cotains: good abitur, uni, good job, find a family and DIE! No way that I will fit in this boring society of robotic humans who click their computer like their life is conected to it. If you read my text until this point, i hope you understand what my point is allthough I'm only 17 years old. Go outisde and travel the world, eat healthy and stop sitting in front of your computer all day and lose all your energy to live. Because, all we need is love! 
Now to the part that will make you happy: Advertisments can influence kids in positive and negative aspects. It would definitly be a idea to stop advertisments for toys like guns or other bad stuff that could bring kids a wrong idea of life and that hurting peolple is wrong. To be honest I still have no idea what to tell you through this text, all I have to say is that all we need is to chill and spread some love. I think I still do not have enough words, so now Im just filling up my text that it looks like I have written enough so yeah, blah blah blah I have no idea what to write... to be continued? Or nor? no one knows.
