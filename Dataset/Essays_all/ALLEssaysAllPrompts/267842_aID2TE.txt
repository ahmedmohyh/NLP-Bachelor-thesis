I think that it is more important, that the teacher is able to relate well with students because if a teacher has a bad realtionship with his/her students, the students wont be motivated in his/her subject. For example if you have a bad relationship with your Frenchteacher, I'm sure you won't study as much if you have a teacher you really like.  Sure, its also very important that the teachers have a good knowledge of their subject but in my opinion thats not the most important think. There are so many teachers outthere, which can not explain thinks or which are just antisocial. A teacher should be teached more in a "pädagogisch" way and they should love kids or young people. Because if a teacher is able to relate well with students, mostly he/she is also able to explain thinks. There are also so many teachers, who know there subject so good that they can't imagine that the students don't know that or that they just don't understand it. A good example for this are the maths-teachers. Often they speak and speak and they don't understand, that nobody is understandig. 

To sumarize my points, I really think that's more important that a teacher know how to speak and how to treat there students, as that they have a excellent knowledge of the subject, there are teaching.
