pro: 

- bad idol
- did a lot of bad things in his life
- many kids take him as an idol


contra:

- was a young, nice kid
- did nothing bad
- no connection between his kidlife and adultlife
- to take care, because he was only a kid and after that he did bad things

To public an advertisment is not easy. It could be risc for a lot of people but it could be also a good thing for other peoples. Noone can make the perfect advertisment for something. It will have everytime a guy who doesn't like it. At the end of a day, all advertisment are good and has sense. In my opinion everyone can show them whatevere they want. Only if it's rasicm or hurts other people shoudn't be allowed to public them.

A lot of people thing that the tv advvertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because he did bad things and he will be a bad idol for many other kids, who watch the advertising. They think it could be dangerous to show them this advertisment, maybe the kids want to get like him. 

Another part of people think, it isn't really bad to show them this advertisment. Because Chevalier was young, nice kid like every kid in the world, actually. He didn't do anything bad in his age, so why we shouldnt't see him on the tv like a 5 years old kid? It has no connection between his kidlife and his adultlife. People should difference between his life as a teenager and his life as a "rich man in Switzerland or as a prisoner in Venice". To show them Toward as a child could be maybe a good thing, because then the other kids can take care not to get like him. Evereyone is a good kid, but not everybody would be for ever a good person. I want to say, that I think it's not a problem to show them people this advertiment. Everybody knows that the Chevalier get bad, but as a child he wasn't really dangerous, and why they shouldn't show us him? At the end of the day it isn't necessary what he did in his late life.
