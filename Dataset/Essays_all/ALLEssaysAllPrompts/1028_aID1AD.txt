Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything. So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert. So there comes up the question, should TV advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden. 
There is the question, how far we are gonig to go, to protect our children. And although an advert could heavily influence them they are most likely not going to grow up, if they don't get in contact with adverts. Because if they don't get adressed, while they are 2-5, they are going to be when they are 6. So how is there any difference. If they dont get the experience of watching adverts, they will not be able to deal with them, even if they are  older. 
Furthermore these adverts don't damage the kids at all. They are just showing new toys, of cereals. And even if they are trash, why ahouldn't the companies have the right, to show the world, what they created there. The children have to learn, that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert. And even if it makes them cry, it will form their character. 
Finally, the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them. And if it cries because they wont, then it will have to learn its' lesson. And if the parents want to give their sweetie anything it desires, and they have to buy every f***ing toy it sees in an advert, then don't blame the advert, but blame the parent. 
In my opinion, there is no real reason to forbid such TV adverts, because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age. There are no convincing arguments for this ponit and I am sure, that this is never going to happen, because it doesn't make any sense at all. BUt
