I think television is great. I like to watch tv all day long. It's a amazing way to calm down and to relax.Why shouldn't it be allowed to watch tv advertising how's directed when you're two to five years old.I mean you have to start early learn a correct way to use television and Co. And alot of television programs are made for children so they also should be used in advertising.There are a lot of toy producers they want to show they're stuff to the children on tv. So if television advertising is not allowed for children. To watch tv shouldn't be allowed to because there are alot advertising how don't have a direction like for example: food ad, event ad or ad for the newest movie at the cinema. Children are around ad's all the time not just when they watch television.So my oppinion to this it's there are advertisting around children anyways if they are directed to them or not. So i think it's up to the parents if they let they're children watch tv ad or not. And parents also should decide it they allowed they're children to buy that stuff from the tv or not.
