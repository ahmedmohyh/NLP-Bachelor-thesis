Is television advertising toward young children good or bad?

Nowadays not only teenagers and adults watch television but also children from two to five years old. Inbetween the movie or soap there is always advertisement. These advertisements also direct themselves toward these young children. What effect can that have on children at that age?

Most advertisements that are directet toward children, are about toys. Therefore these children want to have these toys, that mostly cost a fortune. In some cases their parents don't have that much money to buy the toys, and as a consequence the children are mad or angry at them. But on the other side this is a great way for the parents to find out what their child likes, so they can surprise them with a fitting birthday gift.

Mostly the very young children don't really understand what they see on television, and that means that these advertisements don't make a lot of sense. However if they do understand what they see, for example a toy commercial, it doesn't really affect them in any other way then that they want to have these toys.

Nevertheless, if these advertisements promote dangerous toys or violent behaviour, it can't possibly be good for a child at that age. But nowadays there isn't much or any advertisment like that on television.

In conclusion, I think that it doesn't make sense to make commercials for children that are between two and five years old, because they don't understand what they see.
