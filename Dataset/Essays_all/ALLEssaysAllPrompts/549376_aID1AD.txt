This question is of course a very difficult question to answer. My opinion is, that this kind of advertisment towards young kids should not be allowed. Children between the ages of two and five are not able to question things they're told. It's impossible for them to build their own opinions and to see through marketing tactics. In other words: children are manipulated by companies at a very young age just so they can make a higher profit. This is not just an ethical problem our society produces, but also a problem the next generations will have to live with. 

I'm sure the companies that use these sort of tactics make a higher profit. But one can't just blame the companies, the parents are just as guilty. Parents decide wether they buy the things the children want or not. They are the ones who have to acknowledge the fact that their children's naivity is being abused and then decide in their favour.   

Parents should be aware of those dangers and tactics marketing managers use so they can protect their children until they're able to make an opinion for themselves.
