Essay: Do I agree?

Being a teacher for sure isn`t easy, you need to be able to get through to your students to teach them what they need to know to pass your tests, you need to know how to make every specific student study, you have to be capable to answer all the questions, and all that while writing exercises and exams for them. On the other side, you have to know your students, to go on trips with them or just talk with them. But which of these abilitys is more important?

I think it`s really hard to seperate this two, one kind of needs the other in order to function. Yet I`ll still try to look at each of them alone.
So, what is the reason that children have to (or can) go to school? It`s for their education, so they`ll be able to live as an adult later on and to understand the basics of their environment.
If a teacher now is totally incapable to give them the knowledge they need, even if he gets along pretty well with everyone, knows what Jimmis favorite sort of icecream is or the number of books that James collected, he still fails at his job. 
If a teacher knows every single fact about the subject he teaches, but can`t socialize with the children, can`t explain even though he knows it himself, he fails at his job.
To be the perfect teacher, you must have both. It can be said that while relating to the students without enough knowledge, they will still gain this little amount of it, and while knowing everything but not relating to them at all would probably give them even less.
My conclusion is that both are about equal, but if one had to decide between them, he should take the ability to relate well since that`d be atleast something.
In the end, I only partly agree, and every student is different anyway but writing about that would mean making another whole essay, so I`ll just stop here.
