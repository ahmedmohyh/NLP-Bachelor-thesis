Every student knows that the teahers are the most intellignet people surrounding them. Nobody would ever question a teacher's statement because everything they say is written in the books. But does a teacher need other skills too?

Every student agreeswith the statement: "A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." A student doesn't want a teacher that cannot understand what the student thinks and why. In order to feel accepted in school as a student, the teacher must be able to sympathise with their students. It's also important that a teacher knows their subject perfectly, so he can answer to all the questions asked by the students. 

All in all I think that teachers have to sympathise with the students. But they also need to find the right balance between the abilty to realate well with their students and the authority they have to show. It's a teacher's task to make the students feel comfortable and accepted. But the students need to show respect to their teacher.
