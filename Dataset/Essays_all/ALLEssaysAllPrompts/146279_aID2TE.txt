There are people who think that it is more important for teachers to relate well with students than actually having an excellent knowledge of the subject taught. But is it really more important?

It is important to have a good relationship with the students. Students are more interested in a subject if they like the teacher. They then really want to go to school and learn something.If they do not like the teacher they do not like to go to school even though they might be good at this subject. Students also ask more questions if the teacher is nice. They are not ashamed because they know that the teacher will not make fun of him when he is wrong.

But a teacher should be able to give his knowledge to the students. That is why children go to school, they want to learn something. If a teacher could not do that, he is not a teacher. It is his job. Also students should not get the feeling that if they have a good relationship with the teacher, they would recieve better grades.

I think you can not say that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important. It is just one factor. You go to school to learn something and not to make friends with the teacher. There should be enough distance between a student and a teacher but not too much. The students should feel save and welcomed. They should have a great atmosphere so that they can learn better. So all in all I disagree with the statement because it is not more important than knowledge. I think it has basically the same level of importance.
