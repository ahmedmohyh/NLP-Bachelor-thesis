One of the biggest problem in our todays society is the influence of technologie by watching television or by using your mobile phone in your life and your attitude. This fact people does use for advertisement in due to make the product or the company more famous and popular. Now, there are so many advertisements for so many people. For example an advertisement of the newest mobile phone is directed toward the younger generation. Advertisement is the most popular way to show todays life and enter in this society. So why should not be an advertisement for chldren too?

Advertisement is important so people children included are up to date and can compare different offers. Advertisement is a part in our every daylife for we find it everywhere: in the internet, in television or even at the bus. Owing to that it is like a part of education for children. In that way they are from the beginning on confronted with advertisement so they can learn earlier and quicker how to handle with it. 
Moreover they share a component of everyday life.Because of that they feel like a part of this world and this society and this improves their self-confidence.

In the other way advertisement can have a bad influence on children, because they can not be able to make their own decisions for their mind is still opened to every experience without asking the consequences. That means children can be more manipulated than adults.
Additionally,this influence does not takes the possibility of making decisions it destroys the naturefriendly childhood too in due to that children are disturbed in their life by let them in this world to early.
Moreover it gives the children the possibility to rebel and scream their parents for children want the product represented bythe advertisement.

My opinion is that is better not to have television advertising for that children need to discover their nature surrounding first before enter in to this society.
