As a teacher of a class you sometimes have to choose, if you either want a good relationship with your students or if you just want to teach them your knowlede. So is it really true, that the relationship is more important than just the excellent knowledge?

At first we can say, that the knowledge is one of the most important things. Without it, a teacher would not be able to stand in front of the class and learn them stuff he also doesn't know exactly. Secondly, if a teacher knows so many things the students are satisfied about it and look up to him. But on the other hand, if a teacher just has the knowledge and does not relate well with students they don't fell confortable and they may don't want to pay attention in class. Another disadvantage is, that the teacher may goes further too fast and the students can't follow. Furthermore they can't talk to teacher, when they have a proble because they don't feel cosy in class.

On the other hand, a good relationship can be positive for the marks of the students because they could get more motivated for learning. When a teacher relates well with each student, they are more happy to go to school and they automatically feel confortable in class. Also an advantage is, that they are not afraid of talking to the teacher if they have a problem or don't follow the stuff. However, a good relationship is always good for students because they are happier to be in school and so they pay more attention.

In conclusion, it is obviously an advantage to relate well with students but it is also necessary to have the knowledge to give. In my opinion, just the knowledge is not enough to be a good teacher. It is also important to have a good relationship, because that is helpful to bring the knowledge to the students.
