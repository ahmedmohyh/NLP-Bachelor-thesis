A good teacher have to know everything about the subject being thaught, he have to be kind but also strikt,he should have a good connection with the students etc. We all have our ideas and thoughts about the appeareance of a teacher. How he should be but also how he shouldn't be. We also now that a normal teacher can't be everything of that. in the end we have to seperate what is important for a teacher and what not. So what is more important?

First of all the connection froma teacher to a student is really important. When you dont't like your teacher beacause he treats his student like they're nothing, it could be really hard to listen to someone like that. In Addition to the bad connection if you also don't like the subject. How should some learn something in this lesson?
The atmosphere between the students and teacher can carry so much. Even if you don't like the subject, you have a nice teacher which will help you.

In the other hand the knowledege is also really important. You can have the kindest teacher in the world, but you will gain nothing if he can't teach his subject. If the teacher has a excellent knowledge about his subject, he can help you to solve all problems you have. So you will gain something even if your teacher have non social skills.

In the end i have to say: A good mix of both is important. You can't say the knowledge is more important then the ability ro relate well. So a good teacher should have both, beacuse if not it isn't good for the student.
