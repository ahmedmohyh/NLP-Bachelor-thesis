in this statement it's said that a harming teacher is better than a expecting teacher with great knowlegde of his subject.
I couldn't disagree this statement, because it's much way better for me to have a harming teacher who is relating well with his students and who is like a friend of them, but also teaching some good lessons and teaching basic knowlegde. In this case I agree with it. It's easier to learn when the teacher is polite, friendly, relaxed, and also teaching the basic knowlegde of the subject. A teacher with great knowlegde of the subject expects the students to try hard and focus only on subject. He is perhaps unharming and wants you to know everything that he taught the student. This perhaps  means too much input for students, who then fail in the exam, because the teacher was expecting too much from them. In this case most of the students dislike this teacher, because he is expecting them to learn his excellent knowlegde too and thats not good. 
A Student would have to learn the basics and the things that interest him the most. So he can go on an university and study the subject that is in his interest. Too much input, as I said, is maybe bad, because a student could miss some knowlegde in the exam and wouldn't nail it.
This statement is good, because if it is a harming teacher, it would be much easier to learn more of the subject or only the basic knowledge to have an opportunity in the life after school.
