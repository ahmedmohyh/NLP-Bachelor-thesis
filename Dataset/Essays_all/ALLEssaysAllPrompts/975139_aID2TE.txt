When it comes to a teacher we only think he has to teach us something valuable. But the teacher has many things he needs to look after. He has to grab the students attention and also have a wide knowledge of his subject. But what is more important for the teacher?

A teacher with a wide knowledge of his subject is important for future for the students.
If a student has a question it is the teacher's duty to help the student. Furthermore the lesson must consist of valuable things. If he isn't excellent at his subject than he would be no use for the students. 

On the other hand it is also very important that the teacher understands that the students have different levels. He also needs to create his subject more interesting for the students which could be a very difficult task. What is more he has to treat every student the same.     

In my opinion the teacher needs to relate well with students and be perfect at his subject. if he isn't perfect at neither of them than he shouldn't be allowed to be teacher.
