I once visited ma aunt whose children are two and four years old. I saw them looking television at seven o'clock in theevening. First they saw a film than the film was interrupted by an advertising. I heard the chilren asking their mother to buy some thing that was presented in the advertising. So I was wondering if this advertising poses a problem or if not. And if it poses a problem if it should be prohibited. 

On the one hand there is no obligation to look television. Parents are free to decide if they want to let their children looking television. If the parents think that the advertising has a negative influence in their children's behaviour they can stop letting their children looking television.
Andeven though it could be a problem, the problems are far more alarming in other aspects: Super markets put the candies on the level of the childrens eyes, to make them asking their parents for those candies. We should first find a solution to those huge problems.  
And in the end everybody has the possibility to open a television chanal so why should one not have the permission to show in his chanal what one wants?

On the other hand if there was a regulation the owners of the chanals would still have other possibilities to make money. They could make advertising for older children for exemple. 
But the children are not the only victims of the advertisin. The parents have to buy all the stuff. And this is not fair for them. So the parents are not entirely free to decide if they want to let their children looking television, because there is no television without advertising.
For me the most important factor is the fact, that children are easily influenced. I personally think that it is without any respect to use this for making money. Such a thing schould clearly be not allowed!
