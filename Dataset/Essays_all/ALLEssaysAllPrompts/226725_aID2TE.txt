Essay:

When it comes to teaching most of the parents hope that their children are able to understand the matter at hand rather than knowing everything about the subject which is being taught, so they'd rather have a teacher which is able to relate with the students, rather than having a professor who knows everything but struggles as soon as it comes to share his wisdom in the right way. Furthermore it has to be extremly frustrating to receive an huge ammount of information which got explained so badly that most of it just doesn't stick with the student. You will also have to consider that it is easier for a teacher to look something up on the internet compared to developing a sense for his students capability, so you'd rather have a teacher which is able to relate to his/her students, since it's easier for him to acquire new knowledge.

On the other side the class can benefit enourmosly if their teacher can explain the basics to all the students and who can afterwards share his wisdom with the few of the class which share his interest in a specific subject or just want to learn more. Excellent knowledge also helps to sort out issues regarding homework and so on because the teacher might now how to solve the problem differently than other teachers with more restricted knowledge.

In retrospective I will have to disagree with the statement if I apply it to myself, however I will have to agree in broad terms if you consider that there are less privilleged students out there who need a helping hand when it comes to the explaination of things or problem solving in which case a teacher with the ability to relate to his/her students can be a saving grace. (Please don't consider that as part of my essay I'd just like to mention that I realize how my last sentence makes me look like a prick and that I'm a really nice dude irl thanks)
