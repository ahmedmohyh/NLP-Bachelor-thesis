In the following text I will show why I think that a techer's ability relating well with students is more worth than knowing a lot about a topic. 
On the one hand the teacher's task is teaching and a good knowledge is necessary, because if teachers can't teach well anymore, students won't learn anything. For example there are teachers, who are really like a friend to the pupils, but in the end they fail tests and exams. 
On the other hand I believe that childeren will learn more about a topic, if they have a teacher they can relate with and they like having class. A kind teacher, whose relation to the pupils is good may be better than an intelligent professor, who studied at university. It is the way they are telling things, because when teenagers having emotional turmoils listen to a grumpy man they do not even like, there is a high percentage of receiving bad marks.
Additionally teacher relating well with students is more popular and they respect them in another way than if he was strict. Due to beeing a teenager children try to test their limits at home and in school. To prevent bad behavior it is important showing them what they are allowed to do and what they should not be doing. There are two possibilities to go over this. Even you are strict and thry might be scared of you or they like your attitude and respect you anyway. I believe in a nice teacher beeing a better choice, because there will be more fun in school for both sides.
To put it in a nutshell I am convinced that nice teachers having a good relation to their students are better than an excellent man. I come to this conclusion due to thinking children will learn more, if they see teachers as friends not as enemies. I am student and for me I can say that I like going to school when having teachers I can relate with very well.
