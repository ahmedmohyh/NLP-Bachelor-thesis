If someone want to make a television advertising about baby daipers or for toys than it schould be possible to direct an advertising with young chldren. I think it would be funny when you would see a toy advertising just directed towad older chlidren or teenagers.
And babys or young children are cut and because of that a product would maybe be sold out quicker than others.
For mothers who cant go to work because of their kids it could be helpful when teir kids have a "job" an make money. But those mothers shoulded force their kids to do that, they should have fun filming an advertising.

One negative point of that thing is that it is a lot of pressure for a young kid to film something and thy should have fun doing it.
And i thnk for a lot of mums out there it is like a drug when their kid once have success by filming sommething they want that the kids do it al the time, and that could turn out bad for the children.so that they dont have a real childhood.

I the end i think as long as the kids have fun filming an advertising and as long they also have time to play with their friends and just can be young kids it is no problem to make television advertising toward young kids. so i think it should be allowed.
