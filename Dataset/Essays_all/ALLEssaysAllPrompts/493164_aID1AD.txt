The problem of television advertising directed toward young children is that in the age of 2 to 5 years the children are often overwhelmed by the television. It is often too much for the children to take up and even can frighten them because they are easily scared.

Another point is that sitting in front of the TV for more than 1 hour can cause a headache and is not really healthy. Children in this age should go outside and play in the garden and the woods. They should play things on their own to learn how to do something without being dependant on this screen.

Furthermore is creativity being lost if they only have to sit and get information without really doing something. If a child for example plays a role game there are a lot of ideas created and the child has really to think about what it does next. But if it is watching TV it only has to switch the channel and not really has to think about anything.

If children at this age get used to watch TV there will also be a lack of communication skills. Because if the children are sitting in front of this screen, even together, they won't have to comunicate or interact with each other, only to decide which channel they are going to watch.

But you can also see a possibility in the early contact to TV: The chilren can learn how to go along with the electronic devices in an intelligent way.

In conclusion I would say that the television advertising for young children shouldn't be forbidden but we should be aware of the problems it can cause and at least limit the hours of watching.
