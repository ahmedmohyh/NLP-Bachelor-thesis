First the children gets early in contact with the consumer-society if they watching advertising which shows a products like playstuff, so they're learning early how to deal with this kind of advertising.
But on the other site they cant really decide which of the products is good for them or not. That is part of the parents work.
Also the can't deal with spending and holding money, so they always want to have everything they like and this is what the companys aiming for.
But advertising dont have to presenting products olny. It can help the parents to show the children whats wrong, like non-violence advertising.
The fact that children can't deal with money and that they cant buy themselves anything, makes the children when thay see al lot of product ads a irational feeling of how to deal with money.
So the parents have to decide which stuff is good for the children which not, so they have to fight vocaly with their children, cause they want to get all, but someone, in this case it is the parents, have to teach them right consumer-thinking. 
Also the most of the time products of the advertising aren't that usefull for children in this age. In most of the cases it's just stuff to play, but it isn't important at all. The ads on children-channel in TV are only showing this kind of products, so at the end of the day the parents have to pay for it.
At the end u can say that the advertising itself isn't the problem. the problem is how children gets in contact with the consumer-society.
