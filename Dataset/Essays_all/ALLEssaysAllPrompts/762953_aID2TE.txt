Its a difficult question, if the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Some people say the relation is more important, other say perfect knowledge is essential for a teacher.

So the people who are against the excellent knowledge and for the relation between teacher and student say that the students like to go to school when they get on well with the teacher. Also its easy to see that these classes have a good learning atmosphere and so the students lern more and get better in school. Another argument is, that the students learn how to interact with older people, like the teachers and how they have to behave. For the teacher its more fun to give classes with such happy students and they will longer stay being teacher.

But there are also people who are critical and they say the subject and the stuff the students learn is essential for the future. When there is a teacher who doesnt give much worth to subjects the students will have a bigger problem in the university and other schools. Also when the teachers arent strict anymore the students will recognice that and so they will behave like the teacher is a friend of them.

For me both aspects are essential but i think without a good relation between students and teacher the classes wont be good. So for me the relation is more important than the subject being taught, but it needs a mix between those two abilitys.
