There are many different school, many different teachers and many different student all over the world. A teacher's ability to relat well with students is more important than excellent knowledge being taught. The answer is mostly in the middle. There are many facts for and against it. 

I will starts with the facts against. Students go to school to learn many new things and they do not need to have be go relate to the teachers. to learn as much new things as they could they need to have a theacher with an excellent knowledge. If a teacher is not in the position to answer questions the students can not profit from his teacher because than they can leran it by themselves on the internet or similar things. If the teachers are not well relate to students they respect them more and the lessons are not stopped because of changeing the issue. 

In the opposit students eighter like to go to school when they are well related to their teachers.If the teacher has a good relation to his class they will be more concentrated and interessted. If students like to go to school they can learn better and easier because they like that. Many students conect the topic od lesson with his teacher and decide to like it or not. When the teacher is more often and knows his students they will ask him eigther about something they do not understand. Many teachers that have a excellent knowledge are not able to explain something in a easy way so it is difficult to communicate between student and teacher.

In conclusion I think it ist better to have a teacher that will be relate well to student is more important than to have just a excellent knowledge. The best case is to have a teacher that knows much but also carres a good relation between him and his students. To study should make you feel better because you know more and the relation between teacher and student is one important point to achieve this.
