If the lessons ain't nothing but sitting around and listening to the teacher talking about something you ain't interested in, you don't even stand a chance to gain new knowledge. Teachers need to relate to stundents to be able to teach them, to be able to help them. And if you as a student think that the teacher is just somebody standing in front of you who ain't interested in the stuff he's saying, you wouldn't be listening either. And another aspect is that it is important for students and younger people in general to have someone to relate to. But to have an excellent knowledge about the subject being taught is very important to. Imagen a teacher who can relate well with students, but who also doesn't know a thing about his subject. That would be more than just silly. As a final statement I would say that both,the ability to relate to students and the knowledge about something you're suposed to teach, is very important. But all in all i still belive that it's a little bit more important to relate well to your students.
