In my opinion ateachor should have the ability to relate well with students, but he also needs good knowledge about the topic he is teaching. The students go to school because they want to learn something, but if the teacher is not able to do do this it doesnt makes sence for the students to go to school. If the teacher isnt able to relate well with students, it makes school not interresting for the students. This causes that the students  dont have fun at leaning, so that they dont work as hard as they could if they want to. 
 A teacher also has the job to show the students that they have to respect each other and to improve the social abilitys of the students. Teacher which have a good realation to the studens can do this job better, because they are a good example for this. A teacher which has a bad relation to the students cant do this jo because he is a bad example for that. This causes that the students dont trust him even if what he says is right.
A good theacher needs good knowledge about the topic he is teaching and  he also needs a good realtion to the students. Otherwise he isnt able to do his job well. Both is important and both should be required to be a teacher.
