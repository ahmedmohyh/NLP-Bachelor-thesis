In this essay I would like to talk about the following topic: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Arguments that are pro would be the following: In contrast to your time at university it is more important to learn how to learn whilst you are still in school. That may sound strange but knowledge of for example mathematics is not as important as learning how to concentrate or how to learn on your own for a long period of time. So getting more mature in general. Your teacher can really help you with that but only if you have a good relationship with him/her. In the first two weeks of studying mathematics they revise everything you have already learnt so it is not absolutely necessary to know everything perfectly. Also in most jobs you will not need a lot of the things you have learnt so you are going to forget them anyway.
On the other hand one could argue that you do not go to school to chat with your teacher about your feelings and have fun. You are there to learn something. If going to school was only about having fun you could also just stay at home.
I previously mentioned that if you do not have the basic knowledge in a subject it is not impossible to study but it does make it very difficult. If you have bad luck and you get a teacher that only sings songs with you and has fun whilst you learn nothing you will have a major disadvantage at university.  
I think it also depends a lot on your age. In kindergarden it is certainly not as important to learn things like mathematics or german but the older you get the more important it is also in preparation for your studies.
For me personally I think it is very important for a teacher to do both things. Obviously you are allowed to have fun with your students but you are also there to teach them things and prepare them for what comes after their school time.
