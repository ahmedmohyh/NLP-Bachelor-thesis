In my opinion, the relationship between teacher and students is important but without knowledge on teacher's side, you cannot teach a subject that good. If a teacher goes on well with the students and has the knowledge of the subject means not that there will be a course in which the students learn a lot because it needs one more point: A teacher must be able to tell the students something which they understand. If the teacher tells something correctly but none of the students get it, it isn't a good course.
So first of all a teacher must have a very good knowledge, then he must be able to tell something to the students which they understan and when these two points are allright, it is very refreshing if the teacher gets on well with the students.
So, in my opinion it is important that the teacher know the stuff that he explains but it is also important that the students don't think that there is a jerk in front of them. But these points aren't important if the teacher cannot explain his stuff. All these three points must be given to be a very good teacher. The point which could miss is the relationship to the students. This point is more or less optional. But this point makes the difference between a good and a fantastic teacher. A problem which sometimes comes on by this point is that the teacher has to much fun with the students, so they don't take attention to the stuff which they should learn.
