Everyone has been in the school and had many diffrent teacher. Also everyone liked some teacher more and some lesser. And every ond made some experience with some teacher, which konw a lot about their subject but coudln't transmit their knowledge to the student. Otherwise there are some teacher which aren't very well in their subject but they transmite the information very well that everyone can follow and unterstand. 
When you go to school you suspect that your teacher have a big knowledge about his subject. That is very important, then they have to give her knowkedge to the students and when he isn't very good in it then it is verd difficult to teach and for the studants to unterstand. Also when a student woud like to know more than in the normal stoff isthen it's also good for the teacher to know more about it.
The other aspect is, that the teacher should be good in transmit information. Also that he can explain and have enough patient to explain. He should have a hand for children and should have a lot nerves. 
It is trickyto say what is more important for a good teacher. For me it is more helfpul when the teacher relate well then when he have a high knowledge.  Consecuently I think the knowledge is important then with out knowledge you can't give information to other students that they learn some right informations. But in my opinion the point that the teacher relate well is more relvant. Then when the teacher can spread the knowledge well the students unterstand it better. The best salution is when the teacher have bouth, that he have a good balace beetwenn
