A teacher is one of the most influential people in a students life. Therefore it is very important that they are competent and know exctly what they are talking about. But isn't it even more important for a teacher to be able to relate with his students?

First of all, one has to look at a teacher for what he is basically paied to do - teaching his subject. If a teacher lacks in knowledge in the subject he's teaching, it get's very hard for the students to understand his lessons and to really get the stuff he's talking about. This makes perfect sense because how shold you explain a complecx math problem to someone else if you are lacking the demanded knowledge to solve the problem yourself. 

On the other hand, one could also argue that a teacher also serves as a rolemodel, especially if he's teaching students in the teenage years who are very easy to impress with both, good and bad behaiviour. So if there's a teacher who is maybe not the youngest anymore but who tries to understand the new generation and share some important values with them, this is worth a lot! But if the teacher tries to relate with his students too much and almost becomes on of them this isn't good at all because then the students will lose respect and will see him more as a friend they can goof around with than as their teacher. A teacher therefore has to find the right balance.

In my personal opinion I think it's important that a good teacher has both, excellent knowledge and the ability to relate with his students, but if I had to choose what is more important, I would agree with the statement made in the task. I've learned from personal experience that if you have a teacher who really tries to understand you and your generation, who cares about you as a person and who is able to relate to you, that then the whole lerning atmosphere in the classoom changes and everybody get's much more motivated and focused.
