I can´t agree to this statement, because it is most important, that the teacher knows, what he is talking about. If the teacher relates well with the students, they would follow his undervisning, men de ikke kunne laere noget, fordi laereren kan ikke forklare dem, hvad börnene skal laere. Derfor tror jeg, at laerer skal laere flere i universitetet.
Quam quam.

Moreover I am an excellent student and the task is to easy for me.
Some people might agree to this statement, because they wouldn´t learn something, but like to get a new friend, through a good relationship to the teacher. Good relationships between teacher and student, should be forbidden.

I´d like to add, that teachers are unfailable, so this statement must be wrong.!!!!!
