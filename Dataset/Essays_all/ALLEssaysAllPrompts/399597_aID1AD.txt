Televison adverts for young children, should they be allowed? Children so young shouldn't be watching that much television to be influenced by it's adverts, but also children at that specific age are most easily to influence. So now I'm going to bring up some pro- and con-argument head to head to see which of the sides is better.

At first young children are very easy to influence. They believe in a big man with a big belly, in a red coat and perfect white hair, who lives in the uninhabitable place at the north pole with some flying reindeer, one of them with a big nose, and many elves who don't do any other thing the whole year than making presents for the whole world. So when they believe such a story, then they are going to believe every word that is said in advertisments.
On the other hand they want so much  but are happy with so little, at least when I was a child. I wished for the whole Kidoh cristmas catalogue because everything looked so cool. In the end I only got so little or nothing from the catalogue but was still amazed by the other presents I got. So the small children are going to want so much but are only going to get so little.

An other reason to forbid television adverts addressing  our smallest is, that some mothers can't handle it when their children cry, because they can't have something, so they buy their children everything so they just throw their money out the window for things their children play with once or twice.
But how would the television companies not declare bankrupt if they are not going to get all their money from the adverters which is their main source of income. 
Also do children learn that they can't get everything in live they want when they don't get anything from those cool looking TV adverts. This of course only works, if the parents are strong and not just give their children everything they want.

In my opinion television adverts for small children can be allowed, if companies want to invest all that money.
