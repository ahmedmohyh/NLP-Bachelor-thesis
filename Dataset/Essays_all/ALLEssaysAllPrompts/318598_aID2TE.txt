In this essay I'm going to write about if it is bettter, if a teacher has a good ability to relate with his students or if he knows his subject very well.
There is no doubt that a good relationship with a teacher is very important and can be essential for anybodys career in school. It helps the students to keep listening to what the teacher is saying, because it is very hard to listen to a teacher who you don't like. 
A nice teacher might also be able to get the interesst of the students for his subject and with that make it easier for them to follow what he is saying.
But knowledge is very important too, because it can be very frustrating if the students realize the the teacher doesn't know what he's talking about, this will make it very hard for the students to take him seriously and belief in what he's saying. Also if the teacher doesen't know his subject very well he might not be able to explain thesubject correctly and the students will end up with wrog or not fully understood things which might make it harder for them in later life.
Overal a good teacher has to have booth, knowledge and the ability to relate with his students. But as I have to choose between the two, I would go for the ability to relate with the students, because I think they will learn more, so I agree with the statement above.
