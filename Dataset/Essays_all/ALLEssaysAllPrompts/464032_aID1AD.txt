Children learn the most things when they are still very young. Thats a big advantage to learn how to speak or how to go but the disadvantage is, that they also learn the negative things. Television is something fascinating for children and they could watch it for hours. However as mentioned before they also learn from what they see and they relate this with the real world.

Some think that television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden. Actually there is a point and in some situations it is really something bad for the children. When they see something in television that is directly connected to themselves, they want to try it out. Possibly they do not even want to tell something to their parents because they think that if the child in the television did it by himself why should not they be able to do it alone. This can possibly lead to dangerous situations that do not everytime stay without serious consequences.

On the other hand it belongs to every parents own responsibility what to show and what to teach their children. Television advertising does not have to be  something bad it can also be inspirational for the children. In addition many parents get there ideas for presents from television advertising and presents are always something that really can make a child happy.

In my opinion television advertising is not something dangerous for children. According to statistics the chance that it has a bad influence to children is pretty small. There are not happening many accidents due to some children who watched television advertising that was directed to their group of age. I think instead we should make the internet more safe for children instead of the television. The internet is really the more dangerous thing for children.
