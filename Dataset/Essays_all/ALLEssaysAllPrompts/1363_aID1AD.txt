I agree with the statement because nowadays there are so many hidden influences in the television like how to act in our modern century mostly of a bad point of view or in case of business when you want people to need special things to be accepted also in television directed towards young children.
Often tv-shows create a wrong view of the reality like creating a different universe or a `better` world and children at such young age do not understand which one is the real and which is just virtual world.
Also the normal comunication of children get lost because they are sitting in front of television and learning the informal language instead of being outside with others and learn to comunicate in the right way, still  in tv-shows made for kids
The health suffers too because they do not move as much as the other children who playing outside and having the good influences of nature and they get bad eyes by watching television too much.
Children at the age two to five learn mostly imporrtant things in this period like cycling, comunicating or to write their names.
The biggest part of television they can not understand because there are letters, difficult words or formal language.
After all I am still the opinion advertising television directed toward young children in television schould not be allowed.
