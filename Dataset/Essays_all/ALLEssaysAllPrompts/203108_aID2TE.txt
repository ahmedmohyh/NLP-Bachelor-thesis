A major ability a teacher needs to have is to get along with the students and to teach them a subject in an understandable way. So the question I need to clarify is wether the ability to relate to students is more important than knowledge.
 A teacher has to have a certain connection with the student because otherwise the students wouldn't even listen to the teacher. Of course it is important to actually know the subject thats being thaugt but its useless for a student to listen to a person who knows all the facts about a subject but tells them in an unpersonal and missundertandable way. It is annoying and  and the student begins,because he doesn't understand anything, to drift away with his thaugts and he is not curious anymore.
 Another thing we have to think about is that naturally a teacher can't tell something about a subject he doesn't know, so how is he supposed to taugh a subject.  But it doesn't matter if you know as a techer your subject well when you have no baundry to the students ,they probably can somehow pass the test but thats all because students these days have to be flexible and have to know how to handle bad teachers,trust me I know this from expirience. But if they had a teacher who showd passion while the lessons and the students aren't afraid to ask than they would be much better in exams and also for later when they're out of school that the things you learnd in school you can actually use. So besides the knowledge of a teacher there needs to be also a lot of passion for working with students. Teachers need to have a connection to the students.
