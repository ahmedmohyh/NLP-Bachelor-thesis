Contra:
Without excellent knowledge of the subject she or he is teaching they won't be able to teach the students any of it. The students go to school so they learn the things they need to know in their exams. So if they have a bad teacher or a teacher which isn't of great knowledge, the students won't learn a thing. It's important that the teacher can teach them the important things they need to know. It's not just important for them in their exams but also in life further on. And also the students will have a lack of knowledge when they go to university or start a job which can lead to being fired or dropping out of university. This could destroy their career. 

Pro:
But of course teachers should be able to connect and relate with their students. They should be able to see when their students are stressed out or under a lot of pressure. They schould be very understanding when something's going on in a student's personal life. They need to relate to students when they're under a lot of stress because of the exams and not make it even worse by giving the students homework. 

I think there must be a good mixture between both of these statements. The teachers need to have great knowledge in class and need to pass it on to their students, but they also need to be understanding and need to relate to the students problems outside of a classroom. So I think a teacher who can do both, the "in a classroom" and "outside of a classroom" is a really great teacher.
