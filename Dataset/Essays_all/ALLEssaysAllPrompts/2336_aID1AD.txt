The question wheter television advertising directed toward young children shoulld not be allowed is complicated.
On the one hand it would be (Zensur) when you don't allowed the television chanels to show television advertising.
But on the other hand when kids for example see a toy in the television advertising thats were discribed as very cool they believe that and want one no matter how much it cost. There we are at an next argument. Children in this age don't know how to handel with money. They don't know wheter it's expenciv or not they only want to be cool with the newes stoff. 
Last but not least young children don't care about the danger of the for example toys. In the television advertising it would be shown as easy to use but mabye it isn't that easy and than the children hurt themselfes with it. 
To sumerise in my opinion children aged two to five aren't in that age to dicide what's good for them and what's not.
