I absolutely agree with this statement. 
TV adverstising directed toward young children should be illegal. Young children can`t buy the product the adverstising is for anyway. So the advertising should be directed towards their parents and not towards them. this can be very problematic for the parents when they don`t want to buy a certain product or can`t afford it. nowadays children are exposed to advertising everywhere. So I think TV should ot support this and make it worse. of course young children are very important customers and many factories produce tons of toys, clothes and food only for them but in my opinion it should not be allowed to make advertising for someone who isn`t able to buy something on themselves. 

The TV advertising mostly shows things which kids don`t necessarily need but it manipulates them so they believe they need it. And they could make their parents big problems when begging for a toy or whatever tey saw on TV .There could be a damage done in the happy family life when parents and children are fighting over something ugly like this. in order to protect the family advertising should not be allowed.
Dependig on what the advertisement is, it may also be unhealthy for a kid. For example if it`s for sweets or games. the young child won`t understand this and be mad at the parents who are only caring about their child. what I`m trying to say is that advertisment could make it difficult for parents to raise their kid the way they want and buy him or her the things they think it needs. So in conclusion I think that the TV adverstisement should be directed toward parents and not toard theit children.
