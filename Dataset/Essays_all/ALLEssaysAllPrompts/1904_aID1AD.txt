Firstly one can say, that children are even influenced by their friends in kindergarden, so if everyone of your mates has a special toy, of course you would like to have it as well. For example my kind of generation loved pokemon, and because of this trading with cards was acually very common. So it does not matter, when they are influences anywhere. 
 However I believe children do not even understand everything, which is brought to them in advertisements, because their brains are not developed in a way like it is compared to an adult brain. 
 Furthermore espacially young children tend to become addicted faster than exampally teenagers. In my oppinion it is not helpful for two to five aged to watch television that long, because their minds can not progress all the different impressions. 
 Espacially for children it is essencial to experience nature rather than just looking at screens. Because if this generation loses the interst for nature and the amity to animals, they surely will not respect it, when they are grown up.
 We are all living in a world, which lost the care of nature, because making profit and wealth became more important pastly. At least we should care for the future of our following generations, because there is no reason of taking them all their opportunities, by just living "our" life. 
 To put it in a nutshell, I believe that advertisements for young aged children are not helpful and therefore should not be allowed, because they are too influencial and it is better for young children to grow up without a lot of technical supply due to them becoming adults really fast these days.
