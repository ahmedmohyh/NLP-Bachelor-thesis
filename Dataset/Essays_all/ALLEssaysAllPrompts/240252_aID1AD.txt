Advertisements got more popular and have grown a lot of importancy in our society. In particular television advertising is influencing us every day and developed ubiquitous. In this development one way of advertising evolved and has been selected, the advertising toward young children. The question is: "Is television advertising directed toward young children problematic?"

Young children haven't developed their own opinion yet and act very naiv. Their opinion is depended on their parents and other people surrounding them. Because of that advertisements have a very big influence and is more effective. Not only products for these children can be sold easier, also other things can be advertised toward them. For example an advertisement of a shampoo can show a little teddybear using it, so young children develop a sympathy to this shampoo and tell thei parents to buy it.

This principe can be used to sell neary everything to young children, eventhough they don't need it. For example they don't need a shampoo because they already have one, but because they like the teddybear they have to will of getting it anyways. With this methode it isn't difficult to sell products and it is still efficient.

But it also has negative sides, this children for example do not have developed an own opinioni and started to believe what the television or other media told them.

All in all I think there are some problems in advertising products towards children. But it is also nearly impossible to fix this problem and they will grow even more.
