In this essay it's about the relationship with the teacher's and students. The question is if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

If a teacher is very intelligent it doesn't have to mean that he is a good teacher. Maybe his knowledge is excellent but if he can't give that knowledge to the students it doesn't make sens why he is a teacher. The most important thing for the students is that they understand the teacher and that they can learn from him. If the relation with the teacher and student is good it will be automaticaly a better atmospher in the classroom. So the students are more motivated and get better marks. 
But who needs a teacher which has a good realtion with the students but hasn't a good knowledge?
I think it doesn't make sens that a person which can treat students right is automaticaly a good teacher. It needs the knowledge. What should a teacher teach the students if he doesn't know the things.The students can't learn something from someone who doesn't know the things.

I think it needs both. It needs a good knowledge and a teacher needs to relate well with the students. It doesn't need the best knowledge it's enough if he just have a good knowledge. A teacher is also just a person and nobody is perfect. In my opinion it's a little bit more important that the teacher relate well because I know that my marks are better in subject where I have a better relation with the teacher. They are to many teachers that are passiv. They just do their job and the students don't learn anything. If I would be a teacher I would look that I would be a mix. A teacher with maybe not the best knowledge but with a good relation with the students.
