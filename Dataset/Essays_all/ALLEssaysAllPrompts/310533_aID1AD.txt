Some weeks ago my five year old nephew saw an advertisement about a car toy on television. I remember how he immediately called his mother and asked her to buy him that toy. My sister didn't buy it, but it was okay because my nephew already had a big car toy. 

As young children tend to believe everything they get told, they are very likely to be influenced. This is used by many companies through television advertising to make them want something. The pressure of needing something in order to have fun or to be cool already confronts these young children. And if a child doesn't get what it wants, it fastly gets frustrated and sad. This might be caused by the famous phenomenon, which says that children never can get enough toys. On the other hand some might say that it's the fault of the parents as well, who didn't teach their children enough to be happy with a couple of toys. The fact that children aged two to five normally didn't develop that much yet. So they do not realise that something isn't necessary to have even though they are interested in it. Another argument for these television advertisement could be the money these television channels need. During childs programm on television there is always some advertisement. When a child watches a childs series it it understandable that it is normal to show advertisements which are appropriate for children and not to show adults advertisements. Some television channels need these advertising companies to support their channel and to make sure they are still able to show their content in the future. 

To bring it on point: Young children are very easy to get influenced and companies know that. It is the parents challenge to talk to their children about that. In my opinion this still doesn't justify the companies advertising. I think it should not be allowed because these children already get to see many toys in the stores and it just brings more pressure for the parents.
