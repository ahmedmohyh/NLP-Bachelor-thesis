Although to mutch consume of digital media like Smartphones, Computer and Television is´t good at all for young children because it takes big influence on the way their brains develob in a negative way. So responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' TV. 
But if children of the age of two to fife years whatch TV, in germany they are often whatching ''SuperRTL'' and in this childfriendly program they publish many scenes showing violence and there is a lot of advertising to. And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them. so in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and then, because of this normality of violence showen in TV, the children start to behave the same and not just at home but also in the kindergarden and at their friends homes. 
In my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly TV and they should also renew and think about what they show in this kind of TV and if this might be realy childfrtiendly.
