Nowadays television has a huge impact in our society. The television is one of the biggest massmedia that control our society. It has a huge role in our decision making and influences a lot of our actions and ideologies. The biggest group that is affected by the television advertising are young children. They see something in the ads ( espacially toys) and immediately run to their parents and want them to buy it. This "trick" of advertising their products towards children is used by companies because children especially young children are the easiest to manipulate. 
I personally think that the companies are faceless because the use the innocence of the children to make them believe that they need their product. This is one of the reasons why children nowadays own so many toys because the are heavily influenced by the big toy companies and buy their products. Not only do they then own something which they dont really need but they sink into this spiral of consuming more and more. Especially in the virtual age we live in the children are able to purchase "products" through in-app purchases. This leads to that the children don't realize that they did even spend the money and keep on spending more money on the companies' products. Which furthermore lead to a big surprise for the parents because they do not know about the spendings of their children on  the internet.
To sum myself up. I personally think that television advertising or any sort of advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. These children do not know the value and importance of money and dont know how to control their spendings on the internet.
