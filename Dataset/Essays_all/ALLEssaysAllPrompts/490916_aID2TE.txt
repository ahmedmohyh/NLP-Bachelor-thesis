Yes, i pretty much agree with this statement. In the following text i will tell you why.

In my opinion, a teacher who knows everything about his subject doesn't automatically have to be a good teacher. If somebody doesn't know how to teach things to kids or also adults, his knowledge wouldn't be useful at all. We once had a teacher in english who was very educated and she attended the best univerities and enjoeyed the best education. But she didnt know how to deal with students, so she was fucking useless. So i think when a teacher really knows how to teach and the students like him or her, he is a really good teacher, although he sometimes doesn't know everything.
So don't get me wrong, education is important too, but in schools like ours (Im not writing about universities) knowledge is often overestimated.
Another point is that a teacher who is genius couldnt understand students who don't get what the teacher tries to explain, so the teacher would be too educated to explain it8especially in maths). On the other side, a teacher who also used to have problems with this topic knows better how to explain it. So my conclusion is that teachers should have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught AND they also should relate well with the students.
