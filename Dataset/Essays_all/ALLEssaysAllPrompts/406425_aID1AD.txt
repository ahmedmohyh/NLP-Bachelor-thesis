Advertising for kids

In our world of media, advertising is a huge part of our lives. Everytime we go to the internet or watch television advertising accompanies us. The adverts are directed toward every age group, from young to old. Now there's the question if advertising toward young children should be allowed, or not.

Especially young children are depending on their parents. In every category: Their learning processes, their social life and also financially. Because of that fact, it's very questionable if adverts should be allowed towards young children. Everything the children want, the parents have to pay for. Shouldn't parents be able to decide themselves what they want to purchase for their kids? 
The kids are also influenced by the adverts. If they see an advert, they might think that it's the truth that the advert tells, but in the sector of advertising lies are a huge part of the business. That's also a huge argument for forbidding advertising directed toward young children.

Anyhow, advertising should be a free business. Why should the Government be allowed to censore the adverts in those dimensions? 
Adverts directed toward young children are automatically also directed toward their parents, because they are the one's that by the stuff for their children and decide what they want to buy. This makes them legit again, even if it would be forbidden to advertise toward children. So, it wouldn't even be controllable to forbid any adverts according to the age.

I disagree with the statement that Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I think in a free world with a freedom of speech, etc. we should be allowed to advertise toward who we want, especially because it also can not be 100 percent correctly separated toward which age category an advert is directed.
