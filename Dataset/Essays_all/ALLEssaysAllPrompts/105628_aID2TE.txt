This is a quite controvers subject. Excellent knowledge of the subject is of course a very impoertant asset of a teacher. But so is the ability to be able to relate to a student, who for example might have problems understanding what he or she is being taught. A teacher who can relate well with students very probably can explain things better to his students. Because if a student has problems understanding something, a teacher wo can relate well can find a different and/or better way to explain it to his student. On the other hand what benefit does a teacher have who can relate well with his students but doesen't even really know what he is talking about. Surley a teacher must have very good knowledge about the sujbect he is teaching to his students. But one must also not forget that we are all different human beings with different levels of intelligence. The teachers job is that everyone in his class understands and learns the subject he is teaching. I myself think that a teachers ability to relate well with students is far more important than excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching about. The reason why is because I have made personal experience with teachers who have excellent knowledge but they are bad at teaching because they can't relate to us students. If we students had problems understanding the subject the teacher couldn't help us at all because he just couldn't find out where the problems and/or the difficulties were. That's why i think that a teachers ability to relate is so much more important than having excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching about.
