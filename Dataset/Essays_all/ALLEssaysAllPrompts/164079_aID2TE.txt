The most kids want to have a teacher who relates well with them. They are disappointed if the teachers always serious and withdrawn. They want to have a sort of a connection with the teacher. I think that is so important because the teacher gets to know them, so they want to know at least a little about their life to. That is exactely what creates a connection between the student and the teacher, because the stundent gets the feeling that the teacher cares about him, he is , not just a working machine without feelings, he is sometimes sad or angry too.

 In my view that is very important, that the teacher is open and cares about his students, then if the teacher makes the effort to get to know you as a student you will act also differently in his class.Maybe you will work harder for his class or give more imputs. But if the teacher makes clear he is doesn't care about you at all you will never have a connection with him because why sould you take the effort to get to know him or at least to get along with if him if he doesn't eather? 

But for me the knowledge is as much important as to relate well with students. Just recently we have got a new scientist teacher who had really know clue what he was talking about. He always talked nonesence and at the end he haven't knwon what he was talking about, which was really annoing, but I think he wasafter all a really nice person, but it wasn't enough. The class lost the interrest, because the leasons were so boring. And that is the reason why I believe that boththing the knowledge and to relate well with the students is important
