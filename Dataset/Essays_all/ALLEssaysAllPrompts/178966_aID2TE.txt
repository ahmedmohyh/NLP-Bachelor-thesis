School is for everything important. You could learn in school for your life. It is also imprortant that you learn correct things and that these things are a help for the life. Some people of the world could no, go to school so we have to be happy with this situation in our country. 

Firstly, It would be great for the people who go to school that the teacher is ability to relate well, but we want learn something. We want learn the things at the school and I think this is important that we could learn, because it is not just a time to have fun it is a time to manage the live and the future.

Secondly, It is a fact that we pay for the school. So if the teacher get money for his work, he has to give information to us and he has to know what he talks. His knowlegde has to be excellent, because in Switzerland gets the teacher good money and if the teacher do not have this knowledge, he would not be a teacher, because it is not fair that a teacher get money and then he do not work for that.

An other and last thing is that we want information who are correct. I think that we could get this information if the teacher has an excellent knowledge. So it is important to get correct information, because we talk with other people and if the informations are not correct what we learn, the other people would be laugh about us.

At the end I want to say that it is amazing that the teacher is abillity to relate well with students, but the excellent knowledge is more important than the fun in class.
