No, I don't agree with the statement.
One of the reasons why I don't agree with it is that the television advertising could help the parents to find gift ideas. Otherwise, they would still buy old things and would be aware of new games for example. I don't see any point why it should't be allowed to advertise directly toward little kids, because they won't just go and buy the advertised product. They would still have to ask their parents. It is much better to advertise directly toward them than advertise for products they won't buy in the next ten years. Another thing is that the parents know that the kids would see just things for their age, if the don't change the channel.
 I also see a positive point for the companies, because the will advertise and about 85% of the viewers would be a potential buyer. So a win-win situation in my opinion.

 But the comanies should stay fair and should't ``brainwash`` the kids. Otherwise it woulb be very hard for the parents because the children would want to buy one thing after another. They shouldn't just think about how to make the most sales and lie the whole time. The kids would be sad and that should not be the case.

To sum up, I don't see a problem with companies that advertise directly toward small children, as long as they stay fair and don't try to sell them as much as possible.
