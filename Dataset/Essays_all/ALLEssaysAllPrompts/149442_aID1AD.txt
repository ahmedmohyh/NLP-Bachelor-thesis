We all remember the times we were allowed to watch televison as a child. All those funny and interesting shows and the advertisements in between were an easy distraction after school. Often we would run to our parents afterwards and tell them of the new toy we saw that we want to play with immediately. But is it right to show advertisements to young children, as they are extremely easily influenced?
Children aged two to five are still learning a lot about the world surrounding them. They often don't have their own opinion yet. That's why they are a lot more influenced by advertisements. They want to own everything they see on television as they believe everything that is said there. But they are also learning. And if they are never confronted with advertisements they wont learn to resist them. In this age they can't just go and buy everything they want, which means that the parents can still control them and teach them that advertisements only tell the benefits of a product. If a child learns that and is able to do its research before buying everything that sounds interesting, it has learned a mutual lesson. Of course it can also make children unhappy if they always want something they can't have and if they are never just happy with what they already own. But the chanals for children also have to get money from somewhere. If they have enough income, they can fund better shows that are better produced.
In the end I think that advertisements aren't extremely good for children, but they also don't hurt them. Which is why I don't understand why they should be forbidden. And if parents don't like their children to be confronted with televison advertising, they can just limit their childrens access to the television. There should be enough other things that children can do that are more creative anyways.
