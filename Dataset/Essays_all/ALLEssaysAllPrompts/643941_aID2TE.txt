I agree with this statement, beause I think it's important that a teacher is ability to relate well with students and that's more important than exellent knowledge of th subject beeing taught. For me it's important, that a teacher can understand me and that he know if the class has a lot of stres or not. I don't like teachers who cannot understand when a class has a lot of stress. 
I like teachers if they prepare their lesson very well and I think it's not okay if teachers are not prepare,bechause I have also to do my homework and to learning for exams. When a teacher is well prepare, then I like it to go to school, but when a teacher is not preapare then is the lesson really borring. 
For me it is important that my teachers know how I am feeling. For other student is it impotant too.
