In this generation it's difficult to forbid young children not to watch television. If the TV is once turned on, you can't turn it off.

For young children there are alot of TV series, programms and advertising, which help kids to learn new stuff or the language. So it has a good side, but also a bad side. The kids could learn the language faster and easier by watching television with animation and sound and so they would be better prepared for the school. The cartoons, which are made for children are also very funny and great for them, because they show them how to do things right and what's wrong and they're also cute. So it pull up the kids very quick. But if they watch to much television, it could damage their eyes. The kids would just stare at the television and nowhere else. They wouldn't play with toys or go outside. They would just watch TV and wouldn't learn or do other stuffs. Also the communication get worse. The young children get isolated with themselves and would not communicate for example with their parents. They just want more and more of the cartoons or other programms and they would become connected with the television. 

There would be a solution, how to allow it without damaging the young children. The parents could make a plan or just say that the child can watch TV for a hour and after that they have to play with toys or do other things. They shouldn't allow the kids to watch TV by themselves. 





(I understood the statement wrong and noticed it at the end, so I hadn't time to change it. First I thought it was that young children should't be allowed to watch TV.. sorry)
