In the following text i will discuss if television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed.

On the one hand these advertising help parents to find new cool things for their children to play with but on the other hand the children get very influenced by the products shown on TV. I remember when i was young i always wanted to have the thing which were shown on TV. Otherwise there are advertisings like Durex or stuff like this which are in my opinion not good for the little ones. Furthermore it exist ads like the McDonalds advertising which has a big influence, I have seen a movie once, it wqas about a man eating mc donalds everyday and in this movie they were asking kids if they new the hymne of the United States but they didnt know and when the man ask them so sing the song of Ronald McDonald they knew exactly how to sing it.

So in my opinion, there are different kinds od ad which can be shown to kids, because there are ads which are made for little ones and their parents like the babyborn ad but on the other side there are way too much ads which have a negative influence to kids. Me as a child my dad only allowed me to watch KiKa because there was no advertising, only for there programm, but what he didnt know i watched super RTL secretly at my friends house. The only way to prevent kids from bad influence is to forbid advertising on kids channels, so it should be allowed on normal channels but not on kids ones.
