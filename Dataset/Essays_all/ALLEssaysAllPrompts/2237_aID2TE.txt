Teachers

If a teacher has not such an excellent knowledge about his subject the students may do not learn that much as if they had a teacher with a bright knowledge about his subject. Furthermore it is important to know that much so you can answer questions of the students that are more complex and have nothing to do with your actual topic but are maybe more interesting for the pupils. But sometimes he could expect too much of his pupils so he gives them very hard exercises where the pupils get mad because they cannot solve them and they do not tell it the teacher because his relations to the students are not that well.
If he can relate well with his pupils he is able to give them information that is stuck in their head for many years and not just until the next exam. So when he talks with the students and listens to them he will be able to make his lessons more interesting and motivate them to become more active. By doing that he may will be able to teach his pupils more than a well informed teacher with no good relations to his students could do because they will not listen to the teacher  that well if his lessons are boring. 
So in my opinion it is more important to have a good relation to his students than having an excellente knowledge about his subject for the reason that they learn more things they can remember in their later life and their time in school becomes a little better if they are looking forward to a lesson that they like. And nothing is more important than learning something while you have a little fun.
