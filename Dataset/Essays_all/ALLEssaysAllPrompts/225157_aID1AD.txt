Nowadays, advertising in TV is one of the most efficient ways to generate attention towards a new product that you might want to sell. Especially if this new product is for little children, because they are very inflenciable and you can easily convince them to buy a new toy just becuase it looks nice.

I wonder why we should abolish directed advertisements toward young children because I do not think that this is that much of a deal. If you think about it, at the end the parents need to decide if they want to buy their child a new toy or if they do not, children cannot go out and buy it by themselves. Advertisements on TV channels that were specificly made for two to five year old children, often use advertisement to educate our future generation and I personally think, that this is a good way to explain things to the young part of our society.

On the other hand, TV addiction at this age is a serious problem. Young children tend to spend more and more time in front of the television in this day and age. When I was younger I used to go outside and play football all day long but today, this just does not seem to be the case. Children often spend the hole day watching TV and playing videogames and because advertisements promotes this new technologies I would say that it would not be a dumb idea to prohibit directed advertisement for these little children. An other negative aspect, is that if children see something they want on TV and they like it, they will do whatever it takes to convince their parents to buy that new toy. This is often somthing that ends badly.

In conclusion I do not think that this kind of advertising should not be allowed because it is a way of entertainig our little children as well as a form of education via TV. I used to love advertisements, especially before christmas eve because they were very well done and I would know what I would ask Santa Claus to bring me that year.
