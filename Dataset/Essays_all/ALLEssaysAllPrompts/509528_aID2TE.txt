The question is, if it has any influences to the children/to the teacher when they are not very well together. Maybe, the motivation is higher, when the children like the teacher or when the teacher likes the children. They are working more efficient together and the students are more motivated when they have to solve tasks they don't like. It's not a secret that it is important to get on well with children. You have to be able to be strict and motivating. Otherwise, the children aren't listening and are chatting together. As a teacher it is the most difficult task that you have to balance between being funny, motivating, being fair etc. and being strict and bring the knowledge to the students. A lot of students can't handle it when a teacher gets too stict and have a fear of writing a bad mark. They are under pressure and these aren't able to safe the informations anymore. On the otherside the students don't learn because they don't mind and they think they will write a good mark anyway.

My opinion is that it is more important for a child, who needs more help than others, to get on well with the teacher because he/she has to study more than others and as a result, it needs more motivation. When you have a child in class who doens't have any difficulties in the lessons, then it doesn't matter if it likes the teacher, because for him/her it's easy to safe the informations and they don't need to have a lot of motivation. The students know when a teacher loves his job and doing it with passion. And so are the students more passionate to learn topics, because it makes a lot of fun.
