The clock rings and the students walk slowly into their classrooms where the teacher waits in front of them. They take their seats and the lesson starts. Biology.
The actual subject is how the human DNA functions. The teacher is standing in front of the blackboard and he tries to make a sketch of the DNA strings in our cells, but it just looks like a messed up rope in the heart of an egg. Do you want to learn things in this way?

The example at the top shows us a teacher with no excellent knowledge of his subject, it's clear that we all rather want to learn correct things instead of messed up contents. But there are also other things than excellent knowledge that make a teacher a good teacher. For example that the teacher is able to realete well with students beacause if he is able to, the students will be more interested in the subject and maybe they will learn more. 

On the other hand it is absolutely not okay if a teacher teaches falses things to his students. We go to scool to learn important things we will remember our whole lifes and the teachers are responsilble to solve this exercise with all their knowledge.

For me it is a very difficult question. I think it depends a bit on the subject. In subjects like mathematics or biology I think ist is important that the things teachers teach us are correct. In languages I prefer the teacher that relates well with us students. An other thing that it depends on ist the age of the students. In the primary scool I think it's much more important that the taechers get on well with the students, the knowledge doesn't have to be excellent, good is enough. The older the students get, the more important gets an excellent knowledge.
