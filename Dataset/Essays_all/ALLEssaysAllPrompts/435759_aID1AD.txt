Now our days, the young children watch a lot of TV and there are more and more television advertising directed toward them. Which influence does it have of our future generation? Should we bane it?

At first, young children take example of what they see. If they see other children playing with LEGO, they want to do the same. So they ask them parents to gave them one for their birthday or for christmas. But no all parents have the money to buy what thier children ask to.

On the other hand, if the television advertising is good, it can show the children what they should or should not do. For example an advertising showing children eating fruits and legums. In this case, it is good thing that the children do the same.

Nevertheless, a young child has not the critising sense. If he does not have the toy he saw on TV, he would be very sade. Because in the television advertising, the children were happy with this toy, and he would think that if he does not have this toy, he could not be happy.

To conclude, I think we should bane commertial advertising directed to young childen on television.
