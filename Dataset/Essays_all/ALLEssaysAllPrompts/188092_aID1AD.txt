Should be not allowed are very strong words. In my opinion its impossible to prohibit television advertising for children. Its in the responsibility from the parents. And its the same with much other things. The parents wants to shelter the children from every bad things. Sometimes also advertising is bad. Also here the parents decides how much they want to shelter their children. But at some point of age the parents couldn't shelter the children from television advertising. So it doesn't matter what the parent do? No, its matter very hard. Because its diffrent for the children if they see in the aged three everything in the advertising or with eleven. So at the end the parents have to asked themselves: What it good for my child?
Now i wrote much about parents and their children. But whats with a child which see every television advertising at the aged from two. I think its have more influence then we think At first children learnd from everything something. So they would learn for example the language from the advertising. Also
