What is more important? That your teacher is very good at relating to students or that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
In Switzerland you have to pass through many years of preparation before you're allowed to teach at a gymnasium so theoreticly you should know your subject quite well and also be able to relate well with students, but as I said only thoereticly.
Imagine your teacher is perfect at relating with students but has no clue of what he's talking about, he could teach you very well but what should he teach you if he's not informed at all? On the other hand it's not much use to the stundents to have a teacher who realy knows his subject without the ability to show you how you can apply it.
I have a teacher who, I think, knows his subject but isn't that good at teaching, there just aren't any good structures behind his methods, and at the end of the day we don't learn much at all.
I think both extremes are quite bad for a student because in both they don't learn much. In my opinion the best would be to have some one who is in between of those two extremes, he doesn't have to know everything but should be able to pass the knowledge that he has on to the learning pupils.
