Relation betwee
For every teacher it means something else wehn you talk about relating well with students. It's important that a teacher relates well with students, but not too well. But what does that mean?
Also has a teacher to be able to know exactly what he's teaching.

I think it's important that a teacher is kind and emphatic to the students. It's an advantage when the teacher knows the students and when there's a good relationship between them. But sometimes a teacher has a relationship with the students which is too good and too deep. That can be shown e.g. when he talks with them a lot about his private life or when he's more interested in the students than just in their school work. So a teacher has to be able to let the relationship between students not getting deeper that on the school level.
Also should a teacher know exactly what he's teaching. To become a teacher, he had to study all subjects he's teaching now, and he's the one who's teaching the students. He has to be able to answer the questions about the subjects and to give his knowledge further to the students. 

To conclude, in my opinion both things are important; a teacher has to be able to relate well with students, but he has also to have an excellent knowledge of the subject. The mixture of both is the best thing; the relationship between students and the teacher should rest on the school level, and the teacher should be able to help the students if they need help in school subjects. But when a teacher relates too well with students but he hasn't an excellent knowledge on the subjects, he doesn't seem very serious.
