In the following text I will elaborate on the question wether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
A teacher has to be well educated to do his job, teaching, very well. Studying at a university and learning how to relate to students and how to teach properly is very important. Teachers have the resposibility to teach their students in a correct way to prepare them for their future life. Students have to learn in school; the content of the lessons given by the teachers must help them to be well prepared for the rest of their lifes. 
But it is not just important to know much to get a good job-the relations between people and to know how to treat others and how to behave or the own self-appearance also plays a very big role. It will not only help students get the job they want, it also builds up their selves. If the students are understood by their teachers, they are more likely not only to learn with more enthousiasm, but also to gain important features as self-awareness and maybe even self-esteem. Teachers are more likely to help their students with questions and give them constructive critic. That's how the teenagers learn in a easy, free and vouluntary way so that they can reach their goal and become not only a good and well-informend student, but also a good person.
To summarize, I agree with the statement that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is very important. But a teacher's ability to relate well with students is the most important quality in order to assure the students development and ability and will to learn.
