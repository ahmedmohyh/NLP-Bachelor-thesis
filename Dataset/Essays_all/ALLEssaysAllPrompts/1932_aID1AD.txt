If you watch tv you see lots of advertises. On channels like Super RTL for example are mostly advertises for young children. The question is if advertises which directly advertise to young children espacially in age two to five should be forbidden.

The problem of those advertises are that things are shown better than they are in reality. Small children who don`t know about that see those advertises and want to have everything that looks interesting even if it isn`t in reality. For example if a little boy sees an advertise of a new Playmobil ship which looks very interesting this boy wants to have this Playmobil ship. It is much easier to impress a little child than to impress an adult because the older you are the more you know about life and who you get influenced by advertises for example. Companies use a lot of tricks to impress people because they want the people to buy trhier products. On one hand this can be very annoying for his parents. On the other hand parents can decide on their own what they buy for their children.  Parents can also tell their children that they should not believe everything they see and that things aren`t as good as they are shown in advertises. nother reason why those advertises should not be forbidden is that nearly every type of advertise is allowed. Also advertises of sex toys on pages like amorelie are allowed. And this advertises are in tv in a time every child can qatch tv. Sex toys advertises or alcohol advertises should be forbidden in times children can watch tv.

I think those advertises should not be forbidden. Advertises can influence children very easily but small children aged from two to five are not able to buy everything they want. Their parents earn the money of which they buy everything. As a consequence of that they also decide what they buy for their children. I would more think about forbidding other types of advertises.
