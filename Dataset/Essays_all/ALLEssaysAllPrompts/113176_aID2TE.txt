Relationship or knowledge?

What is more important, to know a lot or to have a good relationship with the students? Both things are important but not every teacher has these. Which one is better?

Knowledge about a subject is definetly very important. If a person does not know a subject well, then this person is not able to explain this subject properly. If a teacher has no knowledge, then he can not teach his students well. For example if the student asks a specific question, and the teacher can not answer that question, then the student will lose respect in front of the teacher and the teacher might have problems later on regarding his status as a teacher. Nobody wants a stupid teacher. A teacher has to be a mentor, somebody you look up to. 

Most teachers have an exellent knowledge abot the taught subject, but on the other hand not all teachers have a good relationship with their students. In some cases there might occur a problem, suc as the student not respecting the teacher. Such cases can be really hard to deal with. When the student is rude to the teacher, then the teacher will face a hard time trying to teach that person or even the whole class. Then the grades of said student will drop and he will hesitate, if he has to do a specific task or if he has to learn.

In my opinion both things are important, but knowledge is maybe a little bit more important. Even if the teacher is sometimes a little harsh or maybe is asking a lof of his students, then they will still learn a lot from him. In my past, I had a very demanding teacher. He was not very kind and most students did not like im, but the class learnt a lot from him. This teacher did not have the best relationship with the class, but he had a gigantic knowledge about everything and we learnt a lot.
