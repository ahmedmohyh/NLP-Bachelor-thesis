We live in a world full of advertising. But is every kind of advertising really necessary?There is a big debate about if or if not tv spots towards young children should be allowed.Television advertising is a economical methode and should have nothing to do with the education and process of growing up from children.

On the one hand children in the age between two and five are not able to understand the reasons or messages which a television advertising wants to give. However it is a try to influence their parents. Therefore it has nothing to do with children themselves and should be allowed. There are surely as many parents or adults watching children channels as young children. Watching television is nothing new for the youngest generation of today so television advertising is not eather.

On the other hand children should not watch a lot of television in that young age. It affects their mental growth and gives them a huge amount of informations which they do not really understand. The aim of an television advertising is to give as much informations as possible in as little time as possible. Most advertisements are also an economical methode to get people to buy the things which were able to be seen in the advertisements. But a lot of experts say that economy should not be everywhere.

In my opinion young children should not watch a lot of television in general. Television advertising is an economical methode and should have nothing to do whith the education of our children. I think that there should exist television channels for children without television advertising even if it does not afecct them in a dramatic way.
