The question if television have not to be allowed to young children is diskussed from many people.
A big problem is the lenguage from many tv-shows. For example "Teletabis" have a very bad lenguage, because the characters talk like little children they just start to talk. So if many young children see this TV-show to often they don´t get a better lenguage. 
On the other side there are many TV-shows where the kids lern new tings. For example "Dora" in the german Television. She teach children in english on a way that everybody can understand this. So young children heard this language in young years of their life and maby they learn faster if they get it in a school lesson.
Children have to learn many things about our nature. They have to learn what can hurts for example. It is a big problem that many children and teenagers don´t go outside. They sit in front of the computer or the Television to often. But inside they don´t can learn how to climb on a tree. Young children need a social life and it´s impossible to have a social if they´re always inside the house or the flat and also not in front of the television.
It´s a fact that the internet will be more important in our future. Young children could learn how to use electronic things with help from the television. They will be confrontet with technic very fast and every genartion get faster an cell phone or something else. The Television could help to teach young children in technic.

On my mind every adult have to choise for him- or her self. I know it could get problems if it not be allowed and other young children watch every day Television. Because it´s a crazy atwenture to see for the first times unknown people or unknown animals in the television. 
I would allowed my young children to watch television, because everybody do it today and I think it´s more easier for my child to learn this thing when it is young. But it´s have to be a rule how long the child watch television.
