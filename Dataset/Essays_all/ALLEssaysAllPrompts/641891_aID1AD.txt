Advertissments make up a lot of parts in nowadays television. Advertising is a big market in this industry. This televised advertissments are directed to various factors, including age or gender. In various occasions there even is advertising directed toward young children. Because of their young age such advertissments can easily influence the children, more than in every other field of age. Should this type of advertising be banned, or is this advertising such as every other?

Generally, television advertising directed towards children is like every other type of advertising. It is fitted to their special needs. In this age its often toys or other media made for entertainment. It may does not matter if this advertising does strongly influence the children in their opinions and wishes. Rather does the influence on the parents matter. They are the one wich will buy the toys advertised in the TV. Because there is a authority wich can decide wether to buy a product or not, the influence on the young children does hardly matter.

On the other hand, children can be very invested in their wishes and opinions. It is often the case that they get what they want. Specially in a time period like christmas. This is also the reason why Advertissments with toys and similar products are displayed more before christmas. The marketing strategy of most of the companies is clearly to make the most of the easily influencable children. Wich is in a economial point of view rather understandable. It is more a thing of morals to bann this type of advertising.

In my opinion, companies really take an advantage on the young children. Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence. Even when this makes sense in a economic way, this strategy of advertising should not be allowed.
