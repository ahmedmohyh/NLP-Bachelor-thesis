In the following I am going to show you arguments for and against the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
An argument for this statement includes the fact that for those children advertising could be an oportunity to get to know things they have not known yet. They can get the impression of things they have not seen yet which can be an intresting experience for them. 
On the other hand I want to give arguments against that statement. Advertising directed toward young children may have a bad influence on them because they get manipulated to buy things. It is a manipulation in fact that they are shown things like toys which are also very expensive. It could lead to problemes like getting addicted to things like that and wanting more and more toys which could also lead to problemes with money. Furthermore it is a process of stealing 
the free choice of childreen. They should have the right to choose whatever they want by themselves and not by the manipulation of advertisings.
To put it in a nutshell I prefer the opinion that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because they should have the right to choose their own intrests and get to be independent in very early ages.
