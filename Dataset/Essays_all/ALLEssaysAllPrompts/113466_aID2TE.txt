To become a teacher, it is nessesary to pass the final examn in this subject he wants to educate. But is he, after he has passed the test a good teacher? To educate a specific subject is not that easy and it is true, a good teacher should have more abilities than just know all the stuff he wants to educate. In every class are different students who learn in a completly different way and some of them have sometimes more, sometimes less time zu understand the material. So the teacher must know different ways to explain his things to his studants. For the good and fast persons in his classes, he has to know much more about his topic than the general class has to know because there will always be some people who are much more interested in details and backgrounds of the material they have to learn. So a excellent knowledge is a must for a teacher. But, as I said before, there are many other things a good teacher has to know. How to inspire his students, how to explain the hard facts about his subject, how to design a lesson which isn't boring and has many different ways of working in it and how to talk to them in a way they like him as a teacher. As we all know, when students like their teacher, they're much more motivated for his lessons and much more willed to learn something. And in this case, if a teacher has a really good social potential, it doesn't matter if he doesn't know something right after the question once. 
In my opinion and in cause of these many facts, what a really good teacher is made of, a teacher's ability to relate is much more important than his knowledge, which is important but not at the very first point. So, I totally agree with this statement.
