The provided statement is not in correlation with what I experienced in my life. This is why I disagree with it. If a teacher is able to relate well with his students this leads to a better class room climate. It is clear that this is a positive effect and improves the motivation of the students. If I exagerate a little: Who does like to go to a boring class with a teacher that only speaks his subject but not the language of the students and does not have any sense of humour? Nobody. But are there people who like to sit in class and have fun with the classmates and the teacher does not intervene or even thinks it's okay to behave this way? I'd say most of the students would be very happy about this type of teacher. Until their last days at school when they realize that they're not ready for their finals since their teacher was unable to well explain them their subjects and just let them hang around in their classrooms. Probably such a teacher wouldn't be able to explain the same thing in a different way or from a different point of view if a student just doesn't get the point behind it or be unable to give satisfying answers to questions, which is very important. And this is when school starts to loose reputation and academic value. 
The best way of teaching would consist of both of the factors: A good knowledge of the subject and the ability to relate more or less well with the students. With a good combination of both factors and additionally an interesting way of teaching you would be able to reach a class climate that is motivating and on the same time challenging and the students would succeed. In both cases if only one of the two provided factors would be given, the teacher can't teach very well. Either because the class wouldn't pay attention or due to his inabilties.
