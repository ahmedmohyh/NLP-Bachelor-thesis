Advertising can be really abboying. For exemple when you want to watch a youtube video about cars and you have to watch a clip about a datingwebsite first. But for parents can it be even worse, because not they get trapped by advertising, there kids do. 
When you get odler you learn to understand the differents between what you need and what you would like to have, and you know what you are able to afford. You have the ability to decide what you want to spend your money for. For young children thats diffrent. They do not know how to handle money, they can not really tell the differents between what they want and what they need. So they are great victims for advertising. But the problem is they haven't even the money to buy it, so the real victims of advertising directed toward young children, are their parents. They have to deal with crying babys, because they refuse to buy them a new toy. Maybe they really would like to buy it for their children but they can't afford it can be heartbreaking if they see them being sad. Another possibility would be if the parents already have problems to show dominance, and it gets even more difficult when they see new stuff on television all the time.
So it's a question about what is more important for us. Do we want free economic possibilities or do we want to help the parents raise the next generation?
For me it's definitly the second point. I think it's already a big challenge to be a parent and we do not have to make it more difficult for them, by using little children without experience as their weakness.
