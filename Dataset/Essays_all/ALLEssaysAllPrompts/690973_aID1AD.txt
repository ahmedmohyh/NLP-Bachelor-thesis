I think that televiion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. In that early phase of their life, these children begin to develope their thinking, morality and behaviour. With the advertising directed to young children, their interest in products and offers could be influenced even controled by the firms who make these advertising. Through the advertising in the early phase of the children's life, the firms achieve to get loyal clients in the future because these children grown up with these firmsin their minds. We should protected our children from such an influence because these children are our future and they should develope a free mind and not grow up with the influence of big firms which have only an interst in their profit. These firms don't see us people as humans, they see us simply as clients.
And I'm gonna be honest wit you. I don't see one positive argument to allow advertising which are directed toward young children. These positive arguments would all end with the same goal: money.
