When comparing a teacher's ability to relate well with students and his or her excellent knowledge of the subject being taught one might think that one is more important than the other. In this essay, I try to clear this matter. 
You might think the teacher's knowledge on the subject is more important because in order to pass on any kind of knowledge correctly a teacher must master the subject they are teaching. Also, it is important to guarantee that the information that is passed down to the younger generations is neither biased nor wrong. Because of these reasons the teacher's knowledge might be more important than his/her ability to relate well with students. 
On the other hand, there are also counterarguments that favour the contrary. Without any ability to relate to their students teachers become simple information sources that are not personal in any way. What qualifies a teacher is his/her way of transmitting complex knowledge in a way that is clear for his/her students. And if that does not happen then the students will not be able to process the information they are bombarded with. Therefore, it is more important to relate well with students. 
My personal opinion on this matter is that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I, as a student, also grapple with the content of my lessons because of the inability of some teachers to explain a matter properly. Because of this, i agree with the statement.
