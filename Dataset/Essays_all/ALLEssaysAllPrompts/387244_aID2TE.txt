A teacher is there for many reason, but is his relatibility more important as his knowledge . Imagine a teacher with perfect knowledge, but he doesn't understand the students. I think it's really important to have an understanding between the teacher and student. You will have to spend many hours with eachother and the studying will discrease, if there's always a tension in the classroom. On the other hand would you a teacher who can't answer your questions and doesn't give the right information. There's a reason why you go to school and I think especially in the upper studies, you would prefer a teacher with excellent knowledge. A teacher who doesn't know about your situation and always gives you a lot of homework can be a pain in the ass,  but a teacher telling you about things he doesn't know would be more demanging. You can't ask him questions about the subject, because he doesn't know either or he doesn't know how to explain things. 

In conclusion I think both understanding and knowledge are very important. But in my point of view the understanding is not more important than the knowledge. A teacher's ability to relate is just a way to make your school life better. The knowledge is the thing which brings you further in life. I thinks is useless to go to school when you don't have a teacher with an excellent knowledge. Sure a teacher who can relate can be nice and can motivate you, but in the end of the day the knowledge counts and not the social skills of the teacher.
