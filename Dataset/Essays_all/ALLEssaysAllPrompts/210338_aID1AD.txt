I agree with this statement. I think, that television advertising could influence children very much and often not in a good way.

Especially in the age of two to five children learn from their environement and believe in everything what they see and hear. You can tell them something about magic or animals which can speak and they believe you because they don't know it better. They don't have other experiences or can check something in the internet or in books. They just trust you and the television "industry" knows how to use this. So television advertising isn't good for children, because you can't controll what your child is looking at. Another thing is, that parents are under pressure, if their child can see to much of television advertising. Today, every family will be the best and happiest, so the children should have everything. If the child see a new doll or a new car they want it and the parents will buy it.

But on the other hand I think it could be very difficult and complicate to do television without television advertising just for children. Often the channels are financed by some companies or factorys which pay the channel for showing their products. As an effect some of the channels couldn't maybe exist. 

In the end it's a question of the moral. What is more important? The future of the children or the surviving of the channels? I know this question isn't really fair, but for me it's simple. I'm against television advertising and that's the reason why I agree with this statement.
