In the following text I am going to write pro and contra arguments against the following statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

It is important that students learn something in the leasons, because they will write a Klausur or something like that. Maybe they also need especially that knowledge in their future, for their job. The students go to school, because they want to learn something and not because their teacher is so nice to him/her.

But also it is important that the teacher can teach the subject as a "friend", because it is not so good when the student cannot handle with the teacher and maybe is afraid of him/her.Then the student does not listen and does not learn something and also does not want to learn something, and maybe he/she will need it, like i said, for his/her future, and also he/she will write a wrong note in the next Klausur. In the baddest situation he/she will repeat the year and then he/she will get the same teacher again and the whole situation will repeat. 

I think that both things are important, because you must learn something in the subject, but you also must can handle with your teacher, because that is why you want to learn something and learn for a Klausur and maybe you have fun to learn something from your teacher. Maybe when the teacher likes the whole class, he will decorate the lessons more creative and you will have more fun to learn and to be in school.
