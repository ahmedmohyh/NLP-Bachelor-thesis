The most common expectation from a teacher is that he knows a lot about the subject he is teaching. Relating well with students is probably the second factor that comes into someones mind while thinking about traits of a good teacher. But is this knowledge really more important than social aspects?

It is common sense that students can not learn anything, if the teacher does not know how to teach it to the class. No matter how much he knows about the subject he is teaching, if he can not make the students understand what he is talking about, they will have a lot of trouble understanding the material. So knowledge alone can not make a teacher a good one.

On the other hand, you can say that a teacher who does not know everything about specific parts of his subject, but instead knows how to explain things so that the students understand, will more likely have a successful class and the students will learn something. But in order to ecplain something well, you have to know it well so having a certain knowledge is a necessary foundation for good explanations. 
Also, in case a student wants to know more about certain aspects that the teacher is not sure about, he can do some extra research on it and then explain those aspects to the student, although his knowledge was not perfect in the first place.

Considering those arguments, I think it is a good mixture of both traits that make a good teacher. He has to be able to explain things well but in order to do so, he also has to have a certain amount of knowledge on his subject. This knowledge does not necessarily has to be excellent, therefor I disagree with this statement.
