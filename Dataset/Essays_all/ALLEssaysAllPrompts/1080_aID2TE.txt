Often students critize that their teachers cannot understand them or relate to them. But is it more important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching or is it more important that he can relate with the students. In the following lines I am going to discuss this question and give my own opinion. 

If I imagine myself a teacher that has a great understanding of his studensts but does not konw anything about the subject he is teaching, then I think everybody can imagine that the students would not learn anything about the topic at all. On the other hand an excellent knowledge is not all it takes to be a good teacher. I have experienced several teachers who I think really loved their job and wanted to teach their students a lot because they had know nearly everything about the topics they thaught. It always ended the same way - the teachers would explain the topics in the most comlicated way I could have ever imagined. But if a student asked a questions, the teacher would not understand why the student could not understand the topic. Later when another teacher explaind the topic or I looked it up on the internet by myself, I mostly ended up finding out that the topic itself was not that difficult to understand at all. But the teachers could just not understand how hard it was for us to understand a topic that seemed so simple to them.

So all in all I think it needs a mixture of an excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugth and the ability to relate with the students. If a teacher just fulfills one criteria I do not think that he will be able to teach his students a lot although he probably really wants to. Because if a teacher can relate well to the students, he can understand what their problems are so that it is easier for him to help them.
