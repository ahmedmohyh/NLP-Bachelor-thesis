A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. :

I do not absolutely agree with this statement. I thinke both aspects are very important but the one which is more important for me is the knowledge of the subject.

I think the first ability a teacher should have is a good knowledge of the subject he teaches. If he has not he is not able to help his students if they have any problems. And the teacher sould be absolutely sure about what he is telling the students. But it is also very important that he is able to relate well with students, so that they like the subjct, even if it is not their best or their favourite subject. If the theacher relates well with his student the chance is bigger that they are interessted in learning thinks and that they are working well during the lessons. And it is a lot more fun for both sides, for the students an for the teachers if they get on well with each other. I do also think that it depends on the situation, that means on the grade of the class the teacher teaches. In kindergarden for example it is more important to get on well with the children and in grammar school it is more important to have an excellent knowledge of thesubjectee

So I do not completely disagree with the statement which is on top of this essay but I so also not agree because I think both things are very important and for me the one which is a bit moreimportant is the knowledge of the subject being taught.
