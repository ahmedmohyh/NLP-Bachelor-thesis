Many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising directed toward young children who are aged two to five should or should not be allowed.
Nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young one's who aren't even old enough to understand everything that is happening. 
That is why they probably don't really understand the television advertising which is why it isn't dangerous when it's directed toward them. The young children can only understand everything through their vision.
When parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an advantage of the advertising.
But there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are just as young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about as well. Children who aren't old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work. The problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television which means that they also could'nt act in movies or television shows and then again the movies would become rather boring. 
All in all there is no reason for me why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the fact that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children don't even understand what is happening in there.
