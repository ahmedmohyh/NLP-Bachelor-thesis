Today, many young children watch in the age of two a lot of television.Does that damage the education of a child and should it be forbidden for them?

Arguments why it should not be forbidden are that many television programs for young people show good morals and the children can learn a lot of them. For example when the protagonist of a programm says that you should not lie. The child won't lie because maybe his parents said that and  the protagonist.
Another good reason why it should not be forbidden is, that for the children in the young age the television stars are for them heroes and they look up to them.
And when they do good things they will do the same as they do.

But there are also a lot of negatives for them and a lot of pro arguments that say it should not be allowed for young children to watch television.
A good reason why it should not be allowed for children is, that children who watch a lot of television does not learn how to make some social contacts or friends. Mostely they are very quiet and does not want to do anything. They just want to watch television.
Another pro argument is that young children in this age should play together. The best would be if they go outside to play. They should explore the world and not the world of their fantasy heroes.

In this essay we saw many different arguments which say that television for young people is good or bad. But in conclusion I have to say that watching television is good for the education of a child. ( At least it doesn't damage the education), you just should not let your child watch too often television, because it should also learn to make some friends and explore the real world.
