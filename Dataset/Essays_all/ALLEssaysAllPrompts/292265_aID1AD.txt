Television advertising

Today's advertising isoften directed towards young children. In those commercials you can see beautifull toys and smiling children.
But why are there so many commercials for children? And wouldn't it be better if there was no advertising for children?

One of the reasons why these advertisments shouldn't be allowed is that it is way to easy to influence children. If a child sees a funny commercial with nice new toys in it and children having fun, it will often ask its parents to buy this new toy. The child will ask and beg until it gets the toy. But if the toy is bought the child will see another advertising on another toy and the whole process will beginn again. The child always wants another toy and won't appriciate the ones it already has. 
On the other side its easier for the parentsit the child already has a wish list. They can go trough the list and choose the one thing, they think is appropriate for a child at this age.
Anyway I think these advertisements shouldn't be allowed. Because if there is less commercial for children they maybe won't sit infront of the TV all the time and go outsiden and play something.
