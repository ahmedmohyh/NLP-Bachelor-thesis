Today the television plays a central part in each live. It exist many pros and cons of watching television. Often parents are to lazy to carry their young children and so they let them watch television. But there exist negative consequenses of watching TV, espectually advertising. Young children belive quite everything they see. So when the children are watching television advertising, they belive in every detail. But those advertisings are often not real. The producers of those advertisings only want to earn a lot of money. And after watching the advertisement, children want to buy the product.

A child also can get addicted of watching TV. And then they cry very often or become a tantrum and are very angry to the parents,when they switch off the television. So it's beter, when the young children do something other than watching television. For example young children could play a game with their family or have a nice evening with some friends.

It also existe some positive points. We can learn a lot from the television. Documentaries often shows us, how something is in real. Also young children can learn. With watching television they could improve their speaking knowledge. So it helps them, before they go to nursery school. 

I think televison advertising towards young children shouldn't be allowed, because young childrens belive to everything. But at the end the parents can decide, if their child can watch TV or not. For sure it's better to go outside to play with some friends than watching television or surfing in the internet. But often the parents are very stressed, so to calm down, they put their young child in front of a TV. For me it's not bad to let the child watching television, but not more then half a houer a day. Often the parents also work the whole day, so they have noother opportunity than let their child watch TV.
