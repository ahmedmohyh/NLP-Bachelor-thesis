It has always been a controversial topic if advertisements in e.g. television should be directed at young children in the age of up to five years. Or if it even has to be forbidden. Up until today, toy companies have the upper hand and every child can see their ads in the break of the favourite cartoon.

The problem most people have with adivertisements for the younger children ist that they are very easy to influence. The ad can tell them anything an they will believe it. They don't have the experiene a grown up person has. Also the parents can control what their child is watching in TV but hardly what they see during the advertising break.
On the other hand advertisements always have that very aspect that everyone can discover new products that fit in their life, even the smaller folks. Secondly every company has the right to advertise their products to a certain level. Apart from probably being against the law, it would heavily damage many toy companies. Another problem is where you draw the line. Every company could just claim that their advertisement only interests children above the age of five. So if it would be possible to just not allow some companies to advertise their products, why should we make a difference in ads that are directed toward elderly people or how can anyone guarantee that a law state like that doesn't get missused by corrupt poeple.

All in all a law like that would maybe make sense on first sight but in reality is just not going to be possible.
And even if it were there, companies would always find a way to go around it.
