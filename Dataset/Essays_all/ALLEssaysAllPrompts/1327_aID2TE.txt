A teacher has the function to taught their specific knowledge. That is why a teacher studied for this kind of job, to teach his or her studenst that they can graduate the A-levels. 
At the other hand the empathie and social skills are important for a good teacher. A teacher without any ability to relate well with the students is more dissliked by the students, because they want someone who has explaination skills and love to talk and spend time with younger people than him.  
As a teacher you have the needed knowledge and passion for your subject otherwise you are not a teacher, because you have to pass exams to prove this. With the time as a teacher you can also learn how to relate with the students better. 
But a basement of relating with others and the will to learn more every day from the studens like they learn from the teacher is important to develope as a teacher.  

In my opninion the ability to relate well with students is the key for a working lesson. As a teacher you passed some test or exams to prove that you have the needed knowledge but without any kindness an the will to teach the students with passion and open mind, thats why in think it is more important to relate well with the students.
