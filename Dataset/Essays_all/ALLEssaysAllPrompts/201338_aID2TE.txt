It is obvious that every student prefers to have a good relation with their teachers than not getting on with your professors. As it is said that pupils are more easily being tought by teachers with whom they use to relate well, this is obviously the best case. However this is often not the case. But what is more important, to get on well with each other or having a competent teacher?

First things first I have to make clear that the relation between a student and it's mentor can extremly influence the manner of learning. Therefore it is important for a student to get on well with the teacher. Especially due to the fact that professors can give you marks that eventually in the worst case can hinder you from passing a course. On subjective basis the mentors can treat you bad throughout your whole schooltime and even have an influence on the other teacher's opinion. 
However, even the best relation with your mentor does not make you learn something automatically. Teachers need some good knowledge about their subject because how should they teach if not? Unfortunately often teachers who always were geniuses in school can not understand that some students do not get everything from the beginning on. For example; as a consequence the less intelligent students, who would need even more support than others, get less help because the teacher does not like them. Not forgetting also that a teacher can loose his autoriy if you get on so well as friends do.

After having considered all the aspect I have to admit that obviously it does not work if you do not get on with your teacher but also if your mentor has not enough knockledge. For me a big knowledge is definitely a must. I personally think that you should get on with your teacher but the relation should not be too strong because there has to be an autority-gap.
