Alright, that's a really difficult statement to argue about. So first, let's find out, what this statement means. It means that young children between two and five years shouldn't be influenced by the television, so they shouldn't watch TV. 

If we say, a child can't watch TV, it plays with other untechnolized products which aren't as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldn't or to see something which can dramalize a young child. But television "canals" mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth, our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys.
But a bad point of the television nowadays are the propagandas for all new playproducts. A child can always see other cool and interesting things to play and can't see how much he already has at home. So watching TV makes one's child unthankful and it wants always more. They want some things which the parents maybe can't afford and as a gift for for the last christmaspresent, they have a sad or angry child at home. They shouldn't get so influenced by the technology nowadays. It's horrible how they try to manipulate the guys before the TV. 
In this reason, it should be forbidden for the children and also for the parents.

But if I think on the first point i've manchened, whatching TV shouldn't be forbitten, but it should be in the sight of the parents so it won't be too much a day. The parents should be aware what their child is doing and what he's watching!
