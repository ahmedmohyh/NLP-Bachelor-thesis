I really don't know if I should agree with this statement because it is a very helpful ability but I don't knowit is more important than knowledge. On the other hand it's important for a teacher to know when his lesson is very boring or if he's doing alright. To know that he has to relate with the students and if he can't do that, he will maybe be a bad teacher for his entire life.
Knowledge is what it is about in school so. If it's the knoeledge to handle every math problem or the knowledge to relate well with other hasn't been said. I think we shouldn't be so focused on just learning strict facts of a topic but rather learn whats important in life as a member of a social community. Because of that humanity is very important in school and shouldn't be underestimated. But if the teacher can't manage this kind of humanity how should the students learn it. Students spent most of their time in school and teacher started to be as important as parents in case of raising up children.
