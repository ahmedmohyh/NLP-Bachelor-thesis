Should Television adversiting direted  toward young children not be allowed?

We all know that the medias inclusiv the TV an enormous power has. Every person who`s watching TV can say it has no impact on him an lie with that statement. In fact it does have. An perfect example are the news in which we get constantly betrayed and lied on. 

We could argue that every family should look for themselves and it is not the problem of the state. For the state is it great if the kids look TV because so has the state a bigger affect of the youth and can more easily give the kids morals which are positiv for the state. It is clear that we have a lot of privat TV and so this factor with the state goes away. The private Channels often do exactly the same for example learn the kids also morals and behaviour from there. 
So the parents should look for the kids and not the TV. 

On the other hand can kids learn a lot from the TV if they are watching shows with a learn basic like the Animal Channel or the show Galileo. If the children look  TV with a good content it could be great for them.

In my opinion the state should not force us to not let our kids watching TV. I think every parents are free when they want let or not let their kids watch TV.
I personally would let my kids watch Tvbut not too much and most importantlynot manipulated thing likethat with the chips imp
