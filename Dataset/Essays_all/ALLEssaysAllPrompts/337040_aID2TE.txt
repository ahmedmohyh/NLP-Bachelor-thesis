Nearly everyone went to school one day, or still go to school. The school is a place, where children should learn and get prepared for their life. But which points really matters in the way, teachers teach the class? The teachers, which have a good relate to their students have less problems with the class, then the teachers, which just have an excellent knowledge. Does it matter, if the students like their teacher or not? Is it either important, that the teacher have an enormous knowledge? 

At one point, it is important, that the teachers know, how to explain the themes to their students. Due to this fact, it would be good, if they have a good relationship to their students. A teacher, which is able to motivate the class, is even more valuable for the future of the children. A child learns more, if it likes the school subjects, and it is more interested, if it likes the teacher. For the most students the teacher is an important person with a lot of influence on their education. 

Nevertheless, it is also impotant, that the teachers have an excellent knowledge. What is an advantage of a teacher, which has a good relate to the students, but a bad knowledge? A teacher should be able to answer the questions of the class, so the knowledge really matters. 

In conclusion, we can see, that it needs both, at one hand the knowledge and on the other hand the ability to relate well with students.In my opinion the relate is more important, then the knowledge. But I don't agree with the statement completely. A good teacher should know a lot, and should be able to have a good realtionship to their students. So a ballance between this 2 skills would be great.
