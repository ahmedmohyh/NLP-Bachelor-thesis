More and more young children are sitting in front of the television. They are looking their favorite serie or film, after 20 minutes the first 10 minutes of promotions starts. A little child with his mother in a supermarket, he sees a big green toy, mother i want this toy! And what a surprise the toy is sale just 99.99, but just for a week. So the effect for the young children in front of the television. who also likes the toy is that he quickly will have this toy too.

First of all in the age from two to five children are very effected from the sociality, if they are advertising directed from the televison, they start believing what they say. When the television shows that we all have super power and we all can fly, we just need to put out theit arms, they do it and then fall down. It should be the work of the parent how they grow up their child and not from the television.

Secondly the television has a big influence on youn children. When a child sees something that he likes he really want it, that could be a big problem for they parents. Maybe they haven't so much money to buy every week new stuff for their children. But when children don't get what they want, they are sad and agry.

Thirdly in this age children shouldn't be advertising directes from the television. They are in age where they should go out to learn, play with other kids. This experiences are more important than stuff from the television. They should make their experiences by them selves and not teached by the televison.

For these reasons i'm agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe
