I agree with this statement  becouse young children shoud go out side and not in the hous.When a young child often befor the tv sit,he don´t  can do frendchips  with other children  in his older. 
The sozial aspekt is in this  moment very importent because when your child is the hole day in the hous becaus his tv show  is there  and when he is older so he don´t know  how he shold speak with other people in his older .
Maybe they could watch tv but not the hole day and not when the weather is goog and you go outside ,but when the weather is bad an you don´t can go outside you musst play with your  playtoies and when he is older he know a litle bit what is good and what is bad.
