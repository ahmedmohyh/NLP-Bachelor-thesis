Teachers are very important people to their students. They do not only teach them important subjects, they also help them grow up in some way. They help them when they don't know something or when there is a matter they can't solve on their own. So it is rather important that teachers can relate well with their students. Because if they don't, the students might have trouble growing up and might become terrible adults, because they wouldn't be able to get the help they desperately needed.
On the other hand, students go to school to become intelligent and to be able to go and study later on, so they can get a good job in their life. A school is a place where knowledge is being brought to students. It is the primary function of a school. Teachers are also paid to do their job, which is to make the students experts on their subjects. That's why knowledge is more important than the ability to relate well with students.
But even so, the latter should not be ignored. Students learn better when they get on well with their teachers. Even if they dislike the subject, a good teacher can still make them listen. If the teachers were being replaced by robots, which could never relate well with students, the average grade of the students would probably sink, because they would get tired of the monotone lessons.
But still, emotional support would not bring the students very far in life. They wouldn't get into universities by telling them they had a pleasant time in school. To get somewhere in life, they'd need knowledge. They'd need to know facts and how things work. If too much time is spent on socializing with students, there might not be enough time to teach the important subjects, which would result in a major drawback in the students lives.
