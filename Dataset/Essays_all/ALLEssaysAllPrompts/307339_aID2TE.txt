It is well know that the bond between teacher an student is important for a good atmosphere and for good learning, but is it more important then the teachers knowledge of the subject he has to teach?

Even thought the ability to relate well with a student is important to teach a student, the ability to understand and be able to explain your subject to a student is more importan, because it doesn`t matter how good the relatoinship between student and teacher is, if the teacher don`t understand it so won`t the student.

On the other hand, if the teacher is an asshole and isn`t able to bond with the student, the sudent won`t obey him and will start to miss classes or to not listen to the tacher and stop studying the subject, thus it will have the same effect as if the teacher don`t understand his subject.

Also worth saying is that, teacher wich don`t understan their subject shouldn`t be teacher in the first place, a teachers job is to help a student to understand the subject, to be able to use the information they learn to their advantage, a teacher who can`t do this can be as nice to his student as he want but in the end it won`t help them to progres in a intelectull way.

Finally, the ability to relate to student is important to help student to maybe like the subject a teacher teaches and despite the fact that they are bad in this subject they maybe learn more because of how nice the teacher is, for example I don`t like my english teachers and so a started to hate english and my marks got worse then before.

To sum up I would say it is important that you have a good conection between student and teacher but you should also be a teacher with a excellent knowledge of your subject, it should be a good mix between those two.
