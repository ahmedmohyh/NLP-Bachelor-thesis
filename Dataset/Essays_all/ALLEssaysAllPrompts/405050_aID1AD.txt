Advertisment is a big subject in the world of today. When we put on the television to watch a specific show, we get interrupted by advertisment very often. Advertisement is present as well in television shows for children. Should this be allowed or could it be bad for children aged two to five?

When children watch TV, they wan`t to watch TV and not advertisement. Advertisment is another world than the shows they maybe watch. It`s possible that they can`t differ an advertisement, in which a person does something unhuman, with the real world. They don` t understand what this all is for. This could cause that children try things they`re not made for.
When advertisment is directed to a young child, they can`t decide what they really want of all these things which are shown. As a child you want to have all the cool stuff. The child may get`s aggressiv when his mother doesn`t want to buy the things he has seen in the TV. This could cause problems as well. 
We see enough advertisement when we walk on the street or driving in the car. Advertisement is so much information for a child, but for an adult as well. The children can`t deal with those informations because they don`t know what the advertisement is for. Maybe they missunderstand something important.
Advertisement could be good as well. With all the things that are shown in the TV the children maybe understand earlier how to deal with some things in the world. It could also be positiv for their vocabulary. in adverts there is often used difficult vocabulary. The children could learn to improve their spelling and hearing in front of the TV with more complex words.

With all the argument I said, I think advertisment shouldn`t be directed toward young children. With the advertisment they spend even more time in front of the TV, and I think that this isn`t very good. They should play outdoor in the forest or somewhere else and discover the world and his nature.
