First and foremost being a teacher requires to have both of these qualifications. When we talk about which one is more important we have to focus on the benefits and drawbacks of each one.

The ability to relate with students can be very helpful to some. Several studies have shown that students don't feel understood or they don't feel a connection to the teacher which leads to lower scores in classes. If a teacher is able to relate he can approach every student independently and try to come up with ideas how they could improve themselves. It allows them even to have a deeper look into students lifes gain their trust and detect if there are any problems. But there might be a danger in coming to close and loosing they students respect and the authority, since some might get too comfortable.

However, having an excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught is crucial too. A qualified teacher should know everything he has to know about his subject. The width of knowledge can only be limited by the level he is teaching on. Even then there are several students that are advanced and need more challenging problems to solve, so we can't say that the knowledge can be limited that easy. Personally I believe that students, if they're motivated, will find a way to study and understand the topic even if the teacher can't relate with them.

To conclude I think that a broad enough knowledge is more important because every teacher should be prepared to answer any question that is being asked about his subject any time. One is for sure, a good balanced mix of both these abilities makes a perfect teacher.
