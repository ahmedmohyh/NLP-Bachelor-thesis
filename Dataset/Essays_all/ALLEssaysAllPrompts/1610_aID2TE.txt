In school, teachers and students face a lot of problems. Some of the students have trouble understanding certain subjects or topics and some of them have trouble getting along with their teachers. This might lead to the question what is more important; a teacher who has the ability to connect with their students or a teacher who is able to explain their subject.

When a teacher is able to show a lot of empathy to their students I think the whole atmosphere of learning is more comfortable. Some shy pupils might be able to talk in front of class and might feel more couraged to participate. It could also lead to the fact that students learn more, because they like their teacher as well and show empathy for them. On the other hand a more comfortable atmosphere can lead to discourage between the pupils. Because of the teacher's ability, pupils could think that they don't have to learn or that they don't have to participate to receive a good grade. But a teacher who has no idea how to treat students can make a lot of them feel afraid and unmotivated as well. The students knowledge will benefit though, because teachers, who don't know how to actually teach, are most of the time way more serious than teachers who learned how to treat children. This would lead to a more efficient way of learning for some, but to a more difficult learning for others. This way of teaching can also lead to the fact that some students might develop mentall illnesses.

In conclusion I think that a teacher who is able to relate well to students is more important than a teacher who might know everything about their subject. From personal experience I can say, that students and teachers benefit of a comfortable atmosphere, but of course I can understand how some people might feel different. But I personally think that being a healthy human being is more important than knowing about a subject that you probably won't need in the future.
