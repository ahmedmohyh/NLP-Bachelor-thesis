The statement that advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed is false. 
One of the most commonly used argument is that the influence advetisment has on the young children is too big. The fear is that children belive everything they get told and think it is a hundret percent true. This fear may be reasonable, but it is just how the world works. Later in life they will get linked and the earlier they learn, that not everything people say on television is true, the better it is. 
Another agrument the supporters of this argument use is that advertisment has an affect on the brain funktion of kids. Generally speaking they mean that it makes the children dumb. But that is not true. Studies have shown that people that watched a lot of television and advertising are not going to be more or less affected in their ability to think. A way more greater danger lies in how young children spend their free time, because is going to affect their succes in sport. 
This is because the age we are speaking of is the best age to learn new movments and develop their skills like throwing, catching or jumping. If the children miss the oportunity to do so, because the just sit infront of the television watching TV all day long, they will have struggles to keep up with their classmates in sport.
In conclusion you can say that showing advetisment to young children is not going to have a bad affect on the chlidren. Instead we should worry about the amount of time they spend infront of a TV, not being out in the nature running aroung and developing their skills. If we not manage to do so, we will have a generation that might still be as smart as the generations before, but might not be able to properly play footbal or do an other type of sport, as good as generations before them.
