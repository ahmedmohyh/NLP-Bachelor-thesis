Nowedays many claim to be better than the others. Many think that it is more important to know alot then to relate good with others. This may sound egoistic at first but it is more likely to be so. Is it good to have more knowledge than others or better to understand what teaching is about ?

At first it all starts in the society. Many people think that it is important to have a huge knowledge about our world. So people tend to learn alot. A positiv aspect is that people gain a huge amount of knowlegdge if they study. They may be going to university. 
After they learned alot in university they teach students at schools. They have a huge knowledge about their subject. 

A negativ aspect is that altough the teachers may teach the right thing they don`t have any experience about teaching. 
The teacher who understand the students is often someone who`s old. This person may not have a new knowledge about things today because he teaches his way he was taught. It`s this kind of person who has a huge amount of experience. But old people are losing their jobs because younger teachers who have more and new ways of teaching are getting the jobs. There are postiv and negativs in this. 


I think that it is better to have a teacher who understands the problems of the students then having a teacher wich has a huge knowledge.
