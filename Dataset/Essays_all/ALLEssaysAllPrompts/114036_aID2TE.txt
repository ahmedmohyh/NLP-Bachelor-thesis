I agree with this statement. I think that teachers should more be like a friend and not an annoying "boss". But knowledge  is also very important, especially in high school. This summer i was in a englishschool in England (Exeter). There, theachers were more like friends, but I understood that because it's a summmerschool. The advantage is that the students have more fun by learning something as usual. A young person doesn't wants to be stressed at school because of his teachers. If you don't like your theacher you don't like to go to his lessons. And by the time the teacher won't like you as well. 
The teacher and students should have have a good relation. Of course the knowledge is also important, but for example in primary school the kids should have fun by going to school. However, knowledge is getting more and more important by the time as you get older and vistit other schools.             
This statement is "more" correct for primary schools than high schools.
