What is more important for a teacher. Should the teacher be a person students can relate to, or should the teacher just be a person with knowledge, who gives that knowledge to others, without thinking about their relationship with those students. Is a teacher's ability to relate wellwith students more important than excellent knowledge.

    When a teachers has a good relationship with their students, the teacher can help the students better because the teacher kows them. Many kids I know agree with this statement. When they needed help and the teacher knew them, it was easier for the teacher to help them. Without his abilityto relate that wouldn't have been possible. The ability to relate well with studens is ore important.

    A teacher who can relate well but knows nothing is useless. If a teacher can only relate well with the students, then he isn't a teacher anymore, because he doesn'thave the knowledge to teach. He could only bean assistant, but nothing more. A teacher who knows nothing is useless.

    Teachers who have good relationships with their students have better students. If the students have a good relationship with the teacher they will enjoy class more and become better in that class. A good relationship helps students to become better in class as they will enjoy it more.

    A teacher should be able to relate butmroe importantly should have a very good knowledge. When the teacher has a good knowledge hencan explain things way bette. Andifhe then can also relate with thestudents, that makes it even more better. Teachers with very good knowledge can help even if they can't relate as well as others.

    I agree party with thestatement. In my opinion a teacher should have both. He should have a very good knowledge, but he should also be able to relate to students as it helps him understanding them better and therefore also helps him to help them.
