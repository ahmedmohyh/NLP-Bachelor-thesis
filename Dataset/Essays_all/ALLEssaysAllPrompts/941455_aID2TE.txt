Well, both either having excellent knowledge or being able to relate with the students is very important. In my case of view, the teachers ability to relate is more important especially if one of the student doesn't understand the subject. If this is the case, the teacher is able to communicate with the student in a very understandful way. Imagine the teacher is very very intelligent and he does know everything about his subject, there is no easy way to explain a problem to a student because he isn't able to relate well with the students.

Teachers mostly know very much about their subject and even if they don't know somethig, they are able to use the internet to learn something more. But if they dont know how to speak or relate to students, all their knowledge is useless. 
It is a teachers job to educate children or teenagers and they will not understand a teacher if he isn't able to relate. I had the experiance by my self, I had a teacher who was not able to explain some simple questions. He wasn't able to do this because od a lack of knowledge but because he was just to intelligent to speak about the subject in an more human way. This was a big problem because it has been mathematics. If you had an experiance like this you will know what i mean, it is a big difference between saying: "Imagine two apples get eaten by to People" or "two Y get divided by two X". A very abstract example but this is the point.

Just to be honest, it's not that important all the time to be able to relate to students, for example as a teacher at university, there is no need to be able to relate with students because they are all educated at a higher level in a special subject. 
Still, my opinion is, that it is better if a teacher is able to relate, especially in: primary-, secondary-, highschool or college.
