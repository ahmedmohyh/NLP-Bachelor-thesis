Nowdays a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledgeof the subject being thaught. Some teacher know a lot but are not able to teach them their student. I agree with the following statement with the following reason.

Firstly, Stutent does not understand what the teach wants to say. It is normally that the students sit there and does not understand anything of the theme because the teacher might talk in a very difficult way and use a lot of difficut words.

Moreover teacher have a excellent knowledge but are not able to to bring them up to their students. They may be in their one world and just write the stuff on the blackboard with out any expretion. An example is in Mathematics, when the teacher just show themthe result orthe way he did it with out telling them how he gets to this result, the student might not can follow the way he get to the risult.

An disadvange is that  teachers with en excellent knowledge knows a lot more about the theme than they sould really have to. He can tell the Student more details if they are interessted.

In conclusion I personally think that it is very important to have a teacher who is able to explain the stuff very easiely and that the students have fun by learning it. It would be very great if the teacher has also a bright knowledge and can the tell the student everything he knows.
