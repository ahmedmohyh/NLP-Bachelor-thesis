You're on the couch with your three year old. The soundtrack of the movie "Madagascar" in your ears and the soft light of your television on your face. Both of you are laughing histerically, they because of the funny animals and you thanks to them. Then the break comes on. You know your child doesn't really understand any of it but you still wonder if they are in any way influenced by this advertisement of "HASBRO" about that new toy, from a movie which isn't even in their range of age. Not a second in your thought, you see your child fidgeting around and they ask you with glowing eyes if they could get it for their birthday. Should that way of advertising really be allowed?

Young people believe a lot. They're at a larger risk of believing things advertisement want to make us believe than adults. Kids are learning all the time and if they're not taught the right things, they make easy targets for advertisers. When children are watching TV, most of the time they're absent minded. Their visual sense takes up most of their brains available capacity. These kids are in some kind of learning mode. If, in that time, they're exposed to some television-advertisement, what happens to them would be like some kind of brainwashing. Also, with the repeating of the same ads it gets worse and worse.
Three year olds should not be influenced about brands and what kind of drink they like best.

Because children should be allowed to just be children, my opinion is that television advertising should not be directed towards young children.
