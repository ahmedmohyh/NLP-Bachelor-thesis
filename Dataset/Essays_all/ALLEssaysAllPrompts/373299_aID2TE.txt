Nowadays, it is often claimed that teachers do the most important job for our society, or even for humanity. This is because they have the power to accompany our children in their trip to adulthood. However, how to do the job the right way is very controversial. Are they being too strict, too nice or are they just not able to connect with their students?

To teach the students a teacher's most important ability is obviously his knowledge; or isn't it? It is certainly quite important but is it really their most important ability? This question is very interesting and therefore often discussed. Nobody can deny that without a teachers knowledge on the subject he would not be able to teach the students anything at all. It is important for the students that the things they learn are correct and the teacher is a valuable source of knowledge.

Nevertheless, many people claim that a teachers ability to relate to his students is much more important than any knowledge of the subject. This is because teachers, who are quite anti-social and to concentrated on the content than on the students working often get worse results than teachers trying to relate with the students. It is difficult for a student to learn something when they dislike the teacher of this subject or when the teacher does'nt eve try to get along with his students. 

Taking everything into account, I am completely convinced that the teacher's social ability are more important than his knowledge of the subject. I have to admit that I believe this, partly because I am a student myself and know the feeling of a teacher ignoring you, which would certainly just support the previously stated idea. Teachers these days should stop being so detailed with everything and for once try to relate with the situations of the students.
