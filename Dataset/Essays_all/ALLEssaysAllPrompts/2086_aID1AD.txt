It has often been discussed wether or not television advertising towards children aged two to five should be allowed or not. Personally, I think it should not for the following reasons.

First of all, a child of two to five years is not yet able to understand marketing strategies and make informed decisions on wether to buy a product or not. Therefore advertising something towards them exploits their childish innosense for profit. Instead products should be advertised to their parents who are responsible for making informed decisions for their children and protect them until they are able to do it themselves.

Furthermore, a child of that age would probably want to own anything they see on television and lots of annoyed parents would probably give in just to have peace. However, this kind of peace is only going to last until the child wants to own something else. This kind of procedure teaches children a craving for material possession from a very young age, as well as a mentality of buying something just to throw it away some time soon. These are values that have already lead to great problems in the world, such as huge piles of waste on land as well as in the ocean. I believe we should not instill the same values that have caused so much destruction to our planet already in the following generations again but instead teach them to make a change. 

Therefore in my opinion it is unethical to advertise something to children who do not know any better yet and exploit them, their parents and our planet for profit.
