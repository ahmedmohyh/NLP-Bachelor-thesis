A lot of teachers now a days tend to have a more or less extended ability to relate well with their students.
A common question related to this statement is, if this capacity has a more significant influence on the class than an excellent knowledge of the teachers subject. 

Not all students have the same strenghts in every subject. That's why their more than happy if the teacher is able to explain further dificulties on their level. It's a total adventage if a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the topic being discussed. On that basis they can break down the subject an solve the students problems more easily. 

If a teacher stands in front of a class and ... the image of not unterstanding what he or she is talking about it automaticly leaves a negative impression. The class tends more to get confused than they normally would.

The relation between the teacher and the student is an important element for a childs motivation to study. If a particular kid always gets left behind and doesn't get the respect it deserves, it can't focus properly on learning new things. The students gets distracted by the teacher's bad atmosphere. It could in the worst case show negative influence on their grades.

This two capacities combined built the perfect basis for a childs school career. One aspect leads to the other: If a teacher is kind and gracefully with its class, but can't answer the students questions and misunderstandings it's as bad as if he knows everything about his subject but he's disrespectfully teaching his class. 
To conclude the treated statement I would say, that there are more than just one aspect, that influence a child's motivation and ability to study.
