A lot of students have expierenced a certain ability in subjets such as math or physics, which changed drastically after visiting a new school. Mostly the subject itself is not as relevant as the teachers capibility to teach. Studies all over the world have shown that students grades can variate depending on the teacher. Is the teachers ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? 
Firstly I will point out that a teachers ability to relate with students is essential. Students feel understood and the class as a whole can benefit more from every lesson. The weaker students can be sit next to the stonger ones whereas both get to learn a lot. Besides the better environment, the speed will e adjusted to the classes understanding off the subject.
On the other hand excellent knowledge is important as well. Wether its geografy, math or english, a teacher not completely understanding their subjet can be dreadful. Especially subjects such as math, physics and chemistry must be taught from a person with excellent knowledge. As a result teachers will use easy language teaching math if he or she really understands. Whereas teachers with no understanding are more likely to use difficult language. They may be capable of using their knowledge in a firm, but are definitely not classified to teach.
In brief both abilities are quite important when it comes to defining a good teacher. In my opinion excellant knowledge is more important because students will more likey understand a subject if the teacher gets the message across easily. Students sitting in a class where the teacher is babbling like wikipedia the message will simply not be understood. The capility of relating then becomes irrelevant.
