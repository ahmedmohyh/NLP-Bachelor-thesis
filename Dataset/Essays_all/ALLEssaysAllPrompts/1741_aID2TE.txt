In the following I will explain my point of view and why I agree with the statement.
I think it is difficult to rate the different attributes in this kind of way but in my opinion the social aspect of being a teacher is more important than his or her knowledge. There are two aspects that are the most important in being a teacher: knowledge on the one hand and the ability to explain this knowledge to the children on the other hand. And in my eyes it is rather more important to explain the knowledge to the children because if a student is more motivated in learning better results will be the consequences.
Let me demonstrate this in painting you a little picture. Take a teacher who's primarly focus is on defendig his authority rather than explaining knowledge. He might have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught but from time to time the students will get more and more bored and even more and more tired - but that is not what I expect from a teacher to do. A good teacher should do his or her work and that is the explaining the knowledge of the subject.
Though some teachers might have an excellent knowledge their main focus should stay on explaining it to the students. And when you take a teacher who really can explain the knowledge to the students the students will get more and more involved. 
Truth be told of course a teacher should really know what he is talking about but in my eyes it is not as important what the teacher says rather than how the teacher teaches.
It does not matter whether you are from america or asia, from europe or africa or even australia at the end of the day children want to learn in school. That is why schools had been found but the schools today are also a promise to our kids that they would have a better education and in cause of that a better future. To fullfit that promise we have to hire teachers who are able to relate well with our children and in cause of that also teach our children well.
