Young children television advertising- right or wrong?

Everybody knows this situation your child or little sisters are watching a child television channel like Nikelodeon or Cartoon Network and afterwards they beg to you or to your parents if they can go to the toy-store to buy this new amazing lego-castle, which they have seen in the TV. This kind of publicity has become a new trend these days. The question is if the companies are taking advantage of the phantasie of our little beloved? Should it be banned and if yes what would be law?

Firstly it is very difficult to answer this question, because on the one hand we can clearly see that these advertisings almost brainwashes the heads of our little ones. But on the other hand, without these commercialbreaks, the channel wouldn't survive and this would be by far more sad if there would be no channels anymore for children.

Secondly we need to ask ourself if there is any differences between the advertsing for children or adults. In my opinion there are no differences, because everytime we watch our favorite serie or sportsteam in the TV, deep down in our brain we let us influence by companies, which are much more harmful then the toys-companies on Cartoon Network.
