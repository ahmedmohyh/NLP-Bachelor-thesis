In my opinion a teachers ability to relate well with students is much more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Firstly I want to explain, why I think an excellent knowledge of the subject is not that important. For me a perfect knowledge is fine but we live in a world with google, bing, yahoo and wikipedia so if we want to know something it is about three seconds away and we have the basic information. In school we learn technics, different writing types, how to become a math pro and so on. The excellent knowledge of every detail is not that improtant to be good in school.In the life after school we have to know other things and need other skills than we learn in school. For me school teaches us something like a ''basic knowledge'', so we can look up for something we want to study. 
Secondly I want to explain the importandness of a social teacher, if a class is sitting in the geografy room ,29 students and one teacher, it is mostly safe that not everyone is onethousand percent in the topic. It is important for the well feeling of everystudent personally, that the teacher sometimes says things like ''I compleetly understand you, I did not feel like doing this too'' this helps young people to imagine the teacher as a human as themselfs and not a person standing much more higher in the hirecce.
                                                                    All in all for me the social skills are more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, becaus this little details often did not last very long in the ones mind but these soft skills are very importent to build a childrens (or young persons) character.
