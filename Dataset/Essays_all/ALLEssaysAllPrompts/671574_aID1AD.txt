In these days everyone wants to make as much profit as possible and therefore advertising and especially television advertising gets more and more important. But often they can influence people and especially children to buy things they do not really need. In this essay I will discuss the question whether television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.


There are some reason which support the statement that televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children aged two to five can often not decide, whether they really need something or not. They can easily get influenced by the pictures represented in the advertisments. They want to have what everyone else has. The parents then have to convince them that not everything showed in these advertisments is useful and sometimes things are not as they look like in television advertising. This often leads to conflict between parents and their children.

But there are also reasons which show that there is no problem in showing young children television advertising.
Adults often get influenced as well by television advertising. So, why should television advertising directed to adults then be allowed? In addition, children get not just influenced by television advertising. Other advertising methods or even other people can inluence their opinion about something just as well or even more.


In my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising toward young children. Of course they can be influenced but I think other people can be influenced by advertising just as well as children. In addition I think that other factors influence childrens opinion more than television advertising.
