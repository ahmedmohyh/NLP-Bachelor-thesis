We have a number of questions to ask ourselves, when examining this statement. Is the child being psychologically harmed? And, is it moral to indoctrinate and influence a child of such a young age? I don't think it is moral to indoctrinate people through television advertising at any age. Why? Because  since who we are and what we think is always a result of our surroundings. Even talking to someone is a form of indoctrination. It is basically impossible to forbid indoctrination. If you take a look at how many children are forced to go to church on Sundays, where they are taught to believe, rather than to think. Or at school, where you are taught to obey and be disciplined. Fox News for example: This form of indoctrination, to me, is simply disgusting. A political agenda covered up as news and facts. We are constantly being bombarded by other peoples beliefs and what they think. So I think the most important thing is to learn to think for ourselves. That is the only way to resist indoctrination.
Anyway, at the age of two to five, when you can't really think for yourself and when you rely on good people to take care of you, I don't think it is harmful to watch an advertisement. Because at that age you couldn't care less what the telly tells you. It is far more important what your parents say and how you are treated at home.
