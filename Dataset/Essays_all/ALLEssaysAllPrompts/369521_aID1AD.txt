Televison advertising directed toward children should not be allowed?

In our socity the televison is a commen thing, who don't have a televison at home anymore? 
A study shows that in Switzerland 80% of the people had a televison at home. Also much more children sits on the coach and watch TV. The televison not only shows children programm but also a lot of advertising directed toward children aged two to five.
Now we have to ask us, if this should be allowed or not.

If kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal. So they get a wrong view. 
Also when the children see all the stuff, which the companies want to sell, they want these things too but the family can't effort all these things. The children get an unrealistic expection from the reality.

But they could also dream a little bit of the things they see in the televison advertising and that could also be a good thing.

I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be forbidden. I think the children should have the opotunaty to dream of the things they see in the TV but I think also that it should have less advertising in TV directed toward children, because it shouldn't have too much influence in the lives of the children.
