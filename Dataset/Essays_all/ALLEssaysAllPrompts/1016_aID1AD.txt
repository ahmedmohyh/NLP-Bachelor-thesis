In the following text I am going to mention some arguments for and against the statement: "Telivision advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed". 

May one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age. Of course it is a weak argument, but at least it is one. Also one has to add that young children aged two to five normally do not watch TV that often. Therefore it does not really matter if there is that kind of advertising or not. But in case that the children watch TV nearly all day it could be helpful for later. Maybe the children are not interested in this advertising in a way and do not listen to it or watch it. So there is the chance that they won't be interested in advertisding later as well, so they won't be easily influenced.

But that is only guessed. One aspect that is against television advertising directed toward young people is that it is not good to get influenced in this young age. And if one thinks about it in a rational way, it becomes clear that children are interested in advertising. Especially, if the advertising presents new things to play with. Also, they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion, because they are too young. As a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true. For example if it is about a new snack that is "so good for children, because it suppports them in becoming large and stong" but actually its main ingredient is sugarl. So they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true. This could be a problem for their later life, because they won't be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth. 

All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion. That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+
