It goes without saying, that children are a lot easier to influence with television advertising, than adults. But this does not necesseraly mean anything bad.

One argument, that a supporter of this statement might bring up is, that children will be influenced to wanting something which is not particulary good for them. While on the surface this looks true, if we think about it the argument is actually not such a solid one. Why is that? Because there will always be a parent who watches over the kid. This adult can and should be able to explain to the little ones, why they may not have this certain thing. Moreover it is also not nice to forbid young children from watching television adverts, because a numerous amount of children enjoy watching adverts from their favourite toys. It might seem odd for us grown-ups now, but I personally also enjoyed watching the advertisment of the newest build-set from Lego, or whatever product it might be. And I think I'm not the only one with that opinion. One question that I'm asking myself when I read this statement is, how the advertisment specifically directed towards children would be bad. The companies who pay for the advertisments on television, most certainly wouldn't want their advertisment about the newest beer brand to be played on the disney channel at four o'clock.

To conclude would I say that this is a really conservative and overprotective thing to do. Whilst these are just some of the reasons, why I think this regulation should not be a thing, there are certainly many more.
