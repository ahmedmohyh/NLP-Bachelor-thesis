If Television advertising for young children should or shouldn´t be allowed, I will discuss in the following text.

First of all you have to say, that the only persons, who can decide if their children are allowed to watch TV, are the parents. Other people can think and talk about it, but can not forbid it and I think this isn´t nessecary at all. When the children want to watch Series, why not? What dangerous can happen? A TV can not attack you or do anything by its own. You can decide, wether it´s turn on or off. Its just important, that the series fits to the age of the child. They should´t watch scary horror movies or agressive action videos and they shouldn´t watch TV the whole day. The younger generation today should know, how to play and use their fantasy like in former times too, when they haven´t had the chance to use any technology. 
But I want to stress at this point again, that it isn´t my task to decide what children shouldn´t or shouldn´t do and nobodyelse should do so. When the parents of a child think Television doesn´t hurt, it´s as right as to say Televisoin isn´t good for my child. You can see this by your own. Have you watched TV when you were younger? I have and I am not terrribly gone wrong. I have built with my sister a new house for our imagined friends in the morning and later I have watched my favourite Series "Biene Maja" and now I am writing this essay in English. So I am the best example, that Television isn´t a machine for making you stupid. It´s just a good way for relaxing and have some fun in your freetime but please, don´t go over the top. Don´t put your Child in front of the TV, when you don´t know what you as a parent can play with it or let it does, what it wants. After some time, maybe 30 minutes or maybe two hours, turn off the screen. Everything should be enjoyed in pieces. You shouldn´t eat the whole day, you shouldn´t do sport the whole day and you shouldn´t watch TV the whole day. Just from time to time, if you want to.
