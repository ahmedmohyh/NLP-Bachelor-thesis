We all had at least one teacher while going to school, that was not able to relate well with his students. But does that make him a worse teacher?
I do really think that a great teacher should not only have to be able to answer all the questions of his subject. The students are more likely to like a subject if they think their teacher can relate to them. That is an important point, because the students will probably be more likely to learn and do homework of a subject they like. 
However, the teacher needs to be sure about what he is talking, and he has to be able to answer questions and explain things properly. If he is not able to do so, his students will not really learn something, even though their teacher had a good relation with each student. 
Another thing is that a teacher needs to be able to understand problems the students may have, even though, for him it all seems to be clear. Often this needs a relation, so that the students are able to ask, and the teacher ist able to help. If the students do not feel free to ask questions, because the teacher might not understand why they do not now the answer, it is harder for them to solve their problems. The support of a techer is really important for them and their learning process. 
For me being a teacher includes more than just understanding of his subject. Otherwise he maybe should work as something else, that does not include social competence. Being teacher aswell means being able to talk to their students and understand them. It does not only need a great knowledge, but it is for sure important.
