Televesion advertising is something we all see nearly everyday, it has become part of our life. It can be annoying for example while watching a movie but it might also be interesting to young children to know what new toys have been made. In this essay I am going to be talking about television advertising to young children and why it should or should not be allowed.
Children today watch alot of television, it is very easily accesible, and while they are watching television and add always pops up. This adds are targeted to young children since they pop up in the childrens television channels such as Disney Channel. They have cool music on their background and make the toy they are advertising something everybody has to have they basically brainwash the children. That is the first negative point of advertising to young children, these children get brainwashed very quickly so what they do after seeing the add on television is go their mom or dad to make them buy them the toy. The second negative point is that making young children watch adds brings nothing usefull to their lives it just brainwashes them to buy the toy, it does not teach them anything.
Advertising to young children has also a positive side but only for the company which is advertising the product. Like I mentioned before young children get brainwashed very quickly, and because they will not stop beging to their parents to buy the product the parents will eventually buy it to them so they can shut up once and for all about that product, and that ladies and gentlemen is how companies make money by advertising to young children.
I am against advertising to young children. Instead if putting an add the government or the channel itself should put something that teaches the young children something usefull. Like for example brainwash the children to not smoke or not do drugs which in my opinion makes much more sense than advertisng a toy.
