In the following essay I will give reasons and examples for and against the following statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) schould not be allowed.". 

Nowdays the juse of mobile technic is getting a higher position. Some people say it is a positive change but some people say it is a really negative change. A reason against this statement could be, that these children can leran something out of these television programs but I think then it ist important, which chanal they wacht. If it is a grate show where you can learn something about the nature and life I think it is a good thing. Like the show in germany "Wissen macht A" it is a show, where two people are teaching the children some spizific words they had asked for. But in this age I think it is to early to try to teach the children some things this way because a two years old children can´t really understand what they are talking about. So I tink it is important to show it with pichtures and picture stories. A positive reason for this statement is that children are sitting all the day inside and are watching tv and are not going out to play foot with other children. And they are not doing tings on  their own wrong because they learned it fom the tv. Another reason ist, that when every children is watching tv they can not have good connections and friendships. And this is a really bad thing! Every child has to ceep in contact to other cildren without tv.

In all I agree with this statement, because when I was so jung I loved it to play outisde with my friends. And I think this is so important for every child! I think it is ok if they sometimes watch tv but the relationship to other children is more important. They have to learn something about life outside the parentshouse, they have to do something wrong so they can learn out of it.
