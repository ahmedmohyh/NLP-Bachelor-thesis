Television nowdays is full of advertising and it isn't something special if you have full 10 minutes of dumb short-films. But these little short-films dont influence young children. And if you raise your child the right way they wont just sit in front of the Tv because they will use their ability to think about new activities to spend the time outside.

Since young children dont understand the advertisement until they are three they are harmless for them. If a child is three to five years old he understands the advertisement but they do not realise  that they are influenced by the media but the other question is what should the advertisement do with the children? These children can't buy anything because they are to young. Another point of view is that you can't bann all the advertisements for young children because first of all the Tv-companies wont show anymore kids-series and how do you want to regulate who's a young children and who's a drunk student who wants to watch Sponge Bob. The more important decision is why do my children have to watch Tv if they so young? So young children should read a little book with their parents and not sit in front of the Tv. These parents are just to exhausted to watch after their kids that is why they put them in front of the Tv. The Tv is a Nanny for times when you don't want to interact with your children but this is a wrong method. If you don't want to be interrupted by your child you have two solutions: a) don't make children and b) put them outside and let them fantasize about the world. Children play alone if you just let them think about how they could spend the day.

Because children have enough imagination for other activities if you let them think and don't put them in front of the Tv where they lose their ability to think about a game. You should not bann Television advertising directed toward young children.
