There is a great deal of advertisement in televison programms all over the world showing the greatest, newest and best things we do not know we want yet. These advertisements influence us on a subconsces level and even if we do not want so change the way we live. Should it be allowed to manipulate the youngest of our species with these advertisements that show ous heavly photoshoped images of a world we live in?
Our society is programmed on being consuming as much as possible. We always want to be up to date with the newest trends and do not want to be left behind. This is how capitalism works.
To get such a well trained society, companies realised that they would have to influence the youngest members of our society, the childrend aged two to five. There is no morning programm for children without advertisements of the must have "Dora the Explorer" writing book and matching to that the new backpack that will surely make you the coolest kid in school. Every mother or father that does not allow his kid to buy any of this marchandise sure has to be evil and not loving his or her child in the eyes of the companies and the children themselves. Which demonic parent does not want his child to be accepted and tollerated in school? But children do not have a good sense of distinguishing between necessary and useless things in life. If they do not get there seventh action hero doll that now is able to handle one weapon more than the old one, they do not understand the world anymore and get angry.
 Therefore we should protect them from the companies that only want profit no matter what and bann advertisements directed to young children in televison
