The question if television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed is very recent. More children are watching TV than ever before, so the industry tries to convience them to have their product. A big part of this advertising are toys. On the one side, in a free marked this advertising should be allowed, because the industry should be able to present their products. On the other side children aged from two to five years are not able to decide what is good for them and what not. So the industry trys to convience them what is good or what they need. Parents often don't like this, because they want to decide what they want to buy them. 
An argument to not disallow the advertising is that the channel has to make money from the advertising, because it is a very important way for them to make money in their buissines. And if they are a channel designed for children, they have to accept this, because no company would show there advertising for adults. 
Another problem is that advertising could get poor failys into trouble. For example if the children is told that he must have a certain product and he thinks this is right, the parents get in trouble, because they can't afford it. 
My opinion is that it should not be disallowed because we live in a free market and the TV channels will probalbly get in a financial trouble. I agree that some advertising is very aggressive, but if the parents really worry about this, they should think about pay TV, where the channel is supported with the money from the subscription and not from the avertising. Remeber you get nothing for free in your live.
