I agree with the statment, that television advertising directed toward young children shounln`t be allowed. Television advertising manipulates the thoughts of the viewers and espacially young children are easy to manipulate. 
If a young child watches an advertising, that shows a spezific thing, for example a toy, it will want that toy, because it just saw how cool it is. Young children aren`t able to think about things as older people and they belive what olders tell them. A television andvertisement shows only the positive things and fitures about a new thing, bacause it should be presented as new and cool as possible. Younger children don`t have the emotionaly strengh to fight against the positive image of the advertised object. They just belive what they were told. 
On the other hand are already many kinds of advertisment avalible and there are other ways to advertise an new product to younger children. An argument for television advertising towards younger children is, that parents decide what they buy their children. Younger childrens aren`t able to go to an store and buy the object which was advertised. So if the childrens get manipulated by the advertising, not all of them get the product. They must confince their parents to buy them the product or they won`t get it.
To sum up there is a problem with televison advertisemant towards younger children, because they`re to easy to manipulate. That is good for the companys which run those advertisemants, but the children aren`t able to buy the product, they have to convince their parents. 
I think television advertising towards younger children shouldn`t be allowed. It`s unfair to promote a product to people who are not able to resiste those advertisments. I fell it`s like television advertising towards younger children is like offering drugs to an drug addicted person. They aren`t able to say resist, but the people who offer it might get profit.
