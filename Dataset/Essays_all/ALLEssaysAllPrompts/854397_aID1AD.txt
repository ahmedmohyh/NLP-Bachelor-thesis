Even though television isn't as popular as it has been a few years ago it is still a big part of our society. Especially younger people are extremely fascinated by their cartoon heroes and favourite shows. But as we all know there's also advertisment in television and children do believe almost everything they see there. They get amazed by the colourful toys and attractions that are shown in TV. So they run up to their parents trying to convince them about buying the newest item they saw. Often parents don't want to buy anything their child wants and so they have to say "no", which easily causes madness when it comes to kids. 

Of course there's also an economical aspect because that's what advertisment is all about, economics. There are thousands of enterprises which are simply based on selling toys to kids. And of course their system wouldn't work anymore without advertising their products in national television. If now television advertising for kids wouldn't be allowed anymore all these enterprises would crash. So completely disallow television advertising for kids isn't really realistic. But I guess children can't handle all the influences television has on them on their own. Parents must supervise their children's behaviour when it comes to television. Also advertisment toward young children should be controlled more. It doesn't take much to convince children, so we have to protect them from all influences. Children shouldn't be abused to make money. Everything sold to children should help them to learn and discover stuff and there are lots of products on the market that don't do that. 

To summ everything up I'd say forbidding television advertising isn't realistic but the future of our world should be protected better when it comes to influences from the outside.
