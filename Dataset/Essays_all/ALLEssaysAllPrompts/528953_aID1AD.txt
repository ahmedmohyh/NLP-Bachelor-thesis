I think it should be allowed to direct advertise toward young children because when you advertise to children they always have to ask there parents in order to buy what was advertised. So the question is if it should be allowed to use children so that they annoy there parents till they buy what they want. But as long as the product advertised doesn't make any harm to young children it isn't different to make advertisment to older people. The goal is always to sell them someting they don't really need or they didn't knew they need it. But when you advertise to young children you always have a second instance that decides if the product gets bought or not. As stated before I think it shouldn't be allowed to advertise to young children when the product advertised has any negative effects for young children. For example products with a high sugar concentration. But in general there's no real reason to not allow advertising toward young children.
