Advertising has always been a controversial topic. From cigarette ads that say smoking is good for you, to offensive tv advertisent and a swearing goat trying to sell Mountain Dew. But claiming that tv advertisement directed towards young children should not be allowed seems a little weird. And I don't really know on which side of this discussion I should be. On one hand I think advertisement in general is a bad thing. It can lead you into buying something you don't really want or weren't really planning on buying. And doing that to little kids is kind of messed up. I don't think a small child should be forced into liking something just because the advertisement of it is flashy and colourful. It's even worse when the product isn't enjoyable to play with. You can compare it with the Pokémon trading card game. Most of the kids didn't know how it was played, they only knew about the anime and just collected the cards. The anime series was just one big advertisement. But on the other hand you could say that it's good for the economy. You have an army of mindless children that will want everything that looks cool on tv. Also we live in a society that is based around consuming and buying expensive stuff we don't really need. We have to learn them young, am I right? Just kidding. I'm really sorry for the parents that have to deal with kids who watch tv advertisements. All the money they have to spend and all the crying children they have to deal with. In conclusion I think tv in general is bad for kids, and if your kid doesn't watch tv it won't watch advertisements directed to him or her. Go send your kids outside to play.
