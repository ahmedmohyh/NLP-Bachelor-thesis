I would say that the teacher has to have a good and honest relation to the students, because it's important that the students can trust trare he teacher otherwiles there is always a bad feeling in the background. If the class likes the teacher, it is often more easy to follow the subject and there is more entusiasmen on both sides.So this to aspects go hand in hand, to some point. On the other side it is said that it is much more easy to follow the teacher, when he is explaining somthing, when you can consentrate yourselve only on the subject and you don't have to pay attention to the things between human and human.
Also on reason for the relation is that you can understand the teacher's problemes when he's not very in the mood or he has a heavy problem. 
A good example is; My friend plays also the piano but we have to different teachers. Mine is very streng and we hardly speak in the lessons. The one of my friend is telling her every time a new story and it isn't rare that she plays not one single play in one hour. In this case I rather like my pianoteacher by whom I can learn something. But in generall, I learn the subject much better when I have a good relation whit my teacher and he or she knows anything about the subject, so it's mostly a mix.
