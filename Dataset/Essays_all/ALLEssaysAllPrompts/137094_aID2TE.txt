It is important, that a teacher can relate well with students, that he is able to understand their problems and can see things also from their point of view. Often, students blaim their teachers for not understanding them and not being nice enough. But is that more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

It is important, that a teacher gets on well with his students. If the students have the feeling, that their teacher tries to unterstand them, they are automatically more motivated and study harder. They see more sense in obeying and in doing, what the teacher wants them to do. Sometimes, there are students, who even see their teacher as an idol. They want him to be satisfied with them and have good marks.

In spite of the fact that it is important, that a teacher tries to relate well with studens, it is even more important that he has enough knowledge and that he knows, how to teach it. Students go to school to learn and get to know new things and the duty of a teacher is, to help them learning it. A teacher should not be seen as a friend or as a nice person to talk with, but as a teacher, who helps the students learning. 
If a student for example does not recieve a good mark, because the teacher had not been able to teach the subject well, it does not help him, if the teacher is always very nice and makes funny jokes. All the students have to reach a certain level until the end of school and that is only possible, if the teacher's knowledge is good enough.

I came to the conclusion, that it is an important part of the job of a teacher to get on well with his students, but that a teacher should have enough knowledge and abilities to teach this knowledge, so that the students can profit from it.
