Nowadays watching television is part of the everyday life of children. As we know not only tv - shows are part of the television programm but also the adverts in between the tv - shows. Now I am going to discuss if these television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

On the one hand television advertising could be something useful, because that's how the children can come in contact with new products. They learn more about the variety of products and can get interested to try new games etc. Moreover the adverts aren't a big danger for the children because they just show new products, which means that there isn't the possibility, that they have a bad influence on the children.

On the other hand by watching televison adverts, the children get influenced on what to buy or what to like, because if they see a special product over and over in the television, they will want to buy that product one day. Especially when the children are in such a young age they can be influenced very easily. Besides that due to the television adverts they can't developp an own opinion of what they like or of what they don't like, because the television adverts bascially forces them to like somethig or to not like something. 

In my opinion television adverts directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I think that it is really important that children especially in that young age, where they start to make an own opinion about things, should be able to decide on their own, without the influence of adverts, what they like or what they don't like. Moreover it is more important to create an own opinion through other human beings like friends or family and not through a machine.
