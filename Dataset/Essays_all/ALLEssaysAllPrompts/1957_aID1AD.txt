In the modern age it is hard to to not be affected by any sort of advertising.
In form of television ads companies try to make their products more popular or better known in general. By having national wide tv ad they can find new buyers of their product very easily.
On the other hand children especially young kids aged two to five shouldn't be confronted with monipulising ads. Because children often believe in the things they are told they can be tricked into wanting everything that is advertised on tv.
Television advertising helps a company to increase their profit and this also means that it important for the national economy. For example the German politicians that made the "Abwrackprämie" in 2009 help a car company to get up after the crisis in 2008 and to make this very important event well known in the public the car company made tv ads.This of course didn't affect the children but it still shows the importance of television advertising. 
Children could be tricked by ads into thinking that they have to have one special toy to be cool. Television ads also often build stereotyps that are very damaging especially for children. When they see on tv that only girls play with Barbie or that only boys can dress up as a pirate they often start to adapt these stereotypes themselves without even realising it and this doesn't only affect them but also the people and kids around them. If they start to believe in these prejudices in kindergarten age they will propably still believe in them when they are in their teens or an adult.
I don't agree with the statement that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because I think that the companies have to get their products to the people somehow. But I also think that when they make an ad for a new toy they should show a bit diversity and let boys play with a doll or girls with sword. The last thing is that I believe that kids that young should not watch tv at all.
