I partly agree.
Whenever discussing a topic, it is not enough to simply see it as black and white. For finding a solution that is best for all, we must consider finding it in none of the extremes, therefore the question asked can not be accurately answered, not by me and probably not by a higher percentage of people. Nevertheless, I will try.
Television is a media that can be accessed by most people in our society, but unlike with other things, we can choose  to see, or not to see what we want on said media. Of couse, children that are aged between 2 and 5 years old,m do not, or only partly have the abillity to do so, but it lays in the responsibility of their parents to show them, or not show them the content that appears fitting to them. It is also their responsibility to only let them watch television for a reasonable time period. Adittionally, children of that age do not have acess to oney, which disables them to buy the advertised things, this also lies in the responsibility of the parents. To evaluate what, and what not to buy, and to teach teir children that they do not need all things. On the other side, It may be rather bad for the developement of the children, if from such a young age, the necessity to buy things is pushed uppon.
