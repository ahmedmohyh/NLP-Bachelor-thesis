In my opinion a teacher should be able to have both qualifications because even if a teacher can relate well to the students if he doesn't know a thing about the subject beeing taught the students can't learn anything from the teacher. On the contrary if a teacher doesn't know how to relate well with the students even if he has exellent knowledge of the subject he might not be able to teach it to the students because they might not be interested in the things the teacher is saying.
In my opinion it also depends on the form of school where the teacher is teaching at. In an elementary school for example a teacher doesn't have to have execellent knowledge of the subject because he only has to teach basic things. So in an elementary school it is in my opinion way more important that the teacher can relate well to the students. On the other hand on an in Germany so called "gymnasium" the teacher should have a pretty good knowledge of the subject he teaches because here the students maybe have to write their final exams about that subject. Also as the students get older they don't need the teacher to relate that good to them anymore it is nice to have a teacher who can relate to you as a student but at some age if a teacher can't do that the students can still learn the things he teaches. If you go a bit further you can also see that at the universities the teachers don't relate at all to their students most of the time they don't even know the names of the students. The older the students get the more can they learn even if the teacher can't relate to them. So in my opinion as stated before I think in the elementary school it is important for a teacher to relate to the children but as they progress it gets less and less important.
