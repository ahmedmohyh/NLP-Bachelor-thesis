In my opinion the statement is wrong. Because in our age i think, if a teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject you defenetely will profitate if you want to. Shure if you are a leazy student a teacher with good relations to the students may be able to teach them even more. But we shouldnt forget, that students at a secondary level are here because they want to which means its in their own interess that they pay atention to the subject. Which leads to the my main point, that if student are encouraged they will learn far more from a teacher who has a excellent knoeledge of his subject. If we thake a look at history for example there is the teacher which waches a interessting movie, whit well known actors, about the theme youre looking at ,at the moment. On the oter hand there is the teacher which copys you 20 pages out of one of the greatest books which were written about that topic and tells you to read it and we will disous about it next time. Then the interssted student will profit and learn much more about the topic by reading the text properly. The lazy student on the other hand will not read the text but he would like the movie and profitate far more of it then from the text. So as we see it dosnt depend onto the teacher that much but also on the students. Finally i guess it can be said that in primary scool the ability to relate with the students is a more importend ability which, the teacher should have. But in secondary scool this canges, because from that point students can get expected to handle whit a teacher with excellent konwledge of his subject.
