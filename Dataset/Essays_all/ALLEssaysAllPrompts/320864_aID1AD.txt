Imagine your in the Bahnhofstrasse and you see a little boy who is shouting at his mother, that he wants to buy a action-figur which he saw in television-advertise. To change this television advertising should not be allowed.

First of you have to say that it isn`t very terrible for little kids if they watch a television advertisment because they can`t do anything or perhaps they don`t understand the advertsie yet. And it`s also the faut of the parents of the child if the child watches television at this age.
But on the other side tabletts, computers and televisions get more and more popular. That leads to that even children at the age of 2-5 already have a smartphone or a tablett. In other words this means everybody has electronic things so the parents can`t do anything against. It`s also a problem that little children, if they have seen something on TV, they want it. So they ask their parents to buy and the parents are going to get it or they start to argue with the kid. In the end the kid has his toy or it`s crying because it didn`t get the the toy. Both options aren`t really options because it isn`t fair to influent little kids who can`t defend their selfs against these advertises. 

In conclusion I totally agree with this statement.
