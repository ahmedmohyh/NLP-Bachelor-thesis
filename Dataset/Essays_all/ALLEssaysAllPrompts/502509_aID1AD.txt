I wouldn't say, that television is just bad for children, it really can be helpful sometimes. I think you can learn a lot about some documentaries about a specific topic. But the problem is the age. With an age of two to five you're not able to understand these documentaries, so it has some TV programs for young children. But they're so stupid sometimes and I think in this age you shouldn't watch TV already. It has many things a child could do, like playing outside with their friends, reading a book, playing with their toys or doing something with their parents. With an age of five I would allow my child to watch TV at the weekend if he wants to. But not everyday and just with a time limit. Maybe thirty minutes on a rainy sunday. I can't understand how so many parents let their children watch TV during the whole day instead of doing some acitivities with them. I think the parents are sometimes so tired from the whole week, when they worked everyday from nine to five and they just want to relax a few hours, so the best way to keep your child calm, is putting them in front of the TV. When it happens not that often and not that long, I think it's ok but only at an age of five, I think two or three is really too young to watch TV. They can barely talk, so i'm not sure if they really understand something. As a parent I also would look what kind of things my child watch on TV, not everything is that clever for a child at an age of two to five. So my last words I want to say, is that i'm not really into letting young children watching TV, but I think the time makes the big difference between the good or the bad.
