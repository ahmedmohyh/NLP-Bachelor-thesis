Advertisment here, advertisment there. In the television, on the radio or on the street, I think we all know it. We have to ask us: Is it good or helpful for us or do they just want our money? We are so influenced by advertisnig, we do not really recognize it. 
In the following part I discuss the question whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
We all know young children are so fascinated of television, phones and this kind of stuff. When they are confronted by televison advertising is the danger, that if they watch for example an advertisment for some kind of toys, that the children want that toy and more and more. And of course the parents can not say "yes" to everything, so they dont understand with their young age why these children in the televison are allowed to have this toy and not they. Furthermore another argument against television advertisng should be allowed for young children is, that you often see things which is not for the eyes of children with two to five years, for example advertisment for ciggarets, condoms, alcohol or whatever. They are too young for this stuff and would not understand the world anymore, because this all is new for them.
But in my opinion advertisment is not just bad and that is it. The things what I have written in the first part can happen, but I think there are so many children which can not taken the content of advertising in their mind, they dont realize what they are watching. These young kids are just fascinated of the colours which are changing all the time on the monitor. I would say it depends on the child
