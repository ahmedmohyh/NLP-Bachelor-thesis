Today the television is a normal part of our day. Most people sitting in the evening in front of there TV and watching the news. But the program changes over the last years. First there are only some movies for adults but today half of the day´s program are for children. Especially young children in the age of two to five can sit the whole day in front of the TV and watch any series. But should this be allowed or not?
I think most children who watch TV the whole day do this because they can´t do anything else. When they go to the kindergarten they hear all other children talk about a new series in TV or about the last episode or movie. Because of that they have to watch this series or movie, too, to talk with other children about this. This can be one reason why children wnt to watch TV. 
An other reason, when the parents of a child have to go to work and the child is the afternoon completly alone, it watch TV because it´s boring without anyone, who could play with the child. So it´s just for being entertained. 
But this aren´t reasons why it should be allowed, just why children watch the whole afternoon TV. 
When you have a look in this series for children then you can find some really interesting facts but the rest is nonsense. For adults it can be possible to split of the facts and the other stuff but could do a child this splitting off? I don´t think so. 
And because of that the children gets stupid ideas and will have confusing dialogues with friends because each friend have an other stupid idea.
In my opinion the parents of a child should really try to cotrole the time their children will sit in front of a TV. You have to allowed your children to watch TV. Otherwise they haven´t the chance of find new social connections because they haven´t a topic to talk about. But it will be better for a child to play with friend or there parents without any electric stuff because it´s better for education the of the child.
