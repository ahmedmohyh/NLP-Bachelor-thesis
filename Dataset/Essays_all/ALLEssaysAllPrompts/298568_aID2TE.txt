This subject is rather contraversial in many ways. I certainely do not believe that one can generalize things. But if I would have to say out of my own experiences. I would say that the abillity to relate to your students is far more important than a teachers knowledge. Because teaching is communication. One tries to share their knowledge. If one can relate to another person, then one can communicate better. One has to be able to know how to teach. The way of teaching is more important than the knowledge of the subject. If there would be two hypothetical teachers. Teacher A would be able to relate to the students more yet teacher B would be able to relate. Teacher A would be the better choice. The students would listen to him more. O
