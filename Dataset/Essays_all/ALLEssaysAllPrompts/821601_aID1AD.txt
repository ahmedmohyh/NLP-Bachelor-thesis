I think children shouldn't get used to our world full of advertises that young. I think it manipulates their opinion on different things. In that age you start to develope your own creativity. It would be bad to show them things better than they are, because that way they want a product and when they get it they notice that it's way less fun than they thought it would be. I think it would be more difficult for them to develope their creativity and dreams if they were manipulated by advertises. Another point is that your childhood is the most beautiful time in your life and it shouldn't be disturbed by annoying advertises on the TV, that's not enjoyable. All things considered I think there shouldn't be advertising toward young children. But to be honest I think kids that age shouldn't spend too much time on the TV at all.
