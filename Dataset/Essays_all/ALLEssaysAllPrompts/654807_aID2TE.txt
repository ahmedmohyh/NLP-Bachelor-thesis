The ability t relate well with students is extremely important for a teacher. Without this trait a teacher would simply be an expert on the topic, but not able to transfer his or her knowledge. The teacher does not have to be overly popular among students, but the teacher should have a minimal sense of decency and stay human for the students. The students should understand that the teacher is human and just doing his job as well as he can. Sometimes if the teacher shows some empathy towards the students, the students might be more likely to have some empathy with the teacher when he is having a bad day and is not in the best mood. Sometimes teachers lack basic human social skills because they think they have to play an authoritarian role as a teacher. This I think is a great misconception. The teacher must always be the most understanding and compassionate person in the classroom. It is vital for a good relationship between students and their teacher for both of them understanding eachothers situation and being forgiving, when something doens't quite go their way.
A teacher without knowledge would simply be a manager. For students to respect him it is important that he shows a certain knowledge and is able to answer most of their questions with certainty and without hesitation. He does not have to be an expert on the topic, but he shouldn't be insecure about the subject on the level he is teaching.
I think both the ability to relate well and excellent knowledge of the subject being taught are extremely important traits for a teacher. Without one of these two parameters I think he chose the wrong job. You cannot be a teacher without being able to relate with the students. It would make it impossible for you to teach the students anything. But without excellent knowledge on the subject being taught there is no real reason for you to talk to them in the first place.
