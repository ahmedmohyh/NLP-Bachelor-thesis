Today it's important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with sudents. Because if a teacher can talk with students and has a connection to them, they like it more to learn something from him. If a teacher doesn't know how to find a connection with his students, he hasn't really a chance to make them learning something about his subject.  As an example: I often hear from students in my class or people from other classes, that they like a subjekt more, when they like a teacher. If they don't like a teacher, they're not really motivated to do homework or to make researches about this topic at home. It also can be, that they don't like to go to this lessons and just miss this classes.

On the other side, it's very important for a teacher to have excellent knwolede of the subject he's teaching. Because even when he has the ability to relate well with students, it's important that the facts about the subject he's teaching are true. When a student learns wrong facts about a subject he likes, it can be that he's going to fail an importent exam because he learned the false facts and believed the teacher that they were true. Also when a teacher has excellent knowledge of a subject, students who realise this, can get more interested because they know, that they can learn a lot of this teacher.

In my opinion, it's important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students but it is more important, that he has excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. This because, a teachers job is it, to teach the students something about a subject and not to be friends with them or to look hat they like him. If a student doesn't like a topic or a teacher and skips class because of this, it's not the fault of the teacher, it's the fault of the student and so he has to look for himself, where to find informations about the subject. 
But if a teacher gives them wrong informations it has a bigger impact and the teacher could ruin the marks of his students.
