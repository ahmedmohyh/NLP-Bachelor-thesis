Many young children watch TV or use mobile phones but when we are at this stage of life we should be playing outside with other kids or spending time with the family. I understand that it may really be a problem that most parents have to work and they don`t always have time for their kids but it is the wrong way to just put them in front of the TV or give them a mobile phone to play. When children watch TV too often they don`t have the chance to socialize with other kids in their age which may cause problems later when they are at school. But the advertisements in TV which are for kids and starred by kids don`t consider that problem and they are especially produced that children watch them. That is not particularly good for the child who is watching them and on the other hand not better for the kid that is part of the advertisement because both of them can`t be outside playing with friends and making their good or also bad experiences. They are way too early in the life of an adult who always need to work and type on their technical devices and are stressed when they can`t, like a kind of an addiction. It`s not only the social factor but also the health which suffers from this TV or mobile phone addiction and kids shouldn`t be part of it at all. So I really support the statement that Televsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
