Going to school is a normal habit here in Switzerland. Children learn a lot during their school time. From how to write to how they should solve difficult mathematics exercises. It is an on-going process. The school is a big part in your youth. So you better feel good in your class and come along with your teacher. But what is more important? That the teacher relates well with the students or that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches?

It is a fact that students learn better and easier when they get along well with the teacher. They like to sit in the classroom and listen to the teacher. They do not do any noise or stupid things which are not allowed in the classroom. They are interested in what he says. They do their homework and learn for the test, to get a sufficient mark. If the teacher`s knowledge is not excellent but good enough his ability to be a nice teacher who can relate well with his students is more important. 

On the other hand, teachers who do not have an excellent knowledge can not teach the students good enough. 
He makes mistakes in what he says or does not know the answer to a student`s question. The students can not profit from the lessons and can not get better in the subject. The kids go to school to learn something and not to spend their time on sitting in the classroom and even the teacher does not know what he is talking about. The teacher should be prepared for the lessons, and this is only possible with an ecxellent knowledge of his subject. 

To sum up I can not agree or disagree. I think a happy medium would be the best solution. It is right, you can not learn from someone who has a bad knowledge of a topic or a subject. But you do not want to learn from someone with an ecxellent and perfect knowledge but who relates badly with students either. I do not like sitting in the classroom during a lesson with a teacher I can not stand because he does not treat me like a full human being. A teacher has to be good at both.
