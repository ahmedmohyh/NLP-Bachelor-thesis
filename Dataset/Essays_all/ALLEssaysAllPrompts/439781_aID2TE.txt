A teacher's ablility to relate to students is something not many teachers have. It is a gift that helps the students feel more comforable with their teacher and makes the student have an interest in what the teacher has to say. A teacher with excellent knowledge of his subject, has though other ways to make their student enjoy and process the topic he has given them. I have expirienced teachers that I couldn't relate to at all, but at the end of the year I'd still look back and think:"Wow, I've learned a lot this year." Being a teacher who can relate to their students is good. A teacher who is able to share their knowledge, wisdom and makes their students interested in a topic is far greater. You can not become a teacher without knowledge and the more knowledge the better. I am convinced that the more information and knowledge you share with yout students, will at some point awake their attention and interest. So in my opinion it is the other way around. A teachers excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important that a teachers ability to relate well with students. Being able to relate with your students is a nice thing to have, but if you have a lot of knowledge you will at the end of the day awake your students interest and relate through the topic.
