More and more young children between the age of two to five watch TV instead of playing with other kids in the garden or drawing a picture or something like that. Has this change something to do with the parents who are to busy to look after their children? 

When the mother and the father of young children have to work, they often can't pay attention to their kids and therefore they allowd them to watch TV. Children who can watch TV are mostly calm and because of that the parents can relax after a hard day. To watch TV is also less expensive than to pay for a babysitter who look after their kids. 
But the negative points of watching television advertising as a young child are strong. Young children should better use their spare time to play outdoor and together with other kids. They should enjoy their age because they have so much energy. Many children don't understand what the people on the TV want to say and what the background of an advertising is. It's also a fact that children who see something on TV they like, for example a special toy, they always want to have this and then it's difficult for the parents to say no. 

I personaly think that young children shouldn't watch TV advertising because they are to young to understand this stuff and they schould learn to play together witch other kids and to see how the nature functions and so on.
