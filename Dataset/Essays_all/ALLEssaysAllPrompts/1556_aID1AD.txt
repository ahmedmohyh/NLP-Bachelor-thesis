In the following I am going to dicuss if customer directed advertising should be allowed for children aged between two and five.

Almost everybody knows nowadays how advertising works and how the companies are tryieng to sell there products.
They try to influence the customers by using smells or by eye pleasing pictures.
So the companies decidet to show there advertisements and commercials to people who are not understanding what they are looking at or who don´t know how the machinery of capitalism works. Children.

Children who love to watch there favourite tv show should get interrupted by advertisements which are are directed towards them. The companies would for example use there favourite charakters that would try to sell a special toy to a child. There are some different things that could happen if the child would watch that commercial. Firstly, the child would hate the characters now because they are advertising stuff which the child does not want or it would get scared by the advertisement. Secondly, the companies would achieve what they want and the parents of the child would buy this toy. And finally, the child would want the toy but the parents could not afford it so child would get sad. 

It does not need to be only a bad thing. 
The commercials could also show how important it is to learn, to obey your parents by advertising pre school and kindergarten books. And thats it.

In my opinion such advertisement would be bad for the psychological health of a child.
It could diturb the child or bring hate into a family.
