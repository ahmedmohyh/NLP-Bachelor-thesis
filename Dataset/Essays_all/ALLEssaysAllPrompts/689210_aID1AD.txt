The question whether television advertising directed toward young children, from age two to five, should be forbidden by law is controversial. This essay is going to examine the issue from three differnt aspects to conduct a reasonable answer. 

Firstly one could ask herseld or himself, why should someone wants to invest in two to five years old children. Those children somehow don't earn any money to spend, neither do they get any from their parents, and mostly their understanding is not enough developped to obtain the message of the advertisers. 

On the other hand it can be argued that they do respond to advertising and that there is really a danger. Namely the companies stress a psychological effect on the children. That means that advertising occurs to manipulation toward kids in therearly growing stage. 

Last but not least one needs to question the system and its reason. In general kids should not watch any advertising on television. If they do, it means on one hand that they watch more than 25min on one stroke, which is obciously not healthy, and on the other hand that theîr parents are not able to control the amount of time that their kids watch and secondly, more importantly: what they watch. 

Therefore I do stronly believe that the parents of the children should be aware of their responsibility and the law should not interfere in the advertising in television. This would only give the parents the signal to be less cautious about their children's activities.
