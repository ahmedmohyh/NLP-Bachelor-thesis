In the following text I will inform you about television advertising.
I am agree with this Statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects.
The first one is that the children often want the object in the televion. They think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents. If they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents. The parents don't like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them.
Forthermore the childrens often dont need the object. The seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say. He only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents.
In addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising. The children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money. If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life. 
All in all the advertising isn't good for the young people. It stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends.
