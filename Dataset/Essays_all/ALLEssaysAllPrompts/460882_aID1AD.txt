The television. An Invention that has changed the life of many people. One aspect is the aspect of the economy: Since the television has been invented, there is a new way of advertising. Millions of people are able to see one's product in the television. A completely new strategy to reach the customers, with something that is more than normal in nearly every house of every family in the modern world.


No matter what the ad is about, they all follow the same goal: The producer want us to buy the new table or the pretty bed or whatever. Today, it's more than usual that the people who are conected to a television become younger and younger, because it's a normal thing today. Even two or three year old children can see advertisments.

That is the point 'd like to discuss. Children with that age can't build their own reason. They think about what they like or what they don't like. They don't really know that it's just an ad, that they probaably get pranked or that everything in the ad is a lie. They just want that little toy because they think it's something really cool. And if they see something they are really proud of, the walk to mom and dad and want them to buy it. If they do, the producers win, because their strategy was succsessful.

I think because of the statements I gave in my text, there shouldn't be any ads for children who are younger than five or six years old. They can't do any desicions about a toy or whatever in an advertisment of a producer who only wants to sell something to earn money. Of course, the strategy of the sellors is brilliant. Making ads for people wyho can't decide if something is good or if something is absolutely rubbish.


The tv shouldn't be used for ads who are directed at children who are under five years old!
