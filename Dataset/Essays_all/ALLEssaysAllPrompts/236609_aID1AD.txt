Todayit is the easyest thing to let children looking TV. You don't have to tidy a room full of stuff whitch they let laying around and where you probably can slip out on them. The children stay in one room where you don't always have to look after them, they don't run away.
The most important thing for children to discover the word by touching everything. They should look at things, feel the surface of diffrent things, smell how they are. Children learn by dooing and playing with real stuff, even if you have to tidy up the room at the end of the day.
Children dont have to sit in a room the whole day. They have to run around, even if they get hurt and get dirty. Outside. Discover the nature. Learn what they are able to do, learn to do things at their own and get confidence.
I think the most importent thing for children is playing with their hands to learn. To feel, so smell and looking.TV should not be forbidden but parents have to allow to their children in a normal way. 
The childhood in this time and the years after are one of the most important times forming the personality. The creativity, confidence and behavior.
