A teacher without excellent kownledge isn't a good teacher because he can't learn you all the things he have to because he hasn't all this knowledge.

A teacher who can't relate well with students shouldn't be teacher because this is the importest thing of beeing teacher.

Which one is wrong, which one write?
In my opinion both is very important. If you have a teacher who can relate verry well with students but he has't a huge knowledge than he can't learn you a lot of important things. He might be more loved by the students because he understands them and could talk in a way they like and understand well. But if he  can't learn you for example the whole grammar of german, than you have a missing part of something you should have learned in school.
Otherwise when the teacher has an excellent knowledge but can't relate well with students, than he hasn't a completed knowledge. To relate well with students it's another part of knowledge every teacher should have. How could he be a good teacher when he can't explain the things in a way that every students understands. Or how could he be good when he can't imagine how the students feel and maybe explain things according the students so that they could understand everything. Worser is when the teacher really don't care about his students and just learn them the things to have his job done.

Finally I would say that both is important but it is better when the teacher could at first sight relate well with students. In this way the students will learn much more than with teacher with an excellent knowledge who cannot explain, understand and think a little bit like his students.
