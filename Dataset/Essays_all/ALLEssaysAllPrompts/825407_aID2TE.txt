The question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught has been discussed for a long time, and is still a current topic which needs a lot of discussion and thinking about.

Those who agree with this statement say that if a teacher cannot relate with the students, the studens do not get any information of the subject being taught because they do not understand its importancy and are not interested in it.

Against this can be said that if a teacher can relate well with the students but does not really understand the subject he teaches, he simply is not a teacher. This is because first of all, a teacher has to understand his own subjects. Therefore, for being a teacher the knowledge of the subject is more important than the ability to relate well with the students.  

Those in favour of the statement mention that the development of an interest in the subject being taught by the students is the most important thing a teacher has to do. It may be important to understand the subject, but awaking a will to learn and an interest in the subject is alwys the first and most important step. 

Those who are against the statement say that developing an interest in the subject being taught does not help anything at all if the teacher cannot explain it to the students. No matter how interested the students are in a subject, it always needs a good explanation, and this can be given only if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches.

I am against the statement because the arguments in favour do not persuade me while in my opinion a teacher has to have an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches to explain it well to the students. Otherwise, he should not be allowed to be a teacher in my opinion.
