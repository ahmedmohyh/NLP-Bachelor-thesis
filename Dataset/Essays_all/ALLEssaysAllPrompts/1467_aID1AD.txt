When childrens not be allowed to watch television, thy can play and have a very nice childhood, so we many people in the past. They dont musst watch television to have fun or a perfect live. The Children can play withe thy parent or friends or they can go out whith al aged og five together with his or her parents. Also it ist better when they parents read  a book for his child. The don´t have contact with televisions and other electric things in this age. The don´t need in this young age contact with the media of the world. It is not importen to do taht in thei age Thy wont to have a nice childhood with much time outside and not in the livingroom. Also the children dont understand what is wright or wrong what the people do in the televison and they do the wrong thinks, because the learn it from a show charakter.  
But ther are many television shows for young children, who thy can learn, things for the kindergarden or the school, also the parent musen´t sitt the whole time be the child. The child look on the television and make nothing els. But the child can learn also in the kindergarden or with pictur books and not with the television. I found children dont need a television in this age, because thy don´t understand this all and play whith friends or whith his or her perents is better than look the whole time for the television. In my childhood i don´t watch much Television, because i play often with my sister and my parent. When my parent had any time my grandparents came and we make much thinks with them, so we had not so much time to watch televisions. But somteims we watch learnig shows, but than for on hour and that not very often.
