A question, that is very important to us and for our future is, how our teachers should be. Is it needed, that they have a good relation to their students or is it more important what they know about their subject. Sure the best mixture would be if they both of them was real.

The people who want the teachers to have a good relation to their students are mostly the students or passed students. They did not like it when the teacher was to focused on his subject without time for the students. So they liked it when they had a good teacher who they could talk with.

But I think this opininion changes as soon as you are parents or maybe even before. When you want your son or daughter or even yourself to be educated good. Then you start to refer a teacher who knows his subject over a teacher you have a good relation to. Because you want to learn more and you are not going there to make friends.

For me I think a good mixture is the best. A teacher should have a good relation to his students but maybe not to good. He is still the teacher lika your supervisor in the job. You need to do what he says and if a teacher is to nice to his students they do not care about when he tries to give you commandments. But the teacher also should not be to much focused on the knowlegde of students. He sould let them learn the most important things and answer all their questions but he should not expect that they can do the same as they do not care as much as him about the subject. So a good mixture should be the aim. A teacher with a good relation to students, but not as a friend who can help them in every question but does not expect this from his students.
