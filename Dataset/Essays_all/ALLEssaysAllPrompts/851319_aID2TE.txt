The statement is about the realte between teachers and stundents. If the have to be tough and teach them how to learn the language English or eighter soft and lovely and they won't arrive the level of knowledge of the other students. 


The main advantage of the pro arguments is that teachers who treat the students softly are more likeable for students and they often go to school with motivation and happyness. In our age, if the students have a good realtion to the teacher the lessons are better and the students are more relaxed.

Moreover If they relate well the students could have a conversation about grades and they are kind with them. For example if a student had a worse mark but they got a reason why they weren't prepeard enough. In case of a funeral or something else on the family base. Probably he could ask the teacher for doing the test a second time. 

Another argument is that students work more in lessons where they are motivated or like to go in. In fact, a journal wrote about this theme and wrote that kids have more brain activity when they are happy and like the teaching of the lesson.


On the other hand there are arguments of the contra side. First of all, if a teacher treat the students tough they only want to make them better in English. They want that the students are good in English after years. The thinking of the teacher wants only to teach you to better students.

The second argument is that in some professions you need English for conversations.

In my opinion I think teachers have to be hard to students, because they will be thankful after years. They can speak with English people without gramatical faults or have to search vocubalary in a dictionary. In our age, English is more important than other people think so. All the social networks are sometimes in English and then you want to understand thinks and not to have no idea what it could mean.
