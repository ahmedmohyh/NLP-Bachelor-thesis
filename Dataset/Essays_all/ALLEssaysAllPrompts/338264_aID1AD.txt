Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed
In our time televisions, mobile phones, computers and all the other electronic things are a very important thing in our life. Already for young children. We even can't image a life without all these medias.That is one point, that we really depend form this things. But the other point is that they influence us in a way that we even don't know. Mostly everywhere we are confrontated whith advertisings. So should televison advertising especially directed toward young children not be allowed? 
Television advertising for adult and also teenagers is already not a good thing, because much of them believe that, what they say. But for young children it's much more bad than for us. For example there is 5 years old boy who saw in the televison that he should defenetly buy the new chocolate because it will give him more force in his life. So imagine the young boy will run to his mother and ask her to buy him this chocolate. He cries and says that he absolutly needs that chocolate to have more force. The young boy isn't old enough to know that this can not be real.
On the other side it is in the hands of the parents. They should decide what is good for their own children and what not. So if they think that the young boy for example isn't old enough to "not influence himself" they shou

So in my opinion televison advertising for yound children should not be allowed because they are still too young to beurteilen what is true and waht not.
