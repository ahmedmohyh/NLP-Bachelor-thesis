I'm disagree with this statement, because in our school are teachers who not have an idea how to teach us, they think  they're cool when they can relate well with students. But especially in the gymnasium we want to learn something and when the teacher has no idea, we don't have d the ability to learn something.
An other point is, when the teacher relate well with students it's to easier for us to influe our marks because we can talk with the teacher and he give us an another chance or push our marks a bit up. And I think a teacher mustn't relate well with stundents then when you have a teacher who is really hard and no one likes, you preparate better because you have more respect and eventuelly you are anxious.You are so much more concetrate when the teacher is more hard and the stuff is more intresting an this only in cause of his excellent knowledge. Is the teacher more intelligent you want to learn more. Another bad side from not having the knowledge is in sport, you can't do sport with children when you don't know how.
But in the music lessons it's the opposite. There you wnat to have a great time and do music and when you have a teacher who not able to relate well with students it's just hard to go through the music lessons. When the teachers knowledge in music isn't very well it's not yellow from egg because every teacher can make a bit music. 
When the teacher has the knowledge you want to learn this because the human is an animal who want to know everything and want to be better than the others, so he improve more from a teacher whose ability to relate well with students isn't very perfect but his knowledge is excellent like a genius.
