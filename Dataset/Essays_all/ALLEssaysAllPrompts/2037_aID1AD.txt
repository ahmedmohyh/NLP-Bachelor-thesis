In the following, the statement "Television advertising directed toward young childre (age two to five) should not be allowed will be discussed. 
First of all, one could support the statement by saying that the advertisement could influence or even manipulate children at such a young age. Young children are not aware of the influence that advertisement might have on them and they do not understand that some advertisement is unrealistic and creates a wrong picture of some situations. For example, there are advertisements in which a girl talks to a cow that produces yoghurt. Advertisements like that might make children of a very young age believe that they will have the ability to talk to cows once they ate the yoghurt. They will be unhappy to realize that they will not have that ability.
On the other hand, one could say that there is no problem in advertisement directed toward yound children because children cannot be prevented from advertisement anyways. Even if advertising directed toward young children would be prohibited, they would most likely see advertisement directed toward older children or adults. This could cause problems because the advertisement could be unappropriate for a young child if they are about controversial toppics. The influence that this could have on children can be much worse than the influence of advertising directed toward them.
Therefore I believe that children should rather be introduced to advertisement that is appropriate for their age so they have time to realize that the advertisement is meant to influence them and can learn to cope with the effects that advertisements have on them. As a responsible parent, one could also talk to your children about television advertising and its impacts.
