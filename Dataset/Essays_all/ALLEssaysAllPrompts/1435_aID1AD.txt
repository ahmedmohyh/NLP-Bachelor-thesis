The question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed, gives a few positive and negative arguments.

One positive argument is that they could find new things and would try to taste them. Like if the Kid doesn't like tomato's, but in the advertising is someone who eats one and tells that it is really delicious, so they would like to eat them and they get new experience.

A negative point is, that in the advertising could be games, which looks so good that the child wants it and crys until he gets it. And so the parents would by it more, than if they don't watched the advertising. So they get very influenced by the advertising.

I think that it is not so got for the children, because they could get spoiled if they become everything that they want and get influenced of the advertising of what they like and of what they don't like. But in some case it is not so bad for the children, because they sometimes have no idea what the people in the television is talking and they don't even get whats happening
But for the Company it is good, because they can sell more. The kids get more influenced than the parents or older kids.
