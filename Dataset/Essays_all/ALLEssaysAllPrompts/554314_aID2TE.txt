There exists a statement that the teacher's ability to deal with students is more important than an excellent knowledge of his subject. It is a really interesting and controversal question, which caracteristics a good teacher must have.

An argument which shows, that the teacher's relation with the students is the most important thing, is that students feel better if they get on well with their teacher. If a student likes his teacher, he or she has the will to behave well and has motivation to learn for his subject. The students don't want to enttäuschen their teacher. For example, if a teacher always shouts at his students, they are afraid of going to school.

On the other hand, it is really exhausting if a teacher doesn't know his subject very well. If a student asks a question and the teacher has to look it up in the internet before he can answer it, it is quite strange for his students. After a certain time, every student starts to ask himself or herself, why he or she is coming to school if they know more than their teachers. They don't get a good preparation for a higher school or university. If a teacher sometimes tells different things which contradict each other, the students don't really know what's correct.

I can understand both sides. I have teachers I don't like and also teachers who have no idea of their subject.In my opinion, both sides are very important and a good teacher is liked by his students as well as he understands his subject perfectly. But I think, it's more important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject, because I could learn better at home and look things up in the internet on my own. I can deal better with a teacher I don't like than with a teacher who has no idea of his subject. In my opinion, there is also an other important point. It is the teaching style of a teacher. If a teacher only shows videos, but is a nice person and knows many things about his subject, I can't like this subject.
