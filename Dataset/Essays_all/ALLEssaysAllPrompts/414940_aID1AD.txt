Television advertising is most of the time really annoying for us. When we want to watch a film and there are always these ten-minute-breaks in it full of advertising, some of us are getting really angry. But should it be allowed to show some television advertising for younger children in the age between two and five? 
I don't think it should. They are too young to know if they want to watch the advertising or not. The companies are making profit out of this. They want younger people to buy (or make their parents buy) their products. I think children should be protected from all the advertising stuff. They should have time to grow up and they should learn in the kindergarden and the school about it. After that, they can decide much better what they want to do. In option to the advertising toward young children, there're can be produced some advertising toward their parents. These are the people who have to spend the money on it and these are the people who have to deal with the wishes of their kids.
On the other hand, there is no reason why the children (aged two to  five) should watch television anyway. I was playing football and jumping around when i was that young. Thats why I think that parents should protect their children from modern technology until they're old enough to understand.
After all, I really agree with this statement.In my opinion it's fairer not to show television advertising to young children.
