In the next few lines I tell you some pro and cons about the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.". 

The most important thing is that a teacher must now everything about his subject. Because the teacher gives his know to the students and when he didn't know everything then he can't give the students the full knowledge. But the relationship to the students is also very important, because when the students hate the teacher they doesn't listen to him so they doesn't follow the lessons. But when the teacher talks only the students don't listen to him, he must include the students so they had no other options as follow the lessons. Fevermore the teacher must now more then the students. For example in an english lesson, when a student speak with the teacher and the teacher doesn't know any vokab that the student use, then he can't answer or he can't say the sentence in a with a better language. And when the teacher doesn't know everything he had a very bad self-confidence. An option for a teacher is that he make a trip to a destination where the students can see and learn. When the teacher do that he can show his knowledge and had a good relationship.

I think both is important but the knowledge is more important then the relatonship. Because the teachers must know more then some students, he study the subject. So I disagree.
