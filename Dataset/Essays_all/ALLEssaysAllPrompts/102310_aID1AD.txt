Is television advertising directed toward young children useful, unnecessary or should it even be forbidden? In this statement it says that television directed toward young children should not be allowed.

I don't agree with this statement because I think there should be an equality between all advertiser and no one should be disadvantaged because of the fact that it is directed toward young children. Almost everyone can advertise his products so why should these type of commercials be forbidden? There are even commercials for health-influencing products such as cigarettes or alcohol. This prohibition would cause an immense disequality which is unbearable fr today's society. Although I must say that I don't think that these young children will be affected or influenced by these ads. But still, it's in the advertisers own right to advertise their products. The young children will see it on the television but most of the time they won't think about it for too long or they aren't even interested in what is shown to them. It could be that they like the color or sound of it, for example when it's a toy, but even when they like the product it's still in the parent's right to buy it or not to buy it. The parent's will decide if it's good for the child or not, because children aged two to five aren't yet able to decide for their own but the grown up people nowadays are able to decide for their own if they need the advertised product and if they want to buy it or not. You can't take away the rightful freedom of these people, mostly parent's, to think and decide on their own. 

To sum it up I think because of these following main reasons, the equality and freedom of advertisement and the people's right, most of the time the parent's right, to decide for their own whether they want to buy the product or not, I still disagree with the mentioned statement.
