In my opinion it isn't as important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject. A teacher can make a realy big diffrence for a student. Aspecialy at a young age a teacher can realy make a diffrence in a students live.
When the teacher realates well with a student it's easier for him to learn all the neccessary things. And what's much more important is that the student could have fun at class. When that's the case it's also a lot easier for the teacher to give all his knoledge to his students. 
I'm a student myself so I can relate realy good to this question. I have a treachar which fits realy good to this case and she is my favorite teachor. From time to time she has to lock in a book or the internet to answer my question but then she really takes that effort and tries to answer it perfectly. My only disadvantage in this situation is that i have to wait a little bit till my queston is been anwerd.
I think the best teachor would be one who combines both of this abbilitys. The excellent knowledge of the subject and the ability to realate well with the students. But when I dad to chose betwen these two options I would prefer the teachor I have the better relationship.
