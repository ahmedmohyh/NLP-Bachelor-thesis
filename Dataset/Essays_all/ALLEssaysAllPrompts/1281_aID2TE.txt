"Teacher`s ability"

The statement that teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject is nowdays a big theme in our comunity.
Teacher`s dont need to have an excellent knowledge of the subject, they just need to have enough knowledge for the students. It`s impossible that teacher`s know everyting. They need to know how to show the student`s the information and how to relate with them. 
It`s often typicall when you dont like your teacher that you will write bad marks. But why?
A teacher have to act like an entertainer and a friend. When you dont like your teacher you wont hear to the things he will show you, you think that he or she will just go on your nervs.
A good teacher know`s how to give informations and act like a friend in the same time. 
But is it more important to relate with the students than excellent knowledge?
Enough knowldege is a big aspect for being a teacher, you will need it to give your student`s informations that they will have a chance in the future.
When you have the knowledge but not the summoners to show it to your student`s your students wont learn.
I think that it is more important to relate well with students than excellent knowledge of the subject because you need to know how you bring your students to learn or listening to the things you show them.
