The question in this task is what is more important? Is it more importat that a teacher's ability to relate well wiht students or is it more important that the teacher give the students the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

I would say it's quit important that the teacher relates well with his students. One important fact is, that the teacher could build a good harmony between him an his students. If he builds a good harmony to his students, the students would learn a bit better. Also when you have a good harmony between teacher and students you would have as a result a good class. If you have a good class, the kids would more likely go to school as usual. So that means if the kids likely go to school, they would make better marks.

In the other hand is to say that a teacher has to be a leader from a class. So when a teacher is to nice to his studends, could it be, that the students wouldn't show any respect to the teacher. It could also come to a castastrophe, because the teacher has no controll over the students. They would do things that aren't allowed to for example coming to late for the lessons, cheating on test and other things.

It's good when a teacher has a good relate to his students, but it's also important, that the teacher has to show the students who the boss is. The best way would be when there is a middle way: That you have a good connection to your students, but also that the students show a bit of respect to the teacher.
