If the ability to relate well with student or excellen knowledge of the subject is more important is a difficult question, often it depends on the subject but there are some things that are more importantant then the others. school is often much easyer for both students and teachers if the have a good relation the mood is much better and stundents are more willing to learn something but what if there is nothing to learn because the teacher has no clue what hes talking about? Now we are in a difficult situation and we could argue that the knowledge is much more important because without knowledge there is nothing to learn and when there is nothing to learn school seems useless. But just turn around the situation know the relation between teacher and students is on a really low level, from my experience as student it is terrible in class nobody is paying attention an  that leeds into much more chatting in class and that makes the teacher mad which results in dificult tests and bad grades for the students. After all both the students and the teacher are frustrated and school is so much fun like playing soccer with no ball. 
A good relation often is the key to a good learning atmosphere but on the other hand it could also leed into that the class and the teacher do not focus on the learning but more on haveing a good time in class. People that are more from the old type may prefere the system that was usual a long time ago where a teacher was more a dominant person that had a lot knowledge. We could argue that the students would learn something but the problem is how and why? The answer is simple the students whould be afraid of what happens when they do not bring the results that the teacher expects and start learning but that whould result into a bad mood in class .
My oppinion is that a teacher need both the ability to relate well with students and the knowledge. Both points are the key to a good school time and a good pool of knowledge after school.
