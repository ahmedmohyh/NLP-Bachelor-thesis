Imagine two extreem examples. One is where a teacher makes jokes and chats with his students the whole lesson and is almost one of them. The other example is a strict teacher, who just does his job and doesn't connect with his students.
I think a mixture of both is important, because if you are only one of these extreems it is unhealthy.

Of course the students should not be terrified before every lesson they have that teacher and it also has to be fun sometimes, because mostly students can remember those things which are linked to a memory and it would be nice if it was a good memory.
