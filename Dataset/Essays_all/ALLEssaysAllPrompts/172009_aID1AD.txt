Television advertising directed towards young children should be banned

In the the year 2016 television has become a normal thing in most housholds. The quality and variaty of programms are better than ever, so it is no surprise that many people from all ages spend much time in front of the TV. It all starts at a very young age. What do you do if your child doesn't stop weeping? The corresponding answer of the 21st century: you put it in front of TV. But this might harm the child in ways the parents might not even be aware of. The things the child sees on TV might be explicit or the advertising might harm them.

The brain of such young children is not developped yet, so it is especially important that they get good imputs from their surrounding in order to develop. If the child now comes in contact with an advertising, that might block the learning process of more important things for the child. 
Then the question arises: "Why should there be ads dirceted to such young children at all?" 
At this age children can hardly make something out of the things they hear on TV, and even if they can, do you really want, that the first word your children says is: "Playmobil"? This age group makes up only a split of the people who watch TV, adults are rarely interested in the same things as childs from two to five, so if they really want to advertise it there surely are better methods.

On the other hand there surely are worse things which can be advertised on TV and some children might even learn some words or anything from the advertisement, because if those ads are directed directly at them they might pay more attention, while they may not pay any attention at all at alternative imput sources like books.

I personally agree with the statement, because I think that for the most children those advertisings are harmful and I personally hate to watch those ads, because if you aren't it that specifc age group, it is really hard to find those ads interesting at all.
