Some pupils have a problem with a subject because they think, they are not intelligent enough or because they think the subject matter is to complicated. Either way the problem may lie in a totally different area. The question is, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? 

Many students claim that they understand a subject better if they get along with the teacher. From my point of view this is also the case for as long as I have been going to school. If a teacher has the ability to relate to their students, the teacher has more possibilities to teach his students on different levels. For example, he can try different variantions of teaching and find the one which provides the most effective way for his students to gain knowledge. A backdraw is that he probably is not able to help everyone because everyone has different study methods. However, he can try to help those students on a different level, e.g. visualizing the subject for visual learners. Also anxiety can be reduced and so the students feel more open and so they ask more questions.

In my opinion, teachers who can relate with their students have a higher chance of succes because the students can also relate with him which in turn can make the subject more interesting or that the students can be more focused during the lessons. I have also expirienced this. When I get along with a teacher, the subject is more interesting instead of having a teacher with whom I do not feel very comfortable with.
