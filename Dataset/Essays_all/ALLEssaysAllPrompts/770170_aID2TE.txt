I often made the experience that teachers are not able to teach us all the things he or she knows. Either it is beacause they know too much to explain the things in a way we understand it or they are not really intrested in us so they just talk about what they know without really explaining the why and how facts.  This porblem may cause confusion for some students. 
Therefore, it is important for some students to have a teacer who understands them and their problems. These are the types of students which learn with their ears. They can keep everything in their mind when they hear anything. In contrast to these students, there are people who learn better whith their eyes. So for those students, it doensn't matter if the teacher relates well with students or not. They just want to read the things their teachers write on the sheets. 
There is another important point : If you go to school, you have to profit from the lessons you go to. The teacher must be able to make good and informative lessons. This is only possible when teacher can realte well with students, when they are intrested in them and when they understand each other. 
In my opinion, it really is important that teachers can relate well with students and not only talk about their knowledge without caring what students don't understand. For the people who learn better with their eyes, teachers who can make interesting lessons are better as well. beacause if they don't understand anything, a good teacher will find the problem and helps him or her to understand everything properly.
