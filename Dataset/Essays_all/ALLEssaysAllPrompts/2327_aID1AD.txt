I obsoltly agree to that statement.

In my opinion it its absolutly bad to directed televisoin advertising to very young people. Thay are so young and are not able to have they own opinion. They are not able to say anything against this advertising and for the parents it is bad to. They don not want to buy this products but can not say something against they childrens. 

You hvae to keep in your minde that chirdrens are absolutly more ijnfluenct by this commercial. 

Atthe ende I have to say that television advertisng for young kids shoud not be allowed. It is toeasy to influence the young kids.

On the other hand we have to say that young kids are not allowed to buy this thingd from the commercial.  But they con influence their parents.

So, television advertising direct toward young children schud not be allowed.
