What is a good teacher?
It's a question which you ask yourself a lot. Which features does a good teacher have and how important is their personality combined with their teaching skills? A good teacher should be both, actually really interested in the subject and also well related to the students.
First of all, it's important that the teacher gets along with the students. A student should feel comfortable in the lessons. If a teacher is well related to the students they show more trust and courage. Students are more interested if they like the teacher and then they show more effort in this subject. Teacher should be motivational and helpful, that's their job.
However, the knowledge of the subject is exactly as important as the relationship to the students. The kids should at least learn something in school and it doesn't impress if a teacher doesn't really know about his own subject. An asked question should always be correctly answered and if the teacher doesn't know it he should at least look it up. If a teacher doesn't know a lot of his own subject then it's not worth it to be a teacher. Otherwise students could learn their stuff on their own and don't have to come to school for this but that's not the goal. 
To conclure, if a teacher really likes his job and can handle the students well then it's exactly what makes a good teacher. An interested teacher is a knowledgeable one. It isn't about being friends with the students but it's about bring them further in education and in the future.
