Nowadays the question if the teacher is able to give the correct notes to the students is more impotant than ever. Thats why I will discuss the question if it is more important that the teacher has the an excellent knowledge of a subjet or if the teacher has the right ability to relate well with his students.

On the one hand it is really important that the teacher has the correct knowledge because if he does not the lessons get really borring. When I was in the 5. grasd my maths techer could not answer our questions because his knowledgre was to small so we, the studens, did not lisen to him anymore becouse we thourght if he cannot awnsrer our question how shoud he be able to teach us.
Another argument is if the teacher havent an excellent knowledge of the subject the studens wiont respect him oiand they wont thave fun in the lessons. In reason to this they will lose there intrest in the theme and so they probably stop following the lesson.

On the other hand it is really important hat the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students because if he is not able to the studens wont respect him and they dont like to go to his lessons. I did not have one of this teachers yet and i hope that this will stay the same. 
Antoher point is that the teachers have an good common knowledge, becouse they should be able to answer questions about life and so on.

So I think it is both  important because the teachers should have the corrfect relate to the students and have a good knowledge so he is able to teach the students the correct thinks on a way they have fun. so they stay interrestet in the theme.
