I think television advertising directed toward young children has both, advantages and disadvantages. 
To say first, in my opinion children between two and five years shouldn't watch much television. If they watch like one film a day (which lasts about one hour) they mostly can't see any adverstising. So I think it depends on the parents if the advertiser can influence the children.

I just see one positve thing about television advertising; that children probably learn to speak and say their opinion if they see things they want to buy in the television. 
But there are way more negative things about it. The worst thing is that children inbetween this age believe nearly everything. So the advertiser can say what they want to and every child thinks it's true. So if they would say you can now buy a brandnew dragon which can fly, do all the household chores and is as big as a real one, every child between this age would want to buy it. I think this is really stressful for the parents. The children will cry at home and want to buy this dragon and they'll get angry if you say them that the advertiser don't tell the thruth. Another disadvantage is, that televison advertising can "help people to turn into shopping addicts.

In general I think that television advertising isn't good for people from all ages, but especially for little children it's a really dumb idea. You can influence them so easily and children get stupid with this thoughts that the television tells always the truth.
