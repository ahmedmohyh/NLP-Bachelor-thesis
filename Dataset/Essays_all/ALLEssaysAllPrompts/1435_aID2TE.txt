It's really difficult to find an agreeing or an disagreeing to the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught". 
It's very important that teacher's have a good ability to there student, because if a teacher has no ability to his class he can't really work well with them. 
But also if he is not an expert for the subject he works for, he can't really teach them something. So it's a really complicated statement. 

I think a good teacher has to compare both. He has to have a good ability to them, so that the students really can learn something from him. Because if he has no ability to them, the students can't work as good as they would work with a teacher who has a good ability to them. It's really important to have a good ability to each other. If the students think  that they can "trust" him, they could talk easilyer to there teacher, as if the have not a good ability to them.
But it's also very important that the teacher's have a good knowledge of the subject. If the teacher has no knowledge, but a very good ability to his class it can't work either, because the teacher cant teach them really.
So i think a really good teacher has to have a good ability to his students, but also has to have a good knowledge of his subject. 
So i thinke the statement is wrong. I think it's more important to have a good knowledge of the subject, than to have a good ability to his students. Because with no ability, but with a good knowledge of the subject, you can teach you're class something. But if you have no knowledge, but a good ability to you're class, you can't really work with the students or teach them something. 
But it's also better to have a good knowledge and a good ability to the students and it doesn't really matter what is more important. Both is important to teach the students the best.
