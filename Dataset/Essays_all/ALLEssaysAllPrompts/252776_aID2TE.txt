Took your worst subject, think about it, would you be better would you like it more if there is a teacher who is friendly an can helps you?
That is excatly what this essay is about. 

First of all, students will like the teacher more and that means they are more motivated in school. And this furthermore will give them better marks. 
If children or teenagers have a bad teacher, vulgary said an asshole, they will hate them. They will hate him and probably start to bully him. And this wouldn't be good for the class and the teacher. And you have to have a new teacher and this isn't always easy.

In every class you have students who always want to know more than the get teached in the subject. They will ask the teacher difficult questions and now imagine that there are teachers who don't have an excellent knowledge about their subject and the student don't get the answer. The aim of school should be to answer most of the questions from the students. 

If you have teachers who have good relationships with their students, they can explain problems better to students who don't get it. 
And there are always some students who are difficult to handle and if you have a teacher who can't handle them, it gets even more worse. 

I agree totally with this statement. Because in my opinion it should be more important to have teachers with a better relationship to the students then teachers with excellent knowledge.
