Why do we think how we think? If we look at our past, our childhood we get remarkabel influences in evereything that we do or watch or even not do. The question is where the strong influences come are. Television is today a big part of our and our childrens' lifes. Younger children are stronger in focus then ever before. my question is should it be forbidden to focus on younger, mostly faster influenced children?

Younger children are fast and for a long period of time influenced by movies and other things they watch in TV. Their parents role as the "bigest" part of their life and the ones which wach for the right place they get in society is more and more endangered by the things they watch in television. If you take at look at this point of view we probably should not allow this sort of advertising. 

But if you change the spot on the pleasure the children have if they watch TV and what they can learn by watching those hidden advertisments which their could never learn them because they simply do not have so much resources financaly and of time.

My personal opinion is split up. One way I think advertising is "parents thing" on the other side they often do not have time to learn their children everything they have to now for their futur life. So I would not change anything. The parents have still enough influence on their children and I think it will never change. My generation already had television and advertising trough it and we did not become so wrong to say it would not allow the same for the following generations.
