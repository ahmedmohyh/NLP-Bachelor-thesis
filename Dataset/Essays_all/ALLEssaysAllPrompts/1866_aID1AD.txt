There are many advertisements in television, therefore the ads are for every age group. Some of them are specialized towards adults, some for teenagers and others for little kids. The problem with these advertisements is, that the little kids are often fascinated by the big amounts of advertisements so they always want to watch more and have the things which are shown in the adverts. That is one of the biggest problems with modern Television advertisements. The little kids are building up a kind of addiction to the TV, although they're not in the age to understand and fully know what's happening in the advertisements yet. On the other side most of the parents aren't even allowing such little kids to watch TV for so long. Most of the kids are only allowed to watch one episode of ''Teletubbies'' or ''Sandmann'' in their free-time so they don't even encounter advertisements, which try to get the kids attention.
On the other hand many parents, mostly in socially lower parts of the society, do not really care what their kids are doing all over the day so the kids turn on the TV and watch it all day until they encounter advertisements. After that they want all the new things shown to them in the adverts and if the parents are willing they buy all the stuff the kids wish for themselves. As you can see there are always two sides of the medal, but as a responsible parent, whom most hopefully are, the kids don't even come close to the advertisements until they're at an age where they understand everything in TV and know that it isn't always real what is shown there. So in my opinion there is no need to shut down the advertisements directed to children because it's in the parents interest to do their prarenting right.
