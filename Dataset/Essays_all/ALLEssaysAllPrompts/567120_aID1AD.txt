Mom, can I watch TV? A sentence we hear very often nowadays, especially from younger children. The television is something younger children grow up with. It's a normal thing thing. The problem is, that a lot of children get addicted to it.

A huge problem is the addiction of children to the television. They keap asking to watch tv all the time. When the parents don't allow it, the kids get angry. So the parents don't know what to do. Because they don't want any stress or an annoying child, they allow the television. The child winns. After the child watched TV, it probably starts to be angry again because it wants to watch even more TV. 

Another fact which speaks against TV advertising directed toward younger children is that they often watch stuff that isn't thought for young children. They see that beating the others and stuff like that can be a solution. But it isn't in the real world. Especially primary teachers can see  what this kind of television does to children.

A thing that isn't that bad is that there are television programs which help children to learn how to read or how to write. This can be helpful when the kids come to school, they may have less problems in their future.

Another point is that it can be relaxing for the parents when they can sleep a little bit longer on the weekends when the children are watching TV. It's just important that the parents have the control of what their children are watching. 

I think that it would be stupid to just forbid the television for younger children. Of course it's very important that the children don't end up watching TV all day long. But I think half an hour in the morning on the weekend is not a problem. Children just shouldn't watch TV before they go to bed. They would dream very wild and wouldn't sleep that good. But I think that the TV as a learning program is a good thing.
