One really important point is that if a teacher relates well to children, every child in the classroom feels more confortable. It gives the lessons a greater ambiance which is more motivating to learn any thing. It takes the pressure down from the shoulders of the kids when they know they have a teacher with whom they can talk and work and for that reason, school is more motivating for the teacher and the children both. 
But now you can think that school isn`t here to have fun but to learn in every lesson the most efficient way. 
Now I agree with that school exists that children learn things. The question is if a teacher with greater knowledge than an other can learn more to the children. I think, that in a century of the internet, a good knowledge is not a licence to be a good teacher because nowadays, if you want to know something, you can find it out by the internet quite easy. In controverse is a teacher who relates well to children more able to learn to know every single child better than the other theacher. So this teacher can figure out the better kinds to teach and look after every individuality. This is an ability which you can`t google on the internet.
But also if we assume that a teacher with a better knowledge can really teach better, I would choose the one who`s able to relate well to children. Perhaps they learn with less efficieny but with more fun. This means, the children really could have an intrinsic motivation to go to school what at the end makes them learning more because they want to.
