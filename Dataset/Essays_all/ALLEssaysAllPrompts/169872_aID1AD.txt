Today many companies advertise their products not only on the streets but also on television. 
This is a good idea because the companies can reach a great amount of audience with this method but should these advertisements be allowed for young children of the age of two to five?

On one hand the children are to young to understand that they can not have everything that is displayed on advertisements on tv. If they see toy in an advertisement, they automaticaly want to have it. This puts great pressure on their parents because they do not want to dissappoint their children.
In conclusion the young audience is used as a huge marketing strategy. The companies put their advertisements for child toys only on the tv channels that are watched by children and not on the channels watched by the parents, even though they are the one who have to buy the toys. The companies aim on purpose for the innocence and naivity of the children.

On the other hand there are alot children who do not put their parents under pressure and gentely ask them wether they can have the toy in the advertisement or not. The major part of the childrens behaviour depends on parenting and on the caracter of  the child. It is the bad parenting for he kids that shoult be blamed and not the advertisements on tv.
In addition, many children do not even watch the advertisement because they are annoyed by them. The advertisement interrupt their favourite series and are considered annoying and unuseful by the children.

In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced. Also the parenting should be adapted to the digital generations. This means that the parents should be able to say no whe a child asks them the hole time about new and expensive toys and should not spoil their children. This way the children will get less effected by the advertisements and the parents do not spend to much money.
