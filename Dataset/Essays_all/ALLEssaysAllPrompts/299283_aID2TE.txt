No teacher is perfect, no teacher ever will be. But sitting down and thinking about the factors that form a good or a bad teacher is very interesting. For example the question, whether a teacher's ability to realte well with the students is more importand than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

It is apparent, that for being a good teacher you have to have a sophisticated knowledge of the subject you're teaching. It makes it easier for the teacher to explain the topics to the students and answer difficult questions.

The hard part about teaching isn't in explaining something for the first time. It only becomes tough when the students start asking question after question and they have to try their best to express themselves and reexplain.
 
Leading up to this point it is very important for a teacher to have a wide knowledge of their subject, however being able to relate to a students difficulty of understanding is inevitable to help them solving their problems. Only if a teacher has  felt the feeling of not understanding something makes it possible for them to explain from a different angle. Only teachers with that ability to relate will actually take their time and help a student sufficiently.

It doesn't help a student if their teacher has seven uni-degrees in a subject but cannot relate to their amateur problems. If a rather hard question pops up there's many others ways to answer it if the teacher doesn't know it form the top of their head.
