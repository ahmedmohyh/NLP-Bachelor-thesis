TV watching for young children is a hard issue to talk about. Everybody has another opinion to that. But the children have mostly no other idea than watching TV or game on the computer. 

One argument for TV watching for young children is that they could learn something about the world, when they for example watch the news or some documentary films. It could also be that they watch a film or serie with their parents and that like connects the familys' relationship. They could have together fun and laugh about the same things. In future many jobs will have something to do with electric gadgets, like computers, televisons or tablets. These children are therefore very good prepared for their future, because they already know how this electronical gadget would work.

A argument against TV watching for young children is, that they don't know what else they should do in their free time. With their friends they have no other or almost no other idea what they should do together. My parents always said, when you watch too much television you'll get squared eyes. Today I and everybody else know that this statement is not true. But I think they just wanted to say, that I'll would be dependent on TV watching. And in some ways I think that this is absolutely true. 

In my opinion children should be allowed that they could watch sometimes TV for example every day 15 minutes but not too long. They should have ideas that what else to do and not just hanging around and watching TV all the time.
