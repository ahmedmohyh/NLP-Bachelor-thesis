Children are sweet and everybody likes children. They just give us a great feeling. This is a fact why many people use little children for their advertising. But is this good for the children?

When the children are little they believe everything what adults are saying. They have no own opinion and can not talk for themselve. They do not choose for themselve. Others are choosing for them. So they can not say if they want to make advertising or not. 
Many parent with sweet babies just try to get their little children on TV. It is a simple work and they get paid for this. Even when the children do not like the work, some parents just force them to do it. 
But with 5 year you should be in de position to say what you like to do and what not. When you force the little children to do stuff like this, than they can not reaise up like they want. It can be irritating for them when they are growing up with doing advertising and suddenly they have to go to school and have a normal way of life. It could bring many problems for the children. 
It also can be that they do not like it that they were in a advertising and when they are older they are ashamed about this. 
In the most advertising where chidren are in, there are just there for thir cuteness. So we are using the cuteness from children to make advertising that other people buy stuff. 
But is it really so bad, when chidlren are in advertising?
I do not believe that. Sure it is not good when others are forcing them to do this. But when they are sometimes in a advertising and when the parents are looking that their baby would not be ashamed about that, when it is older.  But the children also need to know that making advertising is not normal. They have to know the real way of life and to live that.
