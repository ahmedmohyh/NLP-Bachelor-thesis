Among specialists, the topic wether or not young children should be exposed to television advertising, is highly debated. Assessing the Pros and Cons of this argument, I believe that it can be harmful for children to see commercials, which are directed towards them.

I think that one can say without a doubt, that the exposure of young children to television has increased enormously over the course of the last decade. Since I am not a specialist on this topic I can hardly speak of facts, yet I do believe, that children under the age of five can be influenced by commercials, since they hardly developped an understanding of what is true and what is a lie. So if they hear a certain statement in an advertisement, they probably are going to believe it.

On the other hand, one can also see the lack of development in a child's brain as an argument against the one mentioned before. If a child will see or hear a commercial, they would not even understand it. Although this sounds plausible to me, why would a company make an advertisement directed towards those young children then? A second argument could be, that such advertisements have a teaching effect on the children. For example they would learn to differentiate between a fact and an exaggeration as they are broadly found in commercials. 

Now all things considered, I think one can believe whatever he wants. From my point of view, a child should not be directly addressed in a commercial. They do not have any chance of knowing what is right and what is not and therefore I feel like it should not be allowed to direct advertisements towards young children.
