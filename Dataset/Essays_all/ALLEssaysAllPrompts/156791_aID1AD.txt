In today's essay we talk about the question, whether television advertising should be allowed to be directed towards young children or not.

To start off this discussion I wanted to talk about the possible times, where children could be in this situation. They often watch television when their parents are somewhere around the house, so it should actually be in the responsibilty of the parents to look after their kids and to controll what they are watching on TV. But on the other hand, there is so much advertising in the television programms nowadays, so that the parents are overwhelmed and can't really controll it themselves. 

The amout of information we still know from our life in the age of two to five years old is really small. It is normal that we forget most of the things which have happend in this time of our lives. If it actually is like that, it does not depend whether the advertising is directed towards the children or not, because they forget about it in the next few days. Studies have show that there are events from your childhood, which still have an impact on your life. These studies show that parents should truely think about the things they show their children, because it could have an impact on their adult life.

Last but not least children have to learn how to handle this overwhelming lifesytle, where the individual is litteraly floated with information and advertisments. They are born in a world where this is quite normal, so they have to learn it early enough. On the other hand, children are still very sensitive and vulnerable and because of that they cam be affected by it very easy.

In conclusion I would totally agree whit the statement written above, because children are still really tiny human beings are therefore are still vulnerbale and can be harmed very easy. In my opinion there should not be any advertisements dirceted toward young children, because parents can't completely controll it.
