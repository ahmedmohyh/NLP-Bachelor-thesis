Everybody has during his schooltime a teacher who knows everything about his subject but you don't understand a word comming through his mouth. Its very difficut to make good marks in this subjects because the students had to learn everything by their selfs. Also nobody can say that this paticular teacher is a bad teacher because he knows a lot about his subject. 

Stundents like especially young teachers who understand how it is beeing in their situation. There are also older teachers who can tell a lot about their experience. Important is that he or she can tell the kids something interessting or make some funny jokes. If the stundents like to join the lesson of a particular teacher he hasn't to have a doctor titel. Also the kids are more concentrated in lessons where the teacher reach the class. Another advanteg is that kids aren't afraid to ask questions and that's a pretty importent point. If the stundets think that the teacher isn't able to help them, they would not ask anything. In this case it would propably come to bad marks in a exam. If the teaching person doesn't know everything he or she can look it up or work it out during a lesson with the class. 

Every teacher has to know about the themes he tells the class during the lesson. If the he is unsure and tells something how he think it is, the kids would have problems afterwards in other schoollevels. Than it isn't an advantage that the teacher is friendly because it is a handicap for the students. Most of the teachers give their classes handouts in fact a student hasn't understand the lesson he is able to look it up afterwards. To make good handouts you don't have to have the ability to relate well with students. In the 21 th century every school has computers and students are alowed to do some research about their subjects.

For me it is more important that a teacher is able to deal with the adolescents. I have more interessets in the subject if i like the teacher also I write better marks.
