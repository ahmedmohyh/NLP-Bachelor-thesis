To say, if I agree with the statement or not, I first have to explain, what`s the task of a teacher. 
A teacher needs to be able to relate well with the students, because teaching means that you can teach someone something new or to explain someone something he doesn`t understand. This is only possible if you have kind of a relationship. You need to understand how the student thinks to explain the things in a way, so that the student is able to understand what you want to explain. 
But of course it is also important that the teacher knows what he is talking about. If he doesn`t, the student won`t be able to understand it. So if the teacher doesn`t know what he wants to teach, he won`t be able to explain it clearly to someone else.
So I would say, to be a good teacher you need both. You need to be able to build a relationship to your students, or else you can`t explain them things in a understandable way, but you also have to understand the subject. Because that`s what a teacher is for: to explain something to someone else, so it is absolutely necessary, that a teacher understands what he wants to explain, and in which way. But of course you can`t say that there is only one way, how to teach. Because every teacher is different, so every teacher has a different way how to teach. But like I said before, the teacher has to relate with the students, because also the students are individuals and you can`t teach them all the same way, so as a good teacher you need to be able to discover the best way, how you can teach each student.
