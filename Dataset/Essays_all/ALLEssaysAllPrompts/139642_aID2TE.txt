What is more important - relating well or excellent knowledge?

It's very important that the teachers can relate well with students. If you can't do this, you can't teach. The students won't listen to you if you're a mean human being. There must be a good atmosphere in the classrom. They students should like the teachers and talk with them. Otherwise it won't work. The teachers will be able to help more and to motivate the students for learning. So teaching would also be more fun. And of course the students really learn something.

But it's also important that the teachers have a good knowledge. How would you teach the students if you haven't enough knowledge? In this way it won't work. The school wouldn't be a place for leraning anymore. They would meet eachother and listen to teachers, who talk something that won't help anyone. Or maybe they won't listen and won't come to school. School woudn't be important. The students need knowledge to grow up and get a job. What will be in they're future if they don't get it?

So I think that both things are very important. The students can't learn without this two aspects. But I agree with the statement. The way how the teachers are treating students is more important.
