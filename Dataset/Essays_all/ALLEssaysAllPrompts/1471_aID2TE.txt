In the following I want to name my oppinion towards the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."
If teachers arn´t abel to communicate with there students, and they see them only as objects to learn something, that´s not very good for the feeling in the class and also not for the grades and the lessons.
But if the teacher isn´t abel to teach his students something and is only abel to communicate well with them, that´s also not very good for the students and for their grades.
A good teacher should be abel to connect both points, that he can be an good friend for his students and he become a good and well knowledge teacher, who can teach a lot and this with energy and fun. So that the students have fun while the lessons and learn much from their teacher.
If the teacher can connected both, not only the students have a positive effect from that, its a win-win situation.Because the clima in the class is better and the grades an the also on. 
I think, that a teacher should be abel to have good or excellent knowledge of the subject and is abel to relate well with his students.
