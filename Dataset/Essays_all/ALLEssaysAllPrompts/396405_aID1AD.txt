Every day, 365 days a year, there are television advertising. They should influence us, to buy something. But young children watch also television, but they can't buy anything because they haven't any money. Is that good for the children? Should the television advertising not be allowed? Or do the children not understand what they see?

First, the advertising isn't good for children, because it influences them. They dream about a lego toy or a car. They will live in a fictive world. In a world with all these beautiful toys, in a world in wich they could have what they want. But the real life isn't that easy. Who has enough money to buy anything? 

An agrument against the first argument is that they can't think right in this age. The cildren would forget all the advertising two or three years later.
A second argument is that people shouldn't watch a lot television. To live in a fictive world you must watch a lot more hours television than an average man would.
A third argument is that when a young child would watch a lot television a day, there should be a ban on watching television, and not to the advertising.
A fourth argument is that a television concerne couldn't exist without advertising.
