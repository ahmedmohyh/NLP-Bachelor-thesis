First of all there is the main problem that advertising directed toward children has the effect that they ask their parents to buy this toy they are interested in. Secondary there are some parents who aren't able to buy these toys because of financial reasons, so their chhildren could get very dissapointed in their parents if they don't follow their wishes. If there aren't enough financial resources in this family but the parents want to buy this toy for their children they maybe leave out a meal or something else to save money. 

Actually  advertising isn't the main problem but the fact that children in the age of two till five years are spending to much time in front of the TV. In that age there are many better ways to spend time than watching movies or TV in general. Advertising isn't against the law if the advertised product is legal so there isn't any use of prohibitting advertising like this. The advertiser doesn't target the children between two and five years, they mainly advertise for their parents because they want them to buy some cool stuff for their kids. So the true problem is, that parents aren't able to diside which toy would be suitable for their kids.

Personally I'm not against advertising for products for children because there woudn't be any space for Playmobil etc. to promote their products if not in TV. So I think the better solution for this problem would be to teach young couples and parents how they can decide which toy is a good one and which isn't. In a short sentence I can say, that there isn't any need to unallow advertising directed to young children.
