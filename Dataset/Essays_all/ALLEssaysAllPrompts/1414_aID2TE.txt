I do not agree with the statement. In my opinion, it is more important for the teacher to have a very good knowledge of the subject being taught.
I don't think it makes any sense for a teacher to teach a subject without really knowing what he/she is teaching. Without such a good knowledge, the teacher also won't be able to explain things as good as he could otherwise. I would say it's rather important to learn as much as you can in school than having a really good relation to the teachers.
An excellent knowledge of the subject always leads to being able to explain things better and then also to the students learning and understanding better. It wouldn't make any sense to me to have a teacher who can't explain things better than he/she is able to create a good relation to the students.
A good relation between student and teacher of course makes the lessons easier and more relaxed. Therefore a good relation would sure make it easier for the students to learn more and better.
But when deciding between good knowledge and a good relation, I would choose the good knowledge of the teacher.
I don't think the purpose of the school is to only create relations (it sure is as well), but rather to learn and prepare for the following life after school. Also, if the relation to the teacher gets too good, it will mostly result in the students caring less about what they're doing and not concentrating on the things they should learn, but instead having a good time which they can get because of their good relation to the teacher.
Eventually, a balance between these would be the very best for everyone. But as long as that is not possible, I would definetly choose the knowledge over a good relation between student and teacher.
