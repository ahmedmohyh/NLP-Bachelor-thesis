I agree. I think it is more important that teachers can understand their students and relate to them. For example: If the teacher explains something new to the students and doesn`t get that the students don`t understand the context  and the teacher can not relate because he is not understanding because he thinks that the students should understand the context and he won`t explain it to them. Or the teacher has a discussion with them and he is not openminded then he basically tries to convince them  for the wrong reason because he thinks that only his opinion is the right one and won`t even concider another one. 

When teachers think the most important thing is knowledge than they should rather write a book because teaching is also about learning the students something new and important. And teachers were in school as well and they know that it is great to have a teacher who can relate to themselves.

Of course knowledge is importatnt and I wouldn`t want a teaacher who doesn`t know anything about the stuff he wants to teach me but if I have a teacher wich can`t relate to me and is so focused on his own opinion, I would hate to go to his class because it seems impossible to even convince him that there is another way or he is not understanding enough that I don`t understand the problem or the context and he will not explain it to me or maybe even ask why I don`t understand it.
