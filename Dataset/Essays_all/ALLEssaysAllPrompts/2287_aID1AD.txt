If a television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed is a topic which is very discusted. People say, that it should be forbidden, other people say, that it would be an advanatge. 
The advantage is the possibility to learn much arlier and to get a better education in life bacause of learning much earlier. Kids could identify thereselves in young years, so that they could grow up much better and much faster. The reason which totally agerees to this is the television program for young kids. If it wouldn´t makle sense to let kids aged two to five watch the TV, there wouldn´t be this television program.

On the other hand it´s not a good thing, to grow up with technical stuff like the television. The earlier the children get to use these things, the more they use them in later life. That´s on the one hand of course an advantage for the economy, but it´s not a good way to grow up. Children need to learn about and with ways of natural learnung methods. 
Everybody parents need to decide of their own, if he wants to let the children watch the TV, so it shouldn´t be forbidden. But how could you control this? That wouldn´t be possible. That´s the reaason, why this is a totally confusing idea. The best way is to let the parents have the freedom to dcide wether they weant their kids watching the TV or not, so that everybody can decide of his own. 
All in all you can say, that watching the TV with 2 or 5 years isn´t good, but forbidding that is a bad idea, bacause it wouldn´t be even possible.
