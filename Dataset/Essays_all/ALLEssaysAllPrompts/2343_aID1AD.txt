The following essay talks about television advertising to young children.
Television advertising let people feel like they need this product but they didnt.
Childrean are very easy to catch with advertisment because they are little innocents without anything bad or some bad influence. Thats why advertisment fits perfectly to children so the product will be often sold.
Televison is paid by advertisment so you cant cut the advertisment off the screen for the children because the televison need it. Its normal to say its bad for the children but the question is "Better advertisment and TV for the children or no advertisment and no TV?"
So in my opinion its better to have advertisment and TV, because advertising is everywhere and young children are on plattforms like youtube and something like that and this pages are full with advertising so it makes no sense to cut off advertisment from the TV-Shows for children.
