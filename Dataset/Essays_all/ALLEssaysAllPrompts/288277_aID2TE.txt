It is very difficult to say if it is more important that the teacher has to get on well and have a good relation to the class ore if he should have an exellent knowledge about the subject being taught. However in my opinion it is more important to have a good relation with the class than having an exellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In the following I will explain my point of vew.

At the beginning I will start dealing with the negativ aspects of not having an exellent knowledge. Firstofall a teacher should know a lot of things about his subject and should always be up to date otherwise he can not perform well as a teacher. An other important aspect to look at is that if a student makes a question and can not the the teacher ccan not respond it it often makes a bad impression. Not answering a question is not always bad but it should be avoided. 

Now I will list the arguments which support that a teacher should rather get on well with the class than having an exellent knowledge about the subject. For example it creates a good learning atmosphere if there is a good relation betwenn class and teacher. The students samehow are more productive if their atention is good and often that is only the case if they get on well with the teacher. It makes the studentsalso more interrested. Also as a teacher it is not needed to know everything about the subject because at scool in many subjects there are taught only the bases.

The best option is logically a mixture betweene both but I think that in most cases it is more important to have a good relation with the teacher.
