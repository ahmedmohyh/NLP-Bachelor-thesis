In the following text I am going to find arguments in favor of television advertising directed toward young children and against it. 

It is said that young children should not even watch TV in their young age. They could become dumb and not educated, the should go outside or play with someone. Nevertheless there are programms, in which you can see documentaries and earn education of them. But even between one documentary and another one, most of the time there will be television advertising, because there has to be a way to make money for the people who are doing work for these documentaries. On the other hand it is said that Televison manipulates people, children in the young age can be more manipulated. Especially if this would be advertising about Toy´s or some stuff like that. So if they watch TV and get education, that is fine, but each advertising is made to manipulate people. When children see television advertising about toys, most of the time they want to get this toy. The consequence is, that the kids want the toys and the parents have no other choice but to buy this toy or other stuff like that. Toy´s are expensive and after a short time they get broken or the children are bored of these. And further they watch TV again and want a new toy, which means the parents have to pay even more money. If they start to watch TV in their young age, it could be fatal if they would get all the toys they want, because if they get everything they want in this young age, this will not stop if they get older than five years, it will continue and they will not learn to respect what money is, they will buy even more stuff with the money of their parents. And if the parents do not buy the stuff their children want, The children will get angry or loud until they get it.

In the end to sum it all up it can be said, that watching TV does not have to be bad, no, it can be educating. Only the television advertising can manipulate the children and educate them wrong.
