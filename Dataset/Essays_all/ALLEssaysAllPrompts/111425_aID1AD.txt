Televiosion advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed


More often parents of young children hear: "Mom, can I have this new toy which was shown in the tv?" or "Wow, Dad, look a this cool toy! Do you buy it for me?" These children who watch tv get influenced a lot by television advertising. Should it be allowed to manipulate them with these tricks or should it be forbidden? Here we go:

Important is, that young children dont go often (or probably never) in the city for shopping. Just the parents and they decide which toy the little boy or girl will get. So it is totally clear that we have to bring the toys to the childrens home: by television advertising! So they can decide themselfes what they want to play with. So they will have a happy and exciting childhood.

But more important is that the children are a lot influenced by tv or smartphones already on this age! They are addicted to this "toys". So it is now our job to bring them real toys to home and help them to not be so hoocked on technic!

But there are a lot arguments which want to disallow television advertising: Important is that such little children are too easy to convince, they cant really decide! They get manipulatet and cant decide themselfes; the advertising "decides" for them. Is would be better the parents decide what is "good" for them and what is "bad". The parents anyway just want the best for them, didnt they?

Most important is that the children shouldnt anyway watch tv at these age! They should go outside and play with real friends. The television advertising makes them even more addicted to the technic and at this age it isnt healthy!

Now it is totally clear that television advertising shouldnt be allowed! Never!
