In the following i will comment on the question, if television advertisement directed toward young children should be allowed.

I will start with the arguments against advertisement towards youngh children.

First of all, it is very easy to manipulate the opinion of a child in that age. The advertisment could manipulate them and interfere with their raising. Kids a these ages dont know what advertismend is an could easely think, that everything in the advertisement is true, so that when they get the produkt they are sad that it is not as good as in the advertisement.
Also Kids should not get familiar with big companies to soon. Our world is all about companies and names these days and we should not raise our children in a way that supports this.
Children could also form grops and exclude those, that cant afford or dont like the toys in the advertisement.

On the other hand Kids should learn to live with advertisement. They should learn to know when the advertisment is honest or just a polished version of the produkt.
Advertisement can also be a good way to inform Kids and parents about the new produkts on the market an maybe help them save some time at the store.
The television chanels only show advertisment because they pay them money, so that they can funktion as a companie. So if advertisement would get 
vorbidden there would be little to no tv channels for kids, because they are not profitable.
Advertisement is also gut for the economy. Thanks to advertisment hundreds of people have a job, starting at the janitors of the tv companies all the way to the people who advertise their produkt and the poeple who disigne the ad .

In conclusion i think that advertisement directed toward young children is ok and nessesary for the tv channels to exist. Even if the ads could interfere with the childs raising i think the pros just outweigh the cons.
