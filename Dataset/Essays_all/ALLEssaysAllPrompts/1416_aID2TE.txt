The following sentences are about teachers. Is it more important that they know about they subject or that they are able to be nice to students and understand their angrys and mistakes? Of course it is important that your teacher knows about the subject he tought you. Otherwise there is no chance for you to learn something. When he just know a litlle bit he can´t answer you questions and as a student you have to do a lot more at home and alone. The teacher himself also need more time to look after things to understand them to maybe answer a few questions or just write a test and the end of the thema and to correct this. 
When a teacher is like a friend to you maybe there is no lesson just playing or making jokes. Nobody can learn and do a bad test or exam. When the students don´t learn in lessons and the teacher don´t animate them they have to do everything at Home to pass the test at the end. So we are at the same point like when the teacher don´t know about their subject. 
I think what we need is both! A teacher has to know about his subject and the best would be when he like it and when he like children or teenagers and teaching that won´t be wrong too. A teacher shoudn´t be a person you are angry for. You should like going to school and have fun learning new things. When teacher like what they do they are already better in teaching. Everyone is better in things they like to do then in things they don´t like.
So a teacher have to be a nice person (everyone has someday a bad day but in the main part he should be nice one and not a monster). He has to like what he does and he has to know what he does in lessons. 
When I have to decide for one I would choose the last, that it is more important to know about the subject because otherwise there is no chance for students to  learn something. But in my eyes a perfect teacher is able to have both. A nice handling with the students and an excellent knowledge about their subject.
