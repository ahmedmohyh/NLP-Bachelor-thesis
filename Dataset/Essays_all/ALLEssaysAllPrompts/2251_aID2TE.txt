As a teacher you do not only have to know facts. Also you have to know how to handle with the students. In every school is the personal level between the students and the teachers different. For example on a little school with not so much students these level is higher, because you know everyone. 
For that it is very important to not only have the knowledge of the subject. Also it is important to relate well with all students, because then the studends will learn better and also faster. And the students want to learn. When the teacher is funny and relate well will the children, the students do not think "oh, I have to go to school" or "I do not want to". 
But on the other side it is also important that the teachers have a excellent knowledge, because otherwise the students would not learn anything or would learn not correct things. I think the time in school is one of the most important time in a human revolution. Because in this time the children learn not only facts in school, they also learn how to deal in the real life. For that the teachers need a excellent knowledge. And when one taecher teaches their students not correct stuff, they will teach their children oder other kids also these informations, because they think that they are right.
So all in all I think a ability to relate well with students is very important and it is important for the success of learning. But I am not realy sure, if these is much more important than a excellent knowledge. I think as a realy good teacher you have to have both, a abilitiy to relate well and a excellent knowledge.
