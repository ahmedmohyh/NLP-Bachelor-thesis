I think it's different in every school niveau. in primary school for example, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is the most important thing. But in secondary school the excellent knowledge of the subject get's more important. In the gymnasium is a teacher's ability to relate well with students not as important as the excellent knowledge of the subject. In every school after gymnasium is the excellent knowledge of the subject the most important thing. The reason for this change is very simple: the age of the pupils. 

In primary school the teacher needs to show the pupils how important it is to learn all these things. They don't understand that their future life will change with teir habit to leran. In the secondary school the pupils know that it's important and that they should write good grades for the future. But they still need help to get to the level they could reach. In the gymnasium the students are older and understand how important it is to get good grades and how important it is to get trough this school. After the gymnasium the students are adults and can decide by themselves what the should do or what they want to do. So a teacher's ability to relate well with students isn't nessecary anymore. Of course the students are more motivated, if the teacher has the ability to relate well with students, but it function also without this ability.

So in my opinion this statemnt is correct for the gymnasium and all the schools after it. But it's completely wrong for the secondary school and for the primary school.
