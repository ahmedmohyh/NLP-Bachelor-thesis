Every student got some teachers they like and some they don't like. That's the everyday life of being student in school. But is it more important that the teacher is liked by the students than having a exellent knowledge about their subjects?
First, if the students like a teacher and the teacher get along well with the students, they are more likely to study hard and get good grades. But some can argue that even though the students will study more if the teacher relates with them, there isn't any use if the teacher dosen't have exellent knowledge about his subject.
Second, the teacher who can relate with the students well, can explain better their subjects and can answer the questions better because they know what their students don't understand.
You may think that's right and it is, but the most important factor is the education of the students. And the education can only be successful if the teacher knows the subject exellently. But knowing the subject and relating with the students aren't counter arguements. It's one connected thing. If the teacher konws the subject exellently they often are bound to relate better to his students because they know what they found difficult or what they couldn't understand when they studied their subjects. 
In my opinion it is the most important thing that a teacher has a perfect knowledge of the subject being taught than relating with the students. Because if they really know everthing they may also know what the difficulties are and can explain them properly to the students. You're in school to receive a good education and a knowledge about a variaty of things. And that's only possible if the teacher knows the subject very well.
