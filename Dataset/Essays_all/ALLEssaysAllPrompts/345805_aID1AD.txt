Nowadays many kids watch TV for example before going to sleep or when parents want them to be quiet. With television advertisement economic manipulation starts in a very early age. This is affecting children and with them their parents. One can argue that this is just how our society is treated and lets itself treat,so why should this be prevented for kids?

One main reason against television advertising directed towards young children is that they are affected way more emotionally and cannot think of anything else than this one need raised by an advertisement. This hinders them from playing peacefully and learning important skills.
An argument against any prohibition of television advertisement is that parents can decide from what age on their kids are allowed to watch TV. If they don't want their child to be influenced by television advertisement they can let them listen to CDs or read stories to them instead of placing them in front of the TV. Further it is impossible to prevent children from advertising influence as this is everywhere: on the streets, on posters, in supermarkets, toy stores and so on. Everyone of us has come across the situation in the supermarket where little children cry for drink or cereals which include a toy or is packed targeting kids. The parent cannot continue shopping conveniently before promising to buy this certain product the child desires.

In my opinion television advertising should not be forbidden because i don't think it would change anything, neither for kids nor for their parents as .
