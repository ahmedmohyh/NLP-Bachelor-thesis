First of all a teacher's has to bring many important skills to be taken serious. Not only an excellent knowledge of his subject is important, but also an ability to teach the knowledge. He must be understandable, creative, fair and treat all students equally. He must be able to speek to the class in a taking way and interesting. He has also to understand humans and their feelings. He must be motivating etc. 
The skill list of a perfect teacher is long and it is difficult to fullfill every single point. So let's focus on the most important points, let's say some must have's of a teacher and those points are of course a teacher's ability to relate well with other students and the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Which one is more important?
 I have to say both, because if you have only one of those skills, you won't be a great teacher. If you are just kind and lovely to the students but have nothing to teach them, they will love you on the beginning for sure, but when it comes to the final exams, they are going to hate you, because you as a teacher failed to learn them how to pass through these exams. On the other way, if you have a perfect knowledge of what you are saying, you have the base to learn them something. But not being good to the students, is going to destroy that base and they are going to hate you even more because you can't teach them all this super-good knowledge. If you don't care, they don't care. And this is also ending up in most of the cases in a tragedic disaster of bad grades. 
The keyword is the mixture, everything else is torture. Not only for the students but also for you as a teacher.
