In this essay I will show you arguments for and against television wich advertising direct toward young children.

First of all it's important to make sure that the children actually learn something by watching television. Young children can learn extremely fast in compare when they get older. They save many things in there brain without actually know it. If a TV-program is just telling bullshit to the children, they will also learn bullshit because as a child you will take and use all the information you get from everywhere. If a TV-program shows senseful stuff where children can improve their english knowledge for example, then it's good for the learning but there is always the danger of getting addicted to TV. If a child is addicted to something like TV, it's really difficult to take that away from it. I remember when I was about five years old, I woke up in the middle of the night, maybe 3:00, walked in the televisionroom and watched some TV-programs that we recorded during the day. Sometimes I just went to a friend watching TV when I told my mum we would play soccer. Futhermore we don't know that much about what is TV actually doing with us. Television is existing for about 100 years I think. Humans are existing for more than 10'000 years. What I want to say is, that our brain and eyes are not made for something like television. There is actually a risk to get physicly damaged in different ways by watching too mutch TV or watching TV in general. If you do this as a young child the damage will be more fatal.

At the end I think adversting television directed toward young children is ok, aslong the content is senseful and makes children learn something that they can need for their future live and aslong it's not too much. But I think parents have to decide on their own how to handle the risks of getting addicted or physicly damaged by TV.
