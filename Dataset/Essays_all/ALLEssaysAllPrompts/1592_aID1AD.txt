Many young children watch a lot of Television. Because of that they also watch and hear a lot of advertisements for toys, food and other stuff children would want to have. 
This topic is discussed controversially and in the following I will explain what I think about forbidding television advertising directed to young children.

The advertisements effect and manipulate children a lot: They see a new toy in the advertisements, presented as colourful and really nice. They immediately want to have it and want their parents to buy it for them. So they do not really think about it and just want to have the toy because they have seen it on TV, often they actually do not really use it when they have it beacause it is not as nice as it has seemed. Forbidding these advertisements would stop this manipulation and make the children think about what they want a little longer.

But is that really true? Would they think about it longer? Isn´t it normal that children in the age of two to five years make fast decisions and want to have a lot of toys etc.?
And would forbidding television advertisements directed to children of that age group really stop the manipulation? There are many other ways to make children want something, for example in movies. If the people in the movie all have a certain type of toy, the children could also want to have it. In that case it is just as much manipulation as in an advertisement.
Another fact against forbidding these advertisements is that later, when these children are older, they are manipulated in many ways, also by advertisments. Shouldn´t they learn early how to deal with these manipulations and how to resist them?

All in all I think that these advertisments should still be allowed and that parents should decide themselves if they want their children to watch television and the advertisements.
