The criterium if a student likes the subject being taught, or doesn't like it is mostly dependend on how much the sudent likes the teacher. And if they like the teacher, they are more ready to learn. A teacher's ability to realate well with students gives the ability to make them learn. So if we got to chose a teacher for a student, is it more intelligent to take the more charismatic, or the more informed?

Sure to say is if the teacher can't make the students wanting to learn, it does not matter how well informed she or he is about the subject to be taught.
Otherwise if the teacher knows exactly how to make her or his students working but doesn't really know anything about the subject, there is no reason to have the ability to makte the learn.
If a teacher can relate with students, it doesn't only have the consequence that it's easier for students to want to learn, it's a consequence too, that learning itself gets easier. The teacher knows how to make her or his subject digesable for students.
On the other hand there are intelligent students, that want to learn naturally, and have the ability to understand and reproduce complicated knowledge, that isn't made interessting by the teacher. They want to be concored with a deep knowledge of the teacher and don't care about the charisma.

For conclusion, there always have to be both, a good knowledge of the teacher and a good ability to relate well with students. But for the average student the ability of the teacher to relate with students is more important, so that the basic knowledge can be taught for longterm. It is more important, that the student doesn't get exausted by too complicated themes, because if they still like the subject and got a good basic after school, they will have the ability to teach the knowledge themself, if needed.
