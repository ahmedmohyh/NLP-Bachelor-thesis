Folling I am going to discuss about the subject "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of a subject being taught". Arguments which support the statement are for exemple that it is nice to have a good and personal relation to your teacher. The teacher will probably be a good friend of yours. It is a little bit like this in the US. If you have a realation like that, you are probably going to have a good atmosphere in class. Having a good atmosphere is good to learn much during class. On the other hand it is not nessasary to have a good atmosphere  to learn if the teacher is not perfectly prepared.
Arguments against the statement are for exemple the importance that a teacher knows what he talks about. It is important for the exams of students at the end of the year (A-level). Students have to know perfectly about the subjects at the end of the year in the exams and if their teacher does not even know everything about the subject beeing asked at the end, the students will not get a good mark and in worse case will not pass his or her examen. An other point is that it is easier to teach subjects to the students if you do not have a close realation. You have more respect when you do not really know your teacher and when he knows everything about a subject you want to learn something about and you want to pass your exams about.
In my opinion it is more important to have a teacher who prepares me perfectly for my exams and teaches me everything I have to know for my exams than having a teacher who is more or less a good friend at the end of the year.
