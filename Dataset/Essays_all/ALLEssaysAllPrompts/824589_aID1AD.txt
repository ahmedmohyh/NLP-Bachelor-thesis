nowadays we live in a modern world with a lot of thecnology and in this society there are a lot of different opinions about how usefull for example a handy, a computer or a television is. Is it good or is it bad? what are the advantages and the disadvantages? and a very important question, what about the children?
we fokus now on the television advertising and if it should be or not should be allowed for children. One agrument which you can use that it should be allowed is, that the children maybe learn something about what they see, or that they learn the language better when they hear the voices on the TV.
Another one can be that when for example the governement says its not allowed, the people who made advertising have to rethink their whole strategie and this costs. I also think that it`s not something you can go and watch if the parents are doing it right.
But one argument we can use as an agree-argument is, that it is harmful for the children to watch TV, they better should go outside and play with their freinds. its not healthy, it can malke the children fat or in the worst case dumb. the children don`t use their personal imagination as they do it when thy read a book for example. i also think that at the age of two to five the brain developes really fast and its important in that period of time, that the children learn a lot from their parents or from the things which they experience and not from silly advertising which are not usefull in their future life.
in conclusion on the right hand side i would say that it would be better if its not allowed for children at that young age but on the other side i think it`s impossible to make this happened because every family is responsible for their own child. But i would agree with this state.
