In the following text i'll point out why i agree or disagree to the statement that "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
I think there are some problems with advertising direct toword young children. Mainly because they are far too easy to influence. And of course the young children won't be able to buy the products they see in the advertising anyway. The whole point of this is to make these  young children absoulutly want the product so they will make their parents buy it for them. So even though the advertising isn't directed toward the adults they are ones who'll have to pay in the end. But what would be a conclusion ? Obviously it isn't an opportunity to just forbid advertising for products which are made for young children in general. I think the only way to solve this  problem is to make advertising toword the adults so to try to persuade the adult who is watching the advertising that his/her child needs that product. That way you stop young children from being influenced by advertising but the companys will still be able to sell their products. A problem with this system could be that it is hard to tell what directly "directed toward young children" means and what the companys would have to change to change to make it "directed toward adults". 

In the end i definetly agree to this statement because in my opinion it is just a way to get money from adults by influencing their children which shouldn't be allowed.
