Sometimes young children watch television because they like episodes, which are specially made for children. However, the television advertising is a very big problem because the advertising isn't always directed to young children. 
Often advertisings are about internet websites, supermarkets or about something, which aren't allowed for young kids.This could have negative effects on the children. For example they watch an advertising about alcohol or cigarettes, children maybe want to try it because they don't know what it is and that it  is very bad for them. It's also dangerous if there is an advertising about internet websites. If they visit this sites, they could buy something even if they don't want to or go to illegal websites because they don't know what they are doing. Not everything, which you can find on the internet, is nice. 
On the other hand it could be logical to make advertisings specially for young children. The advertisings could informate children about kipnepper or bad people, what they have to do and how they find help if they meet such a person. This must be done in a way children understand, they should not get scared. 

I do not agree and also not disagree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" because both sides have advantages. I came up to the conclusion that it would be good to find an option, which is good for young children so the parents don't have to care about advertisings their child watches.
