The following essay deals with the question wether telivision advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed. 
For children the ages two to five are the most important year of development. They learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things.

The young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series. Later in life they'll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldn't spend their time with this.
If they watch series for example the "Krümelmoster" they may have the same ideas as the actors and do things they aren't allowed or get hurt while doing this.
The development in this young age is very importent. One can't really tell them what to do ore not, they will experience this themselves. But without watching TV they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur. They create other ideas without the influence of television. They get social contacts which they can't make if they only spend their time infront of the TV.
For example I got to know my best friend with the age of 1 because our mothers are friends and we only spend out time outside and played with the dogs or by bad weather we built thing and played memories. We weren't allowed to watch television and later the only thing we watched was the sandman. This only goes ten minutes and was nearly before our bedtime.
The age of two to five is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids, so it's important not to destroy this at home.
In my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.
