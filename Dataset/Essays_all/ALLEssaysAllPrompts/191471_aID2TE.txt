Martha and Jane are argumenting about who they think is the best teacher in school. Martha thinks that their english-teacher Mrs. jefferson is the best, because she has a very understanding personality and truly cares about her students. Jane finds Mr. Monroe better, since he has two PhDs, one in math and one in chemistry and he knows everything about a subject he is teaching you. 
I agree with Martha, because it is very important for a teacher to know his students and understand them. But is it more important than him actually being abel to teach you something? I don't think so. In my opinion its more important that I leave a class fully knowing the subject than the teacher feeling for me and wanting to help me with my personal problems. In life there will always be people that don't relate to you or misunderstand you and its important to learn to deal with that, since some of them might later on be your boss or have a superior posision that you. The things that Mr. Monroe teaches, are thing you later on need for your test to actually get your degree. Some may say a understanding teacher can change your life for ever, but is that really what a teacher is for? No. Technically a teacher is there to explain things to you, to show you some sort of science and help you learn it, but not to help you with your personal issues. If you want someone that listens to you gives you advice, you should go to a therapist. 
But in the end a teacher shoulnd't be only good at one of those two things. A theacher shouln't be your psychiatrist nor your textbook, but a good mixture. A teacher should be relating, experienced, caring, creative amongst other things. But it's hard being all those things, so if it comes down to it I want one that can actually teach me something.
