First of the eastiest way to sell a product to the public is by selling it to their children. Studies show that if  children see a product, they want to have it immediately, which results in them naging until they get the thing they desire. So companys use this methode to sell the products more effictively. 

Nevertheless making advertisements to an audience that is still to young to understand what that product is even about is just mean and unmoral. Children at the age of two to five are in the learing phase of their life, they absorb everything around them what is happening and what could happpen. Personally I believe that an advertising agency should only start targeting children at the age of around seven. At that age they begin to understand what is happening and they may even grasp the sense of the product. 

Plus the advertiments, that target the young aged audiance of two to five are really simple and idiotic. But because those adverts are so immensely simple and idiotic the viewers that saw said advert will not forget it immediately.

On the other hand children are the parents best investment, so if kids like a product the parents will believe that, that product is exactly what their child needs. 
Eventhough, I believe banning television advertisers to target infancy aged kids is not correct and should be banned, the toy companys that bring out toys for that age group don't have an really have an alternative. 

To sum up, targeting infants for advertising should be prohibited, though with the exclusion of toycompanies.
