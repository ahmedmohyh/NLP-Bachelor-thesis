Advertisment are in general something bad. The only reason they were created was to increase the comsuming society. The persons who make those thing, want to see their production growing up and that's a normal thing in the world we live. The problem is that they are making advertisments for the kids too. It's not something that is acceptable. The kids are to young to realize that what is on the screen isn't real. If only they could do realistic advertisment, it wouldn't be so bad. But everything that we see on these short videos are wrong. Maybe not completly wrong but they make the thing better and nicer that in the reality. The kids could be influenced by such a thing. They began to think of things that aren't real. They look at and they want those things just because it looks cool or because the video was funny. They can't have their own mining about it. 

Those advertisments are just a lost of time and are dangerous for the childrens.
