In the following Essay I will take position about the statement: ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.'' 
In our world, we live today, is advertising a thing of our all day life. We find Ad's not just in the TV, there are many other ways, for example ad walls. 
You could now say: why should the advertisment not reach everybody, children included. Well, there might be some points that could support this statement. One might be the growing rivaliation between companys and labels. They obviously have to communicate with the customer to ''stay alive''. But on the other hand, there are children aged at two to five, which should play outside and gather life-expierence. Children, that are sitting all day long in front of their televisions, are often having social problems in their further life. Ad's for those support the Tv consume, especially because children are way more open for those ad's. You could now argue, well there are parents. They have to controll the consume. Yes, that is true. But there are familys with problems, where the parents dont have enough time. Especially for them, should'nt kids get that effected. The labels have still the oppurtunity, to create ad's for the parents. That would let the children uneffected and they could have a lovely time as a child.
My opinion is obvious, dont create ad's for children in that young age. Try to focus on adverstisments for groups, that are able to handle the influence.
