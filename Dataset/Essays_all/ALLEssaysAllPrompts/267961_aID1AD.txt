I agree with this statement, because I think when television advertising directed toward young children, it's very bad for them. For example there is a clip about playmobil and a young child sees it, they want to have it so much. They go to their parents and ask them again and again until they have this toy. But when the don't get it, they will be mad and angry. So when they wouldn't have shown this clip on the television, the child wouldn't even wanted to have it. 
So actually it's bad for kids because they think they need something they don't really need, and their parents have to buy it, to don't make their children mad.
And there are also adverts which aren't really good for kids to see them. There are often nearly naked people, which isn't nice too see at the age of two to five.

But when you are the seller of this toy or of something else kids would love to have, it's a good way, for you, to show advert in teleevision. Because young kids believe or admire the things in the TV and they're so easy to influence. Maybe not all, but most of them. So it's a good way to sell your things.

In my opinion, there shouldn't be so much advert in TV. A little bit, maybe at the evening or in the night, when the kids are in their beds already, would be okay or even better for me. But I think, it's also in the parents hands, if they don't want their children to see all the adverts, that they don't let their children watch so much TV.
