I agree that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed, because kids at the age from two to five are easy to manipulate and the guys who make the advertisement know that. So they use or rather abuse these young naive kids for their egoistic moneymaking. They show tons of advertisement for toys, barbies and other stuff during the beloved series of young kids. The children then run to mum and dad, and cry out for these so important toys. Its if just at that moment it came into their mind that they really really need the new barbie or the newest lego castle. The trick with dumb children is, they don't stop crying for these advertised items unless the parent goes imediately to his or her car, drives to the next store and buys these bloody useless pieces of garbage.
The parents should rather throw the television into the rubbish and make their kids stop watching stupid shows. They better let the kids play outside, breathe fresh healthy air and learn to survive in the cold hard nature. They learn much more their life from being in nature instead of in front of the tv.
