"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.", this statement shows us the situation of the children today in richer countries. Where more or less every family has a television and every child grows up with it. What frightends parents is not due to food or homelessness. It is due to the television.

From a very young age, children are watching television and do not play outside. However with this situation, televison have a huge impact on our children and so on our and their futur. The television companies are aware of this and know how to use their influence on todays children. With hidden messages they can get into the brain of our children and make them think, what they want to think them. Of course this statement of mine is quite hard, but I believe, that watching television as young children, can have a very bad inpact on their lives.

However in the last few years in which television got more and more popular, the population has changed. In an very early age children are confronted with pictures of cruel murder or pornography. Through this the children today are more violant and have sometimes a strange behaviour due to sexuality.

To sum up all these facts lead to the conclusion, that Tevelevison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because it has an influence on our futur and the futur of the world. We should protect our children and should not allow television advertising toward young children.
