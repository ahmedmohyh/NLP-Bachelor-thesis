There shouldn't be advertisment for young children in the television because then kids tend to watch television and that's not good. Children in this age should be in the garden or somewhere else playing. It isn't good for them. My mom always told me that if I am watching television all day I get squared eyes and we don't want that our children have squared eyes. And that leads us to the opposite, the parents of the children should decide if their children are allowed to watch television. The state shouldn't have a word to say when it is about raising a child.
On the other side kids don't even have money at least not very much. When a kid see something in an advertisement and wants it but isn't able to get it it's very frustrating. Maybe it's even motivating children to steal.
You can also say that for the community of television watchers it has to be illegal. Because most of them aren't young children and then it's very unpleasent to see advertisement for childrens all the time. 

I am clearly against advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five, because when I have to watch advertisement, and Ihave to there's no other possibility, I at least want to see something that is for me and not for young children. Also I think that kids at that age shouldn't watch television, there is so much more stuff to do as a child then watching television. But I also have the feeling that in sight of a company it wouldn't really be successfull advertising rather not well spent money.
