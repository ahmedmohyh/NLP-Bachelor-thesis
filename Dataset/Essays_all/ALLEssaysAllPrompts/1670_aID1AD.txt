First of all, I aree with the statement. There are multiple reasons for that and few against it.
The main issue is, that children in the age of two to five have a different mind set up and not all behave the same way. This leads to different perspectives which leads to more factors that have to be included.
But if we ignore that and just focus on one certain type of child, the most common one, which is naive and inexperienced, we come to the conclusion that they are easily manipulated which follows by a child begging his parents to buy the advertised object. One the one hand, if the parents say no which is more likely than just saying yes the child is perhaps going to cry and stress them. On the other hand if they agree and buy the advertised object, let's say a toy, the child will be satisfied but for an unknown amount of time. Children tend to have interests in many things and change often their focus on new things. All in all, the child will be satisfied for a short time until it sees a new advertising which repeats the whole process over to an endless circle of unpleasure for the parents.
