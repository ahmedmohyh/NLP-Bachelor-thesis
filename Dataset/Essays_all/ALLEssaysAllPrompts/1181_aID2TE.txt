Of course a teacher needs knowledge of his subject and even more important: he needs the ability to explain it well and to create interesting lesson. But if a teacher has a bad relation to their students the students will not enjoy the lesson and they will not learn as good as their could. There are many kinds of bad relation of students and teacher. A teacher could be really boring, he could not get the class under controll or he could be very angry and just insult the children. This case is the worst. My tutor always tells our class how dumb we are and that we will not get our A-levels if we go on being so bad in class. But this does not motivate us in any way, the opposite: nobody, especially me, looks forward to her lesson or enjoys it. Furthermore I think that a student is better in a subject with a teacher he likes because he can oppen up better and can show everything he knows. The total atmosphere of the lesson is also more relaxed and better because the students can joke around with the teacher and everything does not need to be that serious. All in all I would totally agree with the statement and I would love if teachers would remember this more often.
