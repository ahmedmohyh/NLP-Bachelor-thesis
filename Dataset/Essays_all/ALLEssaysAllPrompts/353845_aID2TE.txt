Every student knows this situation: It's 8.00 am, you're sitting in class and the teacher is talking to himself while writing some random symbols on the black board. Everyone is tired and no one really cares. Not even the teacher enjoys it. He just tells the students off for not interacting and asking questions or showing any interest. So the question is: Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
For sure it's important for a teacher to know his subject so that he can teach it well. I think the students take teachers more seriously if they see that they really have knowledge of what they are talking about. But all of that doesn't mean anything if the subject can't be brought to the students. How a teacher presents him and his subject is everything. Teachers should motivate their students and show them how interesting and fun their subject could be. For example with creative works and works in groups, showing film sequences and news paper articles, just creating some diversity in everydays class. The students are more interested, have more fun and so they listen better and are more willing to study and ask questions. Even scientists say if people are motivated and willing to learn something it's easier for them. One thing affects the other. So the students are now motivated and interacting in class more, consequently the teacher is more motivated too and the whole climate in class gets better.
