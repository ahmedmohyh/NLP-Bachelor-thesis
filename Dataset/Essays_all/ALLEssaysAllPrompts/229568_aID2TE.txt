Essay

"A teacher's ability to realte well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

First I have to say, that it is important to have good subjects to be taught. But the teacher has a verry big influence of the motivation of the students. When he isn't good to relate well with students they will not respect him or they will just sit in the leasons and are bored. So it is verry important that the teacher has this ability. But when subjects that he teaches haven't an excellent knowledge, I think this wouldn't be that bad. Of course, if these are at a verry low niveau the students would not listen to the teacher. Also they would interrupt the leasons with for example yelling throu the classroom or they might game on their computers.

So for me it is more important that the teacher have a good ability to relate with students than teaches subject on excellent knowledge. My history teacher for example has not this ability and it is so hard for me to keep up my concentration in his leasons. I think a teacher could make his leasons more interesting, if he is spontanious and not if he just stands at the cupboard and writes on it.
