Essay 

A good teacher should deffinetly have a lot of knowledge of his subject because otherwise he wouldnt be able to teach it properly. I think its also more interessting for the students if the teacher knows what hes talking about. You will definetly also learn more or easyly if you can relate to what the teachers saying and if the teacher is well informed about his subject he can also comprare diffcult parts of the lesson to make it more understandable for the students. The fact that the teachers able to compare stuff and teach it understandable could deffinetly influence your grades wich is a huge plus point for the teacher.
A good teacher should also be able to comunicate and relate well with the students because it makes the whole lesson a lot more enjoyable if you have a cool athmosphere. If the teacher doesnt understand the students its very annoying and you are also likely to hate that teacher because students think the teacher doesnt understand them, you may even dont want to go to school because the teacher is soo unfriendly or doesnt unerstand you.
If we recap or make an example I would prefere a teacher who has a lot of knowledge and is able to teach us stuff easyly and unerstandable, but also doesnt comunicate that well and in some cases doesnt understand us, than having a teacher who is very nice and gently and is able to comunicate very well but has no idea about what hes talking about. 
So for me its more important tho have a very smart teacher than a teacher whos just able to relate to us because I think we can gain more knowledge and experience from the smart teacher. That means that I disagree to the statement but it doesnt mean that knowledge is more impotant a perfect teacher should be a mix in between them.
