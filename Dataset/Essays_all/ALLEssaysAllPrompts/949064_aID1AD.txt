If I were a parent, I would'nt want my child to watch advertisements who are not made for his or her age. But I also would'nt want my child to watch television at all at this age. In my opinion, children at this age should go outside and play with friends. They should pass their childhood at the playground, discovering the world, and not sitting on the couch watching television. If children can go outside, they can make friends for life and children who go outside to play are often healthier and less lonely, because they are moving and they are together with other children. Children who only sit at home watching television in their freetime don't have the opportunity to make so many friends as other kids do.
Of course, I would allow my child to watch television,but only seldom and not every day. And I would want to know what my child is watching on television. So I totally agree with the statement. Children shouldnt be watchig things witch are not made for their age. The most of the advertisements are made for adults, and not for young children. 
So I think it maybe would be a great idea to make a television channel just for children without advertisements. On this channel, there should only be movies that are made for children. They should'nt include violent content, so the parents know that on this channel, their child isn't watching anything what is not mentionned for the child's age.
