In Switzerland, teachers are often just here to teach students the subjects they have to learn to pass their school-time. In other countries, like the United States, teachers are like friends for their students. 

On one hand, teachers should be there in the first place to help the students learn all the things they have to in school. On the other hand, teachers should be persons you can talk with, when you have a problem, even outside of school.
For the students, a teacher who communicates well with his studets, the lessons get much more interesting and students get more willing to learn the subject.
Because of the variety of topics in school, students are more often confronted with topics they do not find interesting, a teacher, which helps the students and treats them more like a friend, than like just a student they have to teach something to, it can help the students to firstly have more pleasure learnig everything, or even learnig the things faster and easier and secondly to enjoy school time more than they would if they were just sitting in a class with an emotionless teacher that talks about tobics the don't like.

In my opinion, teachers should have both, they need excellent knowledge of the subject, so they can tell many interesting thing and can even teach some special things about a topic, but they should also be a bit like a friend or even a person a student can talk with, in this case the teacher also should look out for not beeing to friendly because they are still teachers and they can't just give everyone a 6 because they like hem.

With this said, both sides have their positive aspects, but a teacher that combines both knowledge and the ability to relate with students, would be the prefered one.
