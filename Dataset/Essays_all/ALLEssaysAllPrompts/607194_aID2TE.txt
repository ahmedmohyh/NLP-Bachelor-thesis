I have a lot apereance with different teachers. In my life I met teachers, who were friendly and helpfully but they didn't can explain something during the lesson. Other teachers were vere intelligent, but they didn't can help a student when he had problems with his life. I mean with problem that he have struggle at home. 
I would say a teacher should have both but I would say more knowledge than ablity to relate. So I'm disagree with this statement. Here I have two examples:

A teachers has the exercise to teach. That is the normal definition. In the beginning of the 20th centuries was for many students the teacher a bad person. He was strong, unfair and use his instruments to hit someone who didn't the right thing. But the students have learned a lot of things and they are very successfully in their lifes. 
In an other side the students had a hard time and I'm shure that many studends had many problems with themself. My father told me, that many students got sick before the lesson starts. They were so afreaid of their teacher!

I have in the secondary school a friendly English teacher. They helped us with our problems. I could go to her and could tell whats was going wrong in this time and she caught me help. That was nice. But on the other side I didn't learn very good English. I'm shure the guy who read my text will say the same! For me is English to heavy.

I think it's better to have teacher who teach very well and one teacher who could help you if you need it.
