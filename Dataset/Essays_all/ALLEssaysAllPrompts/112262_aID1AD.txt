The television is on, a random movie plays and in an intermission there are some advertisements. Probably one about a new and shiny toy for children of very young age. But couldn't that be a problem to show advertisments to such a young audience, to be more precise, to an audience aged two to five?

Because these children are very unexpierenced in life they can be easily manipulated. That's why probably want the advertised toy after they have seen the advertisement. But simoutaniosly, that's a positive too. If young children woud never be confronted with such temptations they probably wouldn't learn to resist them.

Another opinion is that it woul restrict our economie that is based on consumption. In addition, it's up to the parents of those children to from that advertisement. It's also said that the range of the age two to five was complete rubbish, because two years old children would not even realy realise what a commercial is.

I think that it shoul not be resitricted because it helps the children to develop a healthy commons sense, to distinguish between things they need and things that are unnecessairy. Secondly, if a child would show any issues concerning advertisements I think that it is the parents responsibility to look after their child and maybe don't even allow it to watch television.
