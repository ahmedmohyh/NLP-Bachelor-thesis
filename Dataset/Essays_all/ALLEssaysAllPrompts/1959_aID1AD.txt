In the following text I will give my opinion about the statement, if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. 
First I want to say that I agree with this statement, because in my opionion televisison advertising manipulates the young children.
In my opinion television advertising is only useful to show the interests of the young children.
But young children are not able to know what is right or what is wrong and they also do not know what is good and what is bad and in the way the producer of the television advertising do not present the products in a reality way. So the producer of the television advertising use this traits to catch the interest of the young children, so that the young children want to have the products, which are present in the television advertising. Furthermore this shows that the producer of the television advertising just want to sell their products and therefore the use the young children.
To conclude, I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
