I totally agree with this statment. A good relation between a teacher and a student is one of the most important things to create a good atmosphere for learning. A student can not learn efficiently if he has personal problems with the teacher. In my opinion the most efficient way of learning in school is by listening to the teacher. 

The ability to remember things the teacher told will help you a lot if you have to repeat the things before an exam. You can not learn everything only by reading books an the sheets your teacher gave you. You have to learn by a mix of listening, reading and speaking. The problem is that this only works if you are interested in what the teacher says and this is only possible if you have a good relation to the teacher. 

It does not matter how boring the things are which the teacher is telling you. If you like the teacher, the possibility that you listen to him is much bigger. 
Of course it is important too that the teacher has a good knowledge of the subject. But in my opinion this is not as important as the relation to the students. The things you learn in school are important for your future life but it is impossible that you can remember every detail. It is necessary that the teacher knows the most important things and is able to tell you these because these are the things you can still remember late in your life.
In my opinion you learn to much in school you forget soon later. There are things you already forget days or weeks after you learned it and this is one of the main problems in school.
I have to say that I respect the people who have another opinion. Maybe there are people who can listen to a teacher they don't like but in my case that's not possible.
