First of all it is clear that teachers have a great influence on students. How they are and how they teach their subject is responsible for the students interest and if they are going to like or dislike the subject. The first few lessons are the most important ones because then the students decide automatically if they will be motivated in the following lessons or if they do not like the subject at all.

In my opinion a teacher's ability to relate well with students is pretty important. Althought it might be fun if teachers are acting like friends with their students it is still important that they show them that they are the person of responsibiliy. What I really appreciate is when teachers know that at the end of the school year students are under much pressure and they are having lots of exams so that they respect that and do not put any more stress on their students by doing an exam in their subject.

On the other hand the quality of knowledge should not be neglected. It matters that the students learn something in class and not just having fun with the teachter. Each teacher has it's own way on how to teach stuff. How exactly they do it does not matter when at the end of the school year every class is more or less on the same level of knowledge. Moreover this knowledge might be essential later in life. For example if you want to study they expect that you are on a certain level of knowledge and if your teacher failed to teach your this you won't be able to study there.

With that in mind I can not totally agree with that statement. To me it is more important that teachers teach the knowledge right than their ability to relate well with their students because that is what is important. Later in life no one is going to ask you if your teacher related well with you.
