Television advertising

Television has been one of the most widespread medias for a long time. It can target different audiences of all ages since there is a huge amount of different channels with content specified for certain targetgroups. One of them are children, even under five years old. While this sounds nice, there is a dangerous scheme employed on those channels: the so-called adverts. Usually adverts serve the purpose of making money to finance the streaming of the tv-programs. This is here no different. But small children are easily influencable. If they watch a commercial about a new fun game, they will often want to have it and will persuade their parents to buy said products. And young cute children are espescially talented in doing so. Compared to adults and teenagers, they do not understand the value of money and  have trouble to figure out whether a toy is going to be worth it or just a scam. 

On the other side, prohibiting advertisements for a specified age-group seems pretty radical. And it is not like only children below the age of five would fall into the categorie of getting effortlessly manipulated by ads. Besides that, television is no longer the biggest, most important media: it has been overtaken by the internet. Since even younglings nowadays get a lot of exposure to the internet because they already have smartphones, this might very well be the bigger problem. But banning advertisements on the internet is close to impossible and would probably destroy the whole industry. So getting completely rid of ads does not sound like a good solut

My opinion is that the parents should put more work into monitoring what their children watch. Furthermore, they ought to explain them that buying the things promoted on television is not always a good idea.
