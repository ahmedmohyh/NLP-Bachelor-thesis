Young children shouldn't even watch television or when they watch television they should watch something that has been created for their age. And on a programme for children there shouldn't be any advertising. Young children want almost everything they see and for parents these advertisings for children wouldn't be good at all (although their parents could say no, but most parents just want their children to be happy). So for the family and especially for the children it would be a bad thing, also because if they can watch television they can't watch long time (most children at this age i think), and then the film or series would be distracted by some advertising. 
But surely there would also be a pro, for example for the people who want to sell something for children, something like a game or maybe even clothes. They would make a lot of money i think because children aren't so smart at this age and they believe what the advertising promises. It's much easier to convince children than parents or generally adults. The programme would also make a lot of money because advertising isn't cheap and they can decide which price it will be. 
I think that this statement is right and we shouldn't allow advertising on television for children aged two to five. It isn't nessecary to advertise on television, children also look at stores, they wouldn't earn much more money. And when I'm thinking about the poor parents whose children just want the game that was on television, I fell with them. But most important, I think children shouldn't watch television when their so young, they should go playing outside and if it would be like that, we wouldn't even have to think or "debate" over this. Maybe these young children don't even care if they watch advertisings, but maybe they do. I think nobody likes advertisings in the middle of a film and for that I think we shouldn't say that it's okay that our children have to watch it.
