The statement, that televisions should not be allowed to young children between two and five years is sometimes correct. Children in these years are in an important part of  their life. For example to learn the first things for school. Some kind of them have to find new friends when they begin the time in the kindergarden. Now it`s important to concentrate to get a correct circle of people. 
In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv. It`s bad, that they maybe see things they souldn`t have to see maybe some scenes of terror or something like that.They don`t understand it and they get fear. It´s important, when the children have to watch tv, to choose the right program. A good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals.
I think it´s important to draw a line between playing outside, doing homeworks and watching tv. I share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life, have to play outside. After the kindergarden or school, if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do, it`s okay to watch tv in a cutted time.
In my opinion it`s sad how much children in this chapter, become bad in school or can`t speek very well, because they only watch tv. All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.
