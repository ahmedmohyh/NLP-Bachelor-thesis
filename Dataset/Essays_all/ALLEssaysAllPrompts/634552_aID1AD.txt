In these days nearly everyone has a television in the house. This activity is completely integrated in the society. Several hours a day are spend in watching TV and in this time also advertisment is consumed.
With advertisment exists not only the intrest to make a product known, it transports also the information that the product is needed to have a good life. This is a way to manipulate the idea of a fullfilled life and I think the effects are for children stronger.
With this information you can say that the consumation will rise and this will have a positive influence on the economy.
I agree with the statement because in my opinion children shouldn't consume advertisement which may manipulate them. And I would extend the age from two years up to thirteen years, because teenagers are also, if not more, concerned. But for me it's more important that children shouldn't watch a lot of TV. Today TV is often not a way to learn about new topics than to waste the time, for example until you have to go to bed. I think it is sad that in this society a law is needed to protect children from the influence of advertisment, instead of offer them more attractive activities and keeping them away form consuming too much TV.
