Television advertising toward young children is a complicated subject and brings up different arguments.

To begin, young children are easy to influence and are going to believe the publicity. 
If a special product, developed for kids and good for their growth ( for example special items to play with) is shown on television, they will see it and want to have it. But there are many unnecessarily things on television advertising too!
Children are not old enough to select good from bad decisions, especially when the television advertising are e.g. funny-looking. They want to have things which are actually bad for them or they are going to believe they necessarily need itmes presented by the advertising.

However, forbitting television advertising is not the best solution to this problem. The best way to solve this and give security to young children, is to reduce the time they watch TV or parents who look after their kids. Parents can decide which things their kids need and explain to them why buying something is not necessairy or some things not good for them. Too much advertising is confusing children, they have to quit watching TV sometimes to discover new things in their lives, without general, good and bad, influence from television advertising.
