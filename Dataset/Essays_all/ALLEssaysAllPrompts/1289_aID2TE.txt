I agree with that statement. A teacher without the ability to relate well with students can be as good as it could be possible, but he will never teach as good as a teacher with the ability to relate with students. The point is that you can have an excellent knowledge of your subject, but as long as you dont relate with students, you will never teach them, because they dont like you and they dont want to get teached. On the opposite side a teacher you like, can teach you even if he is not the best in his subject, because you like his personality because he is funny or you can talk to him like a ,,normal" human. This is called respect. A teacher you dont respect, because you cant really talk to him or because he thinks he is above you, is able to teach you in a way, but you wont like it and the main point is that you can not use your full efficincy.
In my opinion a teacher is someone you need to look up to, more in a way that he is someone you want to be like, not a person that treats you like is above you. I agree that a teacher, that can not relate with me, can teach me, but he wont be able to get my respect. Respect is the most important thing between students and teachers. If teacher dont respect you, you wont respect them and the other way around. And if there is no respect the student will not learn as good as he could if there would respect.
