Many students do not like theire teachers because they are too strict or not able to think themselves inside of the students, but what is more important: A well educated  who got exellent knowledge or one that can comunicate with the pupils on one level and is still well educated but not as good as the first.
In my point of view it is more important to be able to think youreselve inside of the pupils because teachers often forget that they were once children too and they should know that the pupils do not attend to theire lessons and that we have to work with 14 subjects and withthat we can not only concentrate ourselves at on subject because we would fail in the other 13 subjects. 
On the other hand a very strict teacher can also help a class to get better at school becausethe pupils are afraid of him and are trying to do everything he wants them to. 
But what if one of his pupils is not able to coup with the situation and is not able to show as much effort as the rest of the class.The strict one would not try to help him and would say that he has to come up with an ideas how to get better at school. but the nice one would try to help him and try to figuere something out together with the pupil.Because of the that the situation between the teacher and his pupils will be more friendly, while the strictone will be hatet and the pupils will  not be as good as if the nice one would teach them. This is because the subject will be more interessting and because of this the pupils will be better but if you do not like a subject you do not give yourebest and try to impress the teacher because you do not likehim.
As you can see for me it is more important have a well educated but nice teacher insteat of having a teacher everybody hates but who is exelent educated
