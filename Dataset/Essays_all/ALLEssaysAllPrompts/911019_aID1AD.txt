The question if television advertising directed toward younger children should be allowed is not an easy one. Here I would like to shortly discuss the pro and contra points.

I'm going to start with the pro arguments. For the toy manufacturers it would be very positive if they could advertise their products on television. They would sell more things because more children would know their stuff. 
But other than that I can't see anything good about it if I'm honest. You could say that the children would always have an idea on what they want for their birthdays or christmas but I think children especialy small ones wouldn't have a problem with that anyway.

And now to the contra arguments. Little kids can be quite greedy. They can get bored of their toys very easily. So if you show them everything that's new they would always want more and newer toys which would be a problem for the parents espacialy if they don't have the money to buy new things all the time. 
Another argument is that small children can't decide if the advertise is fooling them with the quality or the price of a product. They couldn't decide if the advertisers are just telling great stuff about something to sell it and so they would believe everything.
Maybe it would also trick the children into watching the TV more often which is surely not what you want as a parent.

To end my short essay I would like to express my personal opinion. I think television advertising towards small children (aged two to five) shouldn't be allowed because the contra arguments outweigh the pro arguments. Only the manufacturers would profit from it and not the children and the well-being of the children should always be the most important thing to us!
