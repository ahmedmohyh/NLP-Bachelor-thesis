Television advertising is often an issue, especially when it is directed toward young children. Some people argue it shouldn`t be allowed anymore, others disagree. What are the arguments of both sides and which is the right way to go? A search for answers in form of an essay

Young children are the most vulnarable human beings in our society. Since they don`t have a value system or a guiding vision yet, they are in danger of being manipulated too much by Television advertising.

What if they - when they`ve grown up -  become easy-manipulatable adults who are just part of a consumption-society which - unaware of its doing - is just ruled by advertising and media? The way to go is a law against advertising towards too young children. Affected are, anyways, just children aged 2-5, so it is not a very large loss for advertisers.
