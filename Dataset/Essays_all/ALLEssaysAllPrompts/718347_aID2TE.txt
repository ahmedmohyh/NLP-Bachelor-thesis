A teacher's abiltiy to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is a sentence I hear very often, when I talk to my friends or my family. And I think, it is important, that we make these question about school, because we need to organize the school and think more about relating well than only knowledge.

First I have to say, teacher's must have an excellent knowledge of her specific subject or theme, which they have to teach the students. It does not matter, how good the teacher can relate with the students, when he had no clue what he is teaching, or when some of the student's have more knowledge of the subject being taught. Furthermore, a teacher with more knowledge earn more respect than other, and the students can take him serious. Somebody, who will teach them with less knowledge will be seen like a clown standing in front of the class and nobody respects him.

Nevertheless I want to say, that it is important, that a teacher must have the ability to can relate good with students, it does not matter if old or young, full of knowledge or not, because it is his job as a teacher. Students will have much more motivation, when a teacher not only tell his stuff and teach his knowledge. Teacher's used to do this , but the world has changed, the school has changed, it is not the same, so i think that the ability to relate good with students is more important than earlier and it will get more impotant than it is actually.

To conclude, I think that both is very important. Both does not work without the other. A teacher with only one of these ability will not have a easy time with the students, and they also not. School has changed.
