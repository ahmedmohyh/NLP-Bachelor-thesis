My first thought was, that this schouldn't be a problem. When children see advertisement, it has an effect on them, but they aren't able to buy something on their own. When the kids get older they are of course able to buy something. But at this age I think the kids should be more ore less informed and don't let themself manipulate to strong from advertisement. But here i am talking about children who have an average TV consume. When a kid spends more time infront of the television, the effects could be worse. The influence of the mother is important I think. When the  TV cosume is regulated and when the mother don't just leaves advertisements uncommented. In general I think its better when the kids are confronted early with advertisement, because it is a part of the television programm. When they see commercials at an older age they, they also have to learn how to handle it. An important point for me is what is advertised. If its for food, an action park, toys or other TV programms. As is said food advertisement shouldn't be a problem, because here the parents can decide wheter to buy something or not.  When there is advertisement for other TV shows or films, it will probably affect the kids but also here the parents can help by just regulating the time her child is infront of the TV. Important is that an advertisement don't scare kids. I think the reasons why you should show little kids advertisement overweigh and I actually think, that isn't a big problem too. Much more important is how the parents educate their kids.
