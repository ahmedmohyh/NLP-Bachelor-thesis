Some people think that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. But is that really true?

The relation of a teacher and their students is undoubtetly important. It influences the learning progress of the students and their interest in the subject. Students who dislike their teacher do actually dislike the subject in most of the cases too.
However, as friendly, helpful and encouraging the teacher might be, he/her can't be a good teacher if there is nothing to be thaugt. If the teacher hasn't the knowledge that is necessairy, he/her can't teach the students like they expect or deserve. The teacher can't answer questions which are a more difficult than what the students need to know.The students lose their trust in the teachers ability to teach and might even lose their interest in the subject.The lessons will get boring and nerve-wracking for both sides (students and teacher): A teacher who doesn't know enough about the subject he/she is supposed to be teaching and a room full of students who are just waiting until the school bell rings so they can finally go home.

In my opinion the ability to relate is important, but the knowledge as well. A teacher definetly needs both to keep his/her students interested in the subject being thaught -and to keep his/her happiness as well.
