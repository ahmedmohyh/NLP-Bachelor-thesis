I agree with the statement beacuse young children can easely be manipulated by television advertisement. For example if a young child sees an advertisement in the television about a toy can be much better manipulated as grown people. Because the television shows the children a world they like to be for example barbie. And if a young girl in the age of five years see that they insist that the parents buy whatever is shown in  the advertisement. But I also think that the parents have to protect their children of advertisements. But I think it would be better when the television advertising directed toward young children would not be allowed. I think young children can not say what they really want. One day they want atoy and the next day it isn,t interesting any more. And I think if it wouldn't have this television advertisement wich is directed toward young children they better know what they really want and don't want a new toy each day. It is also a problem for parents because they do not know when their child says he want that new toy if he had seen an advertisement and think it's cool to have this toy or he really will play with this toy. It is also a problem that the adertisement shows the children a unreal world in which they want they get in ant hey think if buy this product they will be in this world.
