Being a student and, therefore, being in contact with teachers almost every day, it is very important to me that teachers have a high academic standard. However, as important as having high academic knowledge is knowing how to deal with students. In the following paragraph I will list arguments in favour and against the statement. 

On one hand, a teacher is by definition an individual that has to teach students information about various topics. Therefore, it is very important that the teacher is academicly cualified for a task like that. The teacher has to be an expert because in the end of the day that`s what school is all about: Teachers teach students. On the other hand, students learn best if the study environment is good. In other words, if a student had to learn from a teacher that doesn`t really know or isn`t able to interact in a good way with his students, the student won`t learn as much as if the teacher had the ability to relate well with him. Therefore, a teacher that want's to teach students in the best way possible needs to know how to handle them.

In conclusion, I think that teachers need to be qualified in an academic and educational way. Therefore, I don't fully agree or disagree with the statement. For me the ideal teacher is a combination of both.
