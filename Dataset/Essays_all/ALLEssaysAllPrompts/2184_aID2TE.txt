 The following text discuss about the question " is a teacher´s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being tought?". The teacher´s relation to the students has a big influence to the atmosphere in the class.
Firstly the stuff students have to learn at school is futurerelevant. It is important that students learn as much informations as it is possible to have a great future. For the student´s future the atmosphere in the class room is less important. It has not any influence in the future.
Anyway a great relation between teacher and student makes a great learning atmosphere. So students are more able to learn and understand the themes better, bacause they ask questions to the teacher or classmates.
But with a great relationship between teacher and student , students cuold be allowed to talk with their neighbours during class, sothat they do not pay attention.They have less informations which has an influence to their grades.
But above all a great relationship betwenn student and teacher makes the student social.
