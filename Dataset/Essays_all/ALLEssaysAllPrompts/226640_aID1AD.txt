Advertising has become a important thing for many companies and stores to show people, what they have to offer. Adverts are everywere, they appear on televison, are talked about on radio and hang on all sorts of things. But are there any limits? Schould advertising directed toward young children be allowed?

In their young age children are very easy to influenz because they are still learning a lot. If adverts tell them what's good and what they schould have, they can't develop a opinion on their own. The skill of developing an opinion is very important and adverts block it.
On the other side children don't know much, so adverts can help them to learn about the world. They get to know more and get to know the different aspects of life. It's good to show this to them, because it's hard to find out for themselves.
Adverts lead young children in the wrong direction. They schould learn that the real goal, isn't to own as much as possible, but that it's important to gain experiences, to have social connections and to look in the insiide. Throug adverts they are learnig the wrong values.

To summarise, I think don't agree with the statement compleatly. Advertising can be allowed, but if done so there should be restrictions. They can show things, but shouldn't tell the children how these things are. That way the people, who want to publish adverts can do that and children can still develop their own opinions.
