There's a big discussion about television advertising toward young children and whether it should be allowed or not. in the following text i'm going to discuss this.

For the television production it's important to get money with advertisment because it's often the only source of money. They also need this money for the porduction of programms for children. if they make advertisment for adults or teenagers during the programm for childrens they wouldn't get that much money by the companies that want to advertis their products and it wouldn't be interesting for the children. 

This leads to the question what the television producters should show instead of the advertisment. They can leave the advertisment out but then they don't get any money. So as you can see they don't really have an opportunity to leave the advertisment out because without money they can't produce good television programms for children.

But everyone knows that young children don't earn their own money. So when they see something they really want the pranets have to pay. Another aspect is that children are easily to impress. For example they see a doll in the television and it's the only doll they want. Is has to be this doll. And after that doll they see a school of Plamobil with a gym and a music class and the children forget the doll and only want that school.

As a conclusion i can say that it's a difficult situation. On the one hand there are the television companies who need the money of the advertisment and on the other hand there the families who got porblems because of this adversisment. I think the companies shouldn't make any advertisment for children who are that young. They should make it for children who are older than five.
