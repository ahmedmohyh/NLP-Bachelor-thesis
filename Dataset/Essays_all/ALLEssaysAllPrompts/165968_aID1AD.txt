In the last years electronical devices, like television, are getting used more often. Also small children often watches many hours television per week. Where they come in contact with television advertising. But it is well known that small children are very influencable by television advertising.

As quotet above small children are very easy to influence, especially by well made television advertises. Because they are young and aren`t able to make their own thoughts about  aproduct due to their lack of experience. For example I have seen this when my brother was younger and we went to the cinema. At the beginning and during the brake there were many advertises, like movie trailers and food advertises. While I wasn`t interested in it, my brother wanted to go eating there.

On the other hand it is very difficult to achieve the goal to get no television advertises to small children aged two to five. Because you can`t ban channels fron every channel which a small kid is watching. Because on every major channel their is a small kids watching so they have to ban advertises from every channel.
Also advertises is the main money income of the most television channels. And without this income it would be impossible to provide free television channels.  

Although small children are very easy influenced by television advertises it is very difficult to achieve the goal not to get any advertises to small children. On plus television advertises are the main income of most television channels without them most channels would go bankrupt. As a solution it is possible to do payable televisio channels on which isn`t any advertises. This channels will earn their money by monthly paid prices from the consumer.
