Essay

A new teacher is at school. His knowledge about his subject is legendary and his new class is waiting in excitement in the classroom for his arriving. Their motivation to learn is high and they want to get good grades. But within their first lesson they realize their new teacher is not made for his job. He is moving forward really fast and cannot bring his authority through which leads his students to lose interest and be loud. He ignores inputs about his way of teaching and does not get along well with the pupils. But he could in fact tell them everything about the pupils in second world war and what influence the system of violence is able to have on them. The only problem is that he thinks they are more interesting than the ones in his classroom. 

So first of all we can see the negative consequenzes of the teacher's inability to get along with the student. His work is to teach the students and give some of his knowledge for the next generation. He refuses to do so and makes the students have a feeling of not understanding and not being able to take this class. He kills the potential. 

Otherwise a teacher is bound to have an excellent knowledge about his subject. How can you teach somehting you do not know everything about it for yourself. Secondly this is not the most important aspect. If a teacher relates well with the students, he will be able to find a way of keeping them interested and motivate them to do a good job. Should there ever be a question he cannot answer, there is the possibility to look it up in a book or the internet.

A good relationship between the teacher and his student is the key to a good education and a healthy environment to learn.The excellent knowledge stand at the second place.
