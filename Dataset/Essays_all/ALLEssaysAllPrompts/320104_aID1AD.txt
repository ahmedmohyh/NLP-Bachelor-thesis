Advertisinng

Nowadays advertisements toward young children are very popular. People have different opinions when it comes to watching television very often. I personally  think that advertisements directed toward kids aren't good at all. There are two main reasons why I am against it. 
The first reason why I don't support advertising towards young children is that mostly children at a young age don't really understand the reason why there are so many adverts on television. They don't realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible. The products we see on television are often not very neccesary. Companies promise that we would be happier if we had those things which they are trying to sell. The problem with this is that young children are more naive than elder people. They don't really understand if a product is neccesary or useful, actually they just want it becouse it looks nice or because their friends have a similar one.
The second reason why I am "contra" is that andvertisements influence the standart of the people watching them. Through watching televison advertisements, kids get an image of perfection and they are told how life should be. If they are influeced by a given image of perfection at such a young age, kids get very high standarts and don't know what is normal and natural. 
In general I'm nor against children watching television but because of the useless content of adverts i think that it in not the best thing a child could watch.
