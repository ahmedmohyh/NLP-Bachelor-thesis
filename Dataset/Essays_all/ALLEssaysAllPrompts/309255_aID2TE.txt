First at all, it is important to state that both of them are important. A teacher of course has to know what he is teaching about and he has tobe well-prepared to questions of the students. Otherwise students do not trust their teachers.

Secondly, a teacher is an idole to the students, especially to those in primary classes. If a student realizes that his/her teacher is not well-informed about the topic he /she speaks about, he stops listening to his/her teacher.

Nevertheless, it's scientificly proved that a teacher with a good relation to his/her students is more able to raise the student's attention and to teach them things successfully. Because of the fact that one of the most important things of a learning process is the motivation, the statement above is underlined. Imagine: Your teacher is standing in front of the class knowing everything, but it seems that he is not intererested by his/her students. Would you listen at him/her anymore? Probably not. It means that a good relation to a teacher leads to a more active learning process of a student, more filled with motivation and success.

Finally, because of the fact that it is written of an excellent knowledge in the statement above, which means that there is particular knowledge available, what is probably more than enough because the teacher has not become a teacher without going to university, I agree with the statement above and declare that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is at least as important as excellent knowledge of a teacher.
