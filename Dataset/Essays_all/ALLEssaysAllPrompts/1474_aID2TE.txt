Mainly I would agree with the given statement. Sure, it is important that the teacher has a well knowledge about his subject, otherwise he would not be able to make the students aware of. But when he brings the lessons up to dry or if the teacher is a sleepy guy, nobody would ever listen to what he says.
When I got a new mathematics teacher last year, nearly everbodys grades decreased, because he did not spent nice lessons, where we got examples or other stuff. He did not gave homework, because he thought we could do them in the break before the lesson starts. Maybe he is very good with maths, but his job is to make us good with maths. A few teachers are just here to earn money and to tell students they are lazy, Even if they are not better
Opposit to that we have got a nice physics teacher. He has a good knowledge and he does nice lessons too. As one of the best organized teacher, his lessons are strictly planed and we mostly get everything done in his favour. But also he is a humanbeing, not as other teachers... He is a nice and funny guy, so he does jokes often.
I know there are teachers, who do not do nice lesson but are loved by the students because they are friendly and funny. But we should be aware of that we are in a school and we are here to learn and not to meet teachers as a best friend. 
So my conclusion is, the best teacher is able to relate well with students but also has a plan of what he is doing, so that the students are learning something but still have fun in school.
