I totally disagree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Television always has advertisings there will not be any program on television which hasn´t any advertisings in there. ALso young children can watch this, they can see new toys or shows they want to watch so it can be useful. Especially in the time before christmas or the birthday parents can listen to their children and they can say "I want to have this toy" so the parents can buy this as a present. By the way you don´t have to pay much money to watch television. That´s because of the advertisings you see on television. Companys "buy" time so they can show their new products or anything else. They pay the money to the television transmitter and that is how the transmitter earns money so they can "sell" their shows much cheaper to us. Probably a lot of the parents will say that their children are not allowed to watch advertisings and that they should be banned out of kids tv but if these parents don´t want their kids to watch this they shouldn´t let their kids watch tv at all. Instead of watching tv they should go out on a playground with their kids so they must not see this advertisings. If they don´t want this and want to let their kids still watching tv they shouldn´t complain about it because the advertisings in the kids channels are not bad for them. They are always nice and friendly designed so the kids often even don´t recognize that this is an advertising.
