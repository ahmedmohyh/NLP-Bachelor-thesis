There are many reasons, for teachers to have a good relationship with their students. For example, that the motivation for school is much bigger if the stundents like their teacher. Because they could have fun together and the teacher isn't like their chef. When the motivation for going to school is bigger then the motivation for learning something new is also better. And learning something with fun is much easier. The motivation is a big reason for students, if thei are good in school or not.
It's also better if the teacher likes to come to school. If he has a good class and like his students he is also more motivated to help the students if they have problems and thats very important.
And it doesn't is only better for learning better. It's also better for the contact between teacher, parents and student. The teacher could be like a second father or mother. If the stundets got any problems, for example with their parents, they could tell it to the teacher and he/she could talk to his/hers parents. So a good relationship can also help the childrens in other situations.
Maybe some peoples think, it's bad because the students don't have so much respect from this teachers. If the teacher is more like a friend it could be complicaded to work in a serious way together.
I think that the students learn more, if learning is funny and that's only possible, when there is a good relationship between teacher an student. It's more easy to work all day with a person you like than with a person you don't like. For my opinion every teacher should be friendly, respectfull and funny with his stundents. It would be easier for everyone.
