Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Advertising has always been a big part of society, if back in the day or nowadays. There is a constant convrontation, it doesn`t matter if you`re outside, in the internet or just watch some TV, we find it in all sorts of media. Also advertisements are espeacially made to adress a certain group of people for example age group, gender, race etc. We live in a world, there we have already advertisements for our youngest generation, children aged to five.
Is this even worth the money? How much can a toddler actually already understand?
The companies creating those advertisement definentely see the potential of manipulating a child into wanting something it doesn`t need. A young child is innocent and naive and can`t read out such propaganda. 
But not every advertisement must be seen in a bad way, for example advertisements which are made to motivate children to eat healthy and do sport activities can surely be helpful and have a good cause.
I disagree with that I find it justified to manipulate a human being through media, it doesn`t matter if it is about children or adults. But we will never be able to make a total cut with advertising directed toward young children, but I personally think that money invested into advertisement which rather addresses their parents would be a more valiuable idea.
