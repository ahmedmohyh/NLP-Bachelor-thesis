Television advertising should not be directed to young children(age2-5). Their brain is not able to comprehend what kind of information they are given. They have not learned how to make reasonable decisions yet or tell the difference of necessary and not necessary. A child see's the world in a complete different way than an adult. Not only do they not realise that what they are watching is meant specifically to make them want it, but also do they not realise how much the wished for object would cost. This brings me to another crucial point. Children at that age do not have their own income. By gods sake, they probably do not even quite understand the value of a money. Give a kid a hundred bucks and the worst case scenario would be him or she ripping it apart. They should stop using diapers before being abused by adults advertising stuff, wanting nothing less, but the kids parents to buy the mercendise. Advertising toward people of such a young age can cause them to have future problems with investing their (not endless source of) money, due to the parents not paying for it anymore. They are practically forced to take place in the industry and its demand of consuming.
