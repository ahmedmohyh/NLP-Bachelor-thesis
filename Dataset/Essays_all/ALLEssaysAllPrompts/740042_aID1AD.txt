Today's television programs consists of a lot of advertisements to. And depending on the channel there's a big variety between them since some tv channels appeal more to kids while others are meant for adults. Therefore kids are exposed to adverts too. I see this very critically.

Firstly, kids can be influenced very easily and by appealing ads the young children get very interested in the advertised objects. The advertisers use this facility of influency and of creating interest to their profit. It is a lot easier to appeal to a kid than to an adult since the adults know that the advertiser is only interested in his profit. Regarding this, it is also a question of morality whether you want to use the children's naivety to your profit or not. 

Secondly, the ads might create an addiction-like behaviour. By seeing all those fancy toys the kids get a sense of wanting something really bad and not having it. And when they get it they will be happy for some time until they see the next advertisement with a new toy that they don't possess.

In my opinion, advertising toward young children should not be allowed since the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and since it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have.
