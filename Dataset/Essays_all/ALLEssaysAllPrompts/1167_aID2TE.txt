In today´s school it´s a big theme if the relationship between teacher and student is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject. On one hand it´s of course important to have the exact knowledge of the subject that is taught. MAny people think that this is the reason, why children should go to school. But that is not correct at all. There are other thinggs that are even more important than the exact knowledge. One of these things is the realtionship between the students and the reachers. If a student has a bad relationship with his teacher he doesn´t like to go to this subject and as a consequence he can´t learn as good as other students, who have a better realtionship. If a student has a bad relationship with his teacher he always thinks about this subject in a negative way and this makes the learning process very hard. Although the students` goal should be to reach the exact knowledge, it´s not the only thing that should be concentrated on in schools. With a bad relationship to any teacher in school a student always has a bad feeling, when he has to meet this teacher in the next lesson.
So all in all I agree with the statement, because the exact knowledge is important, but it should not be the only thing that is important in a school, because there are other things that are even more important.
