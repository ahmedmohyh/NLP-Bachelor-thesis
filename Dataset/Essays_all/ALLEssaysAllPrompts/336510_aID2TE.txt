In the following text I'd like to evaluate if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject which they're teaching. 

I'm sure if you have a teacher who has a good relationship with the students, the subject will be easier for you because the lessons will be more interesting. I can even imagine, that if the teacher is very kind to you, you'll be more serious during the lessons and at home and you could make your homework and even have fun and enjoing it.I think in this case the students are more open to learn new things too. But if I'm honest if the students are only learning for the teachers and not for themselfs, something is wrong.
But like everything in life this has also negative aspects. If, for example, the knowledge of the teacher isn't that good, he can't, obviously, teach the subject that well like a teacher with a bigger knowledge. So it's possible that you have questions that couldn't have been answerd by your teacher or even worse, he  or sh could give you false informations.




 Nevertheless I think it is very important that the students are having fun is the most important thing so they're focused on what they're doing.
