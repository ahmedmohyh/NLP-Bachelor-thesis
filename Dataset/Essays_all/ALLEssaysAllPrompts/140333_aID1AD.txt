As a child who's raised in a family with no television, I can only imagine this experience and use stories that I've heard so far. Television advertising can surely be very interesting; that's why we watch it. So if a child at the age from two to five watches this advertising, if daily or just from time to time, it maybe help to prosper its imagination and fascination of new things. I'm not an expert, but if I watch an television advertising, for example for a new product, there's a chance that I'll get interested and start thinking about how it works, what I could use it for etc. I can imagine that a similar process of thinking could start in the head of a  young child.
On the other hand, without doubt, it can be easily addicting. The child gets used to watch something on television, and learns that you can spend time just watching television. But to come to the specific part of the advertising, I guess there's a high chance that the child sees something in an advertising and it instantly has a longing for it. For exaple, if a child sees a toy, which is offered as if one couldn't have fun in his childhood without this very toy, it simply wants it. Advertising can be so manipulating, that a child doesn't realise what other toys it might already has, but just gets greedy about this new toy.
That's why in the end I think, advertising focused on children aged two to five should not be allowed.
