As a teacher it is very important to have the specific knowledge for the matter they teach. Because if they do not have the knowledge and the experience they will not be able the teach the important stuff correctly. It is also really important to be able to answer questions and some questions can be really hard to answer. If students do not understand a specific theme you have to be able to explain it in different words and without knowing more details about a theme you will not be able to do it. So it is important as a theacher to have an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. 

But at the other hand a teacher needs to be able to relate with the students. If a teacher starts with a new subject he needs to understand that the pupils have no previous knowledge of it. If he is not able to relate with the students in such a situation the students will have many problems and will also be confused. As a teacher it is also important to teach the knowledge in a proper and correct way. He needs to remember how it is to be in the situation the students are in.

In my opinion a teacher should have the ability to relate well with students but also have an excellent knowledge of the subject. A good teacher should have both. But if I had to decide which one is more important I would say the excellent knowledge. If a teacher is not able to teach good which means that he is not able to relate well with his stundents is not such a big problem as when he does not have the specific knowledge he needs. Because if he teachs wrong stuff and transmits incorrect knowledge it will probably have a bad influence on a persons future life. So to have the knowledge is more important than to relate well with the students because of this I do not agree with the statement.
