Everybody knows that teacher he hates or hated because of personal reasons. Nobody wants to go to that class and it's not because of the subject it's because of the teacher although he knows everything by heart. But nobody bothers if the teacher is nice but he doesn't knows as much as the teacher everybody hates. As an example I'll use my teacher from mathematics. He knows everything from programming a computer to analyse a graph but the lecture is not good at all because he hasn't made a single joke yet and he's always talking about facts and solutions. But our teacher from history is really nice. He talks a lot about other things than he should do but  actually it's always funny and if he tells us to learn something every student is motivated. But it's also bad if the teacher is only funny and has a good relationship with every pupil but actually you learn nothing as a student. You could watch comedys the whole day and it would have the same effect. To sum it up the best teacher has both of it. He should be funny but he has also sould have a great knowledge about his subject. I think the perfect lecture would consist of 20 to 30 per cent funny stuff and the rest should be straight facts and complicated tasks.
