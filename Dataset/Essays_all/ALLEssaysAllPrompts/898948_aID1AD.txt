Television advertisement is in general a two faced thing. It promises and shows you things that are in the end not really going to come true. If we consider advertisement for young children, it get's even more complicated, because children don't really understand what is happening to them when they are watching advertisements for certain products.

Starting with a pro point, that would be, that the businesses that are selling their products with these adds for children, sell and therefor earn more money. An example would be that if kids go into a store and see something they really want, they are going to beg for it, untill their parents buy them this certain toy. Now if businesses wouldn't even need to get their costumers to come to the store to get this reaction from their kids, but they could even directly reach them at home to sell their products, it is even easier to sell more because like that they can reach a bigger audience.

A contra to that would be, that children are already confronted at such a young age with such marketing ways. The children are used as a way to get the parents to spend money on them. The child is like a conection from the product sellers to the parents, if they get the children to fall in love with their product by saying it's the best thing right now, with colourfull advertisement and kids having fun, it is a trick into wanting to have that exact product. Because kids don't know yet how these advertisements are constructed to get us to buy things.

In general I think that advertisements are not such a bad thing, I just think it shouldn't already be allowed at such a young age because the kids don't know yet how they shouldn't believe everything that is shown on tv or that advertisemnts are just a way to show certain products and make them public but that doesn't mean that we should directly buy them.
