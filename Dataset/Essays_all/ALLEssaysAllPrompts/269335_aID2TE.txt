The importance of a broad knowledge, for an occupation as a teacher, is undeniable. However, knowledge can not be transmitted to studendts, if there is no connection between the teacher and his students.

One supporting argument of this thesis would be the fact, that students mainly pay attention if they are interested in the topic. Thus, one of the teachers responsibilitie is to evoke attention or interest. If he/she is not capable to relate with his students, the students will not pay attention and therefore the level of the teachers knwoledge becomes secondary.

On the other side, having insufficient knwoledge about the subject can lead to serious consequences for the student. If a student is taught, for example, wrong grammar rules for a language, he will not be able to speak the language in the future.

Another supporting argument would be that a good connection between students and teacher can have a positive effect on the students academic motivations overall. Having positive associations with a teacher and his topic has a major influence on how we perceive school in generall. So contrary, if the student has a negative memory of his previous teacher, he will always associate his negative memories with the subject in the future.

In the end, the human interactions between a teacher and his student more more important than his excellent knowledge of the subject. Because a student will not make any difference between a teacher who has a PHD or the Master. But students will definetly know the difference between a teacher who is engaged and interested and a teacher who is not interested in the well-being of his students.
