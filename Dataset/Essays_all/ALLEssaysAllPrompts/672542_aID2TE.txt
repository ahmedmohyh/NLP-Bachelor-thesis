In school you have one teacher that you like way more than the others. Because of this good relation between you, you have the feeling that you learn more than with the other teachers. So you are questioning why. Is a the relation the more important factor than is knowledge?

For a student the relation with the teachers and the knowledge that is thaught are important parts of the education. This, at least, 12 years of your life you have to spend in schools with teachers to educate. A good relation with your teacher makes you able to work and learn  more from him, with a bad relation it's almost a must. But also the knowledge has it's importance. A teacher who has a excellent knowledge can teach you many things that will make it easier for you to understand. Education teaches you knowledge. 

In my opinion the knowlege that a teacher teaches his class is way more important then the relation between him and his students. A teacher with no knowledge about the subjects is useless for me as a student, who wants to learn something from him and not just having fun with him.
