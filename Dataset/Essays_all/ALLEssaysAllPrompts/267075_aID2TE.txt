Most students can relate to having to go to a class that they absolutely dreaded not because of the subject matter but because of the person teaching it. Is it more important to relate to your students or to have a broad knowledge on your specific subject?  

The capabiltity, if a techer has the abillity to teach a subject well, is in my opinion multi-layered. An argument for an extensive knowledge of the subject being taught is that the students are going to be informed with all the necessary information to reach their own conclusions. Certain students don't need to rely on tehir techers guiding them through the work, which makes them more independant learners. However being able to relate to your students has the perks of bringing your point across in a relatable way and making them understand the subject matter at hand. Another important point is that students might start to dislike going to a specific subject solely because of their teacher and get turned off a subject that they otherwise might be more interested in. 

For teaching in my opinion you're better off having both, but that is of course the ideal. Being able to convey an idea and make someone understand is in my mind  ever so slightly more important, because you can create a fundamental level of understanding in your students on which you can build with additional information. In my opinion learing moree in your subject that your teaching is easier, than learning how to make someone grasp an idea and because ofthat I would ultimately say that being relatable is more important than having an extensive knowledge.
