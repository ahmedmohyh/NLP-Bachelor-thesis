The memories of my youth. Always after school i would get on the couch and turn the tv on and watch the kid network in my country for a decent amount of time. There was one thing that really got on my nerfes even today and that is advertisments. There were so any ads on tv I even messured with a stop watch how long the comercials break were. They were or they still are up to ten minutes which for my little self was a lot. Sometimes i beg my mom or dad that they buy me the stuff in the ads. A childs brain is like a sponge of informations: It soaks all information in that the world confronts it with. So it remembers all commercials and toys that got shown in tv. But there are also ads that help the children. For example the school materials that get shown in the kid channel are superb. They get prepared for school. The school ads help also the children to like the school because in the ads the school always looks like it is fun and cool. 

But my opinion i think the commercials in childrens tv should be banned because it creats an image of capitalism and i think the only true form of a state is a state of communism. In communism all the people are equal and there would never be a competitions of products and without a competition there won't be ads. We sould take notes of mother Russia and support it on it's way to a state of communism. Glory to the Communism!
