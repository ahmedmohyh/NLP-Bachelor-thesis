Children are heaviliy influenced by everything they see. So if they see a toy advertised in television, it's easy to understand, that these children want to have them, even if they have no use for them.

An advertisement in television can shoew a wrong image of the product, but for some children television is real. An adult has experience in what he can trust and what is fake. Children can't distinguish between what part of the advertisement they can belive and what they should be aware of. Most of the toys are advertised between shows. For the advertiser it's an easy way to get the people to buy their products. They make the children beg their parents for the toys, even if the parents know better, what kind of toys their children have an use for. If the children see the toy in real life, they may have an impression of what it does and they may change their minds. But even adults can be influenced by advertisements. So if  the children start early to analize, how advertisement in television works, they won't make similar mistakes in the future.

Advertisement in television can influence children, but it can also influence adults. If a child learns how to look at advertisement in the early ages, it knows later how to avoid way bigger mistakes. conclusion
