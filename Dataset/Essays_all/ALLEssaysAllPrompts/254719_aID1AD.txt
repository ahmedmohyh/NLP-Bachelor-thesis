Generly speaking advertising is common thing in our society and necessary for companys to sell theire products, however in the lates time advertising has got an negative tone. People are more and more annoyed by the many posters and spots they see during the day and the idea behind it that they should buy the shown products. When it comes to children in gereral people mostly parents are very concerned about what theire children are confronted with. By dircting advertisement toward children the companys use tricks to influence the childrens wishes and change theire buying behaviour, so they spend more money or in other words they get theire parents and family to spend more.

In terms of law specific advertising towards children in young age is completly legal like it is for every other age group. Speaking about economy it is only fair that companys are alowed to make television advertising directed towards children if they could not do this they would lose much income and were left behind compared to other companys which is not what our modern economy stands for.

Speaking about the influence of this advertisement on children there are no evidences that it has an negative influence on children and even if it had it is the responsibility of the parents to not let theire children see this form of advertisement.
