Should television advertising directed toward children (2 to 5) be forbidden? This isn't a hard question for me to answer, because I only see arguments for this statement. On the one hand there is the problem with children and television in general. Nowadays almost every child grows up infront of a television, whereas twenty years ago they only knew advertising from the newspapers. On the other hand there is the fact that children are in comparison to adults more affected by advertising, because they don't realise that it is advertising at all. They see something and then they want it. But what they do not see is the manipulative advertising company and their goal to earn money, behind it, it's just a simple toy and they want to have it. All they see are the material things and it takes them only one second to decide wether they want it or not. So companies like to produce advertising directed to children, because it is so effective. 

Considering that nowadays children are confronted with advertising in a younger age then twenty years ago, I think that there should be a discussion on wether we allow this or not. With social media and media in general, like radio and television, children get in contact with advertising in a younger age, because although they can not read yet, every child understands a short clip about a new product on TV. I actually can't think about a reason for advertising directed at children, because I think that it is just a simple and very manipulative way of companies to earn money. Children are very naive and they don't see the problem behind advertising, they simply believe everything, especially in the age from 2 to 5. I want to forbid this kind of advertising in order to protect children and also the money of their parents, because in the end the parents are the ones that have to buy it for their children.
