In the following I'll give my opinion on the statement that television advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should not be allowed.
First of, I can't tell any positive thing about advertising directed toward young children. The only positive is the firms earn more money with it and that's why it is a genius idea. As soon as young children see any toy or something like that, they immediately fancy and want to have it. They will ask their parents to buy it about everyday. It'll be getting on their nerves and so the parents will probably go for it. 
The other thing about it is that I don't understand why there even is an advertising while watching a kids show. Children mostly watch TV shows running on a platform made for their age so why isn't it forbidden to let the show break for advertising children who can't even buy the shown things themselves because there are not even earning money by their own?! 
Another negative thing is that advertising does make stupid und unhappy. First, they build up random things to make their advert more interesting and children get even convinced about what they say because they're still naive. Also, you'll get unhappy while seeing all those fabulous stuff you would really like to have. Their "old" toys won't be enough anymore and they'll alsways crave for more. They won't recognize the worth of their old toys. 
Summed up, I think it should be forbidden.
