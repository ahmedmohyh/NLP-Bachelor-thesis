The question wether television advertising directed to the group of two to five year old children should be allowed or should be denied splits the opinions of parents and socialogy professors. An argument against this kind of advertising is the fact that children get influenced by these pictures and start to annoy their parents and to show of their superiority over other children by comparing their toys and games. With such a young age you aren´t able to reflect wether the toy is good or bad because bright colours and funny music influence your brain to tell your parents to buy that specific toy. Even if actually playing with the toy isn´t funny at all or might be boring the good advertising shows of the perfect toy that you need to have. On the other hand you should ask the question why children at the age of two or even five years are watching advertising on television. Parents should care about their childrens behaviours and should be able to stop them from doing things they don´t want them to do. If you don´t allow advertising for this group of children you are actually censoring the television by denying concerns to show of their products which is against the freedom of speech. You also influence the market and are responsible for huge drops of the soled numbers of toys. In my opinion the state should not influence the market and should allow the television advertising. As a coparision you would have to ban all movies, shows and advertising from television, that could influence children in a bad way. Watching advertising for toys is in my opinion a lot better than watching parents to have an argument. So last but not least the parents should be responsible for everything they don´t want their kids to see. They should decide if their four year old boy should watch television instead of playing with his friends -and if he watches television- which channels he is watching.
