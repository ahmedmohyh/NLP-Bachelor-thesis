Television advertising is a big topic nowadays. You can't watch TV without loads of spots about products you schould buy. Even kids get involved in this kind of manipulation. So there is the question, if this should be allowed and what consequences could be the result of it.
Young people always are more manipulative than adults. Often they don't realize what is fake and what is real and that is the thing the advertising companies use for their sucsess.They show the kids a fake world with everything they dream about. So the kids get manipulated and they wanrt to have all the bveautiful things they see in the televison. Especially very young children are in volved in this problem, They can't judge the situation and don't see the real reasons and the conmpanies behind the great and fantastic advertising-world
You could say that this is a problem of the parents because they have to look after the young children and should decide what they see and what they don't see. But  how can you protect your kid from all this advertisment? It's nearlly everywhere and sometimes also very hidden.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to make advertisment in TV for young kids.
In today's Society it is all about having things and wear clothes with the right brands.
Kids learn this behaviour nearly sinse they've been born. And this shouzld be stopped. Kids have to grow up with the kown of the right values and advertising in TV desstroys that.
