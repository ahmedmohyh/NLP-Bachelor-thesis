The essay is about, if it is more important that a teacher relate well with students than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. So how should the perfect teacher be?

The first point is, that a teacher, with a good relationship to his or her students would probably have more fun at work and even so the students, because the atmosphere would be so much more calm. And this is the next point, because a calm atmosphere helps, for the reason, that the students would like to come to school and this includes more work motivation. And still as you can see on a lot of schools in Germany, even if the teacher does not have the perfect knowledge about his subject, the students are still learning with a smile on there face. 

On the other side a teacher with a perfect knowledge about his subject just is able to teach you the things better than a teacher with a less perfect knowledge, beacuse only one, who totally understand his theme is able to reach the students, because he know everything about his subject and understand it, which you can't say about a teacher who got less good informarion. And also, because a good teacher is often pretty mean to the students and gives a lot of homeworks, when they won't work well, the students would learn, beacuse of fear. The  last point is, that a perfect educated teacher is better for your future, beacause there you can learn more informations, which you could use later at work. 

The conclusion is, that a teacher with an exclellent knowledge of his subject better for the students, beacause they get better status in work.
