On television there's a lot of advertising, espacially for young children, because the don't have to go to school or to work so the have the time to watch television the whole day. Now we discuss if it should be forbidden to produce advertising directed toward children aged two to five.
If the advertising directed toward young children is forbidden the companies who produce toys will have problems to bring the product to the consumer. The children wont know what they want for christmas. So the parents will buy some toys and the children will be sad because there parents bought the false toys. Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football. So they get away from the srceens and do something usefull.
But if the advertising directed to young kids is allowed the producer of the toys could sell some cheap produced toys for high price to the kids because they don't know what a fair price for a toy is. Also the children will annoy there parents because they want a lot of things that the don't need. The kids will also be a lot of time in front of the screens to watch their favorite TV-show and so watch more advertising.
In my opinion the advertising directet to young kids should be forbissen because if the children watch advertising they will annoy there parents until the parents buy them a toy and after two weeks they wont play with this toy and the want the next one.
