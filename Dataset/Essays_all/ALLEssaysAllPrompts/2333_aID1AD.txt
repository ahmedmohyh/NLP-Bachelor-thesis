television advertising is much more comfortable for the teachers. the young children can learn and the teachers can watch. but i think the childs don´t agree with this because they are too young.
 they don´t want to watch at the television learning films they want to watch funny and real movies.
 in this age the television can also hypnotize the young kids and they agree with and watch the whole film without speaking.
 in this young age they must play and play with other childs. they must learn from humans and agree with their statments. i think they are too young to watch tlevision in this age, they must interact with humans and each other, they can play in the nature and do some activities.
they can watch a film with breaks and a teacher how say what happens. when they don´t understand a topic, they can´t ask the television. they must teached by humans. when they watch filmsthey want the same thing at home and so the perents have to buy it. and than they play not outside they play alone at home.
