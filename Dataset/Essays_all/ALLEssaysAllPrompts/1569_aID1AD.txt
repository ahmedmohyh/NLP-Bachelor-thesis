Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

I think that it gives two sides for this statement. One for pro and one for contra. One negative point is that the young children don´t know what advertising is and the kids don´t know the background of advertising,so it is unpossible to show advertising in kids tv. The advertising in the tv want,that you see an product and that you would buy it,because the products were presented nicer,as they really are. Then we come to the next negative point by television advertising toward young children. The young kids want all that they see and all thats look cool and nice,they are so easy to influence.The children see an product in television and they would have it. The kids don´t know about television advertising and don´t know who the products really are. I think that the young children don´t know what good or bad is.
One positiv point of television advertising directed toward young children is, that the product,what is presenting in the tv, can be more buy. Because more people watch the advertising. 
In the end i would say,that television advertising should´nt directed toward young children. The kids are too young to know,if the advertising is good or bad. Young children are easier to influence,and to influence to by an product. The advertising can be allowed when the kids are older and know abou this.
