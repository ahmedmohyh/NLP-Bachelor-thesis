A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Some poeple may agree or disagree to this statement. However, let us first discuss what makes someone a good teacher.

Frankly, a teacher has to explain the subject in a way that the students can understand. So he has to find a way of teaching that is simple to understand and easy to remember. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the students to get good marks on exams and they will eventually not like the teacher.

Second, a teacher needs social skills. He has to be strict for sure, but he has also to be faire. If the teacher is too strict, the students will not like the teacher or even fear the teacher. This can cause a bad work atmosphere and everyone knows how important a good work atmosphere is.

Last but not least, a teacher should be a little bit nice. If the students do not like him, they will not really listen to him and that is bad for their studying. 

In conclusion, yes I agree with the statement, because the ability to relate well with students is needed to be a good teacher. To know why students struggle sometimes with a subject will help to explain it better. And of course it is important to be strict and faire, but it is only really possible, when you can relate with students. The work atmosphere is very important. The better it is, the better the students can study. That's why I agree with the statement and I am sure many people agree with me.
