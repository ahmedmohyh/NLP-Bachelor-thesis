Pillows, toys and clothes in pink and light blue- a tipical television advertising. In this case, it's obvious that the advertising isn't directed toward adults or teens but toward young children. There are fervid discussions on this topic and if it should be forbidden.
Have you ever seen a young child aged two to five in a supermarket buying things all by itself? No? Me neither. You know why this is so? Because they are with their parents all the time. I do indeed understand that a child shouldn't be influenced and manipulated at such a young age and that is the case with advertising. In my opinion, advertising may be directed toward young children but it is the decision of their parents if things are bought or not and also what products are bought and used. Therefore, I don't think that advertisings directed only toward young children even exists. The opinion of parents, mostly young adults, matters to companies trying to sell their product. Furthermore, young children at this age mainly don't spend their freetime infront of the television but outdoors playing. Even if they sometimes watch television the chanels for children are already without any advertising. Moreover, it's easy to attract a child's attention because of their young age. They have hardly any experiences and therefore everything they see ist something new. Even if they get attracted by an advertising I don't think that their excitement will last. It's more likely that they forget about products they've seen and find something new to think about and to wish for. 
Finally, you can say that I see no sense in or need for abolishing television advertising direkted toward young children.
