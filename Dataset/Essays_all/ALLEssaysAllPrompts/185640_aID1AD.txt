While watching tv young children are exposed to advertising directed towards them. Should these adds be allowed?

I do not think that it really matters since children that young do not watch a lot of tv. On the other hand young children might be more influenced by television advertising than adults. For me television adds are annoying and have always been so. I barely watch tv and don't think that tv adds influenced me at any time. We don't want to pay for our tv programms and they have to earn money somehow. It might even be a good preparation for the kids for their future life, during wich they will be confronted with loads of adds and will therfore need to keep distance.

If you think television adds are bad for your child, just don't let it watch tv, what it doesn't know, it doesn't miss. There are many other things to be discoverd.
