It is very important, that the teacher has a good relation to his students. If the teacher has a good relation to his students, the teacher and the students have more fun in the lessons and have a better atmosphere to work. But I think, that it is more important to have a teacher, who is very good to teach his subject. So it is not helpfull for the students, if the teacher is very friendly, but the teacher can´t teach his subject and the students don´t learn something. So if the students must write their A-Levels, they have a problem, if the teacher don´t taught well and the students don´t know how they must work with their tasks. But if the teacher is not friendly to his or her students, they have a very bad atmosphere and the students don´t want to work with the teacher and they don´t want to follow the lesson. So you need a part of both, you need a good atmosphere in the class, that the students want to work with the teacher, and the teacher has fun to teaching the class, and you need a teacher with enough knowledge about his subject, anymore the students have problems to get enough education and so they haveproblems in the following exams, or, for example, in the A-Levels. My favourite subjects are the subjects, which have a friendly and sympathic teacher. You have more fun and you like it more to say something in class, if the teacher is sympathic and make some jokes. So it is a better atmosphere and the students want to learn something. But if you have a friendly teacher, without excellent knowledge, the students are unhappy and don´t want to learn something.
