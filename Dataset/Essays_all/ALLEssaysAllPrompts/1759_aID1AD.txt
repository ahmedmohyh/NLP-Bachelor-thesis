Television advertising is seen by everyone daily. Companies are advertising their products and special offers. Adults know how to deal with advertising but we were asking ourselves the question if television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. 
Advertising made for young kids is usually about toys or cartoons. It's made colorful with lots of big impressing pictures which is why kids think it's interesting to watch. If there is an advertising about a brand new toy the children always want to have it so they go to their parents and ask them to buy it. The kids are too young to understand that people always want to sell their products and kids are the best way to do this because parents usually can't say no to their young kids. They also don't understand that all of these toys cost a lot of money. Nevertheless children at the age of two to five don't understand most of what's said in advertisings which is why I think that it doesn't really matter if companies use advertisings or not especially because they won't be able to remember it the very next day. 
In my opinion television advertising for young children are very tricky because kids with their positive minds believe everything and they get impressed easily. So I think a few advertisings can be allowed if they are made carefully. But there shouldn't be as much ads as for adults so the kids can focus on their cartoon without beeing interrupted by multiple advertising. Also parents should try to explain to their kid that they can't have everything that's advertised, I think it's important for kids to know that.
