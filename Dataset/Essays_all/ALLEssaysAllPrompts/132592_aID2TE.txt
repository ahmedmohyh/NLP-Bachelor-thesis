Nowadays many teachers have a excellent knowledge but aren't really meant to be teachers because of the way they try to handle a sum of wild and young students. In a opinion of a student, a teacher has only the possibility to be accepted when he/she appears well. Teachers need to open up, to show the students how interesting and informing the themes are and how wonderful a life ful of knowledge is. In my opinion a good relation to the students is the most important thing a teacher should aim at. It's important that teachers can motivate students, especially in the younger years in life. This is the time, children have to like school to get motivation for the next few years and maybe the university and things like that. Without motivation and happiness in school it is impossible to teach a student anything, no matter how excellent the knowledge of a teacher is. Those were many positive aspects for a teacher trying to have a good relation to his student. But the thing is, when teachers have a perfect relation to the students but have a bad knowledge of the subject being taught, it isn't possible either to become intelligent. A teacher has to be informed about everything and he/she has to be able to answer the most of the questions students ask. If this isn't the case, the teacher wouldn't help anything. 
That's why you can't really say that one of these aspects is more important. I would say it depends on the age of a student. In the first six to eight years of school, the teacher needs to be motivating and students have to get to know the bright sides of learning things and get knowledge. After then, a student has to be able to motivate himselfe and then the teacher has to have an excellent knowledge because the level of the students also gets higher and they become more intelligent every year. That's the time students really begin to ask demanding questions and begin to show interest in the subject.
