The question about the pedagogik ability of a teacher, so how much this talent is important for teeching students, I will analyse in this Essay. I will also talk about the difference between the importance of the knowledge of the subject being taught and the importance of the pedagogik ability of a teacher.

So first you can say that the knowledge of the subject is very important, in case you regard the importance that students get a relaiable and true knowledge. But otherwise you can say that althought the teacher has a big knowledge of his subject; he cant be sure that all the students understand what hes talking about or that the students  listen to him ( maybe because of a bad authority ,for example).So we see that it is also very important how the knowledge is taught.Teeching students contain many important aspects: First the treatment of the students; as a teacher you have to be relaiable and the realtion to the students has to be in a good balance (not to near and not to far away. The knowledge of a teacher should also conatin pedagogik, not just the subject.

In my opinon many teachers thesedays dont know much about pedagogik.They studied their subject for many years,so they know very well WHAT they teach. But the HOW, they leraned in one year. And I think pedagogik is the most important thing in teaching students. Its the Way how you learn somebody something, that he can understand it. For example in math I get since four years very bad marks. My math teachers never told me what the problem is, what my mistakes are! So I have no chanve to improve myself. The job of a teacher is, that he never gives up his students, and that he does everything, that they learn much for their lifes. And to do this job well, they need to have a very big knowledge about pedagogik. Otherwise they cant know how you behave as a teacher.
