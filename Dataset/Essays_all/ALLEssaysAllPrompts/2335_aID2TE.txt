On the one hand it's right, that it is very important, that teachers relate well with the students. On the other hand it is the duty of every teacher to bring the most possible knowledge to the students. The best would be, if you have a teacher who can teach you a lot of new knolledge and who is relating well, too. If it's not possible that a teacher can do both, it depends on the student what is better. The most students are more motivated and interested of getting new knowledge, if they teacher is relating well. So you can say if you like the teacher, you often like his subject, too. But if the teacher is not teaching you well, the good relating with your teacher won't help you in your future (for example getting a place to study or getting a good job). So if he is not teaching enough knowledge, it is not good for the students. So teachers have to try to find a good solution of giving lesson where they relate well with the students and bring them a lot of knowledge.
For me it's much easyer to learn something with a well relating teacher. If i like the teacher I often like his subject, too, and if I like a subject I am motivated to be as good as possible and get the most possible knowledge. If i don't like a teacher I'm often not motivated to have some lessons with him and often dont learn that much from him.
In my eyes, the statement is right, and for me it's important to have a well relating teacher than getting the excellent knowledge, because even if he can give me a excellent knowledege, if he is not relating well, its much harder to get that excellent knowledge and you have to learn much more by your own.
