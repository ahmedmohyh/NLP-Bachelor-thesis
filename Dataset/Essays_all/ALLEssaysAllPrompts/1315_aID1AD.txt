1. Ofthen after television shows for kids there are special advertis towards young kids. But should that be allowed?
I think it should be allowed.
There are many comapanys for products for children and they need to advertis their product so they can sell it better. After televison shows for children, where many children are sitting in front of the television, its the best timing to do so. So they must use their chance to earn money. Eventhough children cant really think clearly about the advertising and you could see this as obuse, because they cant really complain. But I think they also want to see those adervertis because it is about products they like. So they must talk with their parents to "understand" this system.Children want their toys and you dont see many advertis for children anywhere else then in the televison after special television shows. The advertising system is everywhere and children must be confrontet early with this system, so they could learn more about it. If they didnt see any advertis before they become 5 they might buy just everthing they see in advertis, because they dont learn more about the system. Parents might have problems with specific advertising, because their child wants everything they see after their favourite televison show, but they have the control over their child and they must teach him/her how to live with those advertis. Maby you could see it as a problem, that children want to buy everthing they see and they dont really think about it, but if they werent confronted early ist will become a problem later on in their lives.
I think adverftising towards young children is exepteble, because they nned to be confronted with this system and they must understand how the world "works" and it ist teh exercise of their parents to teach them m ore about it. The parents need to teach them how to live with zhe advertising sytem.
