When the teacher relates well with the students and the students approach the teacher, the relation will get better. School is not just based on knowledge, because social aspects like the commuinication between teacher and the students are unevidible. 

The lessons will be boring after a while. The teacher have to show interest in the lessons. When the teacher is not motivated to teach, the students will be like the teacher. They will think, if the teacher has no interests, why should I listen to him.   

A teacher with abilities like this can also control the emotions of the students, so the psychological aspect plays also a big role. 

With an ability to relate can the teacher influence the abilities and the motivation of the students. The students concentrate themselves more and are more likely to listen to the teacher. 

Contra

The job of a teacher is to teach them his knowledge about a certain subject and not more. It is the fault of the students if they expect more. 

The students respect more a teacher with an excellent knowledge rather then a teacher who thinks, that the main reason, why the sutdents are here, are social competences. 

For me, it is dependant on the age of the students. Younger stundents will look more after a teacher with abilities to relate. Students in universities prefer teachers with more knowledge.
