First of all I believe that the ability to relate well with students is more importent than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt.
 
The teacher´s ability is very important, because it might be a help for students so they can learn better. 
Also it could be a help to make the lesson more interesting for the students and that would them help too.
But on the other hand the knowledge of the subject being taught is also very important, because the teacher can not teach something that he or she not knows.
However our class has a teacher who is really good in teaching lessons but she can not write that good so she do sometimes mistakes.
Therefore her lessons are very interesting and sometimes also funny and her jokes are also good so I can learn better in her lessons than for example in english. 
In addition to that teacher are also only humans and I think excellent knowledge seem a little bit impossible, because in biology for exemple are more information about a topic every year because some scinetists have for example invented a new medicine.

To put it in nutshells it is very important that a teacher knows a lot about the subject being taught but I believe excellent knowledge is  quite difficult. For me is the teacher´s ability to relate well with students more important, because it help the students more than excellent knowledge.
