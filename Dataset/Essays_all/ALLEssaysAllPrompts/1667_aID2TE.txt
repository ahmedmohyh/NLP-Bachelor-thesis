It is reasonable that a teacher knows what he is teaching, but this will not automaticly put the information into the students brains. They have to like the way of teaching, they will better learn if they like the class and the teacher. Of course it is not productive to give the students wrong information of a subject, while connecing to them . But it is also contraproductive to have a huge amount of information, really understanding it, but dont having the ability to teach the student. If the students are children, in primer school, it is even more important to understand them and beeing able to talk to them properly. The teacher has to be more of a psychologist or parent, than he is somebody giving information. Young children and teenagers can be very much effected by their suroundings and if they dont connect to the techer their grades will drop.
I think that teachers have to understand their subject, but even more they have to understand people, kids they are teaching. Therefore we have to have smaller classes too. But there is to much that a student wants to change in his schools system. More important than all the problems about food, starting time, rooms and equipment is the community forming in the class, and the head of this community is always the teacher. He has to connect to the students to teach them, or there will be a higher drop out rate and less lerarning in their classes.
