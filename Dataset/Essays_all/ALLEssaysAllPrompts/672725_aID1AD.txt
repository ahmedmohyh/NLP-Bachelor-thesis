Television advertising has more power than we think. The influence of seeing all those topmodels with the nice clothes and the perfect bodies, or seeing the hot guy with the newest iphone, is quite huge. But how does television advertising affect young children, precicly two- to five-year-olds? And how bad is it for those children to already stand under the great influence of television advertising that early?

When young children see television advertising showing bad manners or habits, they could likely start bevaing the same, which is bad for their developement. Children at the age of two to five are in a phase where they learn and develope just by imitating grown-ups. They copy movements, gestures but also words and phrases. So, it is important to make sure that children at this age don't see any television advertising that destroys their innocence and teaches them bad manners and/or words. 

We live in a time where adverts are everywhere. So it's quite important that we can deal with them, even if we don't like seeing them. If children don't get used to advertisement early, it might just get harder when they someday get to know television advertisement anyway. By letting young children see television advertisment right from the start, parents may be able to teach their kids how to deal with it earlier and also a bit easier. 

I think television advertising directed toward young children should stay allowed, because I think that it's important that children learn
