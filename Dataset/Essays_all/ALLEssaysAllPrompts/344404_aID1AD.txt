Television advertising directed toward young children is a very controverse toppic. There are many pros and cons.
On of the pros that can be mentioned is, that the kids can see what kind of toys there are but they are too young to go and get it so it's not like they go to the store and waste their parents' money on something unneccessairy. This shows that there is no actual damage caused by advertising directed toward young children. 
A con is that they might see something on TV, that they really like, but their parents can't afford it. If they go to kindergarden or daycare and see an other kid having this exact toy they might get jealous. 
On the other hand this can also be seen as a pro because it teaches children that they don't always get what they want, which also makes it more special when the finally get a toy. It also encourages them to maybe ask a friend, who has a toy they like, if they could play together, which can help to improve children's social skills.
The negative aspect to this is that childeren with rich parents, or spoiled children in general, might have it easier to become popular because they have all the "cool stuff" the other kids want. But again, this is only directed to children from the age two to five and kids that young don't have an exacty defined social order like older people do.
The most important positive aspect for me though is definitely, that if a kid sees an advertisement on TV that leads them to do something else but just sitting around watching television all day, it definitly influences the kid positively.
All in all I can say that I don't think TV advertising directed toward young childeren is not needed to be forbidden. It is the parents' decision if they want their kids to watch TV and see those advertisements or not. Even though I can't see a real advantage it also doesn't cause any damage.
