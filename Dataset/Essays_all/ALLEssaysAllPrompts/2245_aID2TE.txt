In the following text I want to discuss the question whether a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
First of all it is of cause important that the teachers ability to relate with students is well because the students like the teacher more and so they would listen more to the teacher. Furthermore it is easier to follow the subject if you like the teacher. But if the teachers ability to relate to the students is too good they wouldnt respect him any longer because they see him more like a friend than like a teacher. On the other it is also very important that the teacher have an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching because you are going to school to laern something and when the teacher doesnt know anything about his subject he is wrong in the school. Also the teacher is a person of respect and if he doesnt know anything or just a little bit of his subject he would not get much respect of his students. In addition to that if the teacher cannot answer questions because his knowledge is not good the good relation to the students give him also not more knowledge. Moreover you go to school to learn something and not for the reason of meeting friends and normally a teacher would not be your friend. But of cause on the other hand it is important the teacher has well relation to the students because if the students hate the teacher they also would not listen to them or just because of they are scared of the teacher.

All in all I think that the teacher first of all should have a excellent knowledge of his subject but also he shoeld have a relativ good relation to the students. In addition to that I think that the relation should not be to good because than the students would see the teacher more like a friend than like a teacher and so they would not respect him like a teacher or a person of respect who he is.
