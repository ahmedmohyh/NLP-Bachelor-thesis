Children can be manipulated easy. If an adult or an other person tells them something they believe it. They ask but they don't think they just believe it. Childrens want to learn about the world. So they ask a lot about random topics. It isn't good for them if they get false informations because they won't think about it if it is false. They think it's right because they think it is always right what other older people are saying. They think we know it better.

But it is hard to say that television advertising is bad for the children. It's all about the kind of information the television is telling. If it is about a shampoo advertisement it won't damage the children. They won't care about topics like that it isn't interesting for them. If it is an racist advertisement, like the shampoo cleans a black man and he gets white, we can't tolerate that. The children won't really think about it but in the backest corner of his brain, he could think black people aren't beautyful. 

Advertisements are made by Adults. The advertisements aren't a big problem. It is just about the person who makes the advertisements. If he wants to make racist advertisement he can make racist advertisement. There are a lot of people you can't understand why they are doing this. But not all kind of advertisements can be send out in televisions. There are rules and nowdays nobody can make advertisement like that, while you are saying one thing is better then the other. So I think television advertisement aren't bad for childrens.
