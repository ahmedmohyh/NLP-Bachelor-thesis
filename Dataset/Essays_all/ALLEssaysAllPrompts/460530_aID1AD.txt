Television adversiting is often discused because there is too much of it or it's just unsuitable. This discusion is concerning small children too. Should they be affected by television advertising.

On the one hand television advertising can be seen as a part of the child's learning process. The child has to make contact to his environnement because then it can grew up and face to those problems itself. If this learnig process is skipped at low age, there will be more serious and wide problems in the future.
So television advertising is an opportunity to learn and control oneself but on the other hand it can try to manipulate the the grew ups. In fact this is a serious problem which faces parents too. What should they do if their children ask for presents they see at televison all the time. 
But television can be used as a source of informations. From this point of view it can give useful informations about different products what makes the choosing of presents easier.

In conclusion television advertising can be seen as an opprtunity to learn and to get informations but manipulation of children has to be seen too. In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.
