I am convided that a mixture of both aspects are neccessary, in order to garantuee a successfull teaching.
While it sure is important to be close to his pupils/students, the main goal is the transferation of knowledge, instead of being a good "buddy" for your students. It sure is never wrong to feel with his students and know about their ordeals and problems, but I believe there should be a certain amount of distance between teachers and students. It is important that a teacher is still an authority person and remains in a "neutral zone", in order to maintain his objectivity and seriousness. The teachers job is to prepare his students for higher school levels, university or simple their later life and thus has to transfer as many knowledge as possible, instead of permanently  trying being close to his students and accepted by those. School isn´t an institution of only happy and unproblematic relationship, students have to learn to deal with more or less "complicated" teachers, different personalites and simply authority. Instead of pressing a teacher to relate well with his several dozen students, it would be much easier for twenty people to relate to one single person. 
If a teacher tries to much to be accepted by his students and takes his teaching not serious enough, he is much more likely of being manipulated by his students. I already witnessed a teacher, who was really liked by most classmates, but his style of teaching wasn´t taken that seriously any more and many students tried in preventing him from making serious teaching. 
I also believe that a teacher who knowns extremely much about a topic and really enjoys talking and teaching about it, is more likely to convince his students and spreads information much better.
