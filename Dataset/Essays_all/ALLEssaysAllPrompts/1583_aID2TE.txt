Many young students complain about the bad knowledge of their teachers and that they do not feel well prepared for their following exams or even for their future. But is the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught even that important or is the teacher's ability to relate well with students the key to success?

Teachers are having one job: Giving their knowledge to the students. So knowing everything about the topic or the subject being taught is more important than everything. If the teacher is unsure or is giving wrong information, the students, who trust the teacher, remember and learn these wrong things.
In addition the students come to school to learn something and to be prepared for their future and not to get friend with the teacher. So even if they like their teacher or have a good relationship with him but the teacher is unable to teach the important things, the students will not learn anything.

On the other side, a good realtionship between students and teacher is important for a good atmosphere in school. It may motivates the students and they like to come to school because it does not feel like a need but is fun.
And if they have fun in school they get the things that are teach easier and will remember them better. Good situations or time you spent with friends and where you had fun are used to stay longer in someones head than situations you were in a bad mood.
Moreover, if the teacher relates with the students he cares for them and wants them to do their best. So he is preparing is lesson maybe more interesting for the students or helps them to understand things.

In conclusion, my opinion is that a good relationship between students and teachers is a little bit more important that the prefect knowledge. If the teacher is having an excellent knowledge but cannot give it to the students he is worthless. Making school and the lessons fun is a much more efficent way to teach something because it will be remebered longer.
