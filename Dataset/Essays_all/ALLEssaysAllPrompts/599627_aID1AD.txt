Television advertising can be very diverse. It always depends on the advertisement itself. If the advertisement contains any possibly vulgar footage, it should not be allowed under any circumstances.Young childern, especially between the age of two and five years, should not be seeing those types of advertisements. What also shouldn't be allowed is any type of vulgar or even rude language. They can learn the language very fast and as a result even use it themselves. And of course advertisements with any type of sexual content should be strictly forbidden. For exampe advertisments for condoms or sex toys. Young children should not be seeing advertisments of that type at their age. Now all the other advertisments, like for instance a car advertisment, can be seen by young children. They don't really harm anyone and children of that age are not intrested in buying a car anyways so they won't be affected. Also food advertisments or advertisments for cleaning tools of any kind, like for example a toothbrush or soap to wash the dishes, can be allowed. They don't really harm anyone and might even be interesting for the parents. The only advertisments which might give the parents a headache would be toy advertisments. There's the possibility that the children see the toys on television and start asking for them until the parents finally decide to buy them. But apart from robbing the parents money, toy advertisements aren't really harming anyone so they can be allowed.
In my opinion the television crew might want to sort out the advertisements a bit better so that the parents are able to leave their children in front of the television without having the fear of them possibily seeing any vulgar or rude content.
