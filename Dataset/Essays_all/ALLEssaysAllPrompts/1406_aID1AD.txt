Everybody already watched TV. It's normal and natural that people want to be (unterhaltend) and amused. But children in age of 2 to 5 sometimes watch to much the TV. But why?
Maybe the perents need some free time or have to work on something and that's why they let them watch the TV.

Children in this age can watch the TV. It's not unhealthy or something like that but you have to regular it. Otherwise it will be an addiction and that could be "unhealthy". They won't make some new friends because they are just at home alone.
In this age, it's betterwhen children play in the garden with friends. Children have a very big imagination and they will loose it with the age. That's pretty normal but in this age where it's possible and that simple to imagine some cool games with friends they have to do it and let theire imagination free ;)

But the TV is not only bad for children. They also can learn from the TV. Some series are quiet intereseting and helpful. An example is "Galileo".

My opinion is that every family has to decide for themself, but I think that it's better when the children play in the gardenwith friends or play society games. But when they are watching once or twice a week the TV it's ok and it will not have any bad influence on the children. Sometimes watching TV could be a (Belohnung) for the children.
