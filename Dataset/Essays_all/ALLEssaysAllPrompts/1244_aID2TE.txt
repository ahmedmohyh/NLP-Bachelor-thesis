In the last few weeks one important topic has often been discussed. Whether the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowlegde of the subject being taught or not. 
On the one hand, when a teacher does not know his or her subject right it's hard for them to teach it. If they don't understand it themselveds they won't be able to explain it understandable to their students which is a big negative impact for both parties.
But on the other hand, if they get their subject perfectly but can't relate to their students at all the explanation may be too hard to understand and children won't get it either. Both ways lead to a negative relationship. Many students struggle with teachers they don't understand which leads to bad grades and frustration.
When students have personal problems they are mostly allowed to go to the teacher and ask them for a hint what they could do about it. They trust them and want to be taken for real. If a teacher is not able to relate to her or him it can come to misunderstandings between the teacher and the student wich could make the last one feel even worse with her or his problem.
In my opinion, teachers must be able to do both. The topic you are teaching has to be understood at least good enough to give it to the students and answer questions. And you have to like teaching them that you try to understand them if they are in a odd mood and need someone to talk or someone to explain it even one more time than you wanted to explain it. If you just have one of the characters, being a teacher is not the right job for you.
