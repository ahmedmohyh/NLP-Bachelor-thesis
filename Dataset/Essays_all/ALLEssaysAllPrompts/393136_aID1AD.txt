No i disagree with that statement. I think it schould be vorbidden to show TV advertisments to young children. I think young children shouldnt be confronted with our unhealthy consum habit. The influence of the media should start as late as possible. if it starts to early they will become adicted to media like smartphones etc. I think smal children shouldnt watch TV at al because i think it has a bad influence. Smal children should rather go out and play  with theyr friends or theyr parents. I think children shouldnt be influenced by stuf theyr parents wont buy them ore what might loock cool but actualy just sucks. At least children should be freed of anoying TV advertising if they must watch TV.  

TV advertising is crap no mather who it afectes ore whos it derected towards.
