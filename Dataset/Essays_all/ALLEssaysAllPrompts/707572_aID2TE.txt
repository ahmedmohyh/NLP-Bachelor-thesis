Most people have had at least one teacher in their life whom they really didn't like. Normally this is the case when the ralation between a student and a teacher isn't going very well. Often the grades of a class or a single student suffer because of this.
If a teacher can relate well with his students, they are more likely to enjoy attending school and will probably pay more attention to the lesson. But is it actually more important for a teacher to have the ability to relate well with his students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
In my opinion this isn't the case. If a teacher is not able to teach what he's supposed to be teaching tohis students he's just not doing his job. Surely it is great, when a teacher has a good realationship with his students. By this, he can inspire and motivate them to learn more about a certain subject, his subject. But if he can't explain all this stuff to the students it will probably not be very helpful in their future. 
But it should also be said that this doesn't mean that he has to know every single, small detail about the subject. Still he has to know, what he's talking about snd be able to explain it to his students.
However, it may be more interesting and enjoyable with a nice teacher, who has a good relation with his students, but if it comes for the future of the students, he should probably be able to teach them the subject as good as possible as well.
