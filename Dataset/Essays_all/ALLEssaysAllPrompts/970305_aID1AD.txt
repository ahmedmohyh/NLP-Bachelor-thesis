Many people agreed with the statement that Televisoin advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. But there are also some people who disagrees with this statement. What are the arguments for letting children watch televison advertising and what arguments are there for not letting them watch televison advertising?

I think one raeson why children shoulden't see television advertising ist that children in the age from two to five are really easy to ipresionate and to maipulate. So if they make a very impressionate advertising for barbies or other toys, the children want to have those things. The parents will have the problem, because they can't buy everything that their child sees in the television. 
On the ther hand we can also say that the children might learn something from those advertisings. Maybe they can learn new words, and expend their language.
But the advertising can also have a bad influence on the children, beacause when they see a person or the hero of the szene, and they wan to act like them. So they began to imitate the character that they have seen, beacause they were really impressed. 
But the characters of an advertising can have also a good influence on the children too.

In my opinion children in the age from two to five shoulden't watch television anyway. They should go out and play with theitr brothers and sisters and not sitting on the couch and watch televison. I don't think that television isn't bad in general. For people who are older, I think that watch televioson can be a good way to relax or to learn something for exaple in docomentarys.
So I agree with the staement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
