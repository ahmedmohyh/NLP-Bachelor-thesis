On the one hand, it is important for teachers to know the stuff they teach. But there is something more important then knowlegde. The teacher has to teach the student and transfer his knowledge to him. But the teacher could be the most knowledgebal person on the whole planet earth, if the student can't understand what the teacher is trying to say it is all useless. I had for example a techer who propably knew her subject, wich was math, very well, but in the class there was barely one who understand what she was trying to teach us. So the teacher must know how to relate with the students. He must know how they can easily understand what he is trying to say. So he must relate very well with the students. But it is also not convinient, if the teacher doesn't have any knowledge of the subject. Then, even if he can relate easily with the students there is nothing the students can learn. So it is both important to know the subject that is taught well enough, but to also can easily relate to the students. 
So in conclusion I personally think, that it is slightly more important to relate well with students, than to have an exelent knowledge of the subject, so I agree with the statement.
