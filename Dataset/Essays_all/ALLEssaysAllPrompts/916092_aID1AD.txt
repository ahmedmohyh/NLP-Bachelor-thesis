I disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. I think that parents can not avoid advertising while they are watching television. The children should not be kept in their rooms just to not see advertisings, such as most of the parents will not stop watching  television or, as an alternative, will not only watch it at night time. Anyways, who controls if the advertising is directed toward young children? Also, the companies would lose a lot of money by deleting those advertisings and it would be bad for the economy.

I would rather say that some advertisings should only be shown after a specific time, as example after 9 PM. A lot of sexualized scenes are shown which should not be seen by children.
Some other advertisings, which contain aggressive contents, or those who could afraid children, should be prohibited. Children often do not understand their meanings or interprete them differently. This can be very traumatizing or even damaging for their brains. I would say that children can not difference between realistic and unrealistic scenes. Later on they may have a different understanding in the world and have obstacles in life which were forced by those experiences.

But a fact is that the television and also advertisings belong to the new, technologic world. If television advertising would be prohibited, you would have to prohibit all advertisings such as those on the smart phones and computers. It would not make sense to only prohibit it on the television. For me, it does not make sense either to only prohibit it for children aged two to five. A six year old children is still very young and advertisings can also have a bad effect on them. Parents should be responsible for their children and decide by themselves, if advertisings should be seen by their children.
