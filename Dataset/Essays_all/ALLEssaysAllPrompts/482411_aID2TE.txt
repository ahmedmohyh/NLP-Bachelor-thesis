Is it more important for a good teacher to relate well with his students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject he toughts?
It's not easy to say what is more important. It think, a teacher needs to have some of both. But what does he needs more? The fact that students who like theyr teacher prefer to attempt a subject to another subject that is taught by a teacher they don't like is true. But how is it about the knowledge?

For example, i have a teacher who's knwledge about the suject is very good, but the personal way, the way he treats the students and explains the themes is not very good. As a result of this, me and my class mates don't like to vistit this subject. 
As an opposite of that teacher, i have another teacher who's knowledge of the subject isn' really good, but the way he relates with the students is very likable. In this case it's that some students really like having lessons by this teacher and some don't.
Last but not least, there is a tird type of teacher I have. The one that has a great knowledge about his subject and who is also able to relate very well with near all of his students. It's kind of obvious that the whole class likes to be thought by this teacher. No matter if they like the subject it's self or not.

If you think about the arguments, you come to the solution that a good teacher as to have a good knowledge about his subject and is also able to relate well with his students. So none of the two things is more important than the other one.
