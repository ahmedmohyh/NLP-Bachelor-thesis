Should advertising in the television be allowed for young children or not?
Advertising for young children should be allowed because it´s the excercise of the parents how often and how long a two to five year old children should watch TV. If this advertisments are especialy for the children like advertisments about new dolls ore playmobil tractors there is no argument why the children shouldn´t see this. Of course the kids want to have these stuff later but even this is the decision of the parents if the children will get this or not. But there are even things that are not very good for young children. But often the advertisment on the children chanals are not bad for them. 
If you let the kids alone with the TV and they can change the chanal that is not good because maybe they get some advertisment from the new horror movie or stuff like this. It´s a pitty that you can´t watch TV without advertisment but when the children watch series on Super RTL or KiKa and so on there is not much advertisment and only between the different series. 
In my opinion Television advertising directed toward young children is okay because as the parent you have to decide when the children can look a film or there favourite series. When especialy the very young children don´t look too much TV and advertisment it´s okay. But it is very important that they even play in the garden or with theire brothers or sisters.
