There are a lot of teachers with no ability to relate with their students, wich makes the lessons and the time they spend with the teacher for them pretty hard. If a theacher can't relate to his students it makes also the communication very difficult. The teacher probably want or mean something totally different in a situation then his students, but because he can't relate to them, he doesn't understand the students side. Even if, for example, the students have a great idea, the teacher won't be able to encourage them or inspire them, because in my opinion, if a teacher can't relate well to his students, then the students also won't or didn't want to relate well with the teacher.
On the other hand are there so many teacher, wich have a great relation with the students, but are extremly unable to teach their subject properly. Some of the teachers are like ''friends'' with their students. I think mostly outside the classroom. But when they have to stand in front of a class it's really difficult for them to find the wright words. Also it might be a little difficult to have the students attention and also respect, if a teacher is so close to his students.
Overall I think a teacher needs to find a good mixture of both. That means, that he should be open with the students and at least try to realate well with them, but he also should have the ability to be a good teacher in the classroom. In the end a students is in school to learn new things and not to be the teachers friend, so I believe that for me it's more important to have a good knowledge in your subject as a teacher, but, and that's very important, to explain your knowledge in a good and clear way to the students.
