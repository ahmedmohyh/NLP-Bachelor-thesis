The reason why kids have to go to school is actually that they learn and get new knowledge to maintain the life when they work or to get a good basis for studying at an university. So it's important for the principal to choose excellent and intellectual staff, but we all agree that sometimes they haven't got an easy job with teaching teenagers. I think it is more important to teach them a wide range of new knowledge than to relate really well with the students. 
The students will have more benefits when they were taught with excellent knowledge, because when the professor knows his subject really well, he could also answer questions easy and he would be able to clear out any missunderstanding. As an example at the end of the Gymnasium all have to do the same mathura, so these students who had a good teacher won't have to do much for preparation and will do also better as these students who had nice, but incapable teacher.
On top the teacher hasn't got the job to be a friend. His job is to teach the students new stuff that they pass the graduation exam and even to prepare them for the university or something. Most of the students have got their own squad to hang out, so they don't need a teacher to be their friend.
On the one hand the nearly-grown-up are savage and participate more in class when they like a teacher, but on the other hand when the teacher says things that aren't completely right, the students will be confused and won't do well on the following test. But the teacher has the power in his hand and could punish these students who don't attend the class or disturb the lesson with bad marks and they will be surely more quiet.
In conclusion I think that is much more important to support a student in form of knowledge and not in psychological ways. But the teacher mustn't terrorize his students, he has to be fair and intelligent.
