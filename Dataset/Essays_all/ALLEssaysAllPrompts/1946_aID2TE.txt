The statement "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught" gives a lot of important aspects about this theme which i will show in the following text.

First there is to say that it is always important as a teacher to come along with the own students and to treat them well so they wouldn`t be afraid of the lessons. 
Every theacher should show respect to the students and should be fair to everyone, he or she shouldn`t have favourites. If a teacher is good to the students, the stundents would be also good to the teacher, and this is from my point of view one of the most important aspects to have good school lessons.

But on the other side there is the aspect of the knowledge. Every teacher has to know enough about the subject he is being thaught so that the students are able to understand everything right and learn a lot from  him or her, so they are able to write good exams and get a good and valuable mark. 
If the teacher can`t tellt the students right stuff or has to look up always things which the students ask, they will get bored and lost the interest to the subject. In some cases, the students will also make fun about the teacher and this would be bad for the relation of them both.

In my opinion, there should be a way in the middle. The students just work good if the teacher is nice to them and can relate well with everyone. Furthermore he should even know the basics and maybe a little bit more about his thaught subject, so he can work good with the students. No teacher has to know everything, but as much as it would be enough to let the students understand the subject.
