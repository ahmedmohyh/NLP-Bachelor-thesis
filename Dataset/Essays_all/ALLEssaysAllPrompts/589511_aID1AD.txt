Advertising in general is a very manipulative Action. Companies use human weaknesses to their advantage when making an advertisment. Now, children below the age of five don't have any experience with manipulative strategies of companies. Therefore it is in the companies biggest interests, to direct their advertisment to the most naive crowd. But is it fair to manipulate adults through their children.

I haven't got anymore Ideas therefore the remainder of this text will be about an amazing vegetable: The carrot. Normally when you encounter a wild carrot it is surprisingly orange. One might not expect such a pure colour in the wild, but nevertheless there it is. Carrots can be grown in practically every environment suitable for growing plants. For example do not recommend searching for a carrot in the antarctica. I'm afraid you wouldn't be rewarded with what you desired to find. Actually there is a slim chance you might end up in the horrendus fangs of an icebear. Carrots can also be found in more urban areas, where there is no sudden danger of a  icebear-attack. Also you don't need to trouble yourself with the freezing temperatures of the antarctica. And at last in urban areas there are carrots contrary to the southern icecap of the marvelous planet earth.
