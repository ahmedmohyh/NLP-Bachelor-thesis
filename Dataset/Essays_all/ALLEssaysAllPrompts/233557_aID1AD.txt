While watching TV, we also have to watch television advertising. These advertisments often speak to a certain target group which is most likely to buy the product. Speaking of young children as a target group, we must think of their innocence instead of only gaining money.

Firstly, it is important to mention that young children's life experience is very small compared to adult's. In other words: Most children aren't able to differ between real interest in a product or simple manipulatin caused by the advertisment. Which means they could become advertising victims and get the unrealistic need to buy a product.

On the contrary, the ones who actually buy the product are adults. And adults should have got enough life experience and responsibility to say "no" to their kids when they want to buy something completely unnecessary. On the other hand: If parents become the "bad guys" who don't buy their children happiness - because of television advertising - this state has to be considered as highly sceptical. 

However, most television channels only exist because of advertisments. And they must advertise for the specific target group that watches them. If we stopped allowing television advertising directed towards young children, especially children channels would fade out. As not many grown-ups watch them, they have to direct their advertising towards children. And if they couldn't, they would either stop existing or become pay channels. And pay channels is surely not what we want.

As a result, it is very likely that free children channels will stop existing if advertising directed towards children becomes illegal. However, it is morally not acceptable and we should kill it. Burn it with fire! And make it extinct! (Sorry.)
