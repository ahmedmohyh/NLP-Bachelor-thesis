Advertisement is something we are surrounded with all the time. Most of the time we don't even realize it but we remember a lot of it unwillingly. Advertisement influences us and particularly our decisions what and how much we buy. Should it be allowed to influence young children from age two to five through television advertising to such a degree?

First of all, the directing of television advertisemnet towards young children would make sense from a economic point of view. Children of that age can be influenced easily by a happy jingle, a speaking animal and vibrant colours. They could try to get their parents to buy the advertised product.

But secondly there is the ethical point of view: is it okay to use children of a very young age to get people to buy your products? Are the children getting instrumentalised for an extremely selfish cause of making as much money as possible?

The question is on the other hand, how many children of that age even watch television on a regular basis. I would guess a lot of them are allowed to watch a kids program or a movie from time to time and don't get to see a lot of advertisement on television. Therefore the advertisement could not do a lot of harm and there would be no need to have any restrictions.

All of the above considered, I think that children of a young age should not be seen as a way of selling your product. They are too young to assess things objectively and to make up their own minds. And even if they don't watch television and don't see the advertisement, they could still hear it or be influenced through other media. There is no need to direct the advertisement directly towards them they will come across it anyway.
