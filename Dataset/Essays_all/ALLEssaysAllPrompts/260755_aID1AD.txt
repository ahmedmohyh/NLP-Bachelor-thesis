Its not good because children are very easy to manipulate. So they're going to ask theyre parents if they could have the thing, that has been advertised. When the parents don't buy the stuff, the children will be angry and it results into an argue. In a few situations, it could be, that the parents just agree, so that the children stop crying. This means it's good for the company, that sells the stuff, because they make more money, but it's not for the parents. 

But this argument can also turned into an argument that's against this statement, because the children could learn, that they can't always have what they want if the parents persist and don't buy them the toys. So this would be good for them, because they learn a lesson for life. But it could also be a good thing, because, for example, when it's christmas time and the parents don't know what they should buy for theyre kids. The kids will see something that they like on Television and they will say to their parents, that they like to have this thing for christmas. So the parents know now what to buy. 

I would disagree with this statement, because, in my opinion, sometimes it could be hard for the parents and the advertising can manipulate children easy, but it depends on the kind of advertising. Most of the advertised things for kids are just toys, so its not a bad thing. And the children could learn something from it. I don't remember any kind of bad advertising for kids, that manipulates them really.

So my conclusion is that Television advertising toward young children schould be allowed.
