Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television advertising has a really big impact on children. Mostly the television advertising directed toward children shows a situation where other children play with or use the advertised thing. In the advertising everything seems to be great. Children think, if they have the advertised thing, their life would be like the one shown on TV. But as soon as they got this thing, they realise that it isn't as funny as they had thought, they start to ignore that they had it and they want to have the next thing.
If Children would like to have the advertised thing they had seen in TV, they ask for it all the time and the parents have to say strictly no or if they aren't that strictly, they will buy it. But if they start to buy one thing, they will have to buy a sencend thing and so on. In the end, it's going to be a big amount of money they spent for these things and the children aren't happier with these things. That the parents don't get in such a situation, they can't let their children watch TV, but in todays time, this is really difficult.
In conclusion, the children and the parents don't profit from the advertising and they just waste money for something they don't really like a long time. The best thing to do is not to allow television advertising.
