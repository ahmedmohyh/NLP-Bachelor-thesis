Firstly, you have to ask yourself what is it that makes a good teacher a good teacher. Even though a charismatic teacher is a very nice thing to have, as that would make you listen more, if he's uneducated in what he wants to teach it isn't really helping. You could listen to every word that teacher says but you still wouldn't learn anything. On the flipside, if you have a teacher that is a genius in his certain subject but he is just so boring that you dont want to listen at all, he's not good either, as you wouldn't be able to soak up his knowledge. I think everyone agrees that a teacher who can do both would be the best possible option but that only happens really rarely.
I myself have only seen one teacher who was good at relating with the students while maintaining a high knowledge about the subject. That teacher was my geography teacher at the Bezirksschule Aarau. I still know a lot of the things she taught us about volcanos and the montains and so on. But I think only about one percent of all the people teaching a certain subject are like this, and can do both. I have encountered even more teachers that could do neither of those things. That teacher was very boring and clumsy. He would always come too late and if you asked him a question about the stuff he teaches he wouldn't be able to answer it. I have also encountered multiple teachers that were only one of those things. In the end it doesn't matter if he's charismatic or educated well.
But I myself would prefer a teacher that can relate with the students over one that just knows his stuff. A teacher like that can make you interessted in certain things that you woudn't be interessted otherwise. That teacher could make you want to learn more about the thing he teaches even though he isn't that educated himself. I can understand if someone else may like a teacher more that knows his stuff but is kind of boring. I just don't like boring teachers.
