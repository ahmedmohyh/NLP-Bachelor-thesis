The influence of a teacher on his students is certainly very important. He has the goal to transfer his knowledge to this of the students and so to prepare them for the future life. But what which factores are important to be a good teacher? Are you automatically a good teacher just because you have a huge knowledge or is it more important that you have a well connection to your students?

The student has to be teached by someone who knows much about what his subject. Also it`s important that he has the ability to transfer his knowledge  
On the other side it`s even more important that the teachers likes what he does. He should have built a connection between him and his students so he can reach them with what he tells. When the students like to hear what the teacher is telling they learn much more then if they are demotivated. 

You could have the smartest guy as a teacher with the biggest knowledge ever existed if he can`t interact with the stundents and is unable to explain them important things the teacher is useless. The best would be to find a teacher who is in a good balance between knowledge and the ability to relate well with the students.
