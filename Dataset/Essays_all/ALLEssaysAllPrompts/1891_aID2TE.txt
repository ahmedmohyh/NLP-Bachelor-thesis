People say that teachers who relate better with the sudents are more important than teachers with an excellent knowledge. But is that really better or is it differently better?

To relate well with the sudents a teacher should know the kids he educates. School should be used more as an education center where also the teachers can help the pupils who got problems. As the teachers were studying, they also had to learn about how to deal better with pupils. For example every school got a teacher that is available for every pupil who needs help. If a class got a kid that is stressfull or is hard to deal with, the teacher can speak with that kid and maybe calm it down. This would be better for the whole class and the class would have a better atmosphere. But also very important is, that a teacher who relates better with the class, the pupils in the class are more willing to study, becuase of the better atmosphere.

But what if a teacher doesn´t know the knowledge of the subject being taught?
If a teacher isn´t well at the subject he teaches, he can´t teach professionaly. Pupils who are smarter than others need for example harder exercises. Even the lessons with teachers who got a good knwoledge are more interesting because they know much more and also can teach his knowledge better to the kids. Although if there is a teacher who has a good knowledge it doesn´t mean that he also can teach the subject perfectly to the sudents!

In general you can say that a teacher who combines both aspects would be the perfect teacher. But every argument has its own better and worse aspects. I agree that a teacher should relate better with the sudents because it is very important to relate well with the students because the lessons are much better then.
