In the 21. century it is normal every household to have a TV. If young or old, both classes like to watch it. But should television advertising directed toward young children from two to five be allowed or not? In the followimg Essay I'm going to point out some arguments for and against television advertising directed to young children.
Firstly it is unhealthy that young children watch TV a lot. So the television shouldn't get too much refered to the children, especially not to the very young. Children should play with their toys, instead of hanging on the TV and get more attached to it because of the television advertising. But in the other way, nowadays it's pretty normal, that everyone has access to the television and that little kids are also affected of it. It is just the revolution and nobody can do anything about it. 
Secondly television advertising that is only directed to a specific class of age, leads to less viewers. If there's only advertising directed to children aged two to five, the older people or teenagers will instantly turn off the TV. Whereas for the little children it is exciting to watch. But in the other way it shouldn't be a problem, because it has also many other advertising that isn't only directed to children aged two to five, but also older juniors or even seniors.
The last but not the least reason is that constantly watching TV and being attracted to it through advertising, influences the physical actions, which means that it is really unhealthy. In the other way it is still exciting to watch and for the moment, you forget all the other things and just enjoy watching tv.
In conclusion, in my opinion the arguments are pretty equal. But one day, when I grow up and have children, my children won't be allowed to pass much time in front of the TV. Thats why I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should strictly not be allowed. It influences not only their minds, but also their physical action.
