Should television advertising not be allowed to young children?
I agree with this statement, because the young children should not watch all the day television. The children need the television, when they watch it every day. I think that young children need real friends and not the television, where they doesn´t learn something. When the television make advertising directly to the children, they can´t make a social structure and be alone. The television want to make more shows, where the children can learn math or german, but this doesn´t help to learn it at a television show. Better is it, when the family and friends learn together with the children. I don´t know good things what a television is doing to humans. The television make it young children hard to live in the real world, when they watch all the day dump shows, only to become so more money.
