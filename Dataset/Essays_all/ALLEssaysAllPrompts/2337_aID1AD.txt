In the following text, I discribe you my own meanig to Televison for children. I the TV are also age attentions and when you look at this you make most right. But children have a chance to watch things, they not good for the children. In the TV is all day and all time any to see. Children can watch the hole day and this is very dangerous , because the children watch TV in the time, were athoere people play handball or some other thigs. 
When children look news at the Televion or documentions, it can be good for the children, because they know so more actually thing about the world and about the people. this can be very helply at the school or annywhere. 
Televions aren´t so important hwo school or sport, but it´s can be a small factor. At last Television is very different. There are many different programms and very different shows. Many of the shows and of the programms aren´t important, but some like a newstime or so are important in this time.And when the children watch the right things it´s very good for school and the knolge. I think it´s ok when children watch Tv, but the parent must controll the programs and the time.
