Is the ability to relate well with the students more important for a teacher than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
When the teacher is very dry and just teachs the students the subject without any humour then it would be a very silence lesson. The children would not like to go to school maybe they get stomach ache or headache in the morning before school starts. The children would hate school and maybe their parents will go to the school director and tell him that their children would like to change school. For example when my mother was little she had an mathematic teacher who was very strict. She had a good knowledge of the school subject which got taught but she could not relate well with the students. Once she said to five children who have not understand the homework:" For you five little children I would not explain it anymore." My mother got up every morning with stomach ache when she had a lesson with this teacher.
At the other hand when a teacher is very funny and thinks like his students the lesson could be very interesting. The children would like to go to school and they get no headache in the morning. They would stand up every morning being very happy.
I do not think that it is good for a teacher to just have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But I also think that it is not good for a teacher to just relate well with other students. I think a teacher needs to be funny and he has to have the ability to relate well with the students but I think he also needs to be serious and have an excellent knowledge of his subject. In my opinion a good teacher needs to find the best middlemass of both abilities. My english teacher for example is a very serious teacher who teaches you very much grammar and vocabulary but he can be funny too. The last lesson before holidays begin he often watches a movie with us.
