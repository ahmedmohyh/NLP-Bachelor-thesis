We are use to see advertising everywhere. Our society is consum driven and tries to make money of of anything. But is it moraly supportable to advertise towards young children?

On children's television channels are the commercial break as long as on channels directed towards adults.On one hand young children can not understand the concept of money (at least not utterly). And even less how capitalism works. So it is not fair to target children and make money of their parents.

I can ethically not support the television advertising directed towards young children.Eventough advertising towards children should be allowed, I think the age up to five years old should be excluded, due to the fact that they can not understand the concept of money and should not be confronted with the capitalistic greed. In the future it schould be prohibited to target advertising towards young children.
