In the following I am going to analyse if the relationship between student and teacher is more important than the knowlegde of the subject being taught in school.
This statement is very kontroverse. On one hand a good relationship with the students can be helpful. It is easier for them to listen to a person they like. They would work harder in the school. But on the other hand having not a good knowledge of the subject being taught does not help anyone. How do the students pass the exams when the teacher can not teach them right? It is nice if the students like him, but whom does it really help. Besides it would be easier with a teacher, who has an excelent knowldege, to write good grades. And with good grades it is easier to find a job.
In conclusion I think both is important. But an excelent knowledge is better than a good relatenship. It is more useful for the students and their future. Later if they want to find job, their grades in school are important and not how good the relationship with their teacher was.
