Television advertising should not be allowed toward young children. In the age two to five it is not that complicated to manipulate the children. They just see a picture of a new toy and they can not say no to them and cry all the time to have this toy untli the parents can't say no and the children get it. 
Maybe this is not the same way when the child is two years old. I think in this age the child can not say specific which toy they want to buy. If the toy is there and the child likes this it will play with it. I think in the age of five it is more complicate. 
But I think young children in the age two to five should not be allowed to watch television on their own. The mother or father of the child should be there or should define which movie the child can watch. 
So I think the parents can protect their children of television advertising but my opinion is in general that television advertising should not be allowed toward yound children. Because they can not do something against it. I think they are to young that they could not believe what people say. It is to simple to manipulate such young children that television advertising should be allowed. 
It is simple enough to manipulate us or adults and ways to simple to manipuate the children. 
So I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
