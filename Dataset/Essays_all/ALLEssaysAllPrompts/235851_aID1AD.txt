Small children running around on the playground in hot pants and having fun- stores like H&M use advertisement directed to children.But is that oversexualised advertisement or just advertisement okay? Should it be allowed to manipulate our small folks?

Children want what they see, it's in their nature. So it is a natural process to want all the things the TV provides to them- toys, clothes and candy. But this has a big influence on the rules of their parents. Now they are more or less forced to buy their kids things,that aren't good for their health or their behaviour in the future. Children strive things they wouldn't if there wasn't any advertisement.
Nevertheless, kids get to know all their possibilities they have. They get to know what's new on the toy-market or what they could do with friends and family. If their parents don't want to let them see advertisement, they could cut out the TV of their everyday life.

For me the big question is, if advertisement affects the children so hard, so they aren't capable of deciding and knowing if this is really something they want because they like it or if it's just something they want because they see it on TV. In my opinion advertisement is a big problem in our society. Not only children, even adults get manipulated by it and they are older and it seems like they should know what the purpose of the stores are. In conclusion: I am against TV-advertisement- for children and adults.
