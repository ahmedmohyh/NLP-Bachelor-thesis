"Mom, I'm bored, what can I do?"  "I don't know, why don't you go watch some TV?"

This is a conversation between a mother and her child which is quite normal these days. It is easy having children sitting on the sofa, watching TV all day and not doing any noise. You do not have to worry that your children get lost when they are in your living room instead of playing outside. You do not have to play with them yourself when they can watch easily TV. And why not? I mean, it is perfect when your children are not bored neither annoying neither communicate with friends or doing some sports.....Exactly. 
Children cannot make friends with anybody if they are just sitting on a sofa all day long and even if they have friends and they are watching TV together they do not learn social contact, they do not learn how to do a conversation. Furthermore when children do not move much when they are young they often get really unconcentrated when they get older, so they could have problems of paying attention at school. Moreover children could get health problems by watching TV all day long! It is not just that it is not good for their eyes, it is the fact that they can get really fat when they are eating without moving and doing some sports. And being fat is really, really unhealthy and also dangerous for children being bullied at school! 

Because of all those arguments, I think it would be a good idea to permit television being directed to children under five years. Nobody wants their children to get unconcentrated students or lonely and normally if people get children they also want to spend some time with them, right? I would even say that children under ten should not watch TV, because It is that bad. But most important is, in my opinion, that they do not get used to that consum of media that early. So that they could have enough time to get smart, sporty and healthy humans, which is definetly not possible while watching TV!
