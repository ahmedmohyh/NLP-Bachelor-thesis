On the one hand the teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important because it affects a good climate for learning. In my opinion it also leads to a larger interest into the subject. But on the other hand it may be that you learn less with a teacher which relates well because he tries to be friendlly and not to do extremely difficult tests.
But also a good knowledge is very important. If a teacher doesn't understand the subject well himself, we won't be able to explain it to his students. But it's not just the knowledge that is so important. The more difficult point is probably that you can explain the subject to the students, so that they really understand it and so that they learn something that will be useful in their life and in the future.
But I support the opinion that it is more important that a teacher has a good knowledge of the subject because only then he will be able to teach it to his students. And relating well is also important but I think that it is a question of time until a teacher learns that. Personally I had a French teacher who didn't relate well with the students because she did extremely difficult tests and very tough leasons but now at secondary school I am one of the best of the class probably because of my secondary teacher. So I think that for the life it is more important to have a teacher with good knowledge.
