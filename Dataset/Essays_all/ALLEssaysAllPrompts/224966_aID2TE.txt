Most people would say a teachers ability to relate well with students is really important. It sure can help if you can connect with a teacher on a certain level. You'd be able to overcome difficulties with your teachers help. But if the teacher has no kind of professionalism and has a low amount of knowledge it would  have a negative affect on the studens.

A teacher is an autority to helps us guide our lives in a certain direction, they should have a personal interest in what we can achieve. But they should always have a certain amount of professionalism and knowledge. The students should be able to ask for advice, not only in school related subbjects but also if they need help in their personal live,they should always be able to get through to our stubborn heads. But afterall the teachers should always have an autority role.

If a teacher relates with his students on a high level but isn't capable to teach them what they should know, he is of no use for the students and and the school, they would suffer without propperly knowing why. The students would see the teacher as a friend and not as a superior, an autority. The teacher wouldn't be able to step in in certain missunderstandings and the students wouldn't give them enough respect to work with.

A teacher should have a certain amount of knowledge. He has to teach the students what they should know and has to be able to prepare a students for what's coming. A teacher should be able to make a student understand even the most difficult things, so that the average students is able to understand everything and is prepared for their live. 

Teachers have an important role in the live of students. They help them to find the wright way in live. There should always be respect between a student and a teacher. Not only should the student respect the teacher but vice versa. So the teachers should have abilities in both directions.
