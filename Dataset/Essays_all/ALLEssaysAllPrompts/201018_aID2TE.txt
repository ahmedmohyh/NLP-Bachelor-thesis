I don't think so. In primary and secondary school it's in my opinnion right. Because there you get taught to get social with other people and work together in a team. For example a child in first class who was the whole time afraid of his teacher will never learn fast and efficent from her. If you make this experience so early you will remember this every time in your mind and you won't be 100 % at work. Because your mind is afraid. In secondary school you learn nothing very important and there's also more important to sociate well with your teacher. Because you need this for a normal job. If you go on high school then it's very important that the knowledge of the subject is very high. Also you don't see the same teacher the whole time. Normaly you have for every subject an different teacher. And if you go after high school to university, you will maybe never speak to your professor. So you have to be very intelligent and understand the subject. If you get a good level of knowledge in high school then you will have it easier to learn the new stuff in university. Also in this question it's very important to know is it the last school you visit bevor you start working? If yes then you have to be exelent in your subjet to get a job. The industry is looking for people with a good knowledge not for those which laughed a lot with their teacher in school. When i was in secodary school i had Latin. And i profit up to today from it. The teacher were very strict. But he was sometimes also cheerful with us students. I learnt a lot and i do profit more from him then the rest of the secondary school. So it wont give me something for live if my teacher would have sung a lot with me and thaught me nothing.
