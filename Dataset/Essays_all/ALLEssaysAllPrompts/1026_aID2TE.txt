Today, many students have problems at school. Their parents often think that the teachers are the problem because they wouldn't be able to teach their children appropriately. But is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of their subject? In the following I will comment on this question.

On the one hand, their knowledge is more important because the students go to school to learn for life. The sense of school is not having fun. That's why the teachers need excellent knowledge for teaching their students as well as possible.
In addition to that, it makes no difference, whether a teacher is able to relate well with students or not since the students are aware of the fact that they are at school to learn and not to have fun. So they are also able to learn when they don't like their teacher.
On the other hand, a teacher, whose students feel related to, is a better idol for them. They learn that being polite and friendly is important and necessary for life. 
Moreover,the students feel more comfortable when their teacher is able to build up a good realtionship with his students. When they have a nice teacher, they are more willing to learn what he teaches and that affects their grades and also their professional life.

In my opinion, both an excellent knowledge and the ability to relate well with students is important for the quality of the lessons. The knowledge is the condition for being a teacher and teaching students and a good relationship with students is the condition for the ability of the students to learn the things they get teached.
