If a teacher has the ability to relate well with his students, they learn better and with pleasure. That's important. The learning makes more fun and the students trust him, so they learn faster and with more entusiasm. Also the things he taught them is more present, than a teacher, who taught his students just facts without any emotions and pleasure. On the other side it's important, that students learn wright facts and can use them in their lifes. That's what an education should be. A place to learn for life, not to learn with pleasure or with fun. And surely not to have a good relation with the teacher. It's like a job. Students are workers and for example workers in a rafinery there has nobody  a good relation with his boss. You just have to work for him and you earn the money. But now is learning with a good related teacher  better learning or is it just faster and the students learn just wrong facts ?  The other question is: How important is what the students learn? Can a teacher without excellent knowledge give lessons without any remarkable effects on the students carrier?  In case of a lower step of education it is possible to learn them facts with fun and entusiasm. Thats a good thing to do for a teacher with a good relation with it's students but I think higher steps of education, for students, it's far more importent that the teacher has an excellent knowledge. It's important for their carrier and for their time in an universery. I disagree with this statement for me an excellent knwoledge counts more than a good relation with students. In the futur it will help me more than a good old friend-my teacher.
