Young children are easy to influence, these kids are not capable of making there own opinion. Businesses can easily take advantage of them, for example they can make an advert on toys and bring it on TV. The little ones want those toys now and parents have to buy them. I really don't think that there are benefits when television adverts are just made for the younger ones, they can't buy things themself, so parents would haveto buy all those things, and honestly which parents buy everything they see on TV? So the adverts should be directed toward the parents, they are the ones with the money. I guess, parents are responsible for their children and should make enough rules, so that the kids don't get everything they see on television or the parents make rules on the limited use of the TV. In this way the advert should't have a big influence on these young kids, it would also be a really good lesson for them, they learn, that they can't have everything they see. So, I'm not really against the use of these adverts for young children, because the parents are the buyers. Companys should make the adverts for both parts, parent and childern, because in the ends its the decision of the parents what their kids get and which things aren't good enough for them. I think, parents nowdays are very picky which toys are good enough for their kids. Toys should have a learneffect on children and parents won't buy the first thing they see on television. So for me it's useless to make adverts just for children, the adverts should impress the parents and should show them the benefits of the advertised object. But companys may, see that a bit different than me.
