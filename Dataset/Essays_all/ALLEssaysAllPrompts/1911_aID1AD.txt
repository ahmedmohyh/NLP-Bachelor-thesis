In the following text I want to explain why children of the age between two to five may watch television advertising and how fast they could be addicted to them.
In my opinion children of the age two to five may watch television advertising because it influences the children not that much. In most cases the children do not understand the meaning of the advertisment. They only see a toy which they want and say "I want this so much mum can u buy it for me". And so it goes all that long. But sertent spots are not created for children this age. If the parents controlle that their children do not watch this kind of advertising it is not bad to let them watch television. Another point is that advertisment could be bad as well because it is controlled by the product which is presenting. Sertant products awake the feelings of addiction and childs this age can not handle this addiction (some adults also not). The television production desinged the advertisment very colorfull to get the attention of the children and the children react to this very easilie. To stop this addiction might be very hard, annoying and difficult because if a child save sertant advertisment it could not be delited. 
All in all I would say that advertisment in general is harmless to childs without any problems. But some spots are not that good for children. If their parents protect them for this kind of addicting advertisment they might be save. In this age children should not watch that much television.
