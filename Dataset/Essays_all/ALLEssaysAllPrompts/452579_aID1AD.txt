Children can't buy the Stuff without the parents. They just can go to them and say i want this, i want this. If the Parents don't want this thing they shoud not let the children watch tv. The adversiting is often also good for the parents for christmas or birthdays. they know what they can't buy the little kids so they are happy and also the parents are happy when they see the shiny eyes of the childrens when they get the Present they want. It's true that the children often gets angry if they don't get what they want. The adversiting get an effect on the little gets that they mean that they have to have this thing anf  can't life without that even it is just a toy. that can drive the kids crazy. And the parents often also get crazy about the kid so the buy the stuff and it doesn't matter if its is expensive or if it is cheap. They buy it just for calming the kid and that isn't the goal parents should do. the kids should learn that thy have to deserve a present not every day or any day. they should be happy when they get one once a year and not more.
