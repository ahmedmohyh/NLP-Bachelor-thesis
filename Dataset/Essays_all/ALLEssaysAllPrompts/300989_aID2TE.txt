I don't think we should watch at this in black and white. Is not good if he's a genuis in his subject and can't relate with his students but it doesn't get better if he's just a nice guy reading wikipedia articles. It's something between. The right mixture depends on the grade of the studens. A kindergarden teacher should be really nice but don't have to be a master in singing childsongs but a teacher at collegue should know his subject very well but don't have to be as nice as the kindergarden teacher. In higher classes the students, who really want to learn something will learn it irrelevant of the teacher's skills. But in the kindergarden the kids have to be motivated to learn something. A teacher ''on a different wavelengh'' is a good lifelesson because at some point in life we will have to work with somebody, who we don't like. Schools like the collegue do not just teach subjects like physics, math and history but also a life lesson in general. The problem is that some kids especially is they're younger their motivation will suffer from theachers who can't relate well with the sudents. The teacher should be in the right middle between the two aspects and the middle depends on the grade of the  class.
