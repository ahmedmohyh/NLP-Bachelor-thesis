Advertisings in general do occupy a big aspect in our daily lifes. There are uncountable forms of ardertisings and we are getting confronted with advertisings everywhere we go, at any time. Commeicials on television are very intense because they consume ones attenion by stimulating multiple humen senses, such as ones eyes and ears. Therefore children can be easily influenced by tv-commercials because they react according to their stimulatings and feelings. Advertisings on television which are specificially created to reach children, often include edits that are supposed to manipulate the young audience. Children are easy to persuade and are likely to believe false promisings that are used in advertings to sell a product. One problem of the manipulation is that companies do present an unrealistic image to children, so kids may start believe in things that dont't actually exist in the real world, beacuse they have seen it in a commercial. Parents do also suffer from the specialized advertisisings, beacuse children will beg their parents to by a certain product as long until they will either buy it ore have a mental breakdown. 
Even though that commercials for young children may cause some stress-situations or aren't very ideal for the kid's education, the advertisings on television should not be prohibited. Children should get used to commecials and learn how to deal with daily advertising as soon as possible. Parents also need to take the responsibility and educate their kids about commercals and the way how to react to them.
