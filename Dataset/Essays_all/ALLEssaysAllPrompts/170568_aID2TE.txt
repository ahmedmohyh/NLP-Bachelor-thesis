In my opinion it is important for an comfortable clima in the classroom, when the teacher has the ability to relate well with students. That makes it more easier to concentrate and does positively impact bigger progresses in the subjects. The students then have more sympathies for their teacher and the spirit is good. When I would not have any sympathies for my teacher, how am I then able to listen and what he says and work in his lessons? When students do not feel any connection with their teacher, the maybe have a kind of agression in them. And this is contra-productive, isn't it? 
But the main thing about school is not to have these good relations with your teacher! Me as a student, I agree that I do not go to school to save my human  values and things like this, I go to school to learn new things, to fill my backpack of knowledge. I want to reach my goals, and for that the teachers should be well prepared and should know their subject. That is the job of a teacher, as the name says. A teacher has to teach us in the best he way can do it. 

Summarized my opinion is that nothing of both options is better. I think the golden middle is the best way to tell my opinion. A good relation between teacher and his students, is shurely an advantage. But that advantage does not mean the world. The knowledge the teacher gives us should be correct and without incorrect informations. So I would not wish any of both options for me, but a mix of both would be the nicest and the most progressive combination, that every student would probably wish for him self.
