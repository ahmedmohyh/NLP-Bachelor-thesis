The education of a teacher contains next to the knowledge of the subjects also the psychologial aspects. The young men and women learn how to interact with children and learn how to react when the situation between two kids seems to escalate. But is the theoretic knowledge about psychologic details enough to create well lessons? In this essay I want to discribe the arguments and contras about having a better relation between children and their teacher than his knowledge of the subject he's talking about. 
Everyone knows that only very few kids can learn only by hearing the information from their teacher. All the other children need to create connections between the new information and the knowledge they have yet. It's clear that when a teacher can't help this children to connect things by relate with this young humans, he can't teach them his knowledge of the subject. 
But what's when the teacher has a great ability to relate well with the students but isn't interessed in the subject he's talking about? When the teacher don't want to create a good relation between him and his class? Such teacher's lessons aren't very interessing for the students and they loose their interest in knowledge. You can teach the students with this form of teaching, but the psychologial ascpects aren't very well in this relation. I think that you need to find a form of teaching which contains both knowledge and a great relation.
