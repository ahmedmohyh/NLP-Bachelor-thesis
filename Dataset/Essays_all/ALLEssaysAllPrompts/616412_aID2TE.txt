Do you know that feeling when your motivation for a subject is completely down? But have you asked yourself why this is? Is it because you don't like the teacher? Or you don't understand the subject? Exactly this we are going to look at. 

A teacher should be able to explain the subject in an easy way. Everyody should come along with the explanation. For example in chemics. When the teacher can't explain it in a way, that it is easy to follow, everybody will hate this tacher and the motivation for the subject gets down. So the exams won't be as good. Therefore a teacher should be able to relate to the class. 

When the relationship between the teacher and the class is good, the class will write better exams. This is because when you like a teacher you will automatically like the subject more. So the motivation for learning is higher as when you don't like the subject. We take the example with chemics again. If you are motivated to go into the chemics lessons, you will listen to the teacher and you can easy follow. Also you are more motivated to ask questions if you don't understand something.

To conclude the thing it is important that a teacher has a good relation to the class. I think when the relation is good, the teacher is also able to explain the things in a way that everybody or most of the class can follow. If they can't follow they wouldn't like the teacher. So it isn't as important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge, it's more important that the relation to the class is good, so the motivation for the subject is higher. But nobody is perfect. And so the teacher. And everyone has an other meaning aobut the subject.
