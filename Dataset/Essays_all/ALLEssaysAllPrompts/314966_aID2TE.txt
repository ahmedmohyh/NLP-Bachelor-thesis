What makes a teacher a good teacher? Sure he/she needs different qualities for example knowing how to handle with your pupils, making sure they can follow and do respect you and better getting along well. On the other hand a teacher has to know what he/she is talking about, can answer questions and help with difficulties. Better when a teacher is capable of doing both but if you have to choose one of those abilities... Which one is more important and why?
First of all: Getting along with the pupils is important. They have to trust their teacher because he/she is telling them a lot of things, which they have to believe. Its easier for children or youngsters or even adults to learn things from a person with which they symphazise. Its not something bad, more like a liking to them to obey the rules and making homework. Another important thing is that the teacher has to understand what the student knows, what he/she is asking or which exercise being too difficult. This understanding is the way of good teaching.
But that is clueless without the knowledge. The teacher has to know and understand many things in his/her subject and got to explain the relations to his/her students. Teachers should have the ability to response a difficult question from a pupil without looking it up. It gives the students a safer feeling about their teacher.
In conclusion it is important to have both abilities for a teacher. But if I have to say which one is more important I'd say it is the ability to relate well with students. A teacher who understands his students is more capable of helping them then a teacher who knows every detail about his subject (because the teacher could still look up for things he doesnt know).
