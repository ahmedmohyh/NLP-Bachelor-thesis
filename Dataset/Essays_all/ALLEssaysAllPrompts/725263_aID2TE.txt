In this essay we are talking about the question, if it is better to have a teacher with the ability to relate well with students or a teacher with an excellent knowledge? Is it both important or is it enough to habe only one of these two abilities?

In the primary, I think it is much more important to have the ability to relate well with students, because if the teacher can not explain it in a easy way, the students do not learn something. So the teacher can not bring his knowledge to the students.
In the secondary it is a bit different, here are both welcome, because in the secondary we are a bit older an understand now more. But I like more the teachers, who can explain well than someone who have his presentation and than you have to write an exam about that. But if the teacher, who can explain well, does not have any knowledge, it brings you also nothing.

I come to the end that it needs a bit of knowledge and also a bit the abiity to explain well, because if you have not both, it means that you can not explain but you would have something to explain or you can explain but have not anything to explain. A good teacher has both things and I think you have to have these abilitys if you are a teacher, other ways you are not a good teacher. But I agree with the statement, because a teacher have to communicate well with his students.
