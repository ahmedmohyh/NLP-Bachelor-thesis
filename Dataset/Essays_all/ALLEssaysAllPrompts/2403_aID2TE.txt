A teacher should be have a good relation to his students and should teach his subject good as well. But what is more important?
At first I give some arguments for this statement that the teachers abilitty to relate well is more important that the knowledge of this teaching subject. 
A good relation to the students is helpful because they have more fun in the lessons. Maybe they understand the topic better and are able to learn  better for a test at home. For example the math lessons are less boring when the teacher shows more learning videos or make jokes about special topics. Many students would notice that and would remember this helpful jokes in tests. 
An another argument is that the students have fun to go to school and have learning abilility in this lessons. They would more care about school stuff and would maybe writing better grades. For instance, my friend has a teacher who has a good relation to his students and my friend has good grades in this subject. So the ability of learing is much higher.
Next I give some arguments against this argument.
A good relation to students isnt more important than the knowledge of the subject because the teachers should teach the students well. It is important that the students should good as well prepare for the final tests in schools. When the teacher only make jokes in lessons and doesnt care about the school stuff the students have only fun and learn nothing. 
By the way the students are in school to learn something for the future and when the teacher have no excellent knowwledge in this subject, the students have not many choices in jobs later.
All in all  <i would say that a good relation to the students is good because of the abiltity of learning. But in my opinion the knowledge is more important because the teacher should prepare the students for the future life.
