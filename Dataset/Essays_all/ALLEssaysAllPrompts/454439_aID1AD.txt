TOday alot of young children watch a lot of TV. The TV channels of today show a massive amountof ads. And everybody knows that young children are easily manipulated bythese ads. So this isnt a problem, if a 5 year old boy sees a ad about a new couch. But if he sees ads about all these toys available nowadays, this hasto affect him. So should you show ads directed toward young children.

I think that this would be a great idea, beacause young children are the future of our civilication. Nobody, expect some companys, wants that young children grow up with this much advertisment. If our all people in the future had a childhood stuffed with all these ads, big companys have some loyal customers. Now yout think, whats the problem with loyal customers? I can tell you that this wont come out well. If companys have many loyal customers, they canactually do what they want. If the company is so popular, nobody can bring a company to fall, even if they had done some terrible things. You could say that those companys influence your children like nobody else. Its like these companys got so much power with these ads. It cant be good if companys, whose main goal is to make as muchmoneyas possible, got so much power. 

So with all these beautiful arguments against advertising toward young children, its clear that im fully standing behind this idea. Prohibit these commercials would be a good step against the overwhelming capitalism in our society.
