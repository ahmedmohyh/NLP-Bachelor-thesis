Children between two to five years shouldn't spend much time in front of a TV to have a good education. I think that television advertising directed towards them is nothing bad because they just see and like some toys or other fun activities they would join, so there is nothing damaging at the TV which can cause something bad in a childrens head, just by seeing an advertisement for them. As I said, the advertisements mostly contain some toys for children and if not, it's an advertisement for something a whole family can join like a waterpark. 
A big disatvantage of watching TV in the young age between two and five is that televisions aren't helping the children to build a progress in their brains as it's important in this age. A creativity for exmaple is not here if a child is watching TV everyday for a long time. A child can get some diseases like it can't talk very well for a child at its age. The disease can be worse so the child has to go to a logopedical therapy, where it can make a progress in its brain to finally go to a primary school and educate itself.
My personal opinion of the theme is that good parents won't let a child watch the TV too long in this young age so there will be no damaging effects of a TV and the advertisements in it. Advertisements should be allowed because they don't damage anything and are more there for fun. To that, children are watching wathever they think it's interesting so I've never seen children in this age watching an advertisement because they are not interested at it.
