I understand that companies make advertisements to reach more people and sell more products. 
But personally, I am very annoyed when I once watch a great movie on TV and there is constant advertising. It takes away all the fun and the tension of the movie. When I see advertisement, it has to be really great to make me consider buying the product. This mostly isn't the case. Advertisement towards really young children is bad. The advertisement doesn't even have to be good, when it shows a toy and what can be done with it, it's enough for the children to want it. Young children are easily fooled by what's portrayed on TV. I personally believe that this should be forbidden. Kids should walk into a store and get the toy they like most, just based on colors, appereance and pictures, so that it is really their toy and really something they want. They shouldn't walk into a store and look for that exact toy they've seen on TV. They might not even like the toy too much, but if it's shown on TV, it's cool and will probably make the other kids jealous. 
In todays world we're so easily manipulated by what we see on the internet and the TV. I think it's a shame to start manipulating people from such a young age. That's why I really am against advertisement towards children. But not just towards children aged two to five, I think advertisement towards children up to the age of ten should be forbidden or at least reduced. That might be a bit harder to control, because children that age might already watch programs, that are not directed towards such a young audience.
