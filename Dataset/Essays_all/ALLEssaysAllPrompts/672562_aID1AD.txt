Television and young children

Nowadays nearly every family has got a television at home. Most people use the television to watch the news, the weather forcast, series, movies or documentations.

I think that television in general is a very good thing for children. In my opinion there are many aspects which help children with their education. For example there are series in which they can learn many things about nature, music, animals and more. But there are also some series which aren't good for children like series in which they fight, shoot or use expressions, children shouldn't use.

Television shouldn't be prohibited, but parents should observe what their children are watching. Parents should notice which series have a good influence and which ones have a bad influence to their education. Another aspect is that parents should be aware about how many hours their children sit in front of the television. In my opinion for children, aged two to five, it shouldn't be more than one hour a day. There are some exeptions for example when they want to wach a movie maybe once a week or something like that. But in general children have much more opinions than pass the whole day in front of the TV. They should go outside in nature, play with friends or draw a picture.

I think this is a very interesting topic because when we compare this topic to the way of life 50 years ago this was no problem at all. It was an exeption when a family had got a television at home. Most families had got a radio to listen to the news everyday and not more. Nowadays technology has more and more influence to our life and especially to the life of the children. But I think when people 50 years ago could live without television, our generation should also be able to live without it.
