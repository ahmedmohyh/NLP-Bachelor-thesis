Advertising is a huge deal, on TV, on the radio or in the cinema. Children, especially young children, who watch a lot of TV are mentally not as strong as adults. Because of that, they can be even more influenced by ads that are directed toward them. Also, ads are mostly made in a happy, positive way so that children don't see the problems of a product such as bad quality or high prices.

On the other hand, companies need to make advertising to get the attention of the children and sell their toys. Not only would it be hard to control the ads, but so decide if something is directed toward children or not. Kids aged two to five can hardly buy something on their own so the parents have control over it. At this time, 2017, the influence by other media, espcially smartphones, affects the young boys and girls even more. 

To be fair, they shouldn't watch as much TV anyway, but go outside and play with friends. There is enough advertising, so the youngest generation shouldn't also be overwhelmed by ads that are directed toward them. 

In the end, adverising can't be controlled as easy, so it doesn't make sense to forbid advertising toward young children.
