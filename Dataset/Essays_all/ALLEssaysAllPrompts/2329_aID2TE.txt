It is very important, that a teacher relates well with the students.The teachers's ability to relate well with the students is important to have a good climate in class. Without that, the students will be not able to learn as good as their are able to, because they will be not concentrated enough. 
Having a good relationship with your students as a teacher is also very important, because the students will block and won't respect their teacher, when he or her is not respecting them. A teacher should be at the same level, excepting their knowledge. If that happens, the teacher won't be able to teach at least anything.
Having a excellent knowledge of the subject, that is being taught by the teacher, is not less important than having a good climate in class. Learing is based on a teacher, who has excellent knowleadge.
Being a kind person comes not with being a social person. Being a social person is as important as their knowledge, in case you are a teacher. As a teacher you have to understand you students toughts and their emotion. 
In class it is very important that it's not always only learing, some jokes and a good atmosphere are important, too. Without that your students won't have fun at learning. 
At the and you can say that you won't become a good teacher only with a excellent knowledge in your subject. You also need a kind of humor to get your students attention. But that does not mean the knowledge is unimportant. Of course it is important, because you need to know nearly everything of your subject. A good mix up is the soloution.
