Advertising is one of the biggest industries today,we use it on a daily basis and are confronted with it in almost every moment.But should our youngest children be under effect of these ads?First we need to take a look on the general effect advertising has and why it exist.Advertising is the process in which a product is presented to a specific audience so they get to know of the existence of said product and are induced to buy it.As you might assume, Adverts are almost never neutral and always bias.So they seem to be something we don't want.But keeping in mind that most companies direct their adverts at a speciefic audience we can say that most ads we see are directed at us in some way, thus the chance of the product being something we are actually interested in is incrisingly high.It helps us find the stuff we need&want and maybe even on deciding quickly what exact product has which qualities and often which price.But we need to keep in mind that we (You,me and most probably any other person who reads this) are individuals who are already embetted in the economical system with a way of income and a general idea of necessities and luxus.
The children(aged two to five) are not familiar with such an ideology and thus cant be the one where these ads are directed to...or can they? As already mentioned advertising to these children does not make any sense for the companies who pay money to these adverts so they appear in televison since they can not get money from them, so why do they do it?-They can not buy stuff themselves but they have parents who are more than willingly to make their "kids" happy if they want the new action-figure they have just seen on TV.The question being now on wether this is good or bad could be answerered by saying that, while not being particularly friendly or unshady, the parents still have their own choice to buy the advertised product or not.But not everything is about money so we still need to take a look at the effect it has on the Child.
Adverts are usualy very flashy,catchy and designed to forfill a raised exspectation on the product and are suposed to speak to region of our brain that is responsiblr for excitment without us even noticing it. But most Adults or those becoming one have an idea of rational thinking to ask about and criticise the thing they show on the TV and eventhough the parents are still deciding for the kid, the children are left with a thought of this flahsy product and that anything they see has to forfill this excitment they had on television becouse they never came in contact with the product on another level than that.
