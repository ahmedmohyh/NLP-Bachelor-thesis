This essay deals with the following statement: "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

The relationship between a teacher and his students is a fundamental part of his classes which can decide whether the students will learn and understand what they are taught or not. That´s why I think, that the kind of teacher, who can talk to his students without giving them a feeling of pressure, or even better than that, who can create some kind of a friendship between himself and his students, is in my opinion doing an excellent job.
Students will listen more carefully and try harder to understand what they are taught if a friend, or at least someone they like is standing in front of them. They might also feel more confident and will participate more than they would if they were taught by someone who is scaring them. A good atmosphere can make it possible to pay attention in even the most boring classes. 
But of course it is the main responsibility of a teacher to teach his students. And I expect everybody to agree with me if I say that excellent knowledge is necessarily needed for teaching somebody.  
That´s why I definately have to disagree with this knowledge not to be more important for a good teacher than the ability to relate well with students.
Which I do agree with, is that the relationship between students and their teacher truly 
is very important and can take a huge influence on what and how much the kids will be willing to learn.
