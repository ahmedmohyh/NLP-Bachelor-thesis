Besides having excellent knowledge of the subject that is being taught, a teacher should  be able to relate well with students. 
A teacher's job is to educate students about a specific subject, so they gain new knowledge, which they possibly need for their further education or for their jobs after school. That's why the teacher's knowledge about a specific subject is necessary: Students rely on their teachers. In order to gain the knowledge the students need, the teacher not only must have excellent knowledge about the subject that is being taught, but also he must be able to teach the students well. That concludes the ability to realte well with the students. He should be able to realize specific difficulties students have and react to them, because his goal as a teacher is to make studens understand the subject that is being taught. 
In my opinion the ability to relate well with students is just as important as excellent knowledge. Without knowledge the teacher wouldn't even be able to do his job, but he needs to realte with the students, so he can make sure they are prepared for further education and their future in genreal.
