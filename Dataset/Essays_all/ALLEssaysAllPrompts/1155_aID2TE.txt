At school you can see lots of different kind of teachers and if you ask the students you will hear, that there are interessting lessons and really uninteressting ones. It could depend on the kind of subject but it also could depend on the teacher. So the question is: is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
Teachers have to study really long for their teacher being. They have to learn lots of stuff, so that they can teach children the stuff at school. So it's really important to have a good knowledge so that you can teach a child. If you haven't the knowledge you can't teach the child good enough.
Teachers exercise is preparing children for their life. So if they don't teach well enough, the children aren't prepared enough.
Students learn better when they have good connections to the teachers, so that the teacher is on one wave with the student. The student aren't afraid to ask if they don't understand something and he can tell  the teacher what he's interessted to learn, so that the teacher can think about that and if it works he can put it into his lessons. 
All in all I would say that its imporant to have a good connection to the students. I wouldn't say that it's more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. The mix of that would be the perfect way. You can't give the student too much to decide, because of he could forget who is the boss, but when he has got some questions he wouldn't be afraid to ask.
