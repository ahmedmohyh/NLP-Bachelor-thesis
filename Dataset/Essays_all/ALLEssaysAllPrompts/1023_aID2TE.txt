The job of a teacher is to teach the student at least a little bit about the things he knows, but aswell he should take care of his students and help them with their problems. So what is more important, that the teacher knows even very specific bits of information of a topic or that he can relate well to his students?

It is a proven fact that students learn better, when they like the way how the teacher acts in class. A lot of students say, that they like it better when they can be able to see the teacher as a friend and the other way around. If the teacher has a friendly relationship with his students, it will be easier for him to teach them things. He can speak with them about their personal problems and help improving them, which causes that the students can be more focused in class and will be able to learn faster and better. Also if the teacher knows the personal prefences of the student he can create a lesson that the students will like. Such as he knows that the students would rather have weakly tests than oral exams, he can change up his lesson.

On the other hand a teacher has to know a lot of things to even be a good teacher. Because he can not really teach other people when he does not know too much about the topic himself. Also if he has a good relationship with his students, they will be able to learn quicker than normally and will prrobably want to know specif informaton about tthe topic, which the teacher will not have.

In my opinion the teacher needs to have a mixture of both. He should try to get a relationship as good as possible with them, but also have great knowledge of the things he teaches. Eventhough I think that the teacher does not have to know every single bit of information to be good teacher. The majority of students will not even be intrested in getting to know them. Which is why I think it is more important to create a nice atmosphere of workenvironment.
