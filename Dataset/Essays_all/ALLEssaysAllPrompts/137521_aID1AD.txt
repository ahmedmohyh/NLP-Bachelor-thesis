This statement makes it worth to think about if should happen or not.
Firstable it has some positiv and negativ effects. I beginn with the negativ ones. When the young children are crying you want them to stop, so you go to the  television and show them a programm or some something like that. But when it does not has something for children to watch, you can not show them anything to them. Also if the parents have no time for them to play, maybe they going to give their phones and than it could be addicted to it, because it spend then many hours with it in not so much time.

And now some positiv ones. So if the children grow up without looking so much televison, they will not stay for a couple of hours before the television. In their young age, the children will go outside if it has not something to do at home. They wouldn't have the problem to do otherthing as just watching television. The children will not be addicted to it like the other children.

So I agree with the statement, because it has more positiv effects on the children as negativ ones.This should be clear. Sure it will be a bit more complicated at the beginning, but after the children grow up it will have positiv effects with it. But I could understand if some parents hav not time to play with their children so much. They could do a compromise, that they let their children watch the television with a timelimit, for example just one hour per day.
