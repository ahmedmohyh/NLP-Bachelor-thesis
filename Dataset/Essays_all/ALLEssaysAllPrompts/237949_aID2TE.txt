A good teacher should have both: the ability to relate well with his students and knowledge about his subject. But if I need to say which one is more important I can't give a clear answer. It's for sure important that the teacher can interact well with the students so they have fun in the lesson and that they don't be afraid to speak during the lesson.  On the other hand it is essential that the teacher's knowledge is good enough that the students can ask their questions and the teacher is able to answer them correctly. If the teacher, in your opinion, really "sucks" beause he didn't threaten you fair the of course you don't have any motivation to learn new things. I think it makes a difference wether the teachers is just bad at all in having relations to any person or if the teacher isn't fair. Fairness is in my view the most important thing. It's for sure important to have a great time while you are in student  but it is much more important that you have learned a lot the years you spent being a student. You can also have a great time if you don't like the teacher but if the teacher isn't able to teach you his subject properly than you might have problems later in your profession. To sum up and come back to the question I question the statement beacuse of my own experience. In primar school the statement may be true because there it is also important to grow as a person and the teacher there has a main influence. But the older you get and even in the higher grades the accurate knowledge of the teacher wins at importance. The last years i've had both and I prefer a teacher with a excellent knowledge even if I don't get on well with him just beacuse I want to learn as much as possible. A teacher who knows nearly everything about his subject is more valuable for me than just a teacher who is friendly. So I don't agree with the statement.
