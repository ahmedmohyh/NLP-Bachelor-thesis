When it comes to advertising a lot of companies are very creative. Especially the ones that are directed toward young children. Those usually sell toys, clothes or food which has fun looking logos and mascots. Nowadays a lot of children from the age two to five are being at home left with their nannies or simply don't get enough of distraction or playtime with their parents. 
An evident soloution for them is television. Television is very popular among youger children, they have their favorite tv-shows or cartoons and they have their favorite characters right there on the screen. But most of the time advertisements are running. And they are indeed very convincing and seducing for the youngers. 
Those advertisements have everything in them what a child could dream of. First and foremost we have the product that is tried to be selled, let's take a simple toy for an example now. This toy is now presented by a child (or a group) their age. So already now our kid will feel a connection. 
Secondly the way it is presented is the main catcher. The toy seems to be the reason for all that fun on the screen, for all the kids laughing and jumping around, having a good time alltogether. We will find a lot of bright and vivid colors in the ad, fun music playing in the background, anything a child could wish for. All those placed and intended tricks receive a positive ressonance from the young audience. 
Finally it shouldn't be very surprising if your child is going crazy over a toy in the store. Personally I feel like this shouldn't be that big of a problem, since the kids themselves are anyways not able to purchase anything alone without the parents. The parents on the other hand are left to be a bit strict and say no to their childrens wishes. 
And eventually if the child gets a toy he saw on TV it will make him appreciate it even more, knowing that it is a more special kind of toy.
