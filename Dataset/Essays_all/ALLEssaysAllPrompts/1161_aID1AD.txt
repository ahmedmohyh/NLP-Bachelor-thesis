My opinion to that statement is divided.
On the one hand I think that the television advertising which is directed toward young children could lead to a higher television consume at a younger age, because the young children are willing to watch the advertising which is meant especially for them. In this case, they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends. The parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.
On the other hand I think that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children, because it is in the hand of the parents or everyone else in general how to handle this situation. In our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell. That is why they use the televison to spread their advertising for their products all over the country on the easy way with putting it into the televison. In my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising, with cute little children in it, the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way. I think parents identify easily with televison advertising which is set up like this, because they think about their own child directly. But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it. I can not make a point in that case, because I can understand the companies acting in that way, but i can also think of the fears people might have about television advertising directed toward young children. 
All in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation, because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising.
