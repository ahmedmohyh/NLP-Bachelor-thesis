My parents had not allowed me to look any televion advertisings when I was a child. But not every parents have the same oppinion in the questen if they should allowed there children television advertising. The questen is now if television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed.

If these advertisings are not allowed parents not think that it is good for children and they mayby not allowed there children to look any advertisings.
 But some parent don't want to do something with their children and so they let look them television advertisings for children. If it has nothing for children they let them maybe look some thing for older children or adults and that would be worse.

In my oppinion children should not look any televion but I also think that making a low against it is the wrong way. I think parents should be careful what they allowed to their children and what not but parents must have the chois in these questions.
