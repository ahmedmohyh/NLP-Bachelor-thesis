To decide wether it's more important for teachers to have empathy or know everything about the subject they are teaching, it's mandatory to talk about different points of view.

If you would ask a student to decide, they will probably go with the option the teacher shows a significant lack of. A teacher that is already really empathic is more likely to get viewed as a better teacher, even though a lot of students like their lessons to be well prepared and structured.
A teacher that has excellent knowledge of their subject but is rather cold towards the students is more likely to be viewed as a bad teacher. But the students will demand more specific knowledge of teacher A and more empathy of taecher B.

Since I'm not a teacher it is hard for me to take a teaching person's point of view, but I could imagine that teachers try to pay more attention to what their lessons are about and to get their students interested in the different topics. Their main goal is to feed knowledge to young people.
As always there are exeptions to the rule, for example teachers that only try to kill time until they don't have to work anymore.

I can't be entirely objective on this topic but my conclusion would be: It's more important for teachers to know about their subject and be able to do excellent teaching qualitywise. It's always nice to have a teacher understanding you and why Jimmy couldn't do that homework and it being no problem but in the end the teacher is there to teach you the things you need to suceed (wether you really need all this knowledge is debateable) and it's not their function to wipe away your tears.
