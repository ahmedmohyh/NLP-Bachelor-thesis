In my opinion teacher's ability to relate well with students is really important but being more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught: I don't think so. Assuming that with the word "students" written in the statement is meant secondary level students I think the knowledge plays a more important role. At this age the material in school gets deeper and deeper and a good knowledge is crucial for the teacher. The better it is, the more freely can the teacher lecture and the more interesting make it sound.

In the age of 16-18 students aren't that stupid any more and if a teacher doesn't really know what is he/she talking about, the students will notice and there is nearly nothing as bad as that. As I mentioned earlier also the teachers ability to relate with the students is important but it still doesn't stand in center in the same way it does while teaching primary- and middleschool children. A teacher who really has a deep knowledge of his/her subject can without exception make the lecture sound more interesting, beliavable and credible.
