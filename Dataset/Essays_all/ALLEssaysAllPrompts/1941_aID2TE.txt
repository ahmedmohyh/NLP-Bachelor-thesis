I´m not really sure which aspekt is more important in school. I think both of this aspects are very important.
On the one hand the relationships between students and teachers are important because if a teacher can´t work with students he probably won´t teach the school stuff with the neccecary enthusiasm. Students will think the teacher doesn´t want to teach them right and doesn´t care about their education. But the education that is most important for their futur life. Without enough education the students won´t find a job or they can´t go to an university and study the subjects they always dreamed of. Also the teacher might be bullied by his own students because they don´t like him or her.
On the other hand the most excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is quiet important. The students visit the school to learn everything they need in their futur life and if there is a teacher who is really kind, funny and nice but who can´t teach the stuff very good, the students won´t learn something.
Students like it if a teacher plays games, makes jokes or shows them movies. But that is not all. It doesn´t matter how many funny videos the teacher shows his students instead of how many good prepared an intelligent lessons he give to his students.
In conclusion to that i think the best teacher is a mixture of this both aspects. A teacher who can be funny and  relate well with his students and also has the excellent knowledge of the subject he teachs.
