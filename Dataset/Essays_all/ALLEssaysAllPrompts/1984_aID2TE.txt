Everyone has different imagines about the work with the teachers in school. For some students it is more important to have a good bond to their teachers, for others is the knowledge from the teacher about his or her subject the important point. Both variantes has some positive and negative arguments. The teachers ability to relate with students should be well, this helps that the lessons are relaxed for teachers and students. But for some people it is impossible to have a good bond to their teacher because the simphathy plays a big role. For these people it is much more important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge about his subject. This is on one side very good. Students learn faster and get a better knowledge too, but it can be very stressing if the lessons only exist with learning and more learning. And will you learn with your hole energy when you don´t like your teacher?
I think it is addicted from the student and also the teacher and everyone is different so it´s hard to find a medium answere for this question, so my own opinion is that I think you need both points to have a good classclimate.
