Little children are easyly manipulated. For that reason it is easy to understand when people feel that directing advertising toward them should be prohibited. For the same reason advertisers would probably say that it is the most effective sort of advertising and for that the most profitable. They would also argue that children should choose for themselves what they want. I dont think that children of that age understand what is good for them and what isnt. Few advertisers care about what is good for children as long as they can profit from it. Since they are responsible for their children the parents must decide what they thinkis good for their children and act according to that. Advertising directet toward the parents of those children is something different since they are old enough to know what is good for their children. For those reasons i think that advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
