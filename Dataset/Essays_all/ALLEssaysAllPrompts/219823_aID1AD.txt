Adverts are something everyone knows. Most of the time it is annoying and unpleasant. Television advertising is common. Mostly the film stops at the best moment just to show the faked picture of a woman with wonderful long eyelashes or other nonsense. Is ist necessary to bother our little kids with this?

It is a fact that advertising is a good way to sell products; on television there are so many people who watch all these adverts so it is likely somebody is affected by them and buys the product. It may be annoying sometimes but because of this adverts we are able to watch many things for free. The advertisers are the sponsors and with their money the tv programm is financed. The same goes for the programs for children. 
Children the young age of two to five often do not even understand the adverts and most of the parents do not buy random stuff for their kids just because it showed up on television one time. 
But it is a fact that people are affected by adverts even if they do not realize it. Children are even easier affected. They react to colours and shiny things very easily. So it is possible that the children take some of the stuff they see in adverts and remeber it like that. This can be dangerous depending on what the advert is about.
Also it might be a problem that children want to have everything that is advertised. So they bother their parents to buy them stuff they do not even need. And they do not understand what ist is exactly so they just stick with it. 

In my opinion we should carefully teach our childrens and let them explore new things on television and sometimes just let them have fun. We should not bother them with adverts and only show them unecessary stuff just to get money. It is important that we let our children grow up without too much influence from the outside, they should explore life for themselves.
