Television advertisements: we have all seen them, we have all either laughed about them or even hated them. But what does it actually do with a child's brain and the coseption of their environment?
 
It's nothing new to say, that television advertisements are made to convice or even brainwash you into feeling like you need something, even if you don't. Children are weak victims as they haven't got the mental strength yet to distance themselves from the constant televison adversitements they play on repeat. As a consequence they might get very unsadisfite, unhappy or even frustrated children. 
My cousins, who are between four and six years old, started at a very young age to cry about a toy they saw on television advertisements, because oubvisely their parents would't get it. It seemed like they couldn't live without it anymore and when you started to convince them, that they already had enough and even better toys than the one they saw on TV, they just went on throwing a fit. Of course I have to admit, that now as they get older it doesn't seem to affect them as much anymore, but I still don't find it funny as it puts parents in a very uncomfortable position. 

I understand and accept that it's a very good strategy to sell more products and I wouldn't mind as much if they didn't play over thirdy advertisements between a children's cartoon and another. It might also inspire you to buy something cool and usefull for your kids and make "their wish" come true.
I still think that we should try to avoid this brainwash for childen as much as possible and let them go outside, play with their toys, using their own imagination and fanatsy to make the old toy become a "new" one. Let them grow old in peace in a world they are happy about what they have!
