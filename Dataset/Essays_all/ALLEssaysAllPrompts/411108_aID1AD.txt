Many commercials are made for a specific group of interest. The question in the following Essay is, wether advertisement for the age group of two to five should be allowed. First of all it is important what type of content is presented to the children. It should not be legal connecting cigarettes with a mickey mouse logo. You also have to keep in mind, that children at this age are not fully able to comprehend the value of money. This is not a big problem, when they do not get weekly or monthly cash from their parents, but otherwise the children are seduced to spend there money in a not wisely way. The group of two to five year olds is a big consumer group and very important for economic reasons and when they get interested in a particular product they will be trying to get hold of it very powerful. We all remember the awkward situation in a toy store, when a child screams and shouts to her mother, because she really wants the new lego expansion pack and altough her needs are declined, she still tries to manipulate her mother to buy it. Im convinced that the television is a pretty important medium for many companies to sell products to the little ones and advertisement does not always has to be a bad thing. You get exposed to unwanted rubbish aswell as really interesting stuff. You should take into consideration also, that many television programmes for little children would not exist without commercials, because there would be no selling point in showing them, and for my part, I loved to watch cartoons and television shows made for my age group. In conclusion I think there is not a big problem in showing commercials to children as long as they are reasonable and not graphic or off-putting.
