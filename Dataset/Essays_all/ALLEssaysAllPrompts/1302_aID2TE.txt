School shall teach students in different subjects. The main aim is to learn certain things and not to become the teachers new best friend. But without a good relation between teacher and students a good education isn't possible. 
It is very important for students to feel comfortable when they're in school because they spend much time there. There is nothing worse than a student who is afraid of going to school. 
There are teachers who are too strict with their classes. They have no good relation but they are good with their subject. 
The students are afraid of the lessons and don't ask if they have questions or even take part in the lesson because they are afraid of the reaction of the strict teacher.
Especially during puberty the teenagers need a good relation to their teachers.
It's no good lesson if the teacher knows much about his subject but he's  talking to the wall because the students dont listen. 
Teenagers are hard to control and  such lessons often go out of control. The teacher has to work on their relation with the students so that his students see him as the leader of the group but also as a person they can trust. 
But it is also wrong if the students love their teacher but he knows nothing. The lessons are relaxed but the students doesn't learn anything. During the lesson it might be cool when they have free time but there comes a time when they realize that they should have learned anything so that don't fail the exams. A teacher must know the answer of a subject-related question and may not always say that he does not know for sure. 
So both a good relation between students and teacher and excellent knowledge are important for being a good teacher. The golden middle is the aim but it's hard to reach.
