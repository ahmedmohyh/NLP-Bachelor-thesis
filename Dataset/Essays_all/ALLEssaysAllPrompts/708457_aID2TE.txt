Do you ever just sit in class and after a couple of minutes you realize that you didn't even listen to what the teacher said and instead you were just sitting there glaring into the distance outside the window. This is something most students know and it is often a result of what students call "boring teaching". The teachers need to have a teaching style the students can realte to. A good understanding of the students way of thinking is neccessary to get the information across. A good relationship furthermore, makes it a lot more interseting to sit in class. Nevertheless a teacher shouldn't be a students bestfriend.

Firstly, teachers should be able to think as students in order to understand their mindset. If this skill is missing the information won't get across no matter how hard the teachers try and as a result, students won't listen. It is scientificly proven, that the more the students listen in class, the easier they get good grades.

Additionally, if there is a good student-teacher relationship, chances that students ask their teachers if there is a problem are a lot higher. Relationships based on mutual respect improve the learing experience. If the students don't listen to what is being taught the level of knowledge does not matter at all.

Nevertheless, if a teacher tries to be his or her students' bestfriend, it can often happen, that the students lose their respect and don't see their teacher as an authority anymore. This can cause the exact opposit of what was intended by the teacher.

In conclusion, teachers who can relate to their students and treat them with respect, but are also able to stay a respected authority provide the best learing environment.
