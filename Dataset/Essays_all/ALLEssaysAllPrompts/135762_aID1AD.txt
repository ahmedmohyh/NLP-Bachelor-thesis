Advertisement is everywhere nowadays. It is a part of our everyday life and it is directed toward all of us, young and old. That brings forth the question: Should we allow advertising directed toward young children?

Small children are very naive and don't know how to form their own opinion yet. Therefore advertisement directed directly toward them will have a big influence on them. If an advertisement tells a small child that the product is the best thing in the world a small child will not be able to see through the marketing desguise of the advertisement and will instead just believe it and demand for their parents to buy it. Therefore advertisement directed toward young children is very dangerous as it influences their perception of reality by displaying a false image of products and it can lead to them being spoiled and having false priorities in life.

On the contrary one might also say that the parents are responsible for their children and with that it is their job to decide wether something is suited for their child or not. Therefore banning television asvertising directed toward children is not nessesary because the parents should be the ones preventing their children from being influenced by these advertisements and with that becoming a vilctim of the marketing industry at such a young age. 

Personally I think that advertising directed toward small children does not need to be banned. In my opinion the parents are responsible for their children and with that they are also responsible for what their children see on television. Though I do find it morally questionable to try and use a childs innocently naive perception of the world to sell your products it is still the parent's duty to teach their child what is right and important and what isn't.
