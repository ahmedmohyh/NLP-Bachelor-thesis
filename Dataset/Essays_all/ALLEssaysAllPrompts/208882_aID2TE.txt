What works for the lower grade doesn`t necessarily work for the higher

Today, an incredibly huge amount of money is spent for education all over the world. The money is not only invested in students but also in teachers. But to what extent is this necessary? Isn`t the teacher`s aibility to relate well with students, his natural potential to teach, more important than the knowledge of the subject being taught?

Some argue yes, it is. Hence the money is wrongly spent today. A teacher needs to know his/her subject, without doubt. But this doesn`t mean he/she has to know everything that is related to it. It`s enough to know the stuff he/she teaches. This makes sence also from an economic viewpoint: If teachers were not educated as long as now, billions could be saved!

Others say loudly no. The basis of being a good teacher is the knowledge. Can someone teach students well just with being nice and capable of relating to them but without having knowledge? It is impossible. It makes sence that a teacer has an excellent knowledge of his subject: If a student is especially interested in a subject the teacher should be capable of giving him/her extra information. 

To conclude, one can`t answer the question easily. For teaching lower grades, a teacher who has the aibility to relate well but not an excellent knowledge might work. But when it comes to higher grades, in which to knowledge becomes more and more important it doesnt. Hence it always depends on the situation as a whole.
