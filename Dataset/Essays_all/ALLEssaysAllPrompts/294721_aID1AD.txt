Nowadays, nearly every child watches TV in the evening and even it is only for 30 minutes watching TV without television advertising is not possible, not only on channels for adults, but also on channels for children you find advertisements for several products or services.  
Firstly, you have to think back when you were a child. At an age of about four years you only concentrated on the film you really wanted to see. At the beginning, advertisement might had been funny for you to see how a family is at the supermarket or how people are at a place where you had never been to. But as soon as the advertisement had finished you forgot about it and you concentrated again on the movie, or the advertisement was so boring that you went shortly to the toilet. 
Secondly, when the child is only about two years old it does not really know what advertisement is at all. The child might even think that it is a second movie! 
However, we should not forget that the advertisement can influence young children. As soon as the family goes to the supermarket and the child sees a product which had recently been advertised the child wants this product and is extremely angry with the partents if they do not want to buy it as it can be unhealthy for the child. 
To sum up, even though children might have an emotional outbreak at a supermarket it is not as bad as some scientists think. Young children do not really recognise why there is advertisement at all they concentrate more on the moving pictures and the colours they can see on the screen. 
To my mind, it is not a bad thing that there is advertisement on channels for children. Advertisement is more a boring thing and people rather do something else than watching advertisement or the younger ones do not even understand what the advertisement is about.
