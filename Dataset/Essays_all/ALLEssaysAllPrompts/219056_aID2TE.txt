Since school came up I think the way how teachers teach changed. It began with harsh methods like beating children if they dosomething wrong. Todays knowledge shows that there are much more points to look at. We started observing the children and tried to figure out how each child works. Psychologists started creating experiments to look even deeper in a chidls mind. And thats how it works. Teaching evolved by the time and it transformed from a brutal straight forward way to a more sensitive and warm way. Teachers nowadays can't beat children and I hope they don't want to, because their purpose is to transmit their knowledge. And now we come to the point how they should transmit it. The most inteligent person on the planet is not the best teacher on the planet. He knows significantly more than all the other teachers but he is missing the bond and the understanding to a student. If you have a teacher with a normal inteligence who likes to teach and is able to know what the students don't understand is way better than someone who is more inteligent but at the end only cares for himself. All that knowledge in the brain of the inteligent person doesn't help anybody if he cannot pass it to anybody. On the other hand in higher advanced schools where students can take good care for themselves and all they want to do is to learn as much as possible maybe a more inteligent teacher is better. Also with the inteligent teacher you can be sure that the facts he tells you are true while the other may not have the knowledge to explain something right.
For me the teacher that can relate with the students wins. He knows better what the students are missing or what they don't understand and can optimize his teaching. What I said just counts if the teacher tells the truth. If he just teaches false facts but in a nice way I'd prefer the one with excellent knowledge.
