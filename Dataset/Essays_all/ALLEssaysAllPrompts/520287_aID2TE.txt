Is the teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than an exellent knowledge of the subject?

In my scool i have many diffrent teachers. I like some of them more then the others, beacause they have diffrent characters. But is it better if a teacher have a big knowledge or do we like the teachers with the ability to relate well with us? These are questions which I want to discuss in this essay.

For a student it's very important that he learns from a teacher who knows much. Only the perfect language usage is good enough for a beginner. How will I learn a language or a mathematic term if my teacher can't use it perfect? Although it isn't very comfortable if the teacher can't relate with the students you can learn more of his big knowledge.

But is it that easy? If the teacher knows more a student can learn more? A student has to have fun in what he learns because without motivation you can't learn as much as it is enough to become well in a language or everything else. For the motivation a teacher is very important and a teacher who can relate with me motivates me to do for examples more homework or to repetatetrhe vocabularies once more. With this extra-motivation I can practice something very often and I'll become good in it.

For me it's more important that a teacher can relate well with his students than having an excellent knowledge because he can motivate the students to do more wich is, exspecionally in languages, very important.
