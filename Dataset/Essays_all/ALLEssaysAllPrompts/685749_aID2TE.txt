Teaching strategeties are an often discussed topic and opinions devide in how you should teach students. Some say the relation between students and their teachers is more important than the actual knowledge of the teachers.

I completely agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

On one side you could mention that teachers should know their subject and understand it, otherwise they couldn't explain it to the students. 
I already experienced cases where teachers weren't sure what they were talking about and in such situations students didn't take them serious anymore and stopped trying to learn anything. 
In addition to the mentionned contra argument there's also the point that teachers are no guards of the children and they're not responsible to relate with them. 
Teachers are teachers because their job requires them to teach their subject.

But on the other side there are way more important arguments. For example the one that children (most common in primary school but also later in secondary school) are in a significant stage of their lives, where they develop their characters and how they understand and act with other people. It's extremely important for teachers to influence this period of the student's lifes. And they can only influence these children correctly when there's a good relation between the teachers and students. Teachers have to understand how children think and how they learn. If they didn't know how to teach them nothing got stuck in the students' heads.

So in my opinion, i think that teachers definetely should try to build up a relation with the students so they know how they have to teach them so they can really learn from them. 
Teachers are teachers because their job requires them to teach students HOW to learn.
