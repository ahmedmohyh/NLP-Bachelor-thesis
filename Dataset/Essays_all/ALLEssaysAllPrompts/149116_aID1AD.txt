Today, everyone is used to television advertises but nobody really likes it. But for the businesses they are absolutely important. But should it be allowed to direct them toward young children? 

Young children are easy to manipulate. When they see something on TV they want to have it because it is often shown way different than it is in real life. The people behind television advertises know and learn what children want to see, so they create something that is stunning and cool for them. For sure they also know that the children are the only ones who can change the adults opinions, so they buy the stuff for their kids.

On the other hand, it is good because as I said, the young children sometimes are the only ones who are able to get the parents to buy things. When the consumers invest money on a product the workers form the shops, the producers and all the other people who have something to do with the production, do not loose their jobs. Advertise could possibly also help the children to imagine how they could use some toys and other stuff, so it is usefull for their fantasy.

I have to say I do not like adversise in general but as a child I sometimes liked it because I saw toys there I did not know they exist but I really liked to have. All in one, I do not think advertising is that bad and it is necessary in our generation.
