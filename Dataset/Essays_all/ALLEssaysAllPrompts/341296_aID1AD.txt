Despite the fact that television advertising directed toward young children can cause real damages and can create bad characters, there are also advantages which can lead young children to learn new things ore even let them calm down in a different way than just looking out the window.

Looking into a computer or television screen all day long can cause real damages on your eyes which can be irritating and annoying. It would be very irresponsible to let young children watch tv all the time. It can damage their eyes and could lead them to wearing glasses in their future. Adding to the damage on the children's eyes, watching tv all day long can damage their brains as well. They can create very strong character unable to work in groups or even comunicate correctly in their future. These children are used to watch tv on their own which did not learn them to socialise with other people in their age. 
On the other hand there are some great advantages of telvision advertising directed to children. There are a lot of interesting channels, which can learn children about the nature or other important subjects. They can learn new languages or know more about geography and our earth. Telvision advertising can also calm you down. Watching relaxing things just as for example documentaries can calm you down and relax your mind.
In my pont of vew, telvision advertising directed to young children should be allowed, as long as it is combined whith other important things just as playing around, doing silly things and also communicating with other people.
It should be a healthy mix of everything.
