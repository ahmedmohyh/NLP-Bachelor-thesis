Being a teacher requires various skills such as good knowledge of the subject, ability to controll the students and planning of interesting lessons. Those are few of many more abilities one has to acquire in order to be a teacher. But which factor is more important to provide good education for the students? Is it better when teachers understand how students feel about the topic or is it more helpful when the teacher has excellent understanding of the topic. This debatable topic offers many arguments for and against the statement.

Firstly it can be very helpful if the teacher relates well with the students. In this way the teacher knows what the pupils find easy or what they find rather hard. With this knowledge the teacher can adapt the teaching plan to help the stundents with learning. In addition, students which have a better relationship with their teacher tend to do better in school. Their grades can improve if the students have fun during school.

On the contrary a good relationship with the students is not useful if the teacher has not gained sufficient knowledge in their subject. It can be a problem during lessons if pupils have questions about the topic and the teacher is not able to answer them. Teacher with excellent knowledge can teach a lot to the students and contribute to a better understanding to the subject. 

In my opinion a teacher needs to have both. But I think that a teacher who has a better knowledge of the topic can help you more in order to gain good education, because he can give you a bigger view to the subject.
