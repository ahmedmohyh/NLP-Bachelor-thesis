It is very important that a teacher relate well with his students. A teacher who doesn't understand what the problems from the studens are can't explain the difficult parts and is not a good teacher. But knowledge is also very important. If a teacher doesn't understand what he has to teach the student start making other things in his lessons and don't learn the subject.
I think there must be mix from both things. For example it is less important in the primary school to understand the subject. That's because the small children have easier subjects and mostly what they learn is commun knowledge. In an advanced level it's more important to have a good knowledge. For me it's very boring if a teacher just prints a text from the internet and can't speak about the theme. This are mostly the same teachers who can't give an answer to a difficult questions.
For me there is an other point very important to say that someone is a good teacher or not. And that's how lazy a teacher is. If the teacher just takes the paper from the year before and doesn't prepare the lessens it's not very interesting. But if the teacher also takes modern stuff in the lessons and changes maybe the next lesson if something isn't clear, than he is a good teacher. Mostly the lazy teacher don't understand their things and they don't wanna learn something new.
For me a teacher needs a good compromise between this things. Of course you can't prepare five houers for one lesson. And it's also clear, that a teacher needs a bit of knowledge and that the ability to relate well with students is helpfull. A good teacher has a good mixture ot this things.
