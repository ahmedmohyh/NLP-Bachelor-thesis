The topic: is it more important to have a good relation to the studends or is it better to have all the knowledge about a topic is a high dicussed question in our school live.
A first argument that konwledge is more important is that you can not teach the stutends without any knowledge about the topich you have to teach.
Secondly you can not answer any questions from the students without any knowledge so if a student asks you a simple question about a topic and you have to say:,, Sorry i think i have to look it up at home". The students will ask himself if you are enough educated to teach on a Gymnasium or any other school.
At least their are also some arguments why it is more important to relate well to the students.
The first argument is that the students trust in you and maybe think that everything you say is right.
A second argument is that you do not have any problems to speak in a clear way to the students if you really want to talk serious with them.
Another reason is that the students have a lot of respect to you so you never have prolblems with students which have their own head in some things. Because of this it is easyer to speak with your students.
Finally I would say that both things are very impotant to be a good teacher and without one of these two things you can not be a that good teacher.
