I mostly agree with the statement. Watching TV in young age probably gets to a habit for the later life. Watching a lot of television is not helpful for the education of young people in general, because the media has a too big influence on the people, especially for very young people in age of two to five. By watching TV very often, the media presented by television is a very influencing form of giving information, which is not always firstly intended to educate young people - more there are a lot of commercials which manipulate the children and use their naivity for capital. A young human being in age of two to five should learn to understand their environment by their own and not by consuming what is told and shown on the television. Everything one consumes, consumes oneself.

Even though, watching television in young age can be a risk for the people, espeiaclly the young, we all have to learn how to use a TV, because it clearly is an important aspect in our society. By not allowing young people to watch television, they will never know how to watch it with conscience. They might begin to watch TV, when the parents can not forbit it anymore and the use of mass media with conscience can not be served.

In my opinion, young children in age of two to five should be allowed to watch TV, but for 15 to 20 minutes maximum, because so they know it is a part of the society, but also something parallel of the reality - so it does not give the young the picture of the reality and they can discover their environment and the world on their own with playing outside, making friends, going to kindergarten etc. So, I agree with the idea of television and also other forms of media, like smartphones, tablets, youtube etc. is not ideal for the growing of young people in age of two to five, but not forbiting it, because it is so influencial anyway
