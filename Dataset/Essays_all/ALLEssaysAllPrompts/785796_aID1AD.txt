Today, nearly every household has a television. People of every age watch television daily. But when we watch television, there is television advertising nearly every fifteen minutes, which is directed to different groups of people, also to young children.

A good reason to direct television advertising toward young children is, that this is good for merchandising. When children see something on television, they want to have this thing, and the parents buy it to make them happy. Another pro is, that they learn to not be influenced by television advertising. For example, if they watch television and every 15 minutes there is advertising, maybe they turn out the television because it's boring and go doing other things, like playing. When they know, that the advertising  is during 5 minutes, they come after this time and turn it on again. 

But there are also some cons.Sometimes, children want things they don't really need and if their parents don't want to buy them these inuseful things, children often begin to cry and shout. Especially children in a very young age (two to five), can't decide whether a thing is useful and if they really need this thing. 
Another point is, that when they watch a film of  120 minutes and every 15 minutes there is television advertising during 5 minutes, they watch television television 40 minutes longer. That causes for young children headaches and they are more tired than if they would play outside. 

Personally, I think that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed, because it has a negative influence on the childhood. If they get everything they want, because their parents want to make them happy, they grow up with the thinking that they can have anything they want. This can bring problems when they become teenagers: they don't get much pocket money or the don't gain much money in a job and if they get it, they spend it immediatly, often on things they see on television.
