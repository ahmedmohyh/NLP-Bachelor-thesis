Nowadays almost every familiy owns a TV that can be used by the every member sometimes even by young children. These affect them in different ways depending on what kind of programs are shown on TV. Sometimes even advertisement can affect them. Big companies sometimes produce commercials that are directed toward young children. In this essay i want to explain if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
One argument against this kind of advertisment is the manipulation that commercials can do. Young kids can not decide maturely so it can be dangerous to them. Another argument against television advertising towards young children is that after seeing such a commercial kids want such products though parents rarely would buy or can't afford it what makes kids very sad.
An argument in favour could be that it teaches kids a lesson because they can't and won't have eveything in life. Another pro argument is that kids could be influenced by commecials with good purpose as for example anti-racism campaigns.
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should be allowed but only if they have a good purpose.
