I mostly agree with this statement, due to the fact that a teacher who can relate well with the students is more likely to get them interested in a subject, for example a lesson using games and conversation to teach was more enjoyable for me as a child than a very blackboard oriented lesson. And even though the teacher may be lacking in certain areas the students will learn better in more engaging situations, thus they will profit much more.

It can be argued, that he lacks the required knowledge to teach the students and will give them false information. But as long as you are a teacher you are required to have certain level knowledge, which is why I think that most teachers have an adequate knowledge of the subject they are teaching. In addition to that, younger students attending primary or secondary schools often have trouble being motivated for more difficult and technical subjects like mathematics. For those subjects it is very important that we find ways to motivate young students to participate and learn in those subjects, as they will struggle less in later stages of life when they are confronted with very complex calculations and formulas at universities or other advanced schools.

To conlclude my essay, I believe it is very important that we find the right balance between knowledge and the teachers ability to relate well with students in order to maximise learning potential for students.
