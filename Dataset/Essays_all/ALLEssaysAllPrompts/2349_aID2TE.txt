It is important that a teacher relates well with students.
The students find the teacher better when he or she has a good relationsship with them. A student can learn better in a nicer atmosphery. For example, the students prefer to go in classes where the teachers can identify better with the students. Those teachers want to have something like "being friends with them". They ask how the weekend was or what the students do after school. My chemistry teacher is so a person. He talks with us about his dog and his hole life. Every student likes him and his lessons. 

It is important that a teacher has good knowledge of his subjects.
The teacher must give the hole information of his subject to the students. Students need this, because they want to write their "Abitur" in this subject. My chemistry teacher is nice, but he doesn't gives us enough information for being prepared well for exams or tests. 
The teacher are often more strict than nicer teacher. But this is okay, you don't want a teacher as a friend, you want him or her as a teacher. 

I find, both is important for a perfect lesson. The teacher must be nice to the students, but he shouldn't forget that we aren't his friends, we are his students. He must give us enough information for our hole life. But a good relationship to his teacher is important, too. What does it mean for you, when you have the bestknowing teacher in the subject, when the teacher doesn't likes anyone of you? Nothing. When I should choose between a  good related teacher and a teacher with exellent knowledge, I would always choose the second one. I am in school for learning things for the rest of my life and not for finding a new friend in form of my teacher. At the end, he must always be an authorizity person, standing over the Students.
