To be a teacher one needs a high education. For this reason teachers normally don't have any troubles with the subject they teach and are generally knowledgeable. However it is more important that they can relate with the students and create interesting lessons. This is because of the student's motivation, the interesting lessons but only if the teacher doesn't give false information.

Firstly, teachers that relate well with students are able to motivate them. This is crucial for their education since motivated students benfit more from the classes. They are more willing to study and do their homework. Of course it is very important that children enjoy going to school.

Additionally, an interesting lesson is easier to follow. There are many teacher who just talk during the whole lesson and at some point the students aren't able to concentrate anymore. It is very difficult to take something from a boring lesson.

However, the teachers still have to know enough about their subject. A teacher who is liked by all of the students but doesn't give the right information is not very qualified. Nowadays they have a higher education and need certain qualifications so the knowledge shouldn't be a problem.

In conclusion, it is most important that teachers can motivate their student and relate with them. A good teacher seperates himself from the other teachers by his ability to work with children and not by his knowledge. Because who enjoys going to boring classes?
