It's a fact, that there's a lot of television advertisments that are designed to appeal children, even young toddlers between the age of two and five years. They are usually aired on television channels that aim toward such a young public.
But is it okay to influence people with the power of media from such a young age?

There are positive aspects, especially in economical terms. Children will see a product while watching TV, and feel the desire to own it because the promoters on the screen told them that the just-shown product was something they needed. Children who beg their parents to purchase the wanted item (usually some sort of toy) will eventually get it. That means workers are needed to produce and sell the toy which leads to more income amongst workers and in the end to a higher GDP.

On the other hand, there are also negative points, that may affect the child's mental health. For example, the child will be exposed to our societal standards and all their issues. A black child may ask himself why all the 'cool kids' with the amazing toys are white. That could lead to decreasing self-confidence, because that black child doesn't see role models that apply to their appereance and heritage.
Gendered toys could also bewilder all the young viewers because they feel more drawn the the object that is identified with a boy or a girl when they're the opposite sex.

In my opinion, there shouldn't be any advertising of any kind aimed to reach children that age because there is more damage than good done. Also, children in that age shouldn't waste their time sitting in front of the TV watching all those advertisments but much more, go outside and live in a world where they aren't influenced by money-seeking people, as long as they can.
