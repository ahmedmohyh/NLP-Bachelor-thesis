I think this is correct, because if the teacher knows not so much then he is able to learn something new and he has more fun than someone who knows everything and the students fall asleep during the lessons. And it would be great if a teacher has a good working climate during the lessons so the students like to go to his lessons and aren't sad or anoyed if they now they will have a lesson with this leacher. We have one teacher who thinks he is an walking enzeclopedie and we started to count down how many lesons we will have with him still the end of the school it let us fell better because his lessons are boring, dry and useless. So we hat to go in his lessons and that leads to a bad climate in his classroom so we satrt to thinking of pretending to be ill at the day we have his lessons; If I say it short his lessons are rubbish. And then we have a teacher hwo nows many things but not all an when we know we have him we are happy and we're looking forward to his lesson. He makes some jokes and we have many interesting disscussions. It his lessons nobody falls asleep and even in a test we are not stresst we know we know it and he says we will know the answers. That means ha can interact with us very good and we trust each other. I think this is graet for a teacher because so the students like him and it's not like: "Yeah now we have this lad for the next 3 years. " Its more like: "YES!!, we have this teacher next years my friend told me he is great and the stuff he's teaching is interesting and not like the lessons of ____. (_____=is the boring teacher who has a bad  ability to relate well with his students.)
