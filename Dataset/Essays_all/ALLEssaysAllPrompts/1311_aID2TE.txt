The job of a teacher isn`t that easy sometimes, but the question is on which aspects teachers should focus, 
realting well with students or having the excellent knowledge of the subject. 
Often student have more fun during the lessons while listening to the teacher and work on new things if they have a good relationship with their teacher. If he/she is always kind and make some jokes, most students will have more fun to learn new things. An other importgant aspect is that teachers also have the job to listen to theier students if they have problems. Not only in school, problems at home or with friends can be spoken about too. 
In contrast you have to look on the futur of the students. Mostly they want to get good grades in school to get a good job. A very important aspect during this period of time in school are the teachers who have to teach their students everything they have to know for they finals. The problem begins if teachers haven´t a good or the nessesary knowlegde of the subject they should teach. 
The conclusion is that stundets have to work a lot at home or if school isn´t that important for them, they´ll get bad grades. 
In my opinion both aspects are very important and every teacher has to find a way with both in it while teaching. If they haven´t got a good knowlegde of the subject, for the students it doesn´t matter if the relationship with their teacher is good. On the other hand sometimes students don´t want to learn or work at school if an excellent teacher only tells his material in a monoton and boring lesson and can´t relatewell with students. 
To conclude i would say that it´s important that teachers have a good knowledge but they have to try to teach it in a kind, maybe different and more exciting way and do theier best to have a good relatinship with their students even if some of them may be a little bit annoying or not that intelligent.
