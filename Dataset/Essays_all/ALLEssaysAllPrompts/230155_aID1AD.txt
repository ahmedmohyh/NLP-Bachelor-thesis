To direct children with your advertise can be very effective. You create a dream in their little world and they will do everything to reach it. They beg their mother and father, they think the whole day of it. And, in fact, there can be consequences until they are adults.They loved gelly bears when they were kids. They loved the funny pictures in TV and they will buy for themselves even gelly bears when they're standing in front of a big big sortiment.
So in my opinion it's a big manipulation behind television advertising wanted to be seen by little kids. It's not a fair step of the concerns and it's a way to change childrens' live only to get some more money. When children can't get what they are introduced to want, they become very sad or even mad. It's like all the other kids around you have this special toy and only you poor child aren't able to get it.
But in the other way around I don't think that it should be forbidden. People who are designing advert should decide on their own if they want influence the childhood of many kids. If it is okay to drill children to like something only to have some more profit. And if it would be forbidden: The big firmas will find another way to get what they want. But the parents should learn to avoid to much TV-looking of the children. They should give them an alternative: For example go for a walk in the nature and spend time with their children. Or they play a game with each other.
So in the end I would not want to forbid advertising toward young children, but it would be great if the social environnement is organized, that the influence is very little to this young kids.
