Many children are watching TV daily. The time goes faster and the parents don't have to care about them. Television has a big influence to the children. They can be scared of a movie, impressed by a hero or even learn something about the life. 

Near to all TV shows, movies and so on, are interrupted by advertising. They can be good or bad, adventurous or stupid. 
The advertises are good for the business, the children see some sweets or a doll and the want to have it. They ask there parents to buy this stuff until they get it. Without television advertising many factories would be closed.

The advertises are sometimes very long, so the children get bored. They just want to watch something and all fiveteen minutes the show or the movie will be interrupted by adverising. In this time the children switch to another channel and maybe even forget the show or movie they are actually watching. But it gives also children who turn off the TV when the advertise start and do something better and healthier like going outside or make homework.

So many television advertises are dangerous for the children. They see a man who can fly or somone who swims with a crocodile. The risk is big, that the children are impressed by that and want to try it out by themselves. That is very bad and dangerous.

I think advertising is important for the big business. But I think also they are in the shows and movies for young children not nessecairy. Advertises can have many influences about their life. They are young and hava a lot to learn. But it gives many better solutions to learn about something important about the life than TV andvertises. I know that it's probably impossible to watch TV without advertises. But maybe they can be at the end or at the beginning of a show or a movie, so the children would be less bored or animated to something they shouldn't do.
