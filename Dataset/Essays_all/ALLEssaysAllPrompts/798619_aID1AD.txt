I see the point of the statement. I think in the age of two to five young children don't have the ability to decide on their own what they need in their life. So the kids don't see what is really behind the advertising. They don't see that most of the products costs a lot of money and they don't know that you have to work really hard to get  lot of money. So as a result, the children don't take care to the stuff and break them because they take them for granted.
Another point is that it takes also a lot influence of the child. As soon as they see a good tool in the advertising they want it. Those high needs are for parents a big pressure because they want to give the childrens only the best stuff but they can't do it all the time. But I have to say that I also see the other side of the statement. There are many brands which are making products only for children. I think if it's forbidden to do television advertising most brands don't get enough money because there are less consumer. A second point is that every brand should have the same rights. It shouldn't matter if the brand are selling products for young children or adults. My opinion is that you have to find a good balance. I agree that the children take the stuff for granted and they should learn that the playtools costs a lot of money. But that the whole television advertising isn't allowed anymore is in my opinion an overreaction. Those brands have to life of something and it wouldn't be fair if they have other rights than other companys. I think also that the parents can look that the child don't watch tv. So they don't have to be afraid anymore of unrealistic needs. All parents should rule it on their own. They are responsible for their own kids.
