Many young children get confronted with advertising while watching television. Wether this should be allowed or not is a controversial question. In this essay I'm going to present some aspect in relation with this question and in the end I'm going to present my personal opinion.

It seems totally normal that we watch advertisments on television so why should it be bad for children. First of all most of the children don't understand some of the adverts, this can be considered good or bad, for example when It's an inappropriate advert for children they might not mind the advert or and that would be a negative aspect, they go question their parents and theydon't know how to explain the inappropriate content of the advert to a young child. 
Let's now take a look at "normal" adverts like for example about some toys for kids. Advertising is an established part of the "televisonal experience" and children might even learn something watching them. Why shouldn't the children see what kind of toys exist and which they could might wish for their birthday or something. On one hand Out of the view from companies who sell toys those adverts directed to young children are very important as they are potential costumers. On the other hand there is some sort of manipulation of these kids and they want to be part of this society of consumption.
Furthermore they might get an illusorical imagination of things, as there are a lot of adverts which for example show toys who come to life.

In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist. On top of that these young kids get introduced to a society of consumption which is n't good
