A teacher who teaches well is everybodys dream, but what ability's are important to become this teacher? Thats a question that is controversely disguste by many people. There is a statement that "A teacher's ability to relate well with studens is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.", but is it truth?

It is important for a teacher to have the ability to relate to students. Because if he can relate to the students he understand what difficulties they maid have by learning the subject. so he can talk to them and find a way with them so they can learn somthing and mabye find intresst in the subject. So there is no need for  excellent knowledge of the subject. 

But there is a problem if the teacher only can relate to the students, but has not very good knowledge of the subject, he doesen't need excellent knowledge but a good knowledg is necessary. If he doesen't have it then he can't teach it very good because he only knows the surface off the topic but hasen't a deeper knowledge. So he maid not be abel to answer difficult questions from the students. 

On the other hand a teacher who has an excellent knowledge of a subject, but can unterstand whats maid be difficult to understand for students, also can teach the subject well. He maid have the knowledge but can't explain it to the sudents, so they won't learn anyything.

 If you only can relate to the students, they won't learn anything because you don't understand the subject as the teacher. But if you only know the subject and can't understand the students, they also won't learn anything. I think both qualities are important to be make good teacher.
