During the life, a person earns a lot of knowledge by making mistakes and by making it better the next time. Every person learns from experiences he or she made, from adventures he or she had and from spending time for thinking about things in life. As more experiences as you make, as more you build your own opinions about things in life. Children between two and five years don't have a lot of experiences. They still live in their own world where everything is great and sweet and they don't know any danger or influencing people or advertisment. They believe almost everything you tell them. In case of that a television advertising which is directed toward young children makes no sense and shouldn't be allowed because they're too naïve and to young to make own decisions. I would say a young boy aged three years would be scared about a telephone call with a unknown person who wants to sell a him something! First of all the child would ask itsself why this unknown person wants a telephone conversation with him and not with his parents as usual.
The seller would just use this little guy for making money by influencing him with fascinating toys and sweet animals. It's so much easier to influence young children than adults, because adults know that the unknown person at the telephone promises false facts about the product he wants to sell. I absolutely don't agree with this statement. 
It's not only unfair for the young children, I'm sure that also parents wouldn't be fascinated about a television advertising which is directed toward their children. 
Otherwise it's very intelligent of the unknown person to influence young children with their call. They really know how to make money...

But I'm still against a television advertising towards young children.
