Teachers have to know, what they are teaching. But in  my opinion, the ability ro relate with students and to understand  the is even more important.
We're spending very much time with teachers, at least seven hours a day. Their aim is to make us understand the subject that they are teaching and to make us think about it. But what if a student doesn't understand anything at all? Imagine a math teacher, trying to explain a difficult exercise. It's good that he knows the anwer and how to get to it, but if he can't explain it good enough, the student won't learn it.
But it's not just teaching, it's also the relation between student and teacher. If a student has a problem, it's important that a teacher tries to help him and tries to understand him. If someone comes to school once a week, he has a reason for that. The teacher should talk to him and try to find a solution. The student is bullied by another student or can't concentrate in school or has problems with another teacher,the teacher should be able to help his student. It's nice to know the complete periodic system by heart and to be able to analyze difficult poems, but if you can't explain your students how to do it themselves or if you are not able to help students who are having problems, then you should've rather work as a scientist or a professional poem analyzer than as a teacher. Because teaching is not just knowing much, it's also knowing how to undestand and help your students.
