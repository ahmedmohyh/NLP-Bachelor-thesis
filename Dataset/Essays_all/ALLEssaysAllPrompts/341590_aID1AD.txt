In my opinion it should be allowed. Because it isn't a big thing and if the partens of the children allow them to watch television, they'll know that it will also have advertisement. And also an advertisment won't do anything to a child. If the parents think it would do something to a child or has some bad influences, they don't need to allow them to watch television. Advertisement sometimes also can help to learn something new. Watching television isn't a bad thing at all. Children have bigger possibilities to experience many new things and they may learn from it.

Some people may think that television advertisement is something  bad. The children want to buy this and that. And maybe the children will get addicted to the things which are shown in the television. They may want to buy more and more and won't accept if the parents won't buy them the things shown in the advertisements. And because children aren't that smart yet, the people who make the advertisements can trick them and just make the children more stupid than they already are. 

In the whole I think it should still be allowed. But I can understand if some parents are afraid that television advertisement make the children even more stupid and that they won't learn anything from it. But it isn't dangerous or anything like that. It's just unneccessary. No one needs it. The parents should decide if their children should be allowed watching this but no one else.
