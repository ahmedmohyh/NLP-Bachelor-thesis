It's less important to interact well with the students then to learn them the subjec but the teacher schould unterstand that he can't teach his students the subject without any interaction . If the students don't unterstand what the teacher want them to know its hard for them to understand the subject. The teacher should know the basics to relate well with his studentss or people generally. A teacher who can't relate with his studens will be hated and the students don't learn anything in his lessons because in their opinion is the teacher bad and can't explain the subject, so they don't pay attention  because they think every word that the teacher speaks doesn't make sens.

A perfect teacher is a friendly person who is interessted in his subject and knows everything about it. This teacher schould know the knowlegde about the ability to relate well with his students. With this tips he will be a successful teacher.
