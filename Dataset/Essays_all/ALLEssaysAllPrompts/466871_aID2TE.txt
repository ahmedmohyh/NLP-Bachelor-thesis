I don't agree with the statement, because excellent knowledge is more important.
I mean it's important to understand the students and to relate well with them, but it's also important to know and understand the subject. There are many students that get on well with the teacher, but don't have any knowledge of the subject being taught. They think they could get a better mark if they get on well with the teacher, but that's totally wrong. It's their own fault. It's a problem if the teacher doesn't get on well with the students, because if the student gets a bad mark, he could think that it is because they don't get on well together. And if the student hasn't got any idea of the subject, but the teacher gives him a better mark than he deserves... well that's also a problem. 
So I think both of them is important. A teacher has to get on well with the students and has to have a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because if the teacher doesn't know what he has to explain and learn to the students, the students don't learn anything and it's not their fault. 
But the students also have to show attention in the lessons. But there is something, that mustn't be. The students doesn't have to like the teacher, but have to give more attention in the lessons.
