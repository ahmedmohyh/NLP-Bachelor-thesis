Is it better to have a teacher that knows more about his subject than relating with his students or a teacher that knows better to relate with his students than having knowledge in his subject?

Firstly, it would make no sense to have a teacher who can work great with his students but he could not teach them anything because he does not know something in his subject. It is more important to learn something in school than having a nice teacher who relates with you well. 
But on the other hand, a teacher who relates better with his students can learn them much more than a severe teacher. Because if you have a teacher who is nice and treats you good and make jokes and everything, you have fun to go to his lessons. You sit there and enjoy every minute not like in other lessons where it is boring because of the teacher and you watch all five seconds on the clock in hope it is over. And when you have fun you learn much more easier the things your teacher says during the lessons.

It is important that the teacher can relate with the students but also that he has knowledge of his subject. There is no point in lisening to somebody who is nice and all but has no idea what he is talking about and then you walk out of the classroom with no new knowledge. But it is also no point in listening to a teacher who just talks about his subject and does nothing interesting for the student. He just talks and does not really care about his students and if they are listening, I mean it is there problem if they are not listening and then write bad marks. In my opinion you have to find the golden middle. A teacher who can relate to his students but also knows what he is saying. The more of each, the better. But I think the knowledge is a little bit more important because the students have to learn something, not just hanging around and learn nothing but have a great time with a cool teacher.
