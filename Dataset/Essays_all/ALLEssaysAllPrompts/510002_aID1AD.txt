Today many children want some things like toys because they saw it in an advertising between two series on the kids channel. These toys aren't things they really wanted to have before and for sure don't need. But because it was so well shown in the advertising, they think the toy is really cool. Therefore it would make sense, if the advertising is forbitten on kids channels.
The first point is that they really don't need all the stuff from the advertisements. If the kids see an advertising, they think that they couldn't live anymore without having this toy. They imagine how cool it would be to use it. But as often, the toy isn't that great in reality as it was in the advertisement when the child actually gets the toy. It is a waste of money for the parents and the kids are sad because it isn't what they expected it to be.
Of course you can say that the advertising shouldn't catch the kids' atention. In fact it should be a lecon for them that they can't get whatever they think would be cool. It should be the parents' task to teach the children, it is important to learn to not get everything.
But they can learn this lecon of life in an other way. For example seeing another kid's toys. The kid really wants the toy too but the parents say no and learns how to deal with not getting everything they want.
As my conclusion I think it would be good if the advertising on television isn't allowed for young children.
