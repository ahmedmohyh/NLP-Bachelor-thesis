Television advertising is already a big and controversial topic but advertisments for children that are two to five years old are even more controversial. There are a lot of reasons for and against those advertisments but just some of them will be discussed in the following text.

  First the advertisments help the children to get used to the media they will use when they get older. Because of television ant its advertisments the young children will get an impression of how the technology works and what it is for. 
The information they get leads to a better view on how the things they will be confronted with really are which helps them to make their decisions.
  On the other hand the use of media can lead to a dependence on media and especially on television ant its advertisments. 
Furthermore the young children will not be able to see the differences between true and false because of the mass of information they are confronted with. This is also an influence on their decisions that leads to the question if their decisions really remain their own decisions.

To sum up television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because they would be influenced to much by the information they would get. 
In my opinion media is no bad thing but in such a young age children should rather play outside with other children than watching television and advertisments. They should learn about both sides but not when they are that young, they should stay independent from media as long as they can.
