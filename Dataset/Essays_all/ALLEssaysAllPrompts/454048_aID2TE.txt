I think it is very important that a teacher knows what he talks about, but this doesn't has any use to the students, when the teacher isn't able to teach. The teacher has to be on a similare wave-lenght as the students, so that he knows whats up in our minds, he has to understand the difficulties we go through day-by-day. Most of us want to learn but we also want to feel the teachers exitement when he talks about the things he tries to teach us. As a example, we have a teacher at our school, he knows very well what he talks about, but he can't really teach, he's not very good at tie us to the subject and he isn't an autorithere person, so most students do what ever they want to do in his lesson. It's sad in his case it would be a benefit if he had a better ability to relate to us and just make his subject more interessting to us. On the other hand there is a teacher at our school who is great at understanding us, but we are not always sure, if he knows exactly what he talks about. my favorite teachers have all something in common, they talk with great exitement about their subject and are also able to relate very well with us. So my opinion on this topic is, that both things are needed and when a teacher can do both, I guess then you found a really great teacher. And a great teacher is able to bring out the most of his students.
