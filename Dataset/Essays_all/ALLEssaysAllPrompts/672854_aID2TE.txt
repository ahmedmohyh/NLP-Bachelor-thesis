Teachers

It is often said that teachers need to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught and that they should be able to relate well with students, but in fact most teachers can not have both of it. 

It is important to have an excellent knowledge because you should be abel to talk about the subject without any failures and you should know more about the subject than your stundents. But I think it depends on the age of the children you are teaching. If you are teaching young children you might be a better teacher while realting well with stundents and motivate them. Because they need to learn how to behave in society and how they have to treat each other etc. But if you teach older students than it is more important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject because those students know how to behave in soiety and they do not need a teacher who shows them how social competences works. They are here to learn something new and they want to see a teacher who knwos exactly what he is talking about.

So you can not say that one point is more important than the other because it depends on who you are teaching. You should have both of it on a high level to be a good teacher. A good mix between a teachers ability to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge of the subject is important. If you only have one of this two point you maybe choose the wrong job because you are not able to teach somebody something knew.
