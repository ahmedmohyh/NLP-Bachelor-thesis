This statement maybe depends a little bit on in wich grade you're discussing it. In an elementry school a teacher with a good relation to the stundents is probably more important than in college. Working with children in this young age is still about education, too. later school is mostly about marks and studying and the distance between teacher and stundents's getting bigger. Since school is about learning things in diffrent directions like science, languages and arts, a teacher with a pretty good knowledge is really important. Also for questions or special, extremly intrested students a teacher that knows a lot about his subjects is good to have. For other students, the bit weaker ones, a teacher that has a good relation to them can really be a help, cause he's probably better at explaining things to them at least what he knows about the subject. So I'd say it depends in someway on the student in which way he's getting the topic easier. I think a good teacher has to be able to treat stundents nicely, has to care about them and help them with their difficulties and it is important to be well informed as a teacher about the own subject. I'm personally happy when my teacher explains things shortly and clearly and you get that he knows what he's saying. If they aren't able to relate well with us I don't care much. But when I was younger I did.
