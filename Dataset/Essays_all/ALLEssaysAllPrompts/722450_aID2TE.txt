To be able to relate to their students is a very valuable trait of teachers. But is it as important as excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
In order to be efficient, a teacher has to know his students' abilities and weaknesses and be able to adapt his way of teaching. For example, when he senses that the class does not have any motivation on a particular day, he can shorten his learning objectives for the day in order to make learning more efficiently for the students. The ability to relate is therefore very important, otherwise a bad atmosphere can be developped, which makes learning very hard. 
But without fully knowing and understanding the subject one teaches, it is not possible to transmit that information to another person, or even to a whole class. Especially when the teacher is fascinated of his subject, he can tell his students about it more authentically and enthusiastically which creates interest. In the best case, he gets the students to be as fascinated and excited as he is. ¨
In conclusion, having an excellent knowledge of one's  subject is a great deal more important than being able to relate to the students. Because if you don't know what you're talking about, there is nothing you can teach to anyone.
