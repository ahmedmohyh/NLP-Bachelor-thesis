Advertising is a very contradictory subject and there exist many diffrent opinions about it. Should television advertising directed towards young children be allowed or not?

The factories, who sell the goods, which are in an advertising, make a lot of money with it, because children want to have the things, which they see in adverts and often they evan manage to persuade their parents to buy them. It brings though much profit to the factories.

Secondly, the state would influence the privat live of people, which would contradict the freedom of everyone to do, what they want.

On the other hand, children are very manipulative and advertisments, which they watch, have a big influence on them. They do not realize, that advertising often doesn not show the reality, but a better picture of a product. Childern believe everything, what they hear and they are not able to distinguish between reality and lies. If they see for example an advertising, which they like, they want to have the product without thinking of its downsides. 

The whole lot of advertisments for children makes it very difficult for their parents too, because their children always want to have the products, which they see in the advertising.The parents then always have to expain them, why they do not buy them these things.

Another reason not to allow advertisments for children,is, that this confronts them very early with materialism. We live in a very material society nowadays, but the children should not learn this materialist attitude too early.

Despite the fact that advertisments are good for the economy and a prohibition of advertising would contradict the freedom of everyone to do, what they want, it would be much better for the children not to be confronted with advertising, because it has a bad influence on them.
