First of all I think both abilities are very important, the ability to relate well with students and a good knowledge of the subject which is being taught. In the statement they talk about "excellent" knowledge of the subject. But what is "excellent" knowledge? Does it mean the teacher knows everything and every aspect of the subject? Does he have to know every little part of the subject which is being taught? The advantage of an excellent knowledge would be enormous. He could answer every question students ask and explain the subject very well. It's certainly more interesting for the students listening to a teacher who has a wide knowledge. The teacher could explain things in different ways with a lot of variety. So is there a bad thing about having excellent knowledge? Maybe it could be boring, for the teacher himself and for the students. If the teacher already knows everything he doesn't have to prepare himself for class. Also in discussions he would know every time the correct answer. This would be very annoying for the students and they will become unmotivated.So the question is, is it more important for a teacher to relate well with students? An advantage is surely, that there would be always a good atmosphere. There wouldn't be any childish arguments with the teacher. But maybe if the teacher relates too well with students, they might lose respect and the teacher his authority. So it's important, that there's a good balance. In the end there are more positive aspects in having an excellent knowledge than in relate well with students. I disagree with the statement. In my opinion it is more important to have a good knowledge. This is also very personally, I just don't like if the teacher wants to be my "friend".
