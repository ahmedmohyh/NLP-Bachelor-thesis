On the one hand, having a teacher that relates to students is always nice. One can learn easier, when the a teacher makes his lessons more understandable and more on your level of viewing the world. But if the downside on the other hand is that they do not have an excellent knowledge of the subject, or can not explain something one can only do with great knowledge, there is no point in being in their class. A teacher should have some  professional distance to their students, because they have to grade them. Having said that, one can understand the importance of a good fitting teaching style. It can bring you closer to the subject or, controversial to what is written above, help you in understanding things and just realising stuff, like Kylie Jenner did this year. In my humble opinion, there is a need for both of these abilities. Being #relatable is not only good for making memes but also for teaching students. But being relatable does not cover the fact of lacking knowledge. It needs both.
 Ideally, one should learn in school. And having a teacher with excellent knowledge of a subject is a good  start, but the student has to do the work. They have to learn and understand. So personally, I would rather have a teacher with an excellent knowledge than a teacher being just relatable. Let us face it: School should not be fun. Thankfully it is not.
