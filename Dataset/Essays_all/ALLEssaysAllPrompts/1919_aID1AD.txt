I will talk about the question if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

On the one hand it is very important for the success of firms to have advertisment on TV because you can reach the most people. It is clear that they need advertisment for younger people too because there are a lot of products for younger people. 
Also it is very important because there are TV shows for children and it makes no scence to show products for older people in the advertisment between the shows. No one will pay for older people advertisment between younger people Tv shows.
 On the other hand it is not good because it is easy to impress younger people and so they want to have what the saw in TV. The manipulate the young children because they can not understand that this is only advertisment. Maybe the product is non-scences but in the advertisment it looks very good and maybe funny when it is something to play with.

All in all I think that advertisment for young children should be allowed because without the advertisment for young children there can not be Tv shows for them. Also you do not have to let your children watch the advertisment.
