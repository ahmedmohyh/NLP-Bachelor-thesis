Today there are lots of televison advertising directed toward different targetgroups. Should be television advertising directed toward young children allowed? In this Essay we will give an answer.
   Concerns need advertising to sell their products. If they couldn´t sell their products they won´t make other product for children and haven´t money for those people work in this concern. So at least the concern will close and lots of people lose their jobs.
In advertising it´s never said that children have to buy the product of a concern. But with special effects and wrong arguments they want that children think, they need to buy those products. 
   Fistly the concerns often lieng about their products and these products were shown better and cooler than they are in an advertising in a televison. The "Kids" don´t see these false facts and just see what is cool on the product. Secondly children haven´t money on their own. They need money by the parents. Young children even don´t know the meaning behind money. They haven´t the answer for the question how expensive are 100$ or how much cents are 1$. Another argument is, they can not understand or find out what is good for their own or what is bad for their healthy. They need everytime the opinion by the parents.
   At least you can say that it is better to target parents for products for childrens because they can find and think about the negative and positive facts of a product. Who can understand his children better than the parents. There are just parents who know what is healthy and good for theri children.
