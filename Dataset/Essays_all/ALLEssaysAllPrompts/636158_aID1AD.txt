When we are children we look up to our idols and we try to be like them. Maybe some of our idols are on television but are they always the best for us.
Our parents can watch with us tv and they can control if we are watching something that is no good for us then it depends on the parents. Maybe they see some kind of things they not know before. Plays, dolls or brands for children's sake in case of the parents are newbies they might be relieved for some advertising about them.
But on the other hand children are very easy to manipulate. They're young and take up everything like a sponge if they're interested.The main cause why young people are into having sex or watching porn is because there are always some kind of naughty scenes in advertising. Maybe not in advertising directed towards young children but there are others. Children's advertising manipulate to buy those dolls, plays and games because children want to.
I think parents should look after their children and what they watch. Television is a new form of ''let the children play'' so parents can relax. There are so many children who are addicted to electronic gadgets and their parents don't want to do anything. Their children're getting more and more unsociable. My opinion is parents should more look after their children and play with them outside than watching tv.
