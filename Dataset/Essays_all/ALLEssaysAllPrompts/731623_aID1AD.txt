These statement is really hard and strict. I think it is impossible to stop the television advertising because the companies want to start by the young children with their advertisement. So the children can nerve their parents and get the things they wanted. Without the direct advertisements on television, they can't explore the world in this way so fast. They see everywhere advertisements, why should it get forbidden on the television?

On the other side I understand these statement completely. Parents know that advertisments are bad for development of their child and make unsatisfied. They sorrow theirselves and want, that their chidren can look television without the advertisements. Because to buy all these things would be very expensive. 

At least my opinin is that parents should not allow their children to look to the television alone when they are so young. The parents should have the control. They can play outdoor with friends and have fun. So it is a desicion for each family individully. I think the advertisements are not bad, but the television should not show too much of them.
