There has always been a big discussion about education and what is important when it comes to the question how things should be taught.

You could say that it is in the pupils interest to get the best education possible, for them to be able to sustain in the working world. There for i would say it is important to have a teacher who has a great knwledge about the subject.

But if the teacher can't connect with his pupils he barely won't be able to transfer his knowledge to his students. I as a student myself can totally say that i am also more motivated to study for a subject if the teacher has a good connection with us students because i would also say that i am more attentive if someone i like or think is sympathetic talks in front of us students. If i don't like a teacher because of various reasons like not having a big social competence or not being able to respect their students, i would say that they have chosen the wrong profession. Because a teacher should of course know their subject and be passionate about but if you are not good with people i wouldn't recommend to go into this profession.

So as to say i do think that it's true that a teachers ability to relate with students is more important than knowing everything about their subject.
