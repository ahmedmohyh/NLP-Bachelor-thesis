You could say that in today's society it is important to go with the trend, even with children's toys. It is early developed wether your child is liked by other or not, which often is connected on what toys they play with. If a freind of your child has the cooler toy your child wants it too and if you do not buy it, the friend maby does not want to play with your son or daughter anymore, because his toys are boring. So not buying advertised toys could cause bullying in early age. But I disagree with this statement, beacuse advertisments directed to children do not have a serious effect on the amount of sold products advertised. The children aged two to five are not old enough to understand whats going on. They do not understand that this is an advertisement. In the end they like the product, but it is their parents who get to decide wether they buy the product or not. Also children aged two to fie should not watch TV so often, especially not children younger than four. They hardly learned speaking and understanding what the people say, for example swiss children, who grow up speaking swissgerman until thei go to school. Mostley the children aged two to four do not even understand the language used in TV as it is in german, not swissgerman. And if they do not understand it, why let them watch it? So the advertisments are uneffectful, unless the parents decide to buy the product which isadvertised.
