In this essay I will controverse the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students  is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. According to my opinion I do not agree and do not disagree with this statement.
It's not really the teacher's duty to teach their subject perfect, but they should know it very well. But its also not the most importent thing to have a good relationship to the students. When a teacher only talks a lot about his life with the students than maybe they have fun and a good relationship, but students go to school to learn something. Otherwise a teacher shouldn't just talk the whole lesson without asking questions or even worse without answering needed guestions.
So I think that both things rely on each other. Because when a teacher teaches math (we konw it's one of the most problematic subjects) he has to know his class. Through communication he get to know the students and with them their problems, so he needs the ability to relate well to teach the subject well.
In the most classes there are desperations between the students. A good teacher should decrease them. It's not that easy to be a teacher when you should have all these qualities. That is why I think that the most teacher just teach their subject and don't give attention to students which are less good in school.
This point also leads to the assumption that both qualities are very important. 
In the first grades maybe therelationship is more important because kids are too young to handle everything by themself. Otherwise, when you study at a university, the excellent knowledge is more needed because you are an adult and need the knowledge further for work but as a student like we are both qualities are important.
