Advertising to children up to five years is a quite questionnable method. If a producer launches a new toy for small children it wouldn't be intelligent to advertise to adults since they aren't potential customers. The advertisement has to be directed to the target persons and those are of course small children. 
The question that we have to ask is now: Is it correct to use the children's inability to think by themselves what is necessary to have and what isn't? The problem is that their age is to young to estimate if the quality of a toy is comparable according to the price? Children want to have everything that looks new and interesting and the toy producer knows that he can make profit due to the fact that small children are easy to influence by a television advertising. But this thought-provoking method isn't just a bad way to gain more profit. We shouln't forget that children by themselves can't do a lot. Their parents have decide what is good and what is not necessary for their child. Advertising to children is in this view not worse than normal advertisement. Sure, adults are less easy to influence but on the other is the children advertising not profitable if the parents don't buy the product. The rate that an adult will buy a product for themselves is probably higher than that would buy a toy for their unconscious child.
