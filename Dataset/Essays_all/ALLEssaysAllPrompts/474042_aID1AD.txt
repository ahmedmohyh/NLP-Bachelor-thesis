Today more and more children are watching TV at home. The parents are often at work and have no time for their kids. The easiest way is to leave the kids infront of the televesion. The Kids are busy in this moment. But between the shows it have advertising spots extra made for young children. Is it correct to make this kind of television advertising for young kids?

Because of the television advertising spots a kid comes in contact with the modern ways to communicate. It's maybe easier to understand and the kid learns the easy to speek.

The way a kid speak in their freetime depends on how much they watch TV.

The Television adevertising influence the mind of a young kid. A kid at this age should more think at themselve. It can't be the right way to manipulate a kid. 

In my opinion kids aged two to five shouldn't watch TV. The Television advertising influence their mind. We should let them be kids with their own mind and opinion. They should play outside with friends.
