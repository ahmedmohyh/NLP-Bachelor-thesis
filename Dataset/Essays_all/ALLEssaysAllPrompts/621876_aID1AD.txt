Nowadays it doesn't matter where you are, everywhere you are confronted with advertising especially in television. In our society also young children are included, they raise with the endless advirtising. On tv channels which are made for children, they show advertising which are especially directed toward young children.

A negative aspect of advertising towards young children is that it can increase the wish of receiving presents from their parents. When they are about to watch a tv serie for children, it's not possible that they won't watch the advertising too. They see toys, games and other stuff in the advertising which they automatically want to receive from their parents. They would not have wanted it if they have not watched the things in the advertising.

Television advertising towards young children can also be positive. It can influence their behaving in a good way. When they watch an advertising about a toy, they don't just see the toy for itself, they also see how children play together with it and how they treat eachother. Through that children can learn social competences and learn early how you have to behave yourself in our society.

In my opinion this statement is true. There are a lot of other ways how they can learn how to behave, for example when they play outside with their friends. Nowadays everything is digitalisised and i do not think that also that learning has to pass throug television. Advertisig can have a big impact of our lives and children will be confronted early enough with advertising when they grow up. To conclude, television advertising directed toward young children should be forbitten and on tv channels for children should only be the series withour advertising in between.
