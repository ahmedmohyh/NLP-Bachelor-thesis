Television advertising 

So much people say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. But is this correct and does the advertising influence the education of the children or is this just a little danger? 

First of all, children are very credent and the companys know that. They can influence the children with beautiful pictures or toys. The children don't understand the reason of advertising and believe everything you tell them, for exemple the lie with the "toothfee". The kids would be manipulated to buy a thing or change their opinion for the rest of their life.

The companys have the law to direct every televison advertising to everyone they want. One of their reason to make children advertising is that the parents should look after their children and decide what they should watch or not. It's also nice for the companys because the children are very easy to influence and manipulate. 

In my opinion the television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because the children can't imagine what happens with their decision they do. It's also bad that the companys do that because they just look for their money and nothing more.
