Lately, there has been the discusion, whether it is more important for a teacher to relate well with students than having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. There are several arguments on both sides.

Firstly, if a teacher can relate to students, it can help improving the lessons. The teachers can prepare their subject, considering the preferations of the students. The students may have better trust to the teacher, because he can relate to them and, consequently, is a part of the class itself. Therefore, the students can talk to them and maybe, they can even help to improve the lessons. Moreover, the students could be less afraid to tell their concerns related to the school to their teacher, because they see them more as equal to them than in a higher position.
However, these arguments are based on mere possibilities and are not necessary to teach well. A teacher can relate perfectly with students, but can still teach bad. The main goal of the school is still to learn something from the students point of view. For that, a basic relationship to the teacher is enough. The teacher does not have to relate well with students as long as they can teach well. A good lesson is the basis for the students to learn the knowledge of the subject, and if this knowledge is being teached bad, the students have a bad basis for their studies. 

To sum it all up, the relation between student and teacher can be the best, but if their teaching still remains bad, the students does not benefit from it and get bad marks.Therefore, a teacher's ability to relate with students is less important than excellent knowledge of their subject, because it is all about learning this subject, the teacher is trying to teach. Thus, i disagree with the statement.
