One part thinks the reasen for bad marks is, that they aren't being taught well. The other part thinks they have bad marks because the teacher doesn't like them.

If there is a good relation between the students and the teacher they have a good working climate. So the students can concentrate well and they may have good marks. But if they have a good atmosphere and nobody understands something, this doesn't help anybody. In this case the knowledge of the teacher is more important.

If the students don't like the teacher, but they are being taught well, the bad relationship doesn't matter. They even learn something and they can write good marks.

In my opinion the excellent knowledge of the subject is much more important. Because the students don^t learn something if they get well with their teacher, but the teacher doesn't know about what he is talking.
The most ideal case is, when the students get well with their teacher and the teacher has a bride knowledge of the subject being taught.
