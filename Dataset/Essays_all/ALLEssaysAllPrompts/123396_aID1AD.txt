I am agree withe this statement. It isn't good for the young children to do such things, because the have to discover the world and play with other children. It is important that thys young people can see many things on the world. So the can have there one live. It can't bee good to seat infront of the television the howl day. I think it is the answer whey so many peoble habe a glasses. The scream of the electrony things isn't good for the eyes ant the body. On the television you see many fiction things, that can't bee real in the world we live. 

Children should play with other children. Therer can be a conflict and they must find a answer for the problem. In real situation the children must find one answer to problems for example they cray or say something when they are hungry. On the TV are satch situation don't showed to thechildren. The people on the TV live in a ficten world. There are offenshoerd problems, witch arent important in ouer live. But the real problems aren't showen. 

It is alsow important that children learn things from older people. The television schowed many things, but we don't realy now if this things are right. The young children should learn things from the parents and they have to go to school, so the chan learn thing that are importent. For example write, read, and other things the can learn in the school. 

For me there are many reacens whey children sholudn't do that. It is important that the parents say that to the children then they have tolearn the right things. In the age of 2-5 the children don't now what in right and what is wrong. So the parents and other people of the familie like the older sister or brother can help the young children to finde the right way and the right answer. This is my opinian.
