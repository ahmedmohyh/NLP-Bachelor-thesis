The question about the teacher's abilty is very important, because the learn-effect is different with teachers of each thip of it.   
I'm going to start with the pro argument, so that the teacher is relate well to his/her students then a teacher. It is important for a teacher to relate well with his students, because I think they are paying more to him then to teachers, who are really good in their theme, they are writing something at the backboard and nobody interest for what he/she is doing, so that the students are bored.
For the contra argument, a teacher, who is really good in his subject, it is more interesting for the students and I think easier to get the hang of the subject.
I think it's the statement is correct but at some point is it more important to have an man /woman, who is good in his subject, like at the matura or something like that.
