I'm agree with the following statement that television advertising directed toward young children in the age between two to five should not be allowed.

In this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff. It's right that little children in the age between two to five don't understand much about a lot of things but I think that the television advertising would influence them indirect in their growing up.
On the other hand, I think it's alright if there is television advertising especially for their age group but if there's television advertising for teenager/adults it's not okay anymore. 
Television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people. You have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that. They only think "they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel. But you have to see it in a different view, little children maybe know what's going on in this situation and television advertising is sometimes, not always, a part of their growing up.  Maybe they don't understand a lot but they know, or better to say they feel all of that what's happened. 
In my opinion the worse thing and you can't do it aswell is that nobody asks them how they feel or if they want that. All people think of themselves and this is in character very egoistic/selfish.
In conclusion, you see sometimes it is important that television advertising directed toward little children in some cases (if it's not television advertising for adults/teenagers) but summarized it should not be allowed.
