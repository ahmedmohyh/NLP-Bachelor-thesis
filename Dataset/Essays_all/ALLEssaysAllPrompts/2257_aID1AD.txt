In our generation even the smallest ones are looking televison in their freetime and are seeing the ads of all the nice dolls and toys and want to have them too. But is it correct to influence the childreen which are only two to five years old with advertising directed toward them or should it be not allowed?

If you're going in a toy store you can see thousands of different dolls, games or other toys and it is impossible to choose one of those thousands for a present for your child, and if you are going with your child in a store they want to have everything and they aren't able to choose too, but if the childreen see one special toy in an ad they only want to have this one thing and it is much easier for the parents to find a present if the childreen are knowing exactly what their childreen want to have.

But especially young childreen are very easy to influence with ads and if they only see those nice things in an ad it is all what they want and they aren't having an own oppinion, so the ads in televisons are influencing the growment of the childreen in a negative point. In this world we are living is it very important to have an opinion wich is really yours.

Another point is that young childreen aren't always able to understand the difference between reallitty and fiction and it is possible that when they are always looking tv they will use the connection to the real world and they will stop reading books, going outside and playing with friends. They are happy when they are seeing the unicorn dancing in a tv ad and then they are asking themselves wehre to find them outside, because they aren't able to know that unicorns aren't real. 

All in all I think television advertising directed toward young childreen should not be allowed because they have to build their own oppinion and it could be dangerous if their are loosing the connection to the real world.
