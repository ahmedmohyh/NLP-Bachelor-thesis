Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. 
On television theres allways something for everyone. The dads who love car races or the mums who love teleshopping and the teenanger who loves horror and psycho movies and in the end also cute episodes for small kids who like watch spongebob squarepants. But what happens when the small two to five year old children klick to another side and see these disturbing things which they don't understand in this age? 
They are scared and can't sleep anymore because they are just too young for these kind of things. Its dangerous to let a young child watch television alone. There are so many other things they could do instead of always watching television. Television takes the kreativity and the motivation to expolre the world. Only watch television is so easy but its bad. It's bad for the eyes, for the concentration and for the power of a child. These small humans should first of all learn how to do things by themselfs that they don't get bored. In life theres much more than just a dumb television where you only have to klick one thing and it's working. 
But it's also important to say that television also has some good things on it. With television you can just put the littleones in front of and you can do the things you have to do. There are so many diffrent channels for children which are funny and interessting they actually can learn something while watching television. they can nget in touch with the whole world and all different cultures. But is this that you want for you child ?
My opinion is that it's bad to put theire children allways in front of the tv. tThey have to learn and meet so many things and have to get kreative. It's not all about television. It's important to know what you like and have to get used to the whole life outside the house. It's more important to know how to life than to know where the hat of dorie is.
