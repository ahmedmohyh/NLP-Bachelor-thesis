Should advertising directed to toward young children be allowed or not? In this short essay it will be discused if children from two to five years should be directed with advertising that could influence them in positiv or negativ ways.

Firstly, I think young children should not be directed with advertising of any kind because I dont think they will understand the meaning of it. It is hard to know how the children react to this kind of advertising for example an advertising about a shooter games. The children see this advertising and they want to buy this game but in fact it is not good for them. They could get serious issues for their whole life like aggressions. It is clear that the parents play an important role in this case, but for parents it is hard too to say no to their own children.

The second aspect is in general the media influence. Young children should not be confronted with any kind of media because they could get dependent to it. If they watch television every day they can not focus on other important things like going outside and enjoy the time with friends or explore new things in their lives. The television advertising could act like a drug. The children need it everyday and cant get out of this issues.

Lastly, young children should stay away of this trap the companies create to buy their products.

To conclure, I fully disagree the statement that tv advertising toward young children should not be allowed because I think it is a bad influence for the children, who have to explore new things in their lives without any technological influence. Companies should be punished for creating a trap for the children.
