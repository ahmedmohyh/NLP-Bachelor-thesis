I can almost fully agree with the statement, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I agree, that it is very important, that the students feel understood and taken seriously. So, they will like that subject much more, than if the teacher does not really care about his students. But it has to be in mind, that, although the teacher has to have a good connection to the students, he should be enough informed about the sucject being taught and all the misunderstandings that come with it from the students. If he is just not interested in his students, he will not have the same patience with them and will not help them like a supportive teacher would. 

Furthermore, if the relationship between the teacher and the students is positive, the whole atmosphere in class is better. Because the teacher takes his time to explain everything to everybody's understanding. He shows interest and good will. With that, the students have a more positive mind and are more relaxed. That leads to students, that treat each other with more respect, because they just feel better. In comparison to that, there are much more bad vibes in the whole classroom when the teacher does not care so much about them. In class, there is more tension and when it comes to homework, the students are less motivated. They have bad feelings when it comes to that subject, which not so good because maybe, if they had a different teacher, they would like it. That also affects the choices they make later in life, how to continue after school.

In conclusion, it is very important that the teacher goes on well with all his students, also for their good.
