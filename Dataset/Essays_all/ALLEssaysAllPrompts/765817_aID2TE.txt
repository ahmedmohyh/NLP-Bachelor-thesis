I think that it is more important to relate well with studens than excellent knowledge of the subject. But good knowledge is also important. If you know how to speak and to teach well is a big bonus rahter than knowing all about the subject and explain it way to difficult.

When a teacher relates well with his students, they automatically are more interested at this specific subject and learn more for it. It's also cool if you have a teacher who knows how to chill a bit. On the other side: a teacher with perfect knowledge can show you things that 'normal' teachers couldn't. For example divers experiments or just answer every question. 

The atmosphere inside the room is way better with an nice and funny teacher. It's normal that I like studying more. 
With an excellent knowledge teacher the atmosphere is way more serious. Sometimes it helps but most of the time it's very boring. In this case I don't like to study hard.    

At this school I had both and I liked the cool teacher more just because he mostly was also funnier. I know that to much chill and fun isn't good for us. That's why it needs both. The perfet teacher would be someone who relates well and has an excellent knowledge. It's a shame that this typ of teacher don't exist more in our school.
