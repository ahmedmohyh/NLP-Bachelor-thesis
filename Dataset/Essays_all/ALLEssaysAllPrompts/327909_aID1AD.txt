For many parents it is hard to refuse to buy toys and other things for their young children if they continuosly ask for it. Companies are aware of tthis fact and therefore use advertising that is directed toward young children, hoping they will "force" their parents to buy the advertised subject by asking for it over and over again until the parents finally give in since they can't stand seeing their beloved child being unhappy.

To prevent this from happening, the idea of prohibiting television advertising that is directed toward young children. This seems to make sense since that kind of advertising basically exploits the parent's love for their children. Exploiting love for commercial sucess is clearly moraly wrong. Also, young children have not yet developed any critical thinking and don't realize they are being manipulated.

On the other hand you could say that it is the parent's decision to buy the advertised subject or not. If they don't want to buy their children everything they see in television advetising, the parents will just have to say no to their children. They have to keep that position no matter how much the child begs for it. In other words, they have to teach their children that they can't have whatever they want whenever they want it. That's something they must learn anyway. Once they learn that, television advertising will directed toward young children will no longer work and therefore not be a problem either. Besides for that young children shouldn't spend their time in front of a television anyway. They should go outsied, play and get to experience the world.

In the end I don't think television advertising directed toward young children should be prohibited. It might not be easy for parents to say "no" to their children but they'll have to anyway so why not start with television advertising that is directed toward their young children?
