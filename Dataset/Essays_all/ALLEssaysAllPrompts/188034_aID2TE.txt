This statement is an often discussed topic in the teacher's room. And there hasn't been an clear response to that.
Of course excellent knowledge is an important tool for the teacher, to explain the subject in an much simpler way, so that the students more likely to understand the topics. But on the other hand it's also a possibility, that , highly educated teachers with a broad knowledge in their subject, have the tendencies to go too much in debth, so that most of the students aren't able to follow anymore. If that happens the students often rapidly lose their motivation to study.
But also the relationships between teachers and students can lead to so difficulties in the classroom. Surely, a good relation between a student and his teacher can be very helpful, because then the student isn't afraid to ask , questions and is more motivated to learn. Maybe if the teacher doesn't prefer all the students, this could end in jealousy between the students themselves and also to unfairness, in schoolworks which have to be graded in a subjective way, for example essays.

Personally, I think you can't directly compare these to abilities whith each other. Both are really important, so a teacher has to be a good mix out of both of them. Because a teacher who is highly skilled in his subject, but can't interfere with students on a social level is rarely ever gonna motivate students, but also a teacher who is like a good friend to his whole class, but doesn't know anything about the subject is going to fail to educate his students. So if a teacher reads this, he should try to ask himself, if he would like it to be a student of himself and if not why and how to improve that.
