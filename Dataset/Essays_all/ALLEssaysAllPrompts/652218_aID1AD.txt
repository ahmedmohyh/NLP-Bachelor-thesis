The subject tv advertisement is often discused because of how the media rules our mind nowadays. I, myself, think tv ads directed towards young children shouldn't be forbidden but I'd say it's a waste of money for the companies because such young children usually don't watch tv regularly that's why they'd probably barely ever see any ads, especially because they might only watch one show and then their parents would turn the tv off again. Sure it's not the same for everyone and in some households they might watch a lot of tv and see those advertisements but it's not the norm. 
Overall if I see ads, doesn't matter if for example on tv or in magasins, I don't feel like buying that object. Sure it makes you aware of the product and the brand but otherwise my shopping isn't being influenced by advertisements. 
If parents are concerned that their kids would annoy them with buying stuff they saw while watching tv then I suggest not letting them watch tv that often. But even though I disagree with the statement above, I do think that it's not necessary and definitely no one would miss anything if they'd stop advertising products on tv, doesn't matter towards who it is.
