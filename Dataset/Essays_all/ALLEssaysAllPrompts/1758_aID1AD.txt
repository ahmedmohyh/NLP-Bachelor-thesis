The statement asks if television advertising directed toward young children (agede two to five) should not be allowed. A big adventagen from that is, that the children would not know which new toys their parents could buy them, so there would not be any arguments about buying the latest stuff. But on the other hand the children do not have any ideas what they could wish theirselves for their birthday or for christmas. So the parents would have to walk into the toy store and there, the kids would see even more toys and everything at once so that they could not decide theirselves and it would take a lot of time and money. The difference would be that the children could see the toys in reality and that could be better, because children in this age cannot understand that the reality is different from the TV and that the advertisement wants to influence them.
But to see it from another perspective, there happen a lot of funny situations because of children who understand an advertisment wrong. They just asked their parents about it or they are so attached, that they think for example that everyone in the family really needs an own vacuum. In addition you can think that this children are still too young to see so much advertisement but it is a chance for them to have a break between the series or the films they are watching so that they can go to the toilet or get some food. In addition the brands and fabrics should have the chance to show their products to everyone. It would not be fair if they earn less money than other shops just because the others are selling things for adultes so that they are allowed to show advertisment.
So I think that it is okay to show advertisment in the TV to young children, because it is an fair possibility for everyone and it is part of the everyday life. And if anyone is against this rule, maybe they should just let their children watch less TV.
