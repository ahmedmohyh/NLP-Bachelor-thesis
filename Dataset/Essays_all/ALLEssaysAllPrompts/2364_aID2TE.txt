What is the best way to teach students? Is it more important for a teacher to relate to studenst or to be well educated in the subject he is teaching?
Offcourse it's good for a teacher to have a good relationship to his student. If a teacher has a connection to bis students, it's easier for him to teach them and to communicate with them. It makes it easiert tor him to know if his students are struggling to understand a subject or if they are doing well.
 if he knows his students well, he will be able to judge about there grades. Also the students are more confident to ask the teacher the 'stupid questions'. Students often don't understand a topic of a subject and feel too dumb to ask the teacher for help because they think it might be a stupid question. They are afraid to be shouted at by the teacher. It's even harder for the students to rais their hand to let the teacher know they didn't understand what he's been explaining, when every other student seems to already be working on an exercise.
Although a platonic relationship between students and teachers makes the subjects easier to understand and the lessons are fun, it's also important for the teacher to have excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. A relationship is good and the studenst dare to rais their hands but the relationship is irrelevant as soon as the teacher has no unswers to the questions his students are asking. It's funny when a teacher has no clue what the studenst mean or what they wnat to know, but it's bad for there education.
All in All I think a teacher should be a mixture of the two types: he has to open up for stundents and he has to know the subjects he is teaching very well.
In this case the students and teachers have a good connection to each other, the students aren't afraid of the teacher and the teacher himself knows the answers to his stundents questions. That's why i think that just one of the to abilities is not enough to be a good teacher
