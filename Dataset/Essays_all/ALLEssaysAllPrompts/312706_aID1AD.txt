We all are influenced by televison. But nothing is as influencable as little children. But anyways, alot of television advertising is directed towards the youngest of our society. In the following text it is written about why nevertheless advertising directed to little children shouldn't be prohibitted.
While an adult person mostly can tell truth and false appart, a child can't. And while watching TV, they absorb alot of information witch can have a very negative influence to the child's mind and their future consumption habbits.
On the other hand if Television advertising directed to children should not be allowed, then the children shouldn't be allowed watching TV at all. Children don't only notice spots and shows directed to them, they notice everything.
And back to the future consumption habbits. In my opinion, the consumption habbits is mostly a question of how the consumption habbit of the parents look like, and how they teach their children handling their money.
If parents don't want the possible negative influence of advertising for children, they shouldn't let them watch TV at all.
