Teachers are very important in our modern world. They teach the young children and of course young adults too so that we are well educated. The ability to relate well with students is important for their work but also the excellent knowledge of their subject. So what is more important: the excellent knowledge or the ability to relate well with students?

The major point of school is education. So the knowledge of the subject being taught by the teachers is very important. If, for example, a teacher does not know what he is teaching or cannot answer simple question in his subject, the students will not learn anything. This means that the students visit this course in vain. Furthermore in the future the students will not be able to do "simple" things that they should be able to do. All in all the knowledge of the subject being taught is important.
Besides the knowledge the ability to relate well with students is a second major point that teachers should be able to. If you have an excellent knowledge of your subject but you cannot relate well with your students, you cannot teach them because the students do not want to come to class. They are disgusted of the way you teach. So  their motivation level is very low, and they will not do anything for your class. To summarize, it is also important to relate well with your students.

In conclusion both abilities, the knowledge and to relate well with students, are important. Without them school will not and cannot work. Teachers must have the knowledge of their subject and know how to relate well with their students, so that they know what they do during class and that they motivate their students for the subject. So I cannot say that one ability is more important than the other. I think teachers should have both abilities.
