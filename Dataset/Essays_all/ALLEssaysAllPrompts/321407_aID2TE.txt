A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught.

If a teacher has a good relationship with his students and they can communicate and discuss, it's easier to teach and to learn.
With a good atmosphere it's more enjoyable for both, teacher and students.
It's important to be able to talk to each other about wishes and problems so everyone can improve and that's not possible without a good relationship.
It doesn't work if a teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject, but he can't reach his students and can't motivate them to learn. 
On the other hand if a teacher's knowledge is weak and he can't answer his students questions, they can't learn anything.
The teacher will lose his students respect as soon as they sense that he has no idea what he's talking about. 
It's the teachers job to teach his students and it's his job to know his subject, so that he can prepare his students for the tests and their lifes. 

I neither completely agree nor disagree with this statement. My experience has shown me that a good mixture is needed to be able to learn and teach efficiently. When students and teacher can respect each other and are able to express their feelings and thoughts, it's much more likely that they can profit from each other.
