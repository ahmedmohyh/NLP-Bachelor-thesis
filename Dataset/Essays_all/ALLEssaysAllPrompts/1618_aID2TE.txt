I don´t agree with this statement. 

It´s important for the teacher to relate well with students, because there are often students who be affraid of writing a classtest and forget everything of what they learned. It´s good to see that the student have understand the theme of the subject and only failed in classtests. In this case the student have the ability to get a good great, but also a student who doesn´t learn anyway and only try to be nice to the teacher.

Thats unfair for the students who are really good in one subjects and learned all day long, just to get a good mark in the classtest. And there are also pupils who doesn´t talk that much and can´t speak with the teacher, haven´t they the right of a good great?

I think it´s important that teachers have the ability to relate well with students, but in no way its more important than the knowledge of the subject. I think these two ways to give the pupils a great are important in the same way and a teacher have to do both.
