To start with an agreeing statement you can say that television advertising should not be allowed because it will maybe affect the young children in ways you do not want the child to be affected. 
A point which disagrees with this statement is that the parents should look after their kids and therefore they have to decide if they are allowed to watch it, so therefore it should be allowed to advertise towards young children. 
A supporting fact, is that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because kids can not think clearly and due to that it should be clear that this is not appropriate. 
To react to the statement before you can say that advertising should be allowed if it does not make any harm to the young children. 
A last point to support this statement is that advertising toward young children is unnecessary because they will not buy something but the parents will, so they have to advertise directed toward parents. 
My opinion about this is following, I do not like advertisments at all. So I can easily say it should not be allowed, also due to the facts which supports the statement.
