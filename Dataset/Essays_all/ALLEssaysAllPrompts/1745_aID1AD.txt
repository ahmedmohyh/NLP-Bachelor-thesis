In the following text I will discuss the topic whether telivision advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
For it speaks that many children want to have everything they watch in the television advertising and many parents cannot afford every wish they have because for example they do not have enough money to buy the toys. Furthermore children in this age (two to five) learn at lot just from looking. They see how their parents behave to different situations and imitating them because they think it is right. In additon it is the same thing when they are watching television advertisements. They see the happy family with a beautiful woman as the mother a succesfull man as father and most of the time a boy and a girl. They think it always have to be like this and wondering why it is not like this in their life. 
Now the reasons why this should be allowed. If I think about this topic, I recognized that there is already television advertising directed towards young children and till now evrey child watched this advertisements and what happend? The parents have to say more often no to their children like my parents did. Furthermore we have to think about the companies. They have to sell their toys etc. and how it could be better for them when they direct their television advertisements toward young children who wants that toys what they sell.
I think that not allowing the television advertising only helps parents to save money but it does not change the behavour of the children
