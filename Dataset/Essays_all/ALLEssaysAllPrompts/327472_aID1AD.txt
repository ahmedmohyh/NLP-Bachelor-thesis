Should advertisements targeted at young children be allowed on TV? It is certainly true that young children are very easily influenced by advertissements. That could very well be a evolutionary thing, because children are genetically programmed to learn by watching their parents. A child also can't really know that what they see in an advertisments is not what it is in reality. But children are influenced by other factores too, for example the packaging of the product, or what their friends and "the cool kids" have. So if you tend to forbid tv advertissements, you would have to do something about the other factors too, and that is simply impossible. During childhood it is very important to have "cool things", for example toys, to be socially accepted. If the parents of a child deny him toys, it might not be accepted in a group anymore, and the other kids don't want to play with him/her anymore. It can even go as far as bullying. But would it help to forbid tv advertissements? Personally, I don't think so. Even tho advertissements can have a big influence on young children, there isn't really a problem with them. The problem lies more in the social behaviour of kids. The worst thing that can happen if a child sees an adertissement about a toy is that it will annoy its parents to get said toy, because it obviously can't buy the toy itself. If they say no, it will just be sad for a moment and then see another toy that it likes. In the end it is more a question of parents being annoyed about their children begging them for toys all the time, not about any dangers that the child might face. The conclousion is that it isn't a problem of the advertissements, but of the parents letting their kid watch tv all day because they don't know what to do with them.
