Nowadays there is a big discussion about the television advertising beeing in a direction towards young children. In the ages two to five there is much room to get influenced by any external source of information. That makes the discussion about not allowing the television advertising directing young children debatable.

On the one hand I want to mention the fact that the television advertising is known as a big propaganda like influence for all the people no matter what age. That is why it is extremly important that at least the youngest ones have to be protected by this influence and that they can develop their own opinion and not the opinion they have to accept by the television advertising.

But on the other hand there is also a responsibility by each parents that they can find a good way to handle the fact about the influence by the television advertising. That is why it is essential that the parents look after their children and protect them. 

Another argument against the television advertising is that the fantasy and the imagination of a young child will souffer when they are watching too much television advertising. That is because of the stupidity with which the companies try to catch they young children.

As a conclusion I think everyone can make a case for both sides but for me it is clear that I am totally against the television advertising directed toward young children. For me the most important argument is that the childrem would get influenced by this television advertising too soon in their lives and that they have to build their own opinion befor they get manipuleted by this strong but smart developed system.
