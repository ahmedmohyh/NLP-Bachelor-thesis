It shouldn't beallowed to advertising directy to the you children. Because the children in young age should not watch TV. They are young and have to do other thing like to play outside with other children. If in the TV would be more adtvertise which are directed toward to the young children, they would support that children watch TV. In the aspect of the socialism and for developping of the child it would be unhealthy. How it can be healthy to sit in the front of a TV and watch them all day long? Neither for the children nor for the adults. 

Otherwise it is the job of the parents that they look how many their children consume TV. So if a child with 4 years watch to much TV so has their parents to stop him and not the marketing of something. 

Even the marketing try to advertise directly the children, they can't influence it a lot because the children can just wish something and not walk in the next supermarket and buy himself somthing what he saw it before in the TV. The parents have again to say if the play or what else is sensful or not and have to choose if they want to buy it them child or not. So it would make more sense when they would adevertising directly the parents, they know it better and when they are parents for first time, the will try to make avertything perfect for their children and buy more thing as it needs. 

In conlucsion it should not be allowed to advertise directly the children. It is unhealty and does not make much sense, it would be better when they would advertise for the parents.
