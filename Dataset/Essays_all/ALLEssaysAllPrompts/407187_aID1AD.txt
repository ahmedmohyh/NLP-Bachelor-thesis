Television advertising directed toward young children

The use of the television for children is a serious subject. Nowadays children spend much more time infront of the TV. Is television advertising really supportable?

Kids (aged two to five) are easy to manipulate. If they're see candy or things to play, they're impressed quite quickly and they want to play with it. For children it's hard to split the reality from the things they see in TV. Also they doesn't have a own opinion that age. So it's better when parents decide, what their children really needs sometimes.
Children don't really know if they're in need of the things they see in TV and they start crying, if they see something they want. sometimes that's annoying for the parents.
Another argument against adverdising for children is, that they are spending too much time in front of the TV anyway and this would make it even worse. A childhood outside with your friends and playing hide and seek is much more adventorous and better for the children, than in front of the TV.

All in all I wouldn't allowed television advertising directed toward young children. There are far more arguemnts against it.
