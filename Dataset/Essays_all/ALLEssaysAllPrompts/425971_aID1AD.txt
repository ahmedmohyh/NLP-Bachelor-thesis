When you watch television, there is always that little thing disturbing you. It is called advertising. A couple of adverts take young children to sell their product. A lot of people think that the use of children in television advertising is bad. According to these people the adverts show a different image of the reality. Yet, there are people who support this idea as well. They say the children only do it if they want to and if they have fun whilst doing it.

Many companies try to sell their products with the children playing in the adverts. They want to show that the product spreads happiness and joy. Kids are a good way to express that. They are happy about the little things in life and they don't think too much about an issue. Therefore, I understand why they use children. I want to buy something much more if the adverts shows happiness. If the kid is having fun during it, why should it be bad?

Unfortunately, there are not only good sides within this issue. Companies want to get a good image with cute children in their advertising however, they treat them bad which leads to the children not enjoying it anymore. In addition, sometimes the kid has a lot of pressure by his parents which want their child to become a star.

At the end, I think it is not bad to use children for advertising. As long as it enjoys what he does I don't see any problem in this. Yet, in my opinion, there should also be strict conditions on working time and how to treat the child.
