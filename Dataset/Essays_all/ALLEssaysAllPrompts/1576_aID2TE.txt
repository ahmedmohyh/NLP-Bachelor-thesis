I can´t agree with the statement that the teachers relation is more important than his knowledge in his subject . In my oppinion it does not matter if there is a good or bad relation between teacher and student as as long as their relation is appropriate. Of course a student should never feel that  the teacher does not like him because that would really influence  the students behaviour  in class. The student would not be able to concentrate on the subject when his teacher makes him feel uncomfortable by treating him not well  . So all in all i am convinced that as long as the student does not recognize that a teacher does not seem to like him there should not be a problem . I am of the oppinion that the teachers knowledge is way more important in that case .                                  That is what makes going to school such a necessary thing to us students today . School is all about learning for the future by people who have experience and are specialized for a certain subject . Of course the learning process would be a lot more comfortable for the student if the teacher would seem to like you but that is in my oppinion the less important point . As I said as long as the teacher is able to hide his dislike on a student there seems to be no problem for both .          And that is if you ask me also something a teacher must be capable of , to pretend to have a good relation to all of his students even if he prefers some more than others . Their grades must be given in a fair and equal way so that the students sucess is not harmed in any way . A teacher who can do both of it is of course the better choice . So as a conclusion i would say that it is not even possible for a teacher to have a good relation to all of his students and it should not be asked . But every teacher must be able to treat his students equal and fair .
