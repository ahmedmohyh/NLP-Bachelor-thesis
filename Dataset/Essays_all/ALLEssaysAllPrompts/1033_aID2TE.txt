On the one hand this statement is right, because younger people can learn better if their teacher is able to interact whith them in a nice way, they can't learn if the teacher's not nice and followes their wishes and needs a little bit. Another reason is, that teachers witch a perfect knowledge have a higher chance for making things too complicated for pupils. If these kids don't understand what the teacher wants from them the sense of school isn't reached. 
But on the other hand a teacher isn't there for just being loved by pupils, he/she's there to teach them. He/she can't be nice all the time, because kids have to learn to follow authorities and not just to do what they want. If the teacher is too nice and not consequent they can't learn that they can't have such behavior their hole lives. And if pupils have problems whith their learnig prozess the have the ability to speak whith their teacher about that, but if the teacher doesn't know enough to teach them in a proper way he's not able to change that quickly.
I think that there is nothing more important of those two, they are both exactly same important. A teacher can't teach pupils whithout being nice and friendly, but he has to be consequent too. And how could somebody whithout prfect knowledge teach somebody else, he can't. Teacher have to learn both, if they can't they mustn't be able to become teacher.
