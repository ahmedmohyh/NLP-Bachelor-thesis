A teacher without a sufficent knowledge about his subject is not a good teacher. His knowledge has to be enough good that he can answer the students questions even when they outrange the actual topic of the lesson. His knowledge should also not be fully concentrated on his specific topic. At least a little topic about other materia should also be in a teachers brain. 
It doesn't matter how much the teacher know or how good hsi grades in the university were. His knowledge is only as useful for the students when he can teach it. And this only functions when he can relate well to the students. I'm sure that every student has a teacher who can't teach but knows everything. Refering to my own experiences with a lot of different teachers I can say that even a teacher which only knows the minimum about his own topic is better than a smart teacher, who knows everything, who does not relate to the students. Because when a teacher does not relate to his students, they lose their willingness to follow his speeches and his explanations. A factual very interesting lesson can be the worse 45 minutes in a students timetable. Motivating the students means to activate them. A teacher must generate questions in a student which they want to have answered. And this only functions when the teacher has enough social intelligence to get in touch with the students while the lesson. 
But even the teacher with the best relation to his students has to have a good knowledge about the things he teach. You can become a teacher with excellent knowledge in your specific subject and a bad relation to students.Then you can be a teacher but a bad, relly bad one. But you cannot become a teacher when you dont know anything about your subject but you can handle good with students.  
Knowing at least the minimum of the subject (the more you know the better it is) you teach and a good relation makes you to a beloved teacher.
