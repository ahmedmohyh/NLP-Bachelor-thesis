In the following essay I will point out my opinion about television advertising directed toward young children by listing the arguments and showing my opinion in the end.

On the one hand children could learn on the Television. There are some shows especially for children to learn about the nature, animals and the humans' body. If they watch these shows, they could learn something that could help them in school maybe.

But on the other hand the children could get dependent  on watching television. in the small age of  two to five it would be horrorbly to be dependent to watch TV every time.  They wouldnt go out, play in the nature and meet friends on the streets. For myself it was the best childhood to play in the garden, in the sand or on the street with some friends out of my village. i cant imagine to sit on the tv everytime.
on other point is,that the picture that are shown on the tv are too fast for the eyes of the young children. the brain cant work with the information it gets from all the pictures. it could be the reason for many health problems in the older age.
the parents that let their children watch tv every day, every time will probably see it in the grades of the children when they are students. They wont be as concentrated as other students and wont be as focused. and they wont be as creative as the other students, that told their friends stories about their dreams.

So finally in my opinion the children should have a childhood in the nature with their friends and not in the living room in front of the TV because it is important for the future. if they only watch TV they could miss some lessons for life that make them "normal" human.
