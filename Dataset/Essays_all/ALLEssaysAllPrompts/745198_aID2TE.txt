So at first i think that the relationship "teacher and student" is very important, because when the student dislike the teacher, or the otherside, the teacher dislike the student it is difficult to learn something in the lesson or to listen to the teacher's voice.

But at the otherside i think that a excellent knowledge of the subject a teacher is teaching is important too. Because you are at school to learn something and when you have a good relationship with your teacher but at the end of schooltime you have learnt anything, would be not so good. 

My opinion is, to find a middle. Something between this two points. When the ability to relate well with students is here and the knowledge of the subject is huge and good, both side, teacher and student, have a easier life.
I think the student will go with more power to the lesson when he know, he like the teacher and that the he will learn something.

To sum up, i think a teacher should have bouth side. And than it works.
