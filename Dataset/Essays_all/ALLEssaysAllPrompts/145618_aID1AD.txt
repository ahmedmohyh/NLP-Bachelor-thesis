Nowadays children spend way too much time in front of a television instead of playing with their favourite toys and having fun with their frieds outside.When I was 2 years old or even 5 years old television wasn't an issue at all.I wasn't allowed to watch TV by myself, so I would only sometimes watch the news with my parents (if the subject wasn't too heavy for my age group). But in the new generation of children it is very common to watch TV at a very young age.There are even are even advertisements designed to please the youngest viewers.Is that a good developement in our society or a bad one?
It's obvious that young children are easy targets to advertisements. They see something and they want it immediately, not tomorow or next week,no, right now. When we think of little children at a supermarket we get the picture of children comlaining, maybe even throwing themselves on the ground and crying in frustration for not getting something that they want really badly. That kid maybe saw an advertisement for the product on TV the other day and now it aasosiates the product with the fun the children in the advertisement had with it.
You could say that children that young don't have a brain enough developed to assosiate anything. Well, that's not true because a young childs brain works almost only by assosiatons. They assosiate vegetables with disgust or snow with winter. They assosiate their mothers voice to safety.It obviously only works if you repeat it to them enough. So as there is almost as much advertisement as series and films on TV they are persuaded quite quickly.
So I don't think advertisement directed toward children that young is a good think,that it actually harms them and their relationship with buying and possessing products.I would even go as far as saying that the advertisements make them gready and harm their developement.
