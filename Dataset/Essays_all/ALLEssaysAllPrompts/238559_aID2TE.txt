This statement has pros and cons. In the following essay I want to talk about these different points of view. One of the main pros is definitely that if a teacher has a good relationship to his students, the students are more likely to listen to the teacher and concentrate in his classes, because they like him. Another point is that the teacher then understands better what the students need and how their brains work, so he can improve his classes and make them more accurate for the students. 
But there is also a very big con point to this statement. If the teacher knows nothing about the subject which he teaches, the students do not learn anything and in such a situation not even a good teacher-student relationship can help. There is also another negative aspect to the statement, because if the students do not feel like their teacher is a teacher but more a friend, then the teacher's authority is totally gone and the students may just hang out with the teacher and then they do not learn anything either.
For a conclusion I think that both aspects of the statement are very important. If the students hate the teacher they won't listen to him. But if the teacher doesn't know anything about his subject, then he can't teach it. In either way the students don't learn anything. Although I think the teacher's knowledge can never be to big, but with the relating to the students the teacher has to be careful. He still needs to have the authority of a teacher and teach the subject, but he also somehow needs to get the students to like him. But still neither one of these aspects make sense if the other one is not there.
