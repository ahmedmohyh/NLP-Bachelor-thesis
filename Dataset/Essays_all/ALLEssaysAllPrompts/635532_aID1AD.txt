Television advertising: A perfect day in a zoo with your familiy. They are showing elephants and giraffs and every little child tells his or her mother "Mommy can we go there?". Now you think "why not?".
Let's say a child who lives in a big city and possibly will never have the chance to see animals like cows or horses in real life before it's 10th birthday. In this case an advertisement would be a good thing (eventhough there are  maybe no cows or horses in a zoo). But when nitendo is going to make advertisements towards children aged tow to five about their new mario-cart version and it's no problem for children from two to five to play it. Is this usefull?
I think their parents are the origins that products like nitendos are bought for young children. They will see this advertisement and maybe the vater says: "Mario-cart! I allways played this game and it was the best game I ever had. I loved it!" And he possibly goes to the next gamestore and buys this new game beacuse he loved it and he would love it when his little boy would love it. So he teaches his little boy how to play mario-cart. Only because there was an advertisement about it. But wouldn't it be better to let children in this age play with sand and water or legos? To let them know how it is to play with things like that. To encrease their creativity, to encrease their selfconfidence etc. Their parents enjoyed it to play on the playground in the neighbourhood. They knwo how funny it is to play hide and seek. They never had an nitendo in this age. So why do they allow it that their children are sitting all day long in front of their nitendo and play mario-cart?
That's only one example of advertisements toward children between two and five. And it's defenetely not great. So in my opinion advertisements directed toward yound children should not be allowed.
