To start of actually small children under the age of five shouldn't even be watching tv. So it wouldn't be raisonable to have advertising dirrected toward small children. I also think that firms should think their concept over if they think they need to advertise to small children. Than younger kids have a different kind of thinking, they for example have problems with knowing what's dangerous and what isn't. Wachting tv is also a kind of taking away their fantasy because you already give them a picture of brands they sould like. Brands want to fund a connection to their products very early, than the possibility that somesone changes the product if he's already used to a special kind of product is very small. In my opinion it's important that our society doesn't start a hype about advertisments for children. Those small "things" are our next generation, for me it's more important that their brain doesn't get a damage of all that crap they saw on tv. Now if I would ask you, what would your answer be if you were a firms CIO? Would you tell me that the brain of children wouldn't be influnced by the advertisment? Because that would be a lie and even we grownups get influnced by advertisments. So why already start at the age of two years old? In what kind of society sould this be normal. I'll tell you a fact, at the moment doctors are very worried because children at the age of one and two can't talk the way the sould, they know very little words and do you know why? It's because the parents are on their mobile phone all the time or are wachting too much tv. So why advertise to children? The parents are the ones who can understand what you're trying to tell them.to conclude, advertisments get even grownups hucked to a brand, it causes the lose of the fantasy of small children and it damages their brain if they even watch tv. My personal view on this topic is that nobody sould have the right to advertise to children that's why I agree with this statement.
