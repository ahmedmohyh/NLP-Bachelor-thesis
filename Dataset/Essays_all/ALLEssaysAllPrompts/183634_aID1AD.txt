On every channel you can see fucking television advertising. It's not fucking funny, you kow. The concern or wheever  is behind this advertising will make lots of money. But they also give aout a lot of many becaus advertising special in the televison is very expenive.

Children are so young and they can't make a difference between reality and and this shit they send on TV. 
I would say it's like a kind of proboganda in TV. Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed becaus the young children today are oure futur.  Also a lot of parents are working and didn't know what the children of them is wathing on TV. The big concerne aren't interesst in what is happen whith this kids later. The only thing they interesst is to make money. To make a lot of money. 

So that was the negative aspect os this topic. Now I'd like to show you some positive aspects.
I'm so sorry but after thinking about this topic for several minutes I haven't a good argument Televisin advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Only one aspect I'll tell you. Some times this advertising is a so fucking damn shit that I only can lough about this. Some times I ask myself what kind of a bastard you must be to make a advertising like this I saw. 

 So you can see I'm not a big fan of this advertising on Television.
