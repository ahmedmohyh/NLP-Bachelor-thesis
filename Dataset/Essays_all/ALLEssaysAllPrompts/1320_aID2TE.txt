Today I will discuss, if it is true that a Teacher should have the ability to relate well with students instead of excellent knowledge of the Subject being taught.

It is often better if the Teacher can get the point arcoss and explain it really well to the students instead of having excellent knowledge, just because it ist easier for the studenst to understand a Teacher that can explain really well. For example if you have a question you will probably be able to understand it faster and more efficient if the Teacher can get the point across.
On the other hand it is usefull to have a Teacher that has excellent knowledge. In some cases you have a really in depth question and the Teacher who can teach really well can probably not answer you this question but the teacher with the perfect knowledge can explain it to you, even if you can't understand it aswell as if the other Teacher wo teach you.

In my opinion it would be the best if you would have a Teacher that can teach well and has a great enough knowledge of the Subject so he can answer you nearly ever question. But if I should decide wether it is better to have a Teacher that can explain pretty good or a Teacher that has an excellent knowledge of the Subject, I think I would go for the teacher who can explain really good, because for me it is more important to understand the main part. I can ask the really in depth questions at home the Internet and understand it like that. It is pretty hard to learn the ability to teach students but everybody can learn something and get smarter so he can do both teaching and answering questions. 
As a conclusion you can say, that it depends wether you can understand scientific stuff and by that the Teacher with the excellent knowledge or you are able to do some research and understand it like that but you have a Teacher that is trying to bring the point to every student across.
