The statement implies that social knowledge of a teacher is more important than his knowledge of the subject he is teaching. The social relation between the students and the teacher is very important, because when the students like the teacher they are usually more attentiv and participate more during the lesson. Also borring lessons get more interessting when the students have a good relationship to their teacher.

But the knowledge of the subject is as important as a good relation with the students, because most of the students are in school to learn new things and when they do not feel like they have learned something during the weeks it gets depressing. Also when students realise that a teacher really knows his subject the lesson often gets more interessting, because you know you have learned something in the lesson.

My opinion to this statement is that a teacher should have both great knowledge of his subject and also but less important his social skills. I have experienced how boring and depressing it is when you do not think you have learned anything during the last 2 years, but also how exsighting it is to have a teacher with excellent knowledge of his subject and how interessting a lesson can get even when the teacher has no or not great social skills. If I would have to choose between a teacher who is a nice person and a teacher who I know has a great knowledge of his subject; I would definitly choose the one with the knowledge, because I am here to learn.
