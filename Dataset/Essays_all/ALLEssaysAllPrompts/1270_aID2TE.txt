It is really important that the the teacher's ability is good to relate well with students but it is also important to have an excellent knowledge about the subject. But when the teacher haven't a good ability to relate well with the student it is hard to teach them the excellent knowledge. Because the students can't learn something from him when he can't relate good with the students. For example the teacher is really mean and nobody likes him it is often that the students can't learn something from him because when you don't like somebody it isn't easy to listen to this person or learn something from him. Then he can have the best knowledge but the students don't learn something because they don't like the teacher. That isn't good. But when it is a teacher who is really friendly and can relate good with them and also has a good knowledge it is really great and the students can learn a lot from this teacher. It is also not nice to have a bad teacher with an excellent knowledge than have a nice teacher without an excellent knowledge. So it's really important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge because it is better when he can relate well with the students. It will be very hard if the teacher can't relate well with students and also don't have an excellent knowledge. It is better if the teacher can relate well with the students than has an excellent knowledge. But when he can relate good with the students it is also important to have a good knowledge because then the students can learn a lot from this teacher. So I agree with this statement but I think it is important to have an excellent knowledge when the teacher's ability to relate well with students is good because then the students can learn a lot and that is really important.
