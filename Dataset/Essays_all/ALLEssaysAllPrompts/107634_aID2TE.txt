I think this statement can be both, agreed and disagreed. If a teacher doesn't go well with his students, he isn't able to teach them and they don't want to learn from him. If  he repeatedly shouts at his students and gives them too much homework, they won't accept him as a person they respect. Othewise, if a teacher is nice to them and treats them well, but isn't really secure on subject, students also don't respect him. A teacher should at least have better knowledge of his subject than his students, if he wanted to teach them seriously. At primary level, relating well to his students is more important.
