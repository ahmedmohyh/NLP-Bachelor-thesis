Television plays a role in almost every child's life. Also does advertising. It is always the parent's decision to let the children get to that or not. Some want it and some don't. Even if in today's world, it is difficult to protect your child from advertising and even television. So what are the pros and contras about television advertising?

There could be many reasons, why it should not be allowed to let television advertising get to people at that young age. It always depends on the
advertisment and that is the important point. What kind of advertisment is it? Advertisments that reflect social media often have topics that could be problemating like: sexual content, violence or alcohol/drugs. These are the things parents often see as dangerous for their children, but for example even a advertisment about healthy eating can influence the child's live massively in a bad way.  
Children at that age, believe almost everything, want to know a lot and ask about everything. Parents who don't let their children watch Television just maybe don't want to confront them with the problems of today's world that early.

How I already said are children at that age very (neugierig). They want to know more and it that case not only advertisments, but mostly television can be the right. There are a lot of programms for children all day long, so why shouldn't that be allowed? They hear and watch stories, cartoons leran new things and it's different from reading books or listening hearing stories. 

In my opinion it's barely possible to protect your child from television advertising. Ban it or just refuse tp do it would be unnecessary, because how I already said, they'll get to it sooner or later. But what I'm really glad about are television programms for children. In most cases they are exactly the right thing and influence the child more positive than negative.
