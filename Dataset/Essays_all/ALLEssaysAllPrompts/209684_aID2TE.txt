In my school time, I have had differnt teachers so I think I should know what is important to be a teacher. 

In primary school, especially the first to third class, it is very important that the teachers relate well with the students because in this age the children have to learn a lot about behaviour and the teacher should show the children how to act. If the students think the teacher is fine then they defenetly want to become like the teacher is and they look how the teacher acts and staff and they want to overtake it then. If the teacher has a bad relationsship with the children then this might get difficult. The knowledge is not very important at this young age, the children learn the basics and for a teacher, this part should not be difficult at all. 

The older the students get, the more the knowledge is important and the less the relationship between students and teachers. The longer the students are in school, the materia gets more and more difficult and the excellent knowledge gets more important. For me, I do not really relate with the teachers compared to when i was in primary class, it is very different. Back in primary school the teachers normally thaught us everything, so they had to know from everything a little bit, while today teachers teach a specific subject and they need an excellent knowledge about the subject.

So, all things considered, I think, always both parts are important, but the older the students become, it is more important to have an excellent knowledge while when the students are younger, because then I think relationship with the students is more important.
