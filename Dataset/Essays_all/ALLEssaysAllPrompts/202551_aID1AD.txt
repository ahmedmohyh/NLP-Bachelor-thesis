I agree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." for the following reasons. 

First of all, it is very easy to influence young children, because they can not prove if a statement is true or false, they just agree with these people and do not think on their own. For example when there is an advertising for coke, the children think it is great and they want their parents to buy it, even though it is bad for them (because of the sugar and the caffeine). 
Furthermore, todays young children sit in front of the TV an enormous long time and when there is a lot of advertising, even on the prgramms for young people, they spend much more time watching TV than playing outside ore studying for school. For example when they want to watch a TV series of thirty minutes, it takes about fourty-five minutes, only because of the advertising.

On the other hand, there are helpful advertisings, too. Sometimes you can see a show with information about internet-sites to study maths or a new language. This is very useful for their future in school or later for university.

In summary, I think television advertising for young children should not be allowed, because in my opinion they should make their own experiences with all the mentioned issues in the advertisings and they should spend much more time of their childhood outside, to move and build social contacts.
