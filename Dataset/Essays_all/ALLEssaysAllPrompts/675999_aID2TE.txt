Every student knows him, this one teacher who is absolutely unfriendly and annoying. 
If this is the case, the most students of the class won't be motivated to learn anything, because they don't like the teacher. But not only aren't they excited about the lessons and they're marks will get worse because of that, also they won't like the subject anymore. Which can be bad for their future, because if they have their giftings in this area, but because of the teacher they never liked the subject, they maybe miss out to learn a job in this direction. So it is very important for the teacher to relate well with his students.
But if it's the case that a teacher doesn't have excellent knowledge of his subject, many problems will follow. Even if the teacher is awesome, when the students realise that he hasn't a good knowledge about his subject,they won't take him serious anymore. Also they won't learn a lot in his lessons, so it could be that the students are going to have problems in their future with this subject, if they're going on a higher school level. 
In the end I believe both abilities are very important, but I rather would like to have a teacher who can't relate with the students so well, but who knows what he teaches. Because I think only then, they can teach in a good and interesting way, which is very essential to learn well.
