In the following text I will try to find positive and negative arguments fot this statement.
A positive argument is that if the teachers ability to relate well with students, then the students are going with motivation and fun in each lesson. Second is that students who like their teacher, are most of the time trying to follow the lesson to learn something. If you have a good clima in your class and if the teacher gives students time to have fun and relax, then the students are consistent in learning. They can not learn the whole day without even taking one break. On the other Hand it is also important to have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. You could be the best teacher with the ability to relate well with students, but without knowledge you could not teach your students or you could, but everything they learn would be wrong. If a teacher had bad knowledge, the students would earn nothing else than this knowledge. Otherwise you could be a teacher with excellent knowledge, but you have not got a well ability to relate with the students. In this case the students would not want to learn from you in your lesson and the concentration of the students would be zero in each lesson. 

So I think it is important to have both, the knowledge and the ability to relate well. From my experience I can tell that if i do not like my teacher or if he/she do not relate with me well, then my concentration and my will to learn is zero. The teacher should have the ability to SPEAK with his/her students, so if there are argues between the teachers and the students you can try to solve them, so both groups could earn something from their work together.
