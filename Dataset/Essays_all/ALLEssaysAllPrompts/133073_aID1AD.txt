Firstly, it isn't that good for children to see advertisment because if they see a toy or viedo games which doesn't belong to them they probably want this item and if the parent don't  buy it for them they might feel incomplete and got a empty space in their hearts. In the psychologic aspect we would consider this as a negative relation between parenting character and the children because the child builds negative emotions against his parents for the reason they couldn't fullfill his wishes.
Secondly, advertising is very chatchy. So as young children get caught really fast it is hard to get them out of the vicious circle. I mean to say if a advertisment stands for what it stands then it has the job to cover the audience. 

And for the reason above children shouldn't be part of the audience. 
But on the other hand children have the option to take own dicisions- For example if there where a lot of barbie dolls the girl or, in some weird cases, the boy has to choose which she/he wants to have. 

In my opinion it's a matter of parenting because some parents just want the kids to love them and they forget what is best for child and vice versa. So I would obiviously let my child watch advertising videos because choosing between options is something important in life. Maybe the child chooses the option to skip the add. And it is also important which advertisment should be banned or not. I mean advertisment to park or for some rollercoasters are completely fine but it comes to toy and things like that I might get a bit suspicious.
