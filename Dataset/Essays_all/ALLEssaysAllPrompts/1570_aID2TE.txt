In my view it is very important that a teacher relates well with students,because so it is easier to work together.  So the pupils and the teacher have fun inside the school. the clima in the school is better. When the teacher and the pupils are friendly to each of them, the lessons are more excited and the pupils like the lessons. Because of that I think the marks of that topics are better. When the clima in the class is well, you like to learn something and the teacher like to teach everybody in the class. The negative point is,that the clima against the teacher and the pupils can be to friendly. They have to much fun in the lessons and both arent concentrait. I find it good,when the teacher ist a little bit strict,because then you learn something. When the teacher ist to strict it dont work good, because the pupils dont like  go to school. In this cause i think the oral mark is not so good,because the pupils wouldnt put there fingers in the air and say anything. They have to much respect of the teacher. The most are feared,because they dont want to make a mistake. So at the end I would say the teacher must have different sides. On the first side friendly and relate well with students and on the other side a little bit strict. So the clima in the class is friendly and the students learn something. You can see the work with the teacher and students togehter ist very important,because so it is easier for teaching the students and its easier for the students put the finger in the air and hear at the teacher.
