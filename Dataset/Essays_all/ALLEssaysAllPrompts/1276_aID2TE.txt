First I would say that it's important that the teachers are good with the students but on the other side i would say that's not good when the teacher is well with the students but knows not knowing excellent knowledge of the subject. But when the teacher has the excellent knowledge but can't go on with the students, it's not very well too.

When the teacher, for example a math teacher who is not very well with the students, is really good in his teaching subject but he can't teach this his students because it's too difficult and the kids don't understand this, he can't bring it on his students, if he's angry with them and can't understand why they can't know that.

But when you look at the other side, the teacher is well with his students but has no excellent knowledge of his subject, you can't teach them not so good with how you can do it with the excellent knowledge.

I think that the teacher has to have both, for really beeing a nice teacher. It's good, if you can speak with your teacher about your problems at school or at home. Although it's important that the teacher can teach you good for prepares you for you 'abitur' and your life after the school. One thing of that alone can't bring you and your teacher to the end.
