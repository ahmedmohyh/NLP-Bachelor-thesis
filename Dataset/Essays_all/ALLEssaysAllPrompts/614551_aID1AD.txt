In many households the televisions are daily on and the children are sitting before those every time. Is it better if the children aged two to five can't watch television anymore?
 
In our time childs are often confronted with televisions or smartphones. I think that some parents just sit there kids before the television because for they it is easyer to handle and they mustn't play with the kids and can do other things for example the household. 

First of all, children have to "explore" the world in nature and have to learn to speak. To use the language they can play together. But if they are watching tv they do not play and practice there voice they just hear the language. On the other side many stories or series have a moral end or they could learn about the things they've watched. But I think that the children are to young to learn about those. Another point is that they can't make mistakes and learn from those if they're watching tv. When they are outside and for example fall from a trampolin, they learn that they have to be more concentraded when they jump.

In summary, I think that it should be alloud that children could watch tv, but I think that the parents have to think more about how long their kids are sitting before it and to chose what their watching. And not just sit the children before it because it is more comfortable for those. And for the parents it should be clear that it is really important to play with the kids and be outside in nature.
