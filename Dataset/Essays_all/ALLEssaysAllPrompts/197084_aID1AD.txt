Advertising in ourdays is the main financial resources for television companies. Therefor they have a great interest in showing as many advertising as possible. As you probably have once noticed, there is a huge diversity of publiciy shown directed towards all kinds of telepublic. But should it be legal to direct specificly andverstising towars little cildren?

In the one hand, there is to be said that little children have a great impact on their parents, so when they realy want something they saw somewhere parents often buy the product. They are in a way manipulated by their children. It is then unfair tu push the children to manipulate their parents for buying an article seen in an advertisement.

In the other hand, there is first the responsability of the parents towards the education of their child. Sofar it is the responsability of parents to watch as theit children don't get everything they want. This has to be one main aspect in education ourdays, exactly because of the increasing number of advertising directed towards children.
Second, an advertisement isn't an obligation to buy an article. Aigain here it has to be your concious decision as parent to buy or not to buy this article. It is no case the fault of an advertisement if parents buy their children everything they desire, it is a question of education and responsability of the parents.

Finaly, I personally disagree with the statement. Advertising is in my oppinion a very important feature of our economy and also of interest as consumer, for example when a new product is released that is in your oppinion more useful than the older one. I think it is the task of the aducation by the parents and the state to inform the children or adult consumers about advertisement an there aim. I think that forbidding advertising (as far as it isn't a shocking one) directed towards children isn't an issue.
