I do not totally agree, but I also do not disagree, because I think a teacher's ability to relate well with the students and his knowledge of the subject are more or less equal in terms of importance. 
Of course a teacher needs a lot of knowledge, beacause if he doesn't know anything, he can't teach anything neither. But he also can't really teach anything if the students don't feel like they can relate well to him because without a good relationship between a teacher and his students there is also no respect and if there is no respect the students won't listen 
On the other hand the relationship should not be too good neither, because when the students see their teacher more as a friend than as a teacher it has the same effect and they will not listen. 
So as a teacher you have to find the perfect mixture of a lot of things, being a person of respect, relating well to your students and knowledge about your subject. 


I know I didn't wright much but I also wouldn't have written more in german cause I'm kinda out of ideas right now.
I'm hungry. And I'm tired. I think this is one of the reasons why I am so bad at school: I can rarely concentrate on the things I'm supposed to, insteat I do what I wanna do. This way I have more fun in life, at least for the moment, but I fear that I mess up my future. I don't even know what I wanna do in my future, I mean I do know what I wanna do, I want to play guitar all day long because that's the only thing I know how to do, but I can't earn money just by hanging around and playing guitar, can I? And I need money because otherwise I can't live a decent life in which I can play guitar. I used to want to be a lot of different things and wanted to learn a lot of different jobs over time, but if I'm honest to myself, those things don't really interest me. I just wanna make music all the time but it's so hard to make making music your job.
