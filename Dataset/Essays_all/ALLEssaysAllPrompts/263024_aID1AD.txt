Engllish Essay

I think the question about advertising directet toward young children is an interesting quesion today, because many children watch a lot of television today. The adverts are sometimes very stupid and not good for the children. But I think every company can make some adverts. Probably it's better when you put the adverts who aren't good for children so like with love, sex and alcohol not between the films or series the children will watch. It also doesn't make sense, because they won't buy it now. You should put some adverts for toys or something like that there, that the children want this. But in general the parents can say if they think the children should watch this. I think in this age it isn't good to watch to much television, they should go out and play on the playground. I can't say it's bad when they watch television because you can also learn many thing like the language from some kind of films. But the problem is that when they watch to much television, they don't know the real life. The most of this films aren't from the same country, so they also see the wrong cultures. they lose also he contact to real person and espacally to the family and friends. But in general I thik the adverts aren't the problem, the problem is that to many young people watch TV or also use the interent all the time and they don't have a reason to use it. They see so many stupid things all the time don't realise the real life.
