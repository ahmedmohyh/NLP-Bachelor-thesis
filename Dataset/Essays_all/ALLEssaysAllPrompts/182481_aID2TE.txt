If you are going to school for quite some time like I have then you know how different teachers can be. One can relate very well with his students another not so much. One teacher knows very much about his subject another very little. But what is really more important, the ability to relate well with students or the knowledge of the subject being taught?

I think a teacher's ability to relate well with his students is as important as his knowledge of the subject he is teaching. Because if a teacher can relate well with his students he can teach in a way that the class will understand it better. For example if someone does not understand the teacher because he just cannot teach in a way the student understands it then he should change something in his style of teaching. Like relate the things that he is teaching with things that students care about or think is fun for example social media.
On the other hand it does not help if a teacher can relate well with his students but has know knowledge about the subject that he is teaching.  Because then a students learns as few as if the teacher teaches in a way the students do not understand it. Because if you ask a question and a teacher cannot answer it because he does not know the answer either, you know as little as before you asked the question. Therefore, you probably did not learn very much in that lesson.

So in conclusion, the teacher's ability to relate well with his students is as important as his knowledge of the subject he is teaching. Just in that way you can learn the most from a teacher and the lessons tend to be fun. And if you can remember much from the lessons you do not have to study as hard for the exams in that subject. So you can use your new free time to do something fun.
