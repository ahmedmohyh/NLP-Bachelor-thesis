I agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Today every child spent a lot of time in front of the television watching TV. Advertisments for small children came in the early morning. The most children watch TV in the moring, so they see a lot of advertisments.

If a child see such an advertisment in the TV , it will have this product. The advertisment showes to the child, that it should have this product immediately and the parents will buy it because they will have a happy child. This is not good for children, because the will have more and more products and they learn that they get the product if they wanted it. 

Today small children do not know how to play with natural objects in the forest or how to play games outside because they have everyting. Furthermore they spent too many time in front of the TV watching these advertisments. If children have everything, they do not learn how to share things with others or how to spend time without this products. This is negative for their future. Their life become more and more tecnical and they forget how beautiful the nature is. For example they do nor know from where the milk is. They think, the milk comes from the Migros and not from the cow.

Managers earn a lot of money with those advertisments for young children. This is not fair beacause parents could not forbid watching TV.

My conclusion is, that small children become stupid if they watch such advertisments. They could not make important experiences, like playing in the forest or outside. They learn that they should have this product otherweise they will get sad. It is important, that advertisments are not allowed for young children.
