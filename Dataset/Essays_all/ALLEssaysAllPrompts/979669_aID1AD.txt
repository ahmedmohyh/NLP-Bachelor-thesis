Advertising directed toward young children

This kind of discusion is very difficult becuse there are reasons which are for it and against it and advertising in general a problem for anybody in some ways.
An argument which agrees with the statemant is, that young children should be protectet of some violence and sexual pictures because we don't know how children realize them and what these pictures or videos are doing with their minds. But often it is a problem to protect children from bad advertising, because in this time you can find advertising everywher and you can't controle everything. So it is also difficult to control and forbid advertising which is directed toward children. I think to influence children in a way that somebody has a profit of it is alway bad, but many people do it and. Young children think diffrent to us and that is the greatness of to be young and we shouldn't exploit it. 
At the end I think you can't forbid advertising, but advertising which directed toward young children should be forbiden.
