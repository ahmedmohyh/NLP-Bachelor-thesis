Advertising is nowadays a big part of many peoples lives, and today I will discuss in this essay, if it should not be allowed to make television advertising toward young children.
In our day-to-day life's advertising has become a big part, even for the children. Every Company should have the right to advertise their products. It shouldn't matter how old or young their audience is.
But children with the age of two until five are easily manipulated and many companies will take advantage of that to sell their products. The companies can easily make the children believe that they really need their product. That leads to the children crying about that product until the parent feels forced to buy it for his child. Forbidding television advertisement toward children could prevent that from happening.
But prohibiting advertisment is against the freedom of speech which also isn't allowed. So prohibiting the advertisement can't be the right solution.
Another proble with advertisement toward children in general is that materialistic thinking is allready taught at a very young age, which can influence their behaviour in the long run. Advertisements showing that having the newest or the best looking toy is good can lead to the children thinking the same about other human beings.
In general I think that advertisement toward children shouldn't be banned but I think it should follow clear orders and rules so the children don't get influenced mentally.
