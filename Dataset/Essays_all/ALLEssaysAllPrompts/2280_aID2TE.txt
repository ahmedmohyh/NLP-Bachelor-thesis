In the following text I want to explain my opinion on the topic: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught"


When you think about the school time there were always teacher you liked or not and subjects you liked or not. You like the teacher when he is nice and makes an interesting lesson. You liked the subject when it is interesting and is good teached. When I now think about the topic and the school time, I agree with the statement. In my opinion the teacher and the subject have to fit together. The teacher have to have fun in teaching and with the students. Students often dont listen to a teacher when he talks boring. But when he is funny and interesting they listen and are interested. Even when the teacher dont have an excellent knowledge about the subject, they know enough to tell the students. The teacher can know so much but if he doesnt relate well with students this makes the situation not better. In my schooltime there are different teacher for one subject. When I like the teacher and have a good relation to him, I were better in this subject. When I dont like the teacher and have not a good relation to him, I were not so good in this subject. So the learning is (definitiv abhängig) from the relation between the student and the teacher. 
I think there arent points to disagree with the statement.


All in all I agree with the statement and think that the teacher have to have a good relation to the students so they want to learn something and the stuff to learn is funny and interesting.
