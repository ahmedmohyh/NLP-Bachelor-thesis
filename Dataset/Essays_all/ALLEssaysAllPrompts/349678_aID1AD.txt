Television advertisment. 

Everbody knows it every body hates it. 
And young children shoudnt watch it. Why?

So I dont know why not because if they watch television with two years its bad no matter if it has television advertising in it or not. It's just stupid. Young children should play with things, with friends, go out in the nature etc. They will watch enough tv the rest of there lifes. But back to the advertising. You could say that maybe they can watch sextoils advertisment or sth. But look, that wouldnt be bad because they wouldnt get it. they dont understand all of the advertisment maybe these about chocolate. But okay they watch a chocolate advertisment whats bad about it? Whats could be bad about a chocolate advertisment but not about a serie about a mouse and a frog? I dont know. Children doesnt need to watch the serie about the mouse and the frog and they dont have to watch the advertisement. 

You can think that my opinion to this is that television at all should be forbitten. but thats not. i think its your choice what you are going to to with your children. I dont like television and stuff like these so no i wouldnt put my children in front of a television with the age of 3. But it wouldnt be really bad if you would do it. Its just not really healthy because you dont walk and dont smell the free nature. you get really "faul" if you look to much tv. So go to the scouts. Its great. its better than watching TV. You make friends you are outdoor. You are getting a better imunsystem. And lot more. So dont watch TV You are getting poor eyes. 

So my end is: DONT WATCH TV IT MAKES YOU "FAUL" AND STUPID . and it doesnt matter with or without advertising its stupid 
so go and search a hobby for your child.
