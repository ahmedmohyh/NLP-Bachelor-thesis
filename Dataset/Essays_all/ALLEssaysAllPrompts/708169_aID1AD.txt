Most children like to watch television. They can watch films and series which are espacially made for their age, and there are also a lot of teaching TV programms. But between to programms there are often advertisings. They aim to get people to buy a sepcific product. Should it be allowed in children television, too?
Children who are between two and five years old aren't able to think about other peoples opinion. They are influenced by diffrent aspects, especially from advertisings. If they see joys in the television they want to have it, even if it isn't made for their age or it isn't useful.
In addition to that children can be very exhausting if they don't get what they want. Once a child saw something it really wants, the parents are often not able to stop it from crying until it gets what it wants to have. For parents it means a lot of trouble and spending money for joys. Some parents may not want that children see certain products, because they can't or don't want to buy it.
In my opinion childrens TV programm should be free of advertisings because children aren't able to deal with it or to understand it properly. Watching TV should be fun and children should learn something without being disturbed. Advertisings influence children too much and aren't helpful for their education. Consequently, I think it shouldn't be allowed.
