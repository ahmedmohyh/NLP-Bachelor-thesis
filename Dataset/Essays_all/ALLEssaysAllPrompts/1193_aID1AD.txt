Television advertising on specific products for children like candys or toys is designed exactly for their younger minds. You can find this image also inside a supermarket. The sweets are placed right next to the counter, with the reason that the children ask their parents while paying their products if they can have some "Haribo" for example. The leaders of the market know exactly that they can play mindgames with younger people and earn more money in this way. 
One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them. They also can't tell if it's worth the prize of it.  It is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up. So adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not.
The only question is if the advert is for children and has no other thoughts behind or is designed to earn more money with a product that otherwise wouldn't sell that good.
I think that it's also the job of the parents to inform their kids to not believe everything what television adverts want to tell them.
So i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed still for the reason that adverts for children most of the time don't want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product also does.
