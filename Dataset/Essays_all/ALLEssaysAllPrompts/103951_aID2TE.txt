Being a teacher can be rough sometimes especially when there are a lot of troublemakers in the class. That is why a teacher should be able to communicate with students but creating a bond between the students and teachers is a waste when the teacher has no knowledge about the current subject. That leaves us the question what is more important? creating a bond with the students or having excellent knowledge?

Teachers are supposed to teach, that is what they are paid for. If a teacher doesn't know his stuff what should he teach? But having no relation to his students makes it much more difficult for him to teach his knowledge.
These days students from the elementary school are quite rebellious. I can guarantee that if a teacher doesn't connect with them the students are not willing to learn anything. So basically teachers are like second parents first they have to motivate them, second they have to scold them and teach them if they are wrong.
However a teacher that has no knowledge how was he able to pass the qualification of beeing a teacher?

There are a lot of other points to mention but fact is bonding and having knowledge is something that makes a teacher. A teacher is someone who you can rely on when you (as a student) are in falling into despair and need help. But a teacher is also someone who teaches you stuff and who motivates you to learn.
So I think both are quite important, this is what makes a teacher.
