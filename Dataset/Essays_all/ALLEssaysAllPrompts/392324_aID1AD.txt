I disagree since that is perfectly fine, it's good to raise the hole world to a hoard of consume and profit seeking bastards as the most are now. The best would be to advertise about weapons, how they could improve the amount of CO2 emission or how cool it's to be gay. Maybe you could also advertise the new beaty clinic they opened some villages away since y'all are some really ugly bastards and the way to real beauty takes a very long time so why not start right after toddlers age. You often find advertisments about fast food, that's actually not very good in my opinion since fast food gives these children the idea that you had to have something "food" like to get your toxics and chemicals. That's very unefficient, they should advertise for Lolipops for example. Lolipops maybe not with some flavours like cherry, strawberry or apple but maybe E110, E140 or maybe you could even get some sort of starter pack where you get everything from E100-E180 and then they could sell E181-E200 as an expansion or a DLC. But no one seems to see the actual problem: How are these kiddos gonna buy some stuff if they don't have credit cards or something. The advertisement companies should provide a system where childern (2-5) could give their stroller or things like that as an insurance so the may buy the sniper they wanted always and give billy the neighbours kid a real smooth headshot. But you see this will always go further since now you gave away the stroller for your sniper riffle but no one told you that you may need hydrochloric acid or a good shovel to hide the body...  
Now you should be able to see the pros and cons: The pro is: you actually enriches the lives of thousands of children by making it special and they start to feel better since they get this "I'm still alive" feeling because now everyone is hunting lolis and shooting around but your major problem is: You will always have to invent something new the keep it going like after the snipe comes the hydrochloric acid or after some E number lolies you have to find a way to bind sulfur so they could get it intravenous, this means you need to create jobs to find new things to maintain entertaining them. Actually just as I'm sitting here: The best idea would be to get some of the older ones, four/five maybe to actually get this job and find new funny things for their younger compadrés. You'll see in a very short time you get the infant mafia and sooner or later they're gonna rule the world and maybe maybe at this point they could actually surface how illuminati works and how you are actually able to walk on the sun (at night of course).

In my opinion: A child until 7 shouldn't even know what a TV is.                   <---- real opinion
