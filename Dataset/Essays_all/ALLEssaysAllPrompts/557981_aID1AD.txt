I don't think it's correct or even acceptable of medias trying to influent the mind of such young children since they can't understand what's happening on TV and why they're being showed those toys or the other stuff that seems to be really awesome to them. The only thing they know now is just that they really want to own what they saw on TV and if their parents wont buy them what they want they will probably get sad about it. This could possibly lead to a dissorted way of their consume-behaviour later in their lifes. So it would be the right thing to stop allowing television advertising directed toward young children, wouln't it?

On the other hand I think it comes down to be the parents' responsibility to look after their children and I also don't think it's alright that such young minds who can get influented so easily should spend their time in front of the television since they should be playing outside or with their friends and family. Furthermore, watching TV this early can easily lead to an addiction towards TV's and Smartphones and gadgets like that when they're a little bit older since those are things that comforted them ever since they were little.

In conclusion, I don't think that television advertising toward children should be forbidden or even illegal. I reckon that children this age shouln't even be watching television. Because if the parents won't allow their kids to spend so much time watching TV anymore, there won't be anyone left watching all those commercials.
