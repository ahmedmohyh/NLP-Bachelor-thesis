Lately, it has often been debated whether a teacher's ability to relate with his students is more important than his knowledge of his subject. School systems aren't quite sure which side they should shift to more, since both sides of the statements are definitely important for a good learning experience. 
It is obviously the most important goal for a teacher, to give his knowledge to his students, but there are many ways of doing so. If a teacher can't properly talk to his students and teach them, his knowledge of the subject is basically useless. 
It makes a great difference for students, if their teacher is a very strict person who is nothing but a teacher for them, or if that teacher is also a person who they can trust and relate to. This gets less and less important the older you get and the higher your level of education goes. You can't really compare an elementary school teacher with for example a teacher at a college. At a young age, it is very important for children to have a teacher who they can talk to and who can be sort of a friend for them. The older you get, the more your lessons focus on the actual "teaching part" of school, so the teachers shift from being almost a friend to somebody who you're working with or for. 
Personally, I think that this statement can't be completely agreed or disagreed with. In the end, there should always be a good mixture of both relatability and knowledge in a teacher, while the age of the students and the level of education should definitely be considered aswell. For me, it's more of a luxury if I have a good relationship with my teacher, but I don't mind if a teacher is just doing their job, which is, in the end, spreading knowledge. If a teacher teaches me, what I need to know in order to succeed in their exams, they are doing fine in my eyes.
