In the following text i will give my opinion for the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

A good relationship between the teacher and his students is really important, but not just for them, also for the lessons they have together. The teacher must get along with all of his or her students. If the teacher's knowledge is not that great, he or she can easily do research, for example in the internet or in specific books, or the teacher tells the students to help him or her with that.
On the other hand, the teacher has to teach the students about the subject and probably answer questions from them. So he or she should know about the subject, but obviously the teacher can not know everything and moreover he or she can not answer every question form the students. Furthermore if he or she just knows the basic facts, the students will not learn anything new.

In my opinion you have to find a good mix of the relationship and the teaching. If one aspect is stronger than the other, the lessons probably will not go smoothly. In conclusion you can say that a good relationship between these two parties is not more important than a great knowledge.
