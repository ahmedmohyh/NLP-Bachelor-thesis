Well it is for sure important, that the teacher is able to relate well with the student. But can we say that it is more important than his knowlege in the subject he has to teach? I don't think so because what is a teacher able to do if he has no clue about the subject he has to teach?
So i think that both points of the statement are as important. You aren't a good teacher if you have no idea of the subject you're teaching but you are also a bad teacher if you don't know how to treat the students.
But you can be an excellent teacher, if you know both. Because teacher is a profession where you need several abilities like knowlege of humans and knowlege of the subject. The need of these two abilities makes the profession difficult. But there is a difference between teachers of voluntary schools and obligatory schools because if the students have to go to the school and they can't fall out of the system then it is harder for the teacher. Because then the sudents are more willing to pranks on the teachers or schoolmates. Also do the teachers in this kind of school have to achieve improvements by the stuents so that they really learn something. 
In a voluntary school the teachers need more knowlege of the subject because the students there are more interested in the subjects and it happens more often, that  they want to know more about the theme you are discussing in the lesson. 
Concluding we may say that both points of the statement are very important. But we may distinguish between the voluntary and the obligatory school. As a teacher of a voluntary school you knowlege has to be better than you social skills, on the other hand as a teacher on a school that is obligatory you have to have better teaching skills than knowlege of the subject. But in my opinion you should never only be on one side and for example just know you subject then without the other skill your working life will be difficult.
