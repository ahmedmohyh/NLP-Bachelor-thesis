Advertising is a common thing on all platforms, such as on the web, on television or even in real life. With advertising, platforms can offer more to a cheaper price. Everyone gets a piece of the cake. Advertisments always reffer to a certain age-class. Even advertisements directed to young children are common.

Young children look TV solely to be entertained and not to be advertised. Advertising "uses" people for their purpose. Ads wants people to buy. Children do not know what they are watching. They don't know that an Ad is an Ad. So they get brainwashed in a way. These children then ask their parents to buy. So in a way the Ads use the children to make the parents buy stuff. All this could lead to a bad relationship between the children and the parents and even to arguments. The child could start to feel alone and might grow up in hatred just because of advertisments

I agree with the statement. Television advertising shouldn't be allowed to be directed towards young children because they are not old enough to understand what advertising is about and how it works. Raising up a child is already hard enough for the parents and it should not be influenced by others.
