Today i would like to discuss the statement ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.''
I think its a statement with different opinions about. In the german television is a channel especially for children named ''KiKa''. When i was a child i watched this channel, when i'm watching TV. It's great for children to learn new words or see new things. So on the one hand its a good way for kids to learn new things without to much konzentration, because they learned it in a funny way and i dsagree with this statement.
On the other hand i agree with the statement, because today there are so many channels or series for kids without a good backround and children can't learned from this. There is a difference between series, where kids can learn from and series, where they can be dumb from. When we are talking about these series or channels, i agree with the stamement.
I can't agree with the statement, because when i was a child i sometimes watched TV and the channel and the series was very good and i can't say, that Television have a negativ influence to me. But i can't say if this is different today, because i doesnt watch there channel anymore. But i believe, that we live in a world with so much new things and changes, so maybe now there are some bad series on the kids channel and i think these series should not be there anymore.
