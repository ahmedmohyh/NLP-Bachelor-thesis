In school there are often teachers who you like more than others. Mostly because you get along better with them. But is it more important to relate well with your teacher or that the teacher knows his subject very well?

I think that it's very difficult to agree with this statement or to disagree with it. In my opinion it's important that the teachers know their subject well, they should at least be better than their pupils which isn't always the case. But I also think it's worthless to know much of your subject if you can't teach it. In this case the knowledge of the teacher isn't more important than the relation between the pupils and the teacher. 
If a teacher relates well with the pupils and the lessons even make fun it's great but it's also worthless if you don't learn anything from it. Then the lessons become more like a lesson with a friend and maybe also the respect you have towards a teacher gets lost.

But what should a teacher be like?

A great teacher should at first know much about their subject they teach and they should have the ability to teach the pupils the content. I also think it's important to go with the time, nowadays it's great to include media in the lessons because the pupils don't have to listen to the teacher all the time but also can watch a film maybe or do something on the computers. 

All in all it's difficult to say whether it's more important to relate well or to know much about the subject. An ideal teacher should be something in the middle.
