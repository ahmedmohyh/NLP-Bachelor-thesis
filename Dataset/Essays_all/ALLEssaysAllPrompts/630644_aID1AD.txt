Well why are there always boring statements in essays.
I do clearly disagree. The explanation for it is very simple it´s becaue it destroys the base idea of capitalism. If people had a problem with ads in the television then they wouldn´t let their childern watch it. There would be atleast one or a few channels which wouldn´t advertise and they would be much more popular then the others. But it seems like every channel dispalys ads so noone really wants to block them. Another problem with the state manipulating specific categories in the economy is that it wouldn´t be fair. Who can juge if it shouldn´t be allowed to advertise young children and whats about the eight year olds? 
After 15 minutes of thinking over it still didn´t came into my mind why anyone would want this. To protect you children from foodadvertise so that they eat healthier and dont become fed? Maybe because young children can´t compare the difference between reality and ads and so they trust anything they see? Then there are still the parents to control them and to tell them what is real and what they should do. And in addition to only block and on television won´t help at all. They will still see ads if they browse throught the web, and yes four years old do that, and when they play outside they will also see ads on the streets and other people would tell them about new products. As a conclusion it should be allowed to advertise to anyone and if my country would block certain economies like that, then i would leave this country immediatly because as a content creater i would never know which content gets blocked and which doesn´t.
