Should a teacher get on well with his students or should he know exectly what he is teaching in front of his class? The best thing would be that he is very good in both problems. But that is nearly not possible.
The relationship with the students is quite important. Especially in the way a student has a problem with the theme wich is treated during the lesson. A teacher who has a goo relationship to the class can give him some tips or can say him a other stundent who may can help. A teacher who is only interested in the subject that he is teaching, may even don't recognice that a student has a problem. An if the student would ask him if he could help him he would maybe say that there are enough students who understand what he is teaching he should ask them.
An other intersting subject is the thing with the homework. A teacher with a good relationship may know who always make his homework and didn't take it by hard if there is a good reason why he couldn't make it. A teaker with a excellent knowledge of the subject used to mean that everybody had make the homework and can tell about the current subject. Normally it shouldn't be a question  if the students should do it but there can be some special reasons wich only a teacher with a good realationship can understand.
Sure it is also important, that a teacher knows exactly what he is teaching at the blackboard. But normally they have studied their subject so all teacher should what they are telling. Sure there are some who are extremly interested in their subject and know maybe a bit more than they must.
Personally I would prefer a teacher with a good realationship to his students. Even whe a teacher may have a problem there are around twenty students who can help. And I think a person who don't know all about a subject is even sympatic. Especially a teacher. It gives the feeling nobody is perfect.
