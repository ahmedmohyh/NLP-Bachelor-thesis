Now I want to discuss the statement "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".

There are many different teachers at a school and everyone is different. There are some teachers who have an excellent knowledge about their subject. But negative about them may be that they cannot teach pupil very well. E.g. a teacher will teach all his knowledge and because of that he teaches fast and dry and thats boring for students and they learn not so much.

But there are other teachers who doesn`t have the best knowledge but have a better connection to the pupil. These teachers can reach the pupil more and know how to teach them. Pupil understand the knowledge better with good methods and they also have fun in the lessons.

In my experience I can say that I`m more likely to visit the subjects in which I like the teacher. It makes more fun and I understand the knowledge better than by "boring" teachers, even if they have a better knowledge.

Because of that I agree with the statement "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".
