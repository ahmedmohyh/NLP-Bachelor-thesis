Since many years there are advertisings in the program of kids television show. 
Exspecially american television systems use them by hard.
In the following agrees and disagrees of this topic will be showed.

One the one hand, advertisings have to be in the program, because the company of television were financed by them.
So they are the reason, that many programs are cheap or for free.

On the other hand, this advertisings make kids lose their time, which could be used to play outside or make other funny things.
Furthermore, the children believe this advertisings and get lost to them. The kids see these products and they really want to get them.
So the parents would have many problems, if they maybe have not enough money.
Maybe they are feeling than as bad parents or between the adult and the child will be more trouble and much more stress.

I agree with the statement.
In my opinion television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I think its better when companys use secondary programs for Kids like ZDF and KiKa. So they get more money from ZDF and not so much from KiKa.
Relations like this could be used as an idol for other television companys.
