Chewinggums, sweets, toys and many more products that trigger young childrens wishes are broadcasted everyday on hundreds of different TV-chanels. But is it moraly correct to try influencing these young children at that age already? 

Young children receive information different and their conciousness is not yet so far developed to resist sublimental influences. They start to think they need these good instead of just wanting them. Many adults even are easily influenced and manipulated by media and the effect on children is significantly bigger. This influence leads to a diminishing of choices the child can do on its own since the preset ideas are already made up by television and can only be changed hardly. 
Another important point are the parents of a certain spout. As the influence becomes bigger over time of consumation of these media, parents should actively control the amount of time children are allowed to spend with television and media. If this generally were the case, as it clearly isn't in many of todays households, advertising would have a smaller impact on these children and thus could be tolerated more. 
As a conclusion I'd say it is not toleratable to direct adversiting toward young children and should either be prohibited by law or be reduced by the companies broadcasting them. Media can be usefull in some cases like news and documentals, but in this case it just isn't changing anything for the good, as they teach the children to obtain a materialist mindset which is already too widespread in todays society.
