In the current world, the average persons spends about 2 hours a day infront of a television. Every 20 to 30 minutes is a commercial break. Some people use this break to eat something or get a beer befor the actual programm continus, while others wait in their chair or couch until the show or game goes on. Television advertising is used to influence peoples interests.
In my opinion commercials targeting direct towards young children shouldn't be allowed. First of all, children are unlike mature people very easy to influce or manipulate. Using commercials to attract the demand of a certain product could lead to a obsession for a kid, since they aren't able to think critical like adults. In conclusion it wouldn't be ethically incorrect to advertise direcly towards children aged two to five.
Furthernore, commercials don't give a critical analysis of the pros and cons and aren't reliable at all to product itself. This can be often seen in car commercials, where it has nothing to do with the car, but the atmosphere you get with it. Kids can't jugde correctly so it would be missleading for them. Their expectations are emotions that the product should give. For example the "Nerf Gun"videos. The commercial shows an epic fight between to armed groups in a warzone but with "Nerf-Guns"
The reasons a kid buys the product, since it's an atmospere. In my opinion the children would be disappointed, because they thought that the product can do, what they saw in the commercial.
To summarise, children can be extremly influenced by television advertising. This leads to a big need to have this kind of product for the kid. And when they have it, it won't be good enough for the high expectations, which were created by showing only the good side of the product. Bes
