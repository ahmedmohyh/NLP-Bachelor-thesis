Teachers

The best teachers have a combination of both. It is very important to know enough about your subject, and if you can relate to your students, you have great chances of being successful in whatyoudo. But I think even a teacher with the most boring voice and the dullest teaching style can fill a lesson with with interesting facts without much preparation if he knows enough.
But a teacher who's interested in his students and only knows the facts that interest them too can create good lessons. But in the end it depends on the right mixture of all the teachers skills together. Knowledge and the skill to relate are only two of them. Humor, interest in his own subjekt, creativity, senseability, and good organisation also are descicive for fruitful teaching. That's why this statement is so kontroverse.
After all the ability to relate well with students helps a teacher in achieving most of the listed skills. Great knowledge doesn't bring humor, relating to students can, but great knowledge comes from interest in the own subjekt. Creativity, senseability and organisation are individual and not relateable.

I personally agree with this statement. My personal experience with teachers has shown, that my very best teachers had a combination of both of the required skills, but especially they related with our (students) interests and formed their lessons around them.
