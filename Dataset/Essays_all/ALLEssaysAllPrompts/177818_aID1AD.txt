Nowdays in mostly each hose is used a television. But there are a lot of discussions about the use of children. A lot of  people think the youth is to  much time on their phones and televisions. But what is with the use of young children aged two to five? Shouldn't they be allowed to watch tv? 

The use of a television can help with their education. They can already learn in young age things about the world, and this in a way with fun and pleasur. 
There are a lot of series, which include a good preparation for the school and this in a way the children like to watch it. 

On the other side young children should go out and play with other childs, instead of sitting along in front of the tv. The children should be outside and have fun. There are to many dumb series in the television, which doesn't have any avantage for the childs. One example is Sponge Bob. 
Parents should look for their childs and make little advantures with them. The family can go to a museum of dragons, a hike through the mountains, and the childs will have a really good day with a lot of memories. In opposite, a child won't have good memories of a day iin front of the tv. 

In my opinion children are allowed to watch tv. A little story befor they go to bed isn't got bad at all. 
 But if the parents just let their childs watch tv all day, just that they don't have to look all day long for their childs, it is wrong. Children should go out and be in the nature and in the sun.
