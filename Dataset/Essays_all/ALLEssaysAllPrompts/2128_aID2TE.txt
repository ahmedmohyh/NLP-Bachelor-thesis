The question is wether the ability to relate well with students is more improtant than the best knowledge the teacher can possibly teach in his class.
On the one hand the teacher should know as much as possible about the themes he is teaching in class, because that is a part of his job. It is very important to be informed and to have a opinion of the themes that is the only way for the students to learn something new. For example by asking questions and doing challenging exercises. But not just the knowledge of the subject is important, also how tghe teacher teach it. The methods, he has to create different ways to teach otherwise it will be boring at some time. 
In addition to that he should teach the students to work as concentrated and interested as possible, because that way they reach the best results. However, this is very hard if the students are not listening or doesn't like the teacher, which to boredom. 
On the other hand it is very important to have a good relationship to the students. It will make them feel more confindent about themselves if the teacher is more personal. Also the students would be more active in class, firstly because of the atmosphere: If the atmosphere in a class is strict and unmotivated that will have influence on the work of the class. But if ambiance is interested and friendly, the acting of the students will change enormously.
It should be the goal of every teacher to let their students feel joy and interest while learning something new. It should feel like it is there decicion to learn and not the decision of the teacher. But the teacher can only reach that, when he himself spread his own joy about the subject he's teaching around the students. 

All in all it can be said, that it is both very important for a good teacher: A good realtionship with his students and an exellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching.
