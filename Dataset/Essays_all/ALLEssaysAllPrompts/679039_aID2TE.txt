Sympathy or strictness

The way of teaching changes time to time. In the days of my grndfather he got punched by his teacher and more. Now it is the time of SOL "self organised learning", and the theaher have to give a way to learn by themselves and have to build ab the a good realationship with the students, because kindness stands above strictness.
etBut is it more important to have a teacher a child can relate wich or an teacher who knows all of its subject.

An "allmighty" teacher in his subject has shurly his advantages. he can describe every single detail of a topic he mastered. You, as a student, can be shure that he knows what he sais and he can be trusted on his knowledge.
But the question is do you like to go to his/her class? do you like him as a person? Does he make his subject interesting. A teacher who can relate with students and all to gether have an emapthy, the sutdens like to go to his class and volutarely listeen to the stuff the teacher sais.

Maybe the teaher does not give the marks the students deserve, maybe he gives better marks to the other ones and less good marks to an other students. To much empathy can even destroy a good relationship in class because, if something bad happens, the situation in class can become unconfortable, and the student or the theacher could easely be disappointed.

But when this case doesent come to reality, you can a friendship, you can learn more and you will less hate school.
