A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important that excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught.

I'm in a way agree with this, because students learn more in a lessons when they like the teacher and they know that they can make mistakes. A teacher who can relate well with students knows when a student need more help or when the class doesn't unsterstand what the teacher is talking about and in these situations a teacher with this ability to relate well with them take the time to explain it again because these teachers think more about the humanbeing and they know that sometimes students need more time. When the teacher relate well with the students it is absoluty a better atmosphere in the class room, the students are quite during the teacher is speaking, they respect him, because they also get the respect from him. Students also ask more the teacher if theay didn't understand something. 

the contras of this statement is that students aren't obligatet to visit the school and they come because they like to learn something in the school, everyone want to have later a good job but till to the own ''dream'' job it needs a good education. In this way it is very important that students have teachers with a excellent knowledge, they can learn many things from these teachers and they would be excellent prepeate for their life after school. 

Actually, i'm for this statement. In my opinion we don't need a proffesor who teaches us, because their knwoledge is excellent but they can't understand when we don't understand the thing he is talking about, for he is it all very cleary and so he don't know how to explain it in a way that we can understand it. And if think the other problem is that when students know that the teacher have a very excellent knowledge, they wan't ask questions because they have fear that the teachers think they are stupid.
