In the following text I am going to write about the statement if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First of all on the one hand young children maybe do not know what they are wishing for christmas or their birthday. If they watch TV they can get an idea of what they want.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young childen can have such a massive impact on them. In those young years you do not know what you actually want. Every day children discover something and learn something new. So if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know yet what the main things in the world are. The television may teach them a not appropriate language and espacially when their brain is improving it can have a bad influence on them. 
Furthermore children from two to five do not know what they are even watching. You do not understand the concept of television at all at such a young age. They might get in the situation where they don not know what is reality and what is imagination.
The worst case it can get to is that the children only want to watch TV because it is so new and interesting for them. In these young ages you should not just sit in front of the TV and watch this stuff all day long. You sould go outside and play with your friends and get to know the real world.

I agree with the statement and in my opinion television advertising directed young children should not be allowed.
As a child with the age two to five you should get to know the real world. You should get to see what you can do in this world. You definitly should not sit in front of the television and maybe even get used to an not appropriate language.
