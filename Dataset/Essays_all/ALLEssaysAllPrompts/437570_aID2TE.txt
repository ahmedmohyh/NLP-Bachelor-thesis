First of all, I think that without proper knowledge of the subject, you can't teach others even if you have a great ability to relate well with your students. Maybe you can connect really well with them, but it doesn't matter if you don't have enough information about the subject. Second, even if the teacher hasn't got the ability to communicate with the students that well, he still has the information to pass to the students. Maybe they won't understand a word their teacher is saying, but they still have the information and can do some research on their own. 

On the other hand, it's really important that the teachers have the ability to communicate properly with their students. A teacher is here to pass on his knowledge and if he isn't able to do that, he's doing his job wrong. The point of being a teacher is to give people a basic understanding of what their teaching. He may have all the knowledge in this world but if he can't make others understand, he's worthless as a teacher. This way, he isn't teaching. Another point is, that maybe the teacher himself doesn't really understand his subject. Or at least not all of it. But if he can pass on at least his basic knowledge and make others understand, he already taught his students at least something. That's already better than another teacher who has all the knowledge but his students can't comprehend a thing.

In my opinion, I think it's more important to make others understand than to have a broad knowledge of the subject. I'd rather have a teacher who doesn't know absolutely everything but can teach me and my classmates the basics than a teacher who knows literally everything but we, as a class, don't understand a word he's saying.
