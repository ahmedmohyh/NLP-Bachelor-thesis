Nowadays, many advertisements are directed to children in the age of two to five years. But should this marketing strategie be allowed or is it to be seen critically. In the following Essay I will controversially discuss the topic and give my opinion.

The fist thing that came to my mind when I read about this kind of advertisement was :"How can that be effective". Normally, at that age, parents purchase everithing their children need. They know and decide what to buy, not their children. And even if they would listen to them, the least could express their wishes on what to buy from which brand precisely. The most critical point about the whole topic is in my opinion that children from two to five years are very easy to take influence on. Although in that time, they probably won´t buy any of the products which are advertised, they might remeber the brand and make their parents buy it later on. That way the early advertisement would have an effect. 

I personally don´t think that advertisement directet towards young children should not be allowed because in the end the parents have to decide on what to buy. In addition there are multiple advertisements directet to any group of people, with the direct goal to manipulate them, and make them buy different things. They are allowed too.
