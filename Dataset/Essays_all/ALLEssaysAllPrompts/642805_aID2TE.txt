The problem of distance between a student and a teacher is a very difficult theme and it is also an often discussed theme. The job of a teache is to teach a student. Because of that a stutend is at school. But it is also important,that a teacher shows some interess on a person and also on the class. Because when you have a teacher who is not interested in you and is also happy when the lecon is finished fast, then it is the wrong way. Becaue when you have a cool teacher than you are happy to have a lesson. When you have a teacher who is related too well with the students it is also not good. Because you should have a healthy distance to them. Otherwise you think the teacher is like a friend of you. I think, that a teacher should be a person who have a natural distance to the students but he should  also be interested in them and helps them, when they have a problem. But the most important part of a teacher is to teach the students new things and helps them to find their way. For me both things are important but it is also importand that they are in the same relation to each other.
