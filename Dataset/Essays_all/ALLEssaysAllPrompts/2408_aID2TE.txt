Today many people asks the question which qualifications are important for a teacher. This is the reason why I would like to deal with the follwoing statment: A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
Today there are many tachers who have an excellent knowledge of their subject. But the problem is that they can´t explain the topics for the students. If the students don´t understand a topic and write bad notes mostly they don´t like the subject and have no interested in it. 
There are also teachers who are like friends for the students but don´t have any knowledge of their subject. This is also a problem because the kids doesn´t learn anything. 
The most important thing is that the teacher like the job and children and have fun to go every morning to school. If that isn´t the reason the students know this and also have no interest in school. 
I think that it is more important to relate well with the students, because this is the first and the most important point to get the interest in the subject for the students. If they don´t like their teacher they don´t like the subject. But also the teacher has to be an autoritary person and have to give the best that the students understand the stuff they have to learn.
