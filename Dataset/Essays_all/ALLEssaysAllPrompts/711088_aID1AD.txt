I think it is not necessary to put advertises on television channels for children. My opinion is that young childreen watch too much television on general. It would be difficult to ban all advertises on every channel because many children do not only watch channels and series they are meant to watch. I think most parents aren't concsious about the consequences what too much watching television does to young children. What series and what channels the younger watch is a bigger problem. Banning advertising won't solve this probelm.
