I agree with this statement,which says that it's more important to have a good relationship with the student than teaching them in their knowledge.
In the following essay I'm going to tell you my point of view about that topic.

In my opinion it's very important to have a good relationship because that's a way how students will have fun to study and to learn more and more.
So if you have a very nice, funny and open teacher, you enjoy the atmosphere in the classroom with your classmates and the teacher. Then you go home with a good feeling and you will do your homework with more power. If you had a bad atmosphere in school, your teacher only talks to you like you are their "animal" and says, that you are stupid and you will never learn anything, then you will go home, maybe shout at your parents and just want to be alone and you are frustrated and won't learn anything.
Another point is that you have to learn for life in school. If your teacher is very strikt, you will think it's normal and do the same thing in your job. Then you won't be liked by that many people/ students.
Maybe some people say that it is more important to know how to write an interpretation or to know the latin grammar but i think that it is better to learn for life and that you need an open mind to have friends. Because you can see that if your a strikt teacher you won't have as many friends as if you have a good relation to your students and maybe you can eat an icecream together to have good athmosphere. Probably some teacher say that if it's more a friendship then a realtionship between teacher and student, that the teacher can't get that much respect and the students won't listen to them. 
Finally I have to say that a good relationship between student and teacher will always stay in your mind and if you meet your teacher after some your you will thank him for the lessons for life.
