Today there are a lot of moms, daddies and nannies who let the childrens, aged two to five, watch tv. What are the positifs and negatif sides? Should we stop let them watch tv?
Parents are often stressed and somtimes they desire to have some time to spend for themselfes. So they put the tv on and let their children watch series or movies. Somentimes they haven't really an idea what the children are watching. This could be dangereous because the things they see in this young age, have a great influence of their personality. Looking on the other side, watching tv can be something really interesting for chlildren and they can learn things, depending what they are watching.
A negatif point could be that the children lost their imagination skills or they get a imagine of a world that doesen't exist.
In my opinion it is important that the children go out and play with others. It should be allowed let the children watch tv but the parents should watch with them or  they should know what their children are watching.
