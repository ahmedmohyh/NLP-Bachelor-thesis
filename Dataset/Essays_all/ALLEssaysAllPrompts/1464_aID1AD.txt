I see no reason, to not allow advertisments in the childrens program. The company that sends the program out in Television neeeds to send advertisments too, because they need to earn money. If they wouldn't earn enough money they  would stop their program. Children can be infuenced easy, but they still have parents, that decide what they buy for their children and what not. So I think it's right that advertisments are allowed.
