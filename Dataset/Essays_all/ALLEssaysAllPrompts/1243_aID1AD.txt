Televison advertisings towards young children is a discussed theme, because it can influence them, positive or negative. Is it necessary to disallow these advertisings to children?
The children spent a lot of time in watching television, more than before ten years. The companys know about this fact, and try to reach the children in advertisings where they talk directly to the children. It can be annoying for the parents, when their child wants everything, what seems to be attractive in the advertising, and also the children want to spend more time in front of the TV. 
I think, it is not necessary to disallow advertising towards young children, because on the one hand, they often don't understand, what is said there, and only see the product, also if they make an advert for a car, and on the other hand, the parents should rule the TV consume of their child, so it doesn't sees adverts like that all day.
