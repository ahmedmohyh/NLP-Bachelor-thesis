"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."

Many people think that television isn't really good for young children. Some think that what young children hear or see on TV can be understood wrongly by them or can influence their actions and thoughts. For example when there is an ad for sweets, a child in that age just thinks: "I want that." This is because children in that age aren't thinking as reasonable as children in a higher age already do. A child has to learn to know the results of their actions. 

But you could also say: just let your child watch what's okay for it, if you don't agree with advertising on TV. Just today there are so many options on the television, that there isn't really a problem anymore of what's on TV, because there is everything on TV. And anyway: there are so many television shows which give you much information about nature or technology and the whole world. So TV can also give knowledge to children, which they hadn't whithout TV.

So all in one TV is a good thing an there are many aspects which are good about it, but parents should keep an eye on their young children when they watch TV so that they don't get anything wrong. I think they should watch for their children themselves and not forbid the whole television advertising.
