In the following sentences I am going to explain, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge about the subjects he taughts.
A teacher who makes the students laugh and makes the students to love the subject with the teacher, is in the first thoughts really good, but when the students just go in the lessons with him to laugh and have fun, without learning something, the teacher isn't a real teacher, he is more a friendly person with whom you can talk about everything instead of the things you should learn with him, than it gets really difficult to reach the goal of a lot students, the A-Levels.
A teacher, who has a lot of knowledge in school and knows his themes he teaches perfectly, but can't teach the students in it, or is a strict person, who wants to know the students everything perfectly in the subject, isn't a good teacher either. This person is just an intelligent person who knows a lot, but can't teach other people to get his knowledge. The students won't be happy in his class and also won't learn, just if you study a lot at home, you can follow his instructions in class. Also with a teacher like this the A-Levels are difficult to reach, but with a teacher like this you can learn more at home, because the students know a little bit about the themes they talked about in class.
I agree, and I also disagree with this thesis, because both types of teachers I explained before, aren't real teachers. A real and perfect teacher is a mixture of these two types. The students must have fun in learning in class, and the teacher also needs to teach with a littlebit of fun, but always serious, when he teaches the most important things. With a teacher like that the A-Levels are a good reachable goal, because the students have fun and learn a lot in his class.
