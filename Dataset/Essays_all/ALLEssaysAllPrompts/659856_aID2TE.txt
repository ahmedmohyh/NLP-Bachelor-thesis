A student wants to speak with his teacher about a certian, by the teacher false, anwser in a test he wrote. Shortly after aproching him the teacher loses his temper and shouts at the student for being unpolite and disrespectful.
Who is in the wrong? The teacher with, for an example, a master degree or the student, who seems to think he is better then an diplomated teacher.
A teachers job is it to educat student and to do that he hast to have the knowledge about of the subject being taught. If a teacher, especialy in schools with higher expectation, can not solve a problem or explain it to a student he is unable and there for unfit to work in his job.
On the other side are most of the teachers working with kids and teenagers and needs to understand how a young mind works at this age. If a teacher was to be strict and not adjust his lessons to the level of the students, they will get frustrated and to work with frustrated kids is propably even more frustraiting for the teacher. So it is important to be able to lead students to the point where they can work on the level the teacher wants them to work, but this is a processes  that has to be planed in an achivable way.
In my opinion this two aspects of teaching should be in a healthy balance. This balance should be made fit for the level the teacher is teaching on because you can not teach six year old the same as students that are sixteen.
