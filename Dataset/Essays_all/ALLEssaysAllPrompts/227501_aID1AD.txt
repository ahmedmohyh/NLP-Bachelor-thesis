Advertising for young children
It seems like a lot of children in families have the same problem. The kids watch too much television and thus the spare time of the kids flys away. One major problem besides the fact that there is too much cartoons is that there is a lot of advertisment between the diffrent episodes. Those advertisments aren't boring for the children because they advertise either toy or the following episode. So instead of going outside with their friends, the children stay at home and keep watching television also most of the time the children want that specific toy which they have seen in that advertising. Thus the mother or the dad has to buy it otherwise the kid won't stop asking them to buy it. 
Let's assume advertising directed toward young children would not be prohibited. Than it would be still the same like it is now. The children would not waste their time watching the advertisments and would rather go out and play something with their friends. So without advertising directed toward young children, the families would save money and the children would go out more instead of watching television.
In my opinion it should be the same like it is now because it seems like we have a balance between families and children which are positive and negative influenced of advertisments from the television.
