A teacher's ability to relate with students or his knowledge of the subject being taught

While talking to students about school lessons, the most critical poitns they talk about are their teachers. There are a lot of teacher they like but also some they do not like. What is important in this subject is the way teachers relate with their students and their knowledge of the subject being taught. In this essay I would like to emphasize the importance of these two points.

Firstly, it is important that a teacher knows how to relate with his students in a right way. There needs to be a relation in which both are feeling comfortable. This happens for example when students are not scared to talk about their struggle in the subject which is being taught. When they have a good relation to the teacher it can also help them to concentrate more during the lesson and ask questions. This can motivate them and lead to better marks. 

Another point which is very important for a teacher, is his knowledge of the topic he or she is teaching. If you do not know your topic you can not be able to answer all the questions that may occur. What is worse is the fact that you try to teach something to people which you do not really understand by yourself. Because of this there can happen a lot of misinterpretations on the students side, which will bring them a lot of confusion in their future studies. 

In my opinion teachers should be aware that they are also responsible for the students future by the way they are teaching. It does not help them to have a good relation with a teacher even though he does not get his topic. Nor does it help them to take lessons where the teacher really understands the topic but can not explain it, does not know how to teach and therefore creates a very boring and exhausting lesson. It is important to find a middle-way: Knowing your topic very well and knowing how to make your students understand it. Only this can increase the students interest.
