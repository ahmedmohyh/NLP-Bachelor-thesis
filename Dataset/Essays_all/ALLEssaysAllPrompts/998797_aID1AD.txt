I think it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children, because they do not have any money and can anyway not buy anything. It is very easy to manipulate young children that they want to buy everything they see. Children`s brain isn`t enough developed, so they shouldn`t be involved in affairs, which cost money. The problem is that the infants tell their parents about the things they want. There are some parents, who can`t be enough severe to their children, so the parents do what the want. The children are able to manipulate their parents. But in general such young children aren`t able to make decision, which are connected with cash. 
Nowadays children watch too much television that are are so much influenced by electronic devices. In my opinion children shouldn`t be allowed to watch television every day. Advertising for children are not just in television. The advertisings are every where. Generally I think it is not good that children get influenced by television. In my eyes there are enough other things like advertising in brochures or newspaper, but in television it should be prohibitted to manipulate children with clever advertising.
When I was an little child, I was not allowed to watch TV. Nowadays sellers shouldn`t be allowed to sell things with this method
