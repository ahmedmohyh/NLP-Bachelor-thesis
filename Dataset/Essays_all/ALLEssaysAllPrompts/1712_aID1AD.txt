I mostly agree with the statement, that television advertisement made for two- to five-year olds should be forbidden, because it is bad for the children.

In the time of digital media, television became a big part of our lives. Parents quickly get annoyed by their children and let them watch TV for hours. Companies use this to make advertisements directed to little kids. In this young age, it is hard for them to spererate between want they need and really want or want someone told them they need. They can´t make decisions by their own and directed television advertisement use it to sell stuff, for example toys, that the kids will play with once and never again. They see funny advertisements with other happy kids and screams for their mummy to buy them the same toy. Most parents also get annoyed by this, so they will buy the advertised product to make their child happy and quiet. After some time the house gets stuffed full of toys that nobody plays with, because it is not as nice as it seemed to be and the kids didn´t really wanted it. It is just something that somebody from the commercial told them to buy.

After all, those advertisemets should not be allowed, because it is not okay to use the childish mind of a five-year old to make profit. This is not humane.
