Television advertising directed toward young children is a common topic. There are many arguments for and against.
So I will explain one or two.
The people that are against advertising directet toward young children, argue, that the influence of young kids is enormeous, because they can't triage the informations. So they want to have all of the objects they had seen on TV. But there are as always people that are in favour to tv advertising toward young children, because the children learn how to handle the source of advertising, and learn, that they d'ont need all, what they saw in TV. 
My opignion is like the first argument. I think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. The kids shoulden't sit for a long time in front of the TV, they should go out in the nature and play games. If the kids are out, they can not watch TV advertising.So the problem is solved.
So I agree with the statement.




Ps: If the children went with their parents to the supermarked or to an other shop. They want to have all the things they saw on TV, so it's quite a hard job for the parents to change the opignion og "needing" that.
