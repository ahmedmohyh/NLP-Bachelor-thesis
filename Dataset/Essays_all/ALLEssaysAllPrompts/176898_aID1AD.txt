In todays world television included the advertising is a big topic. Almost in every home there is a TV and even the youngest in the household will use it. This leads to early confrontation between children and commercials. Many companies use advertising especcially directed to young children in order to sell their products. The strategy behind this is that the children will convince their parents to buy certain stuff as they are much more likely to fall for such commercials. Many parents may do not even recogniced that the childs' new desire comes from television advertising. Also, television advertising directed to young people is often seen on children channels and inbetween films for children. By placing the commercials this way they make sure as many children as possible get to see their products.
Because children are much more naiv it should not be a thing to show commercials designed for them. One main reason therefor is that children aged two to five are not able to buy things. It is the parents job. So there is no sence in using commersials directed to children. It may be a good strategy for companies but it is not a fair concept.
In my opinion there should not be any advertising directet to people in general who are unable to afford anything. It should not be allowd in either televison, on paper, or on the radio.
