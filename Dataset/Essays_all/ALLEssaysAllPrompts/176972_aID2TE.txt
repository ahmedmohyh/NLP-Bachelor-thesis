This statement is important to discuss, because we know that we have nowadays different school systems than in the past.Is the answer to this the same like years ago? Or has the evolution of technology change too much and so the new attitude of students.

Of course a teacher should be able to give his knowledge to his students but it is important how he wants to achieve that. It means in what way because a teacher should be an autority for students and not a good friend. On the other hand students should not be scared to talk with their teacher when there is a problem. If a teacher can well communicate with students it is more possible that the students pay more attention to the teacher and his lessons. On that way students would learn more in school than just listening to a teacher who does not care about his students. 
However, there are also reasons against this modern sight of the statement in the begining. It is a fact that teachers have an autority which students have to accept. An disadvantage of this new behaviour between teachers and students could be the loss of this autority of a teacher. it depends on the age of the students but they need in general somebody who tell them the rules. In worst case the students could get out of control and they would not do anything they should for their education. A positive aspect of teaching the excellent knowledge of the subject to the students is, if a student has to absolve an exam at another school to get accepted, he can get prepaired by the lessons at school. 
In conclusion I thin personally it should be a mix between this different mentalities for a good education. For students are both attitudes of teacher needed
