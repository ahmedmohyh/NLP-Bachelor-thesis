More and more little children are used to watch television hour for hour, so they are also used to advertises, but should these ones affect them directly?

It has to be said that some advertises could have a really bad influence on the thinking of a little child. We have to consider that a child at the age of two to five years is not able to make a difference between reality and the world of the television. It believes that, which an adult or whatever tells him and if in the advertise someone says that coke is very healthy, the child thinks that this is true. Such influences on opinions of little children can have really bad consequences, which could actually become a global problem.

But in contrast to that we should also bear in mind that advertises could also have a positive effect. If a advertise is made well it teaches the child something,or it helps him to build a one opinion, which would be great for the following years and its whole life. Mostly, children are not interested in advertises either and they prefer to watch cartoons and so one, in that case they would switch the channel. So why should it not be allowed?

My own opinion is that it should be allowed, because if parents think that advertise threatens their child, they should not let it watch television. I think at the age of 2 to 5 children are too young to watch television by their own anyway and if adults are there, they could change the channel if there is a bad advertise or a terrible scene. And if it is allowed each person can decide by his own if he wants to let his child watch advertise or not.
