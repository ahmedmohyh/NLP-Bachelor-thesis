I disagree. First of all, how can you make that children don't see an advert. You can't write age 5+ before every advert. Second of all, why should a television advert harm a child aged plus 5. I've never seen an advert that could harm a child. And I also think that children on that age won't even know the meaning of an advert. Well maybe that could be the only "reason" why they should not see an advert. There may be some adverts that don't really direct to the meaning of the product, but those adverts won't make a child go "crazy" or make them "stupid". There are even some cartoons that are worse than television adverts, but no one bats an eye to that. 
Also many TV canals wouldn't allow such a "law", because they would make less money, and the people who'd like to advertise wouldn't want to do so anymore. For example toy adverts, how could kids know about the newest toy on the market, kids also have wantings and we should not take that away from them. 
I think the laws for an advert are even too strict sometimes. People always want to go stricter and they are triggered by every little thing, but why are they like that? I really don't know.
