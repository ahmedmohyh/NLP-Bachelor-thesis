Should be television advertising forbidden for young children aged two to five?

We are living right now in a technical world and in the wealth areas of the world is a living without electric issues not possible or just not to think about. The children nowadays grow up completly different than I did. And when my parents didn't allowed me to watch lovely episodes like 'Biene Maya' or 'Pumuckel', I think my parents would have had several problems with me of course. Because watching TV was always a time to relax. But the films I watched were so lovely and there wasn't any violence to see. But that was because we could only watch films and not surf through several TV-channels. And thats the big different between these days and the old days. These days, it's so easy for the kids to know how an electirc machine works and so they are theoretically able to watch the biggest bullshit in the TV. And this could be very unhealthy for her mind. The TV can have a lot of bad influence and I'm personally glad, that I don't watch TV anymore. I think the kids should play outside than sitting inside and watching TV or playing with a smartphone. Otherwise the kids can't build up a relation between themselves and the nature, they don't get confronted with the reality and they will be allergic against many things of the nature. But I think it's also important, that when a rule like this is coming up, it should be controlled in a good way. Otherwise there are gonna be like two groups of children, the ones who never watched TV befor and the other ones who are always talking about series and stuff.
