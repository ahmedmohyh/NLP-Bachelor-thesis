Televison advertising
In modern society media is always present. It influences everybody just by the sheer presence. There almost none possibilities to escape these ifluences. Thus the young undeveloped minds of children are ifluenced by the media probably more than we know.
However the kids learn early to seperate in between what is real and what is not. They may also get used to the devices that bring along these ads. For exaple they get used to using a computer, a laptop, a smartphone or a tablet. They will not have any problems using these gadgets. And anyway it is the responibility of the parrents to what they show to their children and what not.
They are confronted this early that they do not even realize that they are influenced by these ads. They are not able to get an imagination about what they should beliefe and what not. Their minds will be influenced this much that they are almost completely controled by the media in terms of buying stuff. They will not understand why something is neccesary and why they need it because in the ads everything is shown as it is necessery in life and you have to buy it to be able to continue to life a normal life. But in the age where it will be vorbidden the parants have an inormous influence on the children and their behaviour in terms of consuming ads. Thus it is a consequenze of parenting skill to show the children what they should beliefe and what not.
In my opinion it is necessair to control the consume of young children since their minds are still in development and easy ifluenced. But as in order to everything else it is the responisbility of the parents of what their child is waching and what it should not watch.
