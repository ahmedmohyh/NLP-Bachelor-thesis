In my opinion both of this aspects are very important to teach students as a teacher. An Argument for the statement is that a teacher without the ability to relate with student is not able to teach. A teacher with this ability but without a knowledge of his subject is not a excellent teacher but he is able to teach students. So the person, who is able to teach students has a huge advantage in order to become teacher as a person, who is very good in one of his subjects but has not the ability to teach students.
A argument against this statement would be - like I said before - that a teacher, he could have the ability to relate very well with student but has no chance to become a teacher because of the written reasons. 
In a real case a person, who has not the ability to teach students won't be accepted at school for a job as teacher. Even a person who knows nothing to one of his subjects. The school wouldn't accept him. In my opinion in the reality you need of course the ability to relate well with students but not an excellent knowledge of the subject. If you want to be a teacher you have to be able to teach others. An "excellent knowledge" is not needed in the most cases.
So in general ould a agree but in reality this would not be accepted.
