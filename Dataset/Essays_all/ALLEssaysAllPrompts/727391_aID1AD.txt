In our digital age our television gets unsed a lot. When the fist televisions came into the households, mostly the parents watched TV. But soon we found out the use of television for children. The television companies started to show kids programms for children. So more and more parents led their children watch TV. As television got more and more famous, it got attractiv for advertiser. A company who advertises over a TV chanel, for example in a movie break, could rich, without a lot of effort, a decent number of potential costumers. Nowadays television advertising is normal on the most chanels. The effect on those who are watching the advertise is not totaly clear.
Some television chanels even started to show advertisements on kids chanels and these are also specially made for young children. But is this legal, or is it manipulating?
Young children of the age from two to five can not realy build their own opinion and often can not decide whether they want to see the advertisement or not. Young children also react a lot more sensilbe to inputs than older people do. They can ealsy get manipulatet. If an adult is watching an advertisement on television, he can make his own opinion about it. But a young child does not have this ability. So whatever a young child sees on television it believes. 
Another poin is, that it is just not fair for the parents if their children are keen on having the lollipop from television after they have seen its advertisement. 
Because of these facts, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be banned from all television chanels. Otherwise our children get somehow manipulated in a way we do not really anderstand.
