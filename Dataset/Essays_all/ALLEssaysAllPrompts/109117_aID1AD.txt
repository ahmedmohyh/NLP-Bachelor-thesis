Nowadays, a lot of the global advertising is being done in the visual sector, which include printed and digital media. The way how children spend their free time has changed since the invention of the television. Children tend to watch television more frequently than 30 years ago. The advertising segment has adapted to this change and as a result, even on programs targeted especially towards children, there are a lot of adverts advertising children stuff. Should adverts targeted towards children be banned?

First of all, children aged two to five are usually not able to read. Thus, they cannot inform themselves about the product of desire. The only other way of receiving information is by hearing or by pictures. It seems obvious that the best way of presenting a toy to a child is through the television.

On the other hand, children cannot judge a product as an adult or even a teenager would. They do not understand a lot about the price, the usage and lots of other aspects, which are taken into account in order to buy something. Furthermore, the children will eventually produce a desire after a certain product or toy and will not stop asking their parents about it, just because the child has seen others at his or her age playing with it in the ad. Sometimes even if they have something similar already.

In my opinion, television advertising should be banned because children are not able to make a smart decision concerning the worth of buying something and this leads to an unnecessary preassure on the parents.
