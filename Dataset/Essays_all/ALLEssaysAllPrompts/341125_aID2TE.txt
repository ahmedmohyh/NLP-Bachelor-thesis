Every school has teachers and the following essay is about the question if it's better to have much knowledge as a teacher or being able to relate well with the students. Of course it's important that the teacher is able to relate well with the students. For example it's better for the learning process when the teacher is nice. If the students have a lot of stress it's good when the teacher understands their situation and cares about it. It helps to improve the connection between the students and the teacher. A good connection is better for both. For example a teacher making an announced exam one or two weeks later because it's wished from the students. When you have a good relation to your teacher you will learn more.
It's also important that the teacher has knowledge about his subject. The students go to school because they want to learn something. It would be really bad if the teacher couldn't give them new inforamtions and learn them more. It's not funny to go to class if the teacher doesn't tell anything interesting. It's boring and the students won't listen, so the lessons won't be good. The students will distract themselves until the class is over. 
I think that a teacher can relate well with his students is as important as that he has a big knowledge of the subject which he teaches. So my conclusion is that a good teacher has to present botch qualities.
