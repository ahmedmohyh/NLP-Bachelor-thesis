Firstly, we all have to go to school. We all have teachers like a nightmare but also lovely ones who care about us and who make our life easier. But I am asking me, if it is important to know well the subject or if it is enough to be a friendly and interesting person. 

Personally, I like to go into the Biology class. Do you know why? Is it because I like the teacher or is it the reason that I love to add things to my knowledge? Kind of both I think. But for students the most devastating thing about school is motivation. Without motivation we spend our time on our chairs, waiting for something to happen and do not learn much about what we would be able to. In case the teacher relates well with her students, the children are more likely to pay attention and participate in coursework. Everybody seems to listen to the person who intends to teach something to the audience.

Contrairly to that, the knowledge of the teacher is important, too. You can not learn without the facts that your teacher can give you. If teachers are almost too kind, most of them are not strict and following to that students do what they want. In my opinion the knowledge can be learned by reading books, doing Internet researches and beeing interested in learning. By that, we can say that we can learn things without a teacher, profesor or any other person but it is the way we are used to have during our career of school.  

In conclusion, the ability of a good relation between a teacher and a student is more important than listen to very complex theory. But why we have to choose a distinction between knowledge and a good teacher? In the end, the best way is the conection between both. It has a lot of excellent teacher in the world who have a incredibly and stunningly knowledge they are ready to share with us.
