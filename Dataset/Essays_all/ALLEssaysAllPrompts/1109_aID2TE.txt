Teachers should have a good relation to their students. But an excellent knowledge is also very important for the students and their education. Students may agree that statement, because it might has an a big affect on their schoollife. Most students having a good relation to their teacher might be better in that subject, because they will  like going to school more. It is possibly easier for the students to follow the lessons. Nevertheless the teachers should have a good knowledge in the subject they are teaching.So can a good relation to a teacher push a student foward to better marks if the teacher is not able to give his knowledge to students? The knowledge of the teacher is the base to be give it to their students. so the perfect mix is made of both of these aspects. A teacher having an excellent knowledge, what a teacher definetly should have to be a teacher and relating well with students might be the best for a student, which means that a student can educate in the best way. My opinion follows on experiences i had and i think that many other students noticed the same. Marks were ways better when I had a teacher who can relate well to students but a good knowledge of the teacher has to be given. In addition I would personally say that  somebody who can not relate well with students or younger people should not be a teacher.
