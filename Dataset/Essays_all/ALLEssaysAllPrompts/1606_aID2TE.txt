A teacher and his students need a good relationship at school. How smart enough the teacher is to teach his subject is not so important. But is this the right way of being a teacher?
At first you don't need to be scared when you're going to school, because you're having a good teacher and you know that nothing bad can happen. You know you can talk to him,because he will be nice to you. But when you learn nothing at school, the reasons for being at school are gone. Maybe you get better grades, but when you are getting a new teacher you are seeing the problems that you had all the time, but didn't recognized yet. When you are having a teacher who is very smart, you learn something and in the end only knowledge is that thing that matters. In the future you will maybe forget the teacher, but the knowledge you got is still there and important. You will be thankful for the things you learned in the past, not for the teacher you got. A real teacher also needs to teach things to his students and not making friends with them. Also for all the tests knowledge is important.Some tests are not made up by the teacher you got and you will be write a bad grade. In the end the only thing we want are good grades for having a good job in the future and not a new friend who is our teacher.
