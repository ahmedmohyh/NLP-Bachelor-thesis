The importance of teacher's ability to relate well with the students

Nowadays, there are plenty teachers in each school who teach at least one or two subjects during their wohle periode of work. After a 45 minutes lesson, students change the room and also the teacher. So how much importance should be given to a good relationship between the teacher and the sudents and how important is the  teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject being taught by the tacher? 

So thinking of the iportance of the relationship between the teacher and the students, we fist of all think about the marks given by the teacher. So it's easilly to make a non-existent connection between student's relationship to te teacher and their marks. You can think, the teacher gives you better marks, if you have a good realtion towards him. I do not particularly agree with this statement. In some specific cases it might be like that, but in most of all, the teacher doesn't care about the realtionship towards the student while correction his examsheet.
But isn't it much more important to have a teacher who has a very excellent knowledge. Isn't ist more useful for the student to have somebody who explains the things very well? I personally think, that we shound give much more importance towars this aspect of teaching. For me, a teacher, needs to know much more than he's used to teach to every single class. He needs to have a great amount of experience and knowledge of many different things that could be related to his subject. So for example, a physics teacher really needs to know how mathematics work. Like our physics teacher, he needs to be able to explain all the formula an all the mathematic background we need to have persent in our minds to understand the physikal questioning.

So concerning all the arguments, we can definitely agree with the statement, that knowledge is more important that a good relationship.
