In the follwoing essay I will give a statement to the question, if a teachers abilitiy to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thought.
On the one hand one could say yes because when there's a good relationship between the students and the teacher, the students might be more willing to work and to learn and they also don't have to be afraid of asking questions. When there's a good relationship there might be also a better and nicer atmosphere in class.
But on the other hand the relationship between them is not as important as the knowledge the students should get from the teacher, because the students should be wanting to get good grades and not a teacher as their friend. The students have also got to get a lot of knowledge in school because a lot of it will maybe be important for their future and might decide, if a student is getting the place to work he/she wants in the future or not, because the knowledge wasn't enough.
Usually the knowledge of the teacher, which he/she is giving to the kids, and the relationship between both have got the same importance and there should be a good balance.
To summarize the statements I would say that there is no right and no wrong of the statement. As i already said, there has to be a good balance, but in the end it's more important for the students to know a lot and to get good grades than a good relationship to their teachers.
