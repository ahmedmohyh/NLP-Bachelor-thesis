A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
A pro argument for this statement is, that it is very important for a student to feel sichwohlfühlen in school. And that has much to do with a teacher's ability to relate well with students. 
A contra argument is, that a student goes to school to learn something, and it doesn't matter if a teacher have the ability to relate well with students or not.
But people with pro arguments think this isn't true. They think a teacher's ability to relate well with student's is more important because how can you as a student learn something if the teacher for example can't explain their knowledge to the students.
I think both of those things are important. A teacher's abilty to relate with students is important, but the fact that a teacher has excellent knowledge of his subject is also important. I thinks it is a good atmosphere if both things are important.
