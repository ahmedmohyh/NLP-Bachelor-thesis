Nowadays, there are a lot of choices on what you want to  watch at TV. Especially children love watching it, but of course the channels don`t only show movies or documentaries. More and more there is a lot of commercials and advertising between two programs. I can say about myself that I know many advertising quotes from different companies, and for me they`re easy to remember. 
Young children may be more influenced by commercials than older people, so the question is wether television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. I agree with this statement because in my opinion it`s a good idea not to show TV ads for children younger than five years, or maybe even older (e.g. until seven years). Most children like everything they`ve seen at TV and want their parents to buy it for them. But mostly after a month, it`s broken or not interesting anymore, and they want to have something new. I think this is just a waste of money. The problem is, when everybody has this special thing and only few kids not, they feel sad or seperated from the others. But of course this is the strategy of the advertisement industry, and they gain a lot of money with things like this. 
If something should change, for me it`s important that the parents do a step and "save" their children from the mighty industry. To put it in a nutshell, I think there is no chance to forbid TV advertisings because of human rights relating to expression of opinion.
