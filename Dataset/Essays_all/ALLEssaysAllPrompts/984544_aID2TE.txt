The job of a teacher is to explain things to the students. To do this he needs to know how to explain the topic and of course he needs to know informations about the topic. But what is more important?

A pro for the excellent knowledge of a topic is that if they do not know the answer, they will not have anything to explain. A good teacher must know the answers to all questions of a student. If he only knows a little part of the whole topic the students will not get better in the topic. But there is the other way arround aswell: If a teacher got the excellent knowledge about a subject but he does not know at all how to explain it, he will not learn anything to the students.

So a teacher needs both, a part of good knowledge and a part of ability to relate well with the students. Let`s talk about a teacher that got both things, but one is better then the other one: Wich one should it be? If the teacher would have a bigger knowledge, he would be able to explain more things to the students. This would be a good thing if the students already got a little knowledge of a topic, because like that they would not get confused too fast. But if the students would not have any background informations a teacher who can explain things better would be perfect. Like that the students would easily get a good (or medium) knowledge.

So as we can see the question: "is the ability to relate well with students more important than an excellent knowledge about a subject" depends on the situation. For myself, I prefer a teacher that can explain what he knows. I think that getting to much details about a subject is ussless, because if I am interested in a topic i can do reasearches by myself in my free-time. But to get interested in a topic I need someone who can explain it well to me. I agree with the question.
