Television advertising is a topic whitch became very important for today. Often the advertises are shown between movies on all channels. That also includes the television channels for children. But is that ok? Should the children aged two to five see advertising, for example for expensive toys?

One important argument for advertising directed toward young children is that the advertises would be "fitted" for the children. That means that advertise which are shown on tv channels for adults wouldn't be shown on the kids channels. So the children would only see things that are interesting for them. That could be advertises for other TV-shows or interesting and new toys. 

An argument against these topic is that advertises for example for toys, these toys are always shown better than they really are. Children up to five are not "smart" enough to get these advertising tricks. They always belive what they see or hear. With this intention, the advertising companys use the kids to sell their the product they advertise for.

In my opinion Television advertising should be forbidden on TV-channels made for children up to seven or eight years. After this age most of the children are intelligent enough to get the clue behind the advertise: the companys want to sell their products and often show them perfect so that every child should have on of these. So I agree with the topic that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
