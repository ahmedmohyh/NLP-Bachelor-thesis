In my opinion there are no problems about the statement below.
On the one side i can understand that some humens are not okay whit that but i think it is a normal procces in the new modern world.
So one say that it would be bad for the kids and they have problems in their social life.
The kids have no friends because of the television consum they have.
But In our modern world whit so much war and political statements i think it is our oppotunity to informate the young humens.
So i think that Television is not oly bad when it used safely. Also it is a normal rising process to watch tv and play video games on playstations. I don't know even one child who doesn't do this in their childhood. And that they don't get freinds is a not truth point, because every kid do this and every kid get so 'online' friends who also are friends.
Es ist ja nicht  so, that the kids are every day in the house and watches all day long tv and play video games. The school or kindergarten is there a very important point because the cildren can talk there to ech other and can social contacts knüpfen.
In my opinion it should give more high quality information sources also in the internt were these children can learn and have fun.
I think the children should have there fun and learn by themselves. To the end i can say that it should'nt be forbidden but it should be verantwortungsbewusst used.
