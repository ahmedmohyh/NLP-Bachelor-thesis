Advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life. In the trains on the streets and even on television. On television, there is by far the most advertising. This is disturbing, as there are really long television breaks for advertisements only. The problem with advertisements on TV is that it isn't possible to ignore them. The question is: should such advertisement of television which directs toward young children be allowed?

To start off it is safe to say that it is difficult for kids to find out about new things. Television advertising is only a way of showing kids possibilities which they wouldn't have known of without television. Advertising is all about expanding the kids horizon.
Moreover, kids are being entertained by advertisements. They see cool things in the television that they want, but they probably won't ever have them. This makes the kids dream about what they could have and entertains them. It is important that kids never stop dreaming, and that kids are entertained enough.

On the other hand, kids usually want the cool stuff they've seen in the TV. The problem is that kids havent got any money. First thing they do is they run to their parents and ask them to buy the toy, or whatever the advertisement was for. This isn't the best for the kids education. Kids should learn how to deal with money and how to decide whether they really need something or not.
Furthermore, kids will find everything cool. They can't judge if it is something cool and something usable or just something that has to be sold. Most of the things that are advertised on the TV are unnecessary things which are really bad quality and not usable.

It is clear that television advertising for children is something that causes rather problems that educating the kids. Kids should be able to watch television without being disturbed by advertisements which are turning them crazy.
