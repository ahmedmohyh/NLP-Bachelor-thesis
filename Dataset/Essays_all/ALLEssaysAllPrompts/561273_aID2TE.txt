Teachers nowadays teach very differently from those a hundred years ago. These days a teacher not only needs to know the subject well but also has to support their students in other matters. Beside, the classes should be variant and the students should apply different methods to learn. It is known that a good climate within the class is important as well as a good relationship to the teacher in order to have the maximum learning success. But is it more important that the teachers relate well with the students or that they have excellent knowledge of their subject?

As already mentioned, a good relationship with the teacher is an important part of success. If the teacher does not interact with the class, student's motivation is lower as well as their willingness to learn than with a teacher they like. If the students are looking forward to the classes, they are prepared to do homework and contribute to the classes. Should that not be the case they just attend school but dont really learn much. That's why a teacher needs social capabilities in order to relate well with the students. 

On the other hand a teacher must know their subject well. A teacher who has no idea of his subject cannot be taken seriously. Why should students believe what their teachers say when they know that they sometimes tell wrong contents? The students no longer see why they should learn something that possibly is not even true. Only relating well with the students, it seems, is not enough to make a good teacher. 

In my opinion teachers need to have excellent knowledge of their subject. Is that not the case they struggle explaining the content comprehensibly and the students will notice that very easily. At the same time good teachers should also show that they are human and that they understand the problems and difficulties of their students. It is the mixture of both - excellent knowledge and a good relationship - that makes a teacher successful.
