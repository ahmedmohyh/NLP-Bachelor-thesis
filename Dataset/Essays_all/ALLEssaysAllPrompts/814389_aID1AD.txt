Nowadays children often watch television instead of going outside. This leads to some children seeing too many commercials. It's not rare that children, after they've seen such a thing, go up to their parents and ask them to buy this certain thing for them. But what if they wouldn't see the commercials? Would the parents have less pressure of buying their children certain things?

On the one hand it's of course great for the product to direct their advertisement towards children, on the other hand they do make doubtful use of the childrens innocence and inexperience. If someone tells a child that this nerf gun is great and it's the thing they've always wanted, then the child will believe this. But what if it's true? What if the child will have fun with the product? Is it wrong to get the childrens parents to buy it?

Some people are sure it is. Children should be able to choose what they want without getting influenced too much by advertisement. However, some say that adults are also influenced a lot by advertisement so why should it be wrong to do the same with children. 

Personnally, I think children should definitely not get to see as much advertisement as adults. I guess it influences them too much in some ways. If it was forbidden to direct television advertising towards young children, I think it would  also help the parents a lot. Of course parents do have to say no sometimes, but it does no harm to prevent directing television advertising towards children. Because despite the fun things you see on television some of the commercials do really have a bad influence.
