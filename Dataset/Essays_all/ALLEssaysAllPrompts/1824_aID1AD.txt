In the folloeing text I am going to write about television advertising dirercted toward young children. This topic is difficult, because on the one hand their are children who have to be protected and on the other hand their are the producents, the companies which have to sell their toys.

Television advertising is absolutly normal nowdays, but if children are in the focus there are huge problems:
First, chrildren are easy to manipulate and this is nothing than maipulation. The companies which are publishing a new toy and praise this in the television, they want the children to buy this. 
Another point is that the german law declares that children are not be able to save them selves from influenes from outside. As well as this their are also under the protection of their parents. The parents have the ability and not only that, they must protect their children from these influenses. Now you could say that the parents are in order to do that and why the state has to forbit the advertising for child toys. Yes you could, but many parents are unably to know sometimes what is good or not. Many very young parents or single mothers or fathers have to time to be there for their child and so they set them down, in front of the tv and the child watches tv without any protection. This is maybe the minority, but there are some outside and they also must be proctected. 

Also the companies have other ways to raise their sells. The advertising should showed for the parents or for adoults not for their children. The parents can realize what is what their are showing.

All in all, I think it is helpful to forbit the television advertising which are directed to young children in an age of two to five. These children should not be allowed to decide what is good or bad they parents have to do this and the state should help the parents at this point. 
No it should
