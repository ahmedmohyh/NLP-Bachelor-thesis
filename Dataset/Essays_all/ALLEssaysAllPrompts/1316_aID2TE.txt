I disagree with the statement ''A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught'' because when you have a teacher who has not the excellent knowledge, the students learn incorrect facts and make a lot of mistakes in their future because they didn't learn how to use correct words or tenses. For example: you have a teacher who uses incorrect verbforms or the grammatic is very bad, the students make the same mistakes all time because they think the teacher is right. They also get bad grades when they get an other teacher.
