Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be forbidden? In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.

In the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign. For example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life. Besides you can watch advertisements in TV that show people who do embarassing things so that the spectators laugh about them. That`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five. As they are able to sing the song that they listened to in television or want exactly these cookies that their star is eating in the advertisement too. That these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad fact. One can pretend them from that by forbid them to watch TV. Apart from television there are so much interesting things to do and let them know how things are working: for example showing them how to bake a cake, drawing pictures or doing other creative work. But there are also reasons that are for the idea of allowing advertisements toward little children in TV. The earlier they are confronted to advertisements the better they can resist them when they are older. That would cause not buying the things that one has seen in TV but instead of that being independent from the advertisements. 

All in all I would say that I don´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements. So nobody cares when you watch them first. It is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements.
