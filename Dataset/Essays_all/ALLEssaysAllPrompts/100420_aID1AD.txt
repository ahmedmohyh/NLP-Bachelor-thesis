In the following text the question is discussed, if Television advertising directed toward young childre (aged two to five) should not be allowed. There is a conrtoverse discussion about that subject for long now. But is that really so unresponsible from the advertising industrie?
As capitalist and CEO you have the absolute right to advertise like that, because your goal is  to catch eye-balls and to sell more of whatever product. As a mother of 4 young children and not too much money though, you might not be so happy when your children always desire the fanciest toy. So what to do about it?
For the advertisors young children are easy to connect with, because they do not have such a complex believe and decision making system as most adults do. Therfore it is quite compelling for companies, to make cheap advertisements with good chance to succed. On the other hand, it is exactly that, that young children are not able to distinguish useful and not useful information, that makes advertising toward this group questionable.
For the companies it is an easy way to get new customers, because when the children are growen up, and might have themself childern, they still will remember what they wanted in their childhood and so will buy it for their kids. It is almost at the level of some kind of indoctrination so to speak, which makes it moraly unatractive to advertise towards young children.
In my opinion the resposibility lies by the parents of the children and not by the advertisors. It is their problem, when they just let their child watch TV nine to five a day. So they have to take responsibility for how their child develops and to control the input it gets from the environment. Therefor i do not think one can prohibit to advertise toward young children.
