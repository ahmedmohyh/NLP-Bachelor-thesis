I agree, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Becaus first i think a child in age of two don't even have to look tv. Second a child in age of two plays one day with a toy and the next day it isn't anymore intrested. Parents don't have to buy toys, becaus their children saw it on tv. A little girl wants everything, that is pink. Doesn't care what it is. Little children don't know, what is good for them and waht not. Their parents have to say what is good for their children. Children in this age have to play outside and creat their own toys with their friends. In the tv looks everything much better. It's expensive and not good quality. One week is a barbie in the television advertising and in the next week a ball, witch can change the collors. And the barbie is already history. The childrens cry for the barbie to get it. And when the parents finaly buy it, they don't care after a few days. If there would be no television advertising for young children, they wouldn't need this things, becaus they never heard about it. The children in age of two can't buy the toys becaus the have no money, so their parents have to buy it. If the children can't buy it, the advertising shouldn't be for young children. They should go out and play with trees, animals, nature and their friends. Children should learn new friends know.And not seat in front of a tv.
