The statement targets a widely disputed matter in the field of education, if a teacher's ability to relate to students should have priority over their knowledge of the subject they're teaching.
Of course these two are rather important features for a teacher to have but to prioritize one over the other could bring advantages and disadvantages.
For one, if you prioritize the ability to relate to students over the knowledge of their craft, you risk a decrease of the quality of their education, since the teachers may not be educated enough in their subject to teach it to students. Vice versa it also brings problems, if you prioritize the teacher's knowledge of the subject being taught over the ability to relate to students, you might also decrease the quality of the student's education, because even if a teacher is excellent in their field of education, he or she might not be able to transfer this knowledge to the students in a way that the students would comprehend it, since the teacher can't relate to them.
Yet prioritizing one of these features of the teachers can also bring advantages.
If the teacher is able to fully relate to the students, it can make learning much easier and less stressful for the students, since the teacher would be able to understand what the students are thinking or feeling and would correspond accordingly.
Choosing to prioritize the knowledge of the subject being taught also brings good, because it would ensure the good quality of the actual knowledge that is being transfered to the students.
While I think that out of these two features of a teacher I'd choose the teacher's ability to relate to students, I believe that both features are very important and should be in balance to one another.
