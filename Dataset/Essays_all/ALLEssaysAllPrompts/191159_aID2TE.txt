The other day our french teacher was trying to show us, that french spellig is quite easy. She showed us examples, which seemed obvious to her, but we just couldn't quite comprehend the reason. She went on about how easy french is, but our whole class didn't agree. She couldn't relate to us, as she can already speak french very well, if not nearly perfectly and we are still in the process of learning it. In this case it would have been beneficial for her to be able to relate to our situation.

In a situation, where the teacher relates to the pupils, one learns things faster and remembers them longer. The teacher can formulate the concept in a way, that is more understandable to the students. This leads to the students learning more and having fun in the process. However, if the only virtue of the teacher is to be able to relate, his knowledge on the subject to teach may be lacking. This eradicates the benefits, as insufficient knowledge of the teacher leads to wrong assumptions and habits of the students, aswell as false information.

If a teacher can relate to the student so well, that he starts behaving like one, the students may have fun, but ultimately it leads to them not learning anything. The function of school is, for the students to learn how to function as an intergrated human in society and to pass on knowledge, not to become best buddies with a teacher.

All of this leads me to only partly agree with this statement. I agree that a teachers ability to relate is very important. However their knowledge on the subject they teach should not be lacking. They should have a good mixture between understanding and relating with the students and having a profound knowledge on the suject. If this balance is ideal, both the students and the teacher will enjoy learning from each other and walk out of every lesson wih a feeling of accomplishement.
