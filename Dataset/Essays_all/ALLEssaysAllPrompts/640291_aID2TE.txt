A teacher's job is to teach students about his subject. Teaching requres abilities to explain things, to relate well with the students, to be communicative and fair. However, a teacher also has to have a certain knowledge of the subject he's teaching, otherwise he won't be able to teach the students anything.
 But this doesn't mean that the teacher has to be a doctor in his subject. Most of the times this doesn't even help, because the teacher's standards are set way too high and the students won't understand the subject and are more likely to fail the class. For example a math teacher who spent most of his lifetime studying in an excellent university and who never had any problems in maths, might have some problems explaining more simple mathematical themes to students, because he's so well educated. Therefore he can't relate with students, who aren't the best in mathematics, because maths were always easy for him and consequently the students might lose their motivation.
So, in my opinion, it would be better to have a teacher, who can relate well with the students and who has the ability to explain things in a simple way, rather than in a complicated, non-understandable way, even if his knowledge of the subject isn't that great.
