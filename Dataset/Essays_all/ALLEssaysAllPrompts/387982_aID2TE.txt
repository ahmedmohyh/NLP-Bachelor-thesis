Every day we have to go to school and learn something new for the future. We spend the most time of the day in the school. The teachers have to explain to us new things so that we can use our knowledge in our daily life or for the future when you want to get your dreamjob. And now the statement is that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.  
 
It's important that the teacher knows how to communicate and behave with students. Especially when the students are teenagers because they can be really rude at some point and the teachers should be able to teach us good discipline and behaviour too. 
As a teacher they have to teach differents topics in a way that the students understand it and these guys have to know the topics if they want to success the exam.

But how do you want to mess the ability of the teachers if they can relate well with students or not. There will be some very curious people who want to know more stuff than being taught and when you have a teacher who doesn't have an amazing knowledge would be difficult. 

In my opinion it's really important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject being tauhgt.But at the same time the teachers should be able to relate with the students. The both abilities are very important.
