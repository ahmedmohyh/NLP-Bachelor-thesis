Television advertising is a controversial topic, especially if it is targeting young children. As usual,there is not only one right opinion.
Parents must be aware of the "risks" if they let their children watch television. They should be aware of the consequences of this useful "game" if they just want to get their children doing something. Advertising targeting young children might have some positiv aspects. Since young children are very susceptable for new information (including advertising), the believe everything said in an advertisement. If we take a milk promotion as an example(considering milk is healthy): The advertisement is telling that every child needs milk in order to grow up and become strong. Probably, most of the children disliking milk before the ad, will start to drink milk, since they believe they need it. 
On the other hand,advertisement on television specified for young children is very dangerous. Children are probably the most likely to get manipulated since they have not learned yet how to evaluate information they receive. So if there is an ad for a chocolate bar saying that it is very tasty,good for children and even can replace a whole meal, young children are likely to believe in this. Furthermore, advertising directed toward young children teachs them materialistic values already in their young age. 
In conclusion, the negative aspects overweigh the positive ones. Even though parents have a certain responsibility for their children, it is unreasonable to place specific advertising for children of that young age. It is not necessary to make our children already "adicted" when they are 4 or 5, not to television and not to other promoted goods including lots of sugar etc. Therefore, we need to be careful what we promot.
