The question wether television avertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is a theme with a lot of different aspects.
First of all I think that the children are old enough to make this experience and to find out in which world we live. The second aspect is that Children grow up in a world with a lot of social medias. They live in a time where the internet and television is one of the most popular thing all over the world. 
Secondly I think that television advertising would be a great adventure for the children and they can find out their straights. They learn a lot of things they will need in life. 
But on the other side I think that the children are too young for the television advertising. It´s important for young children that they learn that the social media isn´t that important. They might be play in the nature or they have to spend time with family. So when they were confrontated in this young age with television advertising, it might be not that good for young children. Moreover I think that the Children arn´t in the mood to say no or yes to television advertising. So the parents usually decide wether their children have to take party in television advertising.
I come to the conclusion that the children shouldn´t be allowed to television advertising. They are to young to make their own decisions and they have to play in nature. They have to live their childhood. This means to play games and not beeing a part of television advertising.
