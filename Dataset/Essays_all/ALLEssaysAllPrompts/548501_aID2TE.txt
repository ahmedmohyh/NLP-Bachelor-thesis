The reason for the kids to go to the school is that they have a better knowledge afterwards. But if the teacher and the kids understand each other better, the kids will also learn more because they have more fun and understand each other better. So when you look back after you finished school it is more important that you have learned something because your future is depending on it. When you're in school you think it's great when the teacher is doing some dumb stuff with you and in the lessons you laugh a lot but in the end you just had a great time and you dind'nt learn much. So it is important for the kids that they have the possibility to have a good teacher, who will teach them a lot. You can't learn everything in school, that's normal but for your education you need good skills and you have to learn them until you have a good job.
I have known many teachers, who just thought that fun would be better than actually learning and maybe because of them I think that it is more important to learn and have a good education. We live in a world where education is more important than learning how to live. We want to have a good job so someday we can be a good mother or father, whom can give their children a better life and also to have a better status in our life, to be better. But if I would become a teacher I would have a balance between a good relationship with kids and the knowledge I have to teach them. You can't always just give homework and do actually work sometimes it needs to be funny too. A good relationship to the students is important but you have to make shure that also a distance is there. So you don't get to close to your students.
