In the following essay I will point out why I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.

Of course I understand parents who say that this advertising just makes children want more things to play, the newest things, the most popular things, the most expensive things. And that is true, kids can be convinced more easily than adults to buy something or to let it be bought by their parents.
But on the other hand how many companies do we have that are specified on the production and selling of toys. Advertising is a huge part of their marketing and without this they would not be able to present and sell so many new toys. Companies like ToysRUs would lose very much of their profit over the years. That would be bad for the economy because when less toys are sold less toys will be produced and less toys will be exported.               There are advertisements for everything that is just part of how our society works. If it is on television or in a newspaper or even on a bench in the park, advertisements are everywhere. 
In the end it is the choice of the parents wheather they buy their kids these toys or not. It is their decision if they want to teach their kids wheather they can not have everything they want or not.
If think television advertising should be allowed even toward young children and if parents have a problem with that they should not let their kids watch that much television. Children will always want the newest and funniest toys because they hear about them from other kids or see it on other kids. They are young and do not understand that everything costs money and that money has to be earned. Never then less parents should teach their children that they can not get everything they want, because in life it is not that way either.
