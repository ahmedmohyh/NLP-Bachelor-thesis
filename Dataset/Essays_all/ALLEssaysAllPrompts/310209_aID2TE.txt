So first let me ask this question:"What is a teacher?" "A teacher is a person who teachs you things about life,nevertheless he has to have a good knowledge and the ability to keep things interesting, otherwise the students won't listen to him. He has to keep in touch with students and fascinate them while doing his lesson.
In my opinion it is important to have a general knowledge about the theme, otherwise you aren't able to teach well. Everyone, who is a teacher had studied for years in a university because it is required. And that is good, because in general  the person itself hasn't stopped learning new things, so the teacher has widden his knowledge during those years studying at a university. 
But on the other hand, for me it is necessary, that a teacher is good in explaining things or themes. If you are a teacher and you are very smart but you can't explain anything, you won't be able to teach a class. It's sad but true, but your knowledge isn't useful for other people. So the most important thing, of being a teacher, is the ability to explain things understandably. But those teachers you find once in a blue moon, trust me. Furthermore a good teacher has the ability to enjoy the students whenever he teachs something to them in front of the blackboard , otherwise school isn't intersting anymore and students get depressed.  
Summarising i want to say that it is more important being able to explain things clearly, than have a enormous knowledge , and you have no use for it. Both, students and teachers, have a better lesson. There are advantages for both sides.
