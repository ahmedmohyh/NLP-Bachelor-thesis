In my opinion, a teacher should have the ability to transfer his knowlege to the students and it doesn't matter how. With the upcoming problems in our world, the humanity has to impove their skills to solve problems. So to be able of solving problems the people have to brush up their knowlege and they have to learn how to think logical. It doesn't matter how they become better in these parts. 
But I have to add that a good realationship between the students and the teachers would support the transfer of knowlege from generation to generation. 
In my point of view a teacher should be able to relate well with students but otherwise he have to know things.Because if a teacher is good only in one of these two parts, the students can't profit. I mean how could a student learn things in school if he doesn't understand the explanations of the teacher. The degree of knowlege a taecher should have depends on grade of school. It's obvious that a teacher on a high school doesn't need to know as much about his subject as a professor on a university. But both must be able of anewering questions the students have.
To improve to ability of thinking abstract, a student have to ask questions and a teacher must be able to answer.
