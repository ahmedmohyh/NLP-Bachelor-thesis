Should television advertising directed toward young children be illegal?

Little children are highly influentual. Seeing an interesting game or play tool in an advertisement makes them go crazy for it. This is problematic because it will end in an argument with their parents. 

On the other hand side shouldn't children such a young age be watching television often anyways. In my eyes are not only the avertisements playing a problematic role but the whole television-watching-actiity itself. Children should be playing outside. There are a lot of things children shouldn't be watching and as long as they are not watching it, there is no problem. What I want to say with that, is that parents are responsible what their children are watching. 

Advertisements should be directed towards adult people anyways. These people are the one with the money and the one who will eventually purchase a certain item or tool. So I think it is a clever move to make advertisements directed to adults rather than little children. But it shouldn't be illigel to make advertisments for children.

I'm not a big fan of too many prohibits. And advertisemetns are not harming anyone. The only problem I see is that the children will start to complain that they want a certain game they have seen in a specific advertisement, but good parents will get over this situation.
