For students it's very important that teacher can relate well with them, because the feeling that someone who understands you is teaching you helps alot of students. But I think that it's also very important that there is a knowledge of he subject taught. Because if a teacher doesn't know anything about the subject he can't teach something.

But I agree with the statement because the ''relationship'', in a schoolish meaning,  is very important between teacher and student. If there is a good relationship between the class and teacher are the students more interested.
 If the teacher only tells the students what he knows about some specific toppics are the students very borred. The teacher is not able to do somethig special with the class because he is like five steps away from the class and the students. But if there is a teacher that relats well with students is alot easier for him, because the teacher is able to work better with the whole class. Like this the teacher is only one step away from the class

For teachers it's very important that the class is active and learns alot,I think that students with a teacher that relates well with them are able to learn more and faster, even if the teacher doesn't have an excellent knowledge as other teachers,just because other teachers are having more knowledge of a specific subject, doesn't mean that they can give the information to the students in an understanding way.
Often they're not able to give the knowledge to the students, because they don't know how they can learn the fastest or which way is the best to understand. Like that, they are maybe often very stressed. Otherwise teacher that are relating well with the students are more calmed down because they know how their students are working and which way the best is.
