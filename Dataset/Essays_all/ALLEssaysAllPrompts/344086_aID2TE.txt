An essay to this controversal statement 

Everybody of us has experiences with the techniques of teaching. There are so many formes which are controversal discuessed in relation to bring the knowledge to the students.Do the teachers have to be realte well with students or is it more important to teach the students brilliant knowledge of the subject? 

For me personally it's more precious to relate well with students than to have an excellent knowledge of the subject because a rational reltionship between teachers and students is for both parties profitable. Of course, the second statement is also very important for the qualitiy of the lessons but students associate also quality with the constellation between the teacher and them. If a teacher is abscent or too distantly to the students, first they can feel uncomfortable or unimportant. A too frozen relationship results to less confidence in discussing problems or asking questions to the students. 
But I didn't want to say that a teacher should have lost this autority; Mr. or Mrs. teacher have to keep attention on them because when they're to well realted to the students which means, they are more collegues, they lost a bit of an hierarchy, which is also need for the school life.

At the end, it's sustainable for both to have a rational/healty balance in their relationship because it makes for both a confortable, productive school climate which is not just good for the expansion of their kowlege, it's also good for their asscociations thinking of school life
