A school is looking for a new physics teacher and there are two candidates. One is a renowned scientist, but he does not seem to be able to relate to children very well. The other one is not as well trained as the physicist. Even though he knows all the basic principles that are taught, when it comes to more complicated themes, than what is taught at school he lacks a certain understanding. So which one ought to be hired?

A good knowledge of the subject one is teaching is essential. It is not enough to know more or less what you are talking about and being able to read out loud the passages of cours material. Students have a lot of questions, be it because they do not understand something, be it because they are curious. Consequently a teacher must posess excellent knowledge of the subject in order to be able to explain everything.

Why do we need teachers, if we have books and the internet? Because neither of those can relate to humans and to make somebody understand something you have to be able to speak with them on their level and understand where the problem lies. Therefore a teacher must be able to understand his students. As long as he knows the subjects he teaches fairly well, meaning everything you are covering in school, he will be able to make his students understand, when a book filled with all kinds of extra knowledge can not.

In conclusion we can say that both are important, knowledge of the matter and the ability to relate to students. But the thing is, the statement does not speak of knowledge, but rather of excellent knowledge of the subject. The word excellent means that you have knowledge beyond what you need to teach. That of course is an useful asset but really useless if your students do not even understand the things you are teaching. I, personally think that being able to relate to your students is more important, than superior knowledge of the subject.
