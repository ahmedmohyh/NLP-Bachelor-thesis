An argument against advertising directly towards young children is that they're way to easy to influence and they can't judge like an adult person can if they need to have the advertised product or not. That means if a young children sees an advertisement they are more likely to feel forced to buy that certain product than an adult. In contrast to that there are also arguments that support the television advertising directed towards young children for example the companys who produce product for children aged two to five want to sell their products so they advertise like any other company and if a children is aged two to five the parents should decide if the children should get the product or not. Also the parents can decide if the children should watch TV or not so in the end it's all about the parents. Another argument is that the children, in most cases, can't buy the products anyway because they don't have any money so they have to ask their parents if they can get the product or not and if the parents say no the children maybe learns that it can't always have everything it wants to have. If advertising directly towards those young children would be allowed many adults would probably also lose their job because TV stations that are for children are most likely to play advertisements that are for kids so if they would be forbidden the TV stations can't play advertisements that are for their viewers anymore which would mean that some companys would really lose much money.  
In my opinion the TV advertising directed towards young children should't be forbidden because of the arguments above. Also as I mentioned before I think parents should watch over their children if they watch TV and not give them all they see in the advertisements so I think this is really about the parents. Also in my opinion not allowing these kind of advertisements is some kind of censorship.
