A teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important, but to have an excellent knowledge about the subject you taught is also important. You can't be a good teacher if you teach something you don't know anything about, but the other way around it's the same. The first thing that comes to mind if you think of a teacher is that the teacher has to know about the subject that he teaches. I mean thats obvious. If you don't know what you talk about you aren't allowed to teach a class, it's the most important ability for a teacher. But on the other side if you know everything about physics but you can't explain how it works or the students don't have any clue what you are talking about it as bad as not knowing anything about the subject. We've also had teachers who really liked physics but couldn't teach it to us so we had to learn everything again at home. So you can't be a teacher without both of the abilities. Well, I mean you can be a teacher but than you aren't a good one and it's not a benefit for everyone. I think another important ability to be a good teacher is to love beeing a teacher. If you love your subject and explaining it to students than it would be more fun for everyone. The stundents wil love to go to your class and they'll understand it much more. For example I've had a history teacher who was my favorite. He loved his subject, knew everything about it, thaught us everthing like a story so we could remember it and everyone was happy. He had put so much effort in his job to make it interesting and more fun for us. Well back to the main sentence. In my opinion i think it's a lot more important to relate with students because you can always learn about your subject your teaching but to have the ability to relate to student is rare and very important to me.
