How should a theacher teach? This question is nowadays not easy to answer. There are a lot of theories about the correct way of theaching and each of them is different. Because of this, many teachers are not shure anymore what they should do. Should they try to be the best friend of their students or should they know as much as possible about every topic, which they are teaching?

If a teacher is too close to his student, than the class has no respect. The students will do whatever they want  andtalk all the time and these will cause a bad learn atmosphere. The reason for this is, that if the teacher is always trying to be the best friend of his students, he will never say no or stop, also he will rarely punish a student, because he does not want that the students start to dislike him.

A teacher, who keep the most possible distance in the relation to his students, is not in every situation the best solution, because he will always be the biggest enemy of the class and never know what actually is going on in the class. If there is a problem in the class he will get to know about it, when it is already too late.

To have an exellent knowledge about the topic is a good thing. In this case he can definitely answer nearly every question of his students.

The only problem, if the teacher has a big knowledge about a topic, is, that he may will achieve that his class has the same level of knowledge about the topic. This means for the class that the velocity of the lessons is high and that they have to learn much for the tests. 

In my opinion the middle thing of these two ways is the best solution. My dream teacher should not be my best friend, but also not my enemy. Additionally he or she should now as much as possible about the topic, but if she or he has to research the answer of a difficult question I have no problem with it.
