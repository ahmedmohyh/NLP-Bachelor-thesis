Imagine a world, where our kids are being taught by roboters. It may already is the case. Some teachers are already being considered as roboters, even tough they are humans. But teachers are more, than just roboters, who stand in front of class, hammering some formules in our heads. For some students, they are also a person of trust; someone, who is there for you, and who can help you, if you're in trouble. There may not be a problem, if every student is a roboter to. But everyone of us is more complex then any math problem we can imagine.
Sometimes it may be even better, if the teacher is not a genius, if it is someone, who also had to battle with math and french. Like this he knows even better, what's difficult and what's not. He knows, what may causes trouble and how to explain it. 
So yes, I agree with this statement, but we can't forget, that teachers also must have the ability to teach their general knowledge, even if it's not that big.
