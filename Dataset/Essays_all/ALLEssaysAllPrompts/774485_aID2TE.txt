A lot of people would say that the most important thing as a teacher, is to know your own subject well. You need to be able to perfectly understand the subject you are teaching, so that you can explain it simply. If a person is not able to explain complicated things in a simple way, then he has not understood it himself.

However we all know the image of the genious scientist who can hardly explain anything in a simple manner. Obviously the scientist knows what he is talking about but he could never teach it. To be a teacher you have to be socially competent. You havee to be able to relate to your students and you need to know how they think. Just because you know everything about your subject does not make you a good teacher. Teaching is a science in itself.

In many countries people percieve the standard of education is falling. Maybe the view that being able to relate to your students is more important than knowing your subject has caused this.You could argue that you need to know a lot about your subject to be able to teach it to others. To be a good teacher you have to be an expert at your subject.

That you have to have a certain level of expertise regarding your subject is of course true. This still does not mean that the most important thing about teaching is knowledge of the subject. You do not have to have a Nobel prize to be a good teacher. Usually teachers do not have to teach very advanced things anyway. They stick to the basics. So the only thing teachers mainly have to understand are in fact only the basics. To be able to teach these it is most important to be able to relate to your students.

This is why, in my opinion, it is more important to be able to relate well to your students than to be an expert at your subject.
