For me, the most important thing to do as a teacher is being interesting. A teacher who knoes a lot of things but who doesn't know how to explain them right and who's not interesting is worst than a teacher who knoes less things but explain them well. 
As a student I would prefer a teacher who learn us with passion and facility than a teacher who simply tell us things in a boring way, althought the facts could be really interesting. The place of the speaking way in teaching is clearly the most important thing a teacher needs to think about. 
But a teacher needs to have something to say too to be interesting. A teacher who speak very well but does not know a lot of things is less interestingt than one who knoes some good stuff but no how to say them. 
A good teacher is a teacher who knoes how to speak with students and who has something to say others than the course, the diaporama, or exactly the programm.
