Now having spent over 10 years at schools, most of us had teachers, who had a really good reputation when it came to relating to students. But on the other hand, everybody of us also had a teacher who nobody liked and nobody got along with well, even though the teacher might have had more knowledge than the one the students could relate to better.
The questions that has to be posed is if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Relating to student isn't the only thing that matters. It could be argued that it's more important to have better knowledge of the subject, because students can learn more in the lessons, ignoring the fact of them possibly being bored. Lessons can be used much more effectively and can be far more informative than lessons with a less excercised teacher. Because of better knowledge of a teacher students have the possibility to learn more stuff in less time, whether they can relate to the teacher or they do not. 
On the other hand, one could argue that relating to students should be the teachers leading ability, because they have to be encouraged to participate and learn during a lesson. Furthermore, to much knowledge on behalf of the teacher, combined with a bad relationship to the students, can lead to miscommunications between the two "parties". The teacher, simply having a higher standart of knowledge, can easily get annoyed if he tries to teach the students more advanced stuff and the students don't pull at the same string as the teacher.

All in all you have to say that the ability to relate with students is a teachers most important ability, because with that it stands and falls, whether or not students are active during the lessons, trying to grasp as much as they can, or not.
