The advertising industry is well known for many years now. We are all used to it and accept it while watching tv. But we all know that they can trick you have a big influence on your decisions during shopping. Is advertising directed towards young children now more dangerous? Should it even be disallowed?

For me, advertising in general is well known by all of us. It already got normal and to disallow something that is already normal for people is a very difficult move. 

On the other hand, advertising directed towards young children aged between two and five is not really fair. The products in advertisements do not look the same in reality as they do on tv. And most of the time the product is not able to do the things it does on tv. And very young children are not old enough to see that. They can be tricked very easily and that is the point wehre you have to say that it is just not correct.

Furthermore, young children watching advertisements just want the product. They don't even care about whether they are going to play with it or not. During that age, you just want anything and don't say no to nothing.

But the biggest point for me is that children between two and five are not able to buy the stuff they see on tv by themself. The product shown on tv still has to get bought by the parents. 

To summarize, i think that you can't just disallow advertisement directed towards young children. You would always have to debate about whether for example the toy is made for children aged five or aged ten. In addition to that,the toys and other stuff still need to get bought by the parents and with them agreeing that the product is good for the kid, there's nothing wrong with it.
