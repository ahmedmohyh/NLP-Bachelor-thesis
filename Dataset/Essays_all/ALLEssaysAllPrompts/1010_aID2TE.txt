What should a teacher be like? What is important? The following text discusses the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". 
 
First of all the argmuents are named which speaks for a good relation between the teachers and the students.                                                                          A good relation between teacher and students can be helpful in many ways for the quality of the lesson. If the teacher is nice and treat the students well, they like the teacher and more important, they respect him. And a respected teacher is nessesary, because otherwise the students do what they want to and probably don't follow the lesson. Another reason for the teacher to concentrate on the relation to his students would be that, if they like him, then the chance that they have fun in lesson is very high. And if they have fun, they want to learn more and that makes a good lesson.                                                         But on the other hand there are of course also negative arguments for this statement and that it's more important that the teacher just concentrate on his knowledge. The main goal of lessons is that you learn something, so in every case it's nessesary, that the teacher shows up a big knowledge so that the students are able to learn a lot. And if the teacher doesn't focus on the subject being thaught lesson is useless, because the students wouldn't be able to learn anything.  

In my opinion the teacher should treat the students well, but he should also focus on the subject, so he should try to find the wright balance. I think, that the teacher should treat the students with respect, so that they as a result also respect him and want to concentrate in lesson. But I don't think, that the teacher should be like a dude to them, because then it's difficult to focus on the subject, because you easily dirft away to private stuff. So all in all I would say that being a teacher isn't as easy as it maybe seems to be.
