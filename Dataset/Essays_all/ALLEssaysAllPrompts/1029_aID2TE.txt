School is and has always been a controversial topic. Specifically the question 'What makes a good class?' is answered very diversely nowadays. Some people think a good relationship between a teacher and his students makes his class great and is more important than him actually teaching them excellent knowledge. In the following, that statement will be evaluated.

On the one hand, students obviously need to receive enough good knowledge about that certain subject to be able to graduate well. When graduating, the questions do not variate from teacher to teacher in the important last exams. This might lead to many bad grades based on a teacher not having taught his students enough.
On the other hand, it is nearly impossible for a teacher to be that bad. They are tested strictly several times before being able to actually work as a teacher and the worst ones are automatically not accepted at schools.
Moreover, if a teacher actually is great at his subject but has no idea how to actually teach it because his students possibly do not tell him what they don't understand, bad grades are guaranteed. The reason for them not being able to talk to their teacher might be that the teacher is way too dominant to make them feel secure while asking for help. Some students even fear certain teachers. They can't concentrate at all during his class and therfore understand even less of what he is saying. 

Concludingly I would definitely say that enough specific knowledge is very important. But only if a secure environment is given in class, the student are going to be able to learn sufficiently and get good grades orally and on exams.
