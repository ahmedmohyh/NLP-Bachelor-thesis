Everywhere we go we have advertising. Everybody, no matter if young or old, is influenced by the advertising. As an adult you know whats happend and you can stay against it. But as a young girl or boy you dont even understand what these adverting is doing with you. They are so easily to influence, much easiler than adults. So should it be allowed to show advertising in television toward these kids?

On the one hand yes, because everywhere is advertising. so why shouldnt it be allowed to show some in the television? 
In my eyes the question is: why can such young children watch television? They should go out and play with there friends. And so its the mistake of the parents because its their buisness to "save" the childrens from these advertisings and so its also there problem, if the children see something to play with and they want it. The industry isnt stupid. Its there plan to direct the advertising to these kids. So they ask there parents for thousand times, if the can have this thing. And the parents want that their child is happy or they just wont hear much longer the same question everyday, so they buy this item. Thats how our system functionned.

On the other hand its not okey to espacially direct the advertising toward the childrens. They havent the chance to stay against it and say: "ohh i dont wanna have these sweets" if they saw the advertising because its so easily to influenced them by anything in this age. So its absolutly evil from these 
"advertising-chefs" to use this for there own money.

Back to the question: it should be allowed to show advertising on television. But not  to often and not to much. Its in the hands of the parents wheter they are okey with the fact that there child watch advertising or not. So the have the chance to chance it if they dont wanna this.
