Probably everyone has at least some experience with bad teachers, but how should they be measured? What makes a teacher good or bad, is it really all about the precise knowledge?
A teacher with excellent knowledge is generally better on details. This is extremely positive for good and interested students, but in most subjects that is never a majority. For slightly less bright students, everything the teacher tells may become boring and annoying because there is no point in learning many way too complicated details. As consequence, most students lose interest in the specific subject, which, honestly, never speaks for a good teacher.
A teacher with less knowledge will lose less time in details and may be more focused on general understanding and relations. And when it is easier, fewer students are left behind. Additionally, this teacher's model will surely be able to motivate students a lot more, which in turn supports the student's passion about these now interesting things. It will encourage them to persue these topics in their future.
To sum up, I mainly agree with the given statement because this is the better solutions for the majority of students. However, as soon as a teacher's knowledge drops under a certain level, lessons become boring, annoying and maybe even childish for everyone. That should never happen and ultimately makes the corresponding teacher terrible. But of course the ideal teacher is excellent at both abilities, which will enhance the student's general understanding AND detailed knowledge, and motivates them even more.
