On the one hand children could be maipulated very fast. If an advertisment is shown in the television which says that thy have to buy this toy they would buy it quickly without thinking about it. Sometimes an advertiment isn't for the age of the little children (like Eis.de). Those advertimsents should be shown in the evening when the children are sleeping and on channels for adults. The advertisments should be made for kids in the age who are whatching the channel where the advertisment is on air. If there is a movie on TV in the evening the channel should take care that there is an advertisment for kids.
On the other hand it should be allowed because the companies could make more money with their advertisment because some children see a toy and want to buy it. And the channel could make more money too if they can show more advertisment. And the children don't get what the advertiment is talking about so they don't care about it. But if the children are whatching the channels for adults the parents have to take care that their child don't whatch the channel and only the program which is made for it. 
In my opinion the advertisments should be made for the kids if they are directed toward young children and if they switch on a channel which isn't made for kids it wouldn't be the mistake of the advertisment or of the channel. But advertisments like Eis.de should be shown after 10 p.m when the children are definitly in their bed and are sleeping. If not their parents have to take care that they don't have a chance to see those advertisments.
