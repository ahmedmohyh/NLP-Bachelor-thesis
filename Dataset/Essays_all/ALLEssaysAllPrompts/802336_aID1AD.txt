Its saturday morning. The TV is turned on and Dora the explorer is playing. After ten minutes there is a pause in the show where advertisments are seen. But not advertisment for a skin care cream or a perfume. It is an advertisment for toys for young children. Should this be allowed?

Advertisments are shown to stimulate the customer to buy a product. For that the customer must own money. A child does not conciously own moneyto spend. This makes the whole point of the advertisment useless. The problem it might cause is for the parents. The child might want to own the toy and will constantly beg the parents to buy the toy. Young children might be more susceptible to advertisments than adults because they will not ask themselves the question if they need the product or not which could later on continue to make them an easy pray for as seen on tv products.
The advertisments might be directed toward children of such a young age but indirectly be for the parents. At christmas it might be a good thing because if the childless uncle doesn't know what to get his nefeu he can simplly watch TV and be inspired.

 In my opinion it is useless to show advertisments for young children because they cannot buy the product which makes the advertisment a waste of time and money. If the advertisment were to encourage children to go outside and play it might change my opinion.
