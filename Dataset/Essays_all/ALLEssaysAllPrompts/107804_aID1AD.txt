In my opinion the television advertising shouldn't be directed toward young children.
The thirst reason is that the children in this age are very influencable, so the advertisments just have to put a few good looking pictures in the television and all the children want these things. This is very bad for there parents because they can say that the thing isn't as good as it shows but the child won't believe it.
So the parents can buy the thing to the child and loose money so that the child is happy for about one or two hours, or they can say no and the child will feel bad as long as it won't get it. But the advantage in the second one is that the parents don't have to loose lot of money and also that the child learns that he won't get everything he wants. The child in the thirst example will after two hours be as happy as before and the next time he sees an advertisment he will again want the thing in it , because he know that he will probably get it.
This problem is very big for many problems: If i give the thing to the child it will be quiet and content but it costs money and the child learns out of that, so it think that it just have to cry to get what it want. But at the other hand if I won't give it to the child, I'm maybe a bad mom/dad and the child doesn't like me.
One point for the opposite is that it would be unfair if all labels or shops could make television advertisment but not the one for children.
I think it's a difficult question but I have the meaning that it isn't correct to sell his product just because the parents wanted to be good to there children, although the children didn't really want the product for real.
