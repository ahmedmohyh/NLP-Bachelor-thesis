I would beginn my essay by cutting the statement in two different parts. The first one would be:"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important..." and the other part would be:"than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught." We have two completely different point of view in this sentence. 
Let's take in the first place the first part of the statement. The ability of relating well with students is really important, if the teacher wants to transmitt something. If he or she doesn't have a certain connection with the students, they won't have pleasure listening to the teacher. This side of the job is more than important. But of course, and now I come to the second part, if the teacher doesn't have any idea of what he or she is talking about, this could be problematic. The teacher has to have a certain knowledge in the subjects he or she is teaching. The school were actually invented to learn and to make the general culture of students grow. It is also more interesting for the students to have a teacher who is really good in the subject and who is able to answer to a lot of different questions.
I think both sides should be executed together. A good teacher who knows a lot of things about a subject and who is able to transmitt it with passion and patience to the students while having a good connection with them is the right solution. I don't think one has to be more important than the other. They should be equally considered.
