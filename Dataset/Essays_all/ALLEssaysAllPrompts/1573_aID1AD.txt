I agree with the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe.", because in my opinion young children shall go outside and shouldn't be attracted by television. 
Many people would say that young children could learn from different television shows, but I think that the children aren't old enough to understand everything. For example the TV show "Dory". This show should help young children to learn English in a very young ages but most of the children won't understand this and just watch little graphic humans doing crazy things. 
I also think that it is not good for the eyes when young children watch too much television, because they look at an very big screen the whole time and the animation istn't good for their eyes.
Also young children don't understand that their is a difference between them and the animated humans. Children think that they are like them. 
An example is the show " Die Teletubbies". The Teletubbies had TV's in their belly and young children watching this show thought that they also have TV's in their belly and cut into their belly looking for a TV and died.

I think television advertising toward young children isn't a good thing, because the children aren't old enough to understand the things in the TV, they just watch it. And instead of this they should go outside and play with other children, that is much better for them and for their health.
