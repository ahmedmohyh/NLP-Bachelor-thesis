The theme of this exam is, if a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught. I think that every student knows these teachers. In the following essay I want to find pros and cons.

First of all I think that the atmosphere in a classroom is very important to learn well. That means, if the teacher has a perfect kowledge, but can´t teach, it is really hard for the students to listen to the teacher and to learn things like vocabulary. So it is often loud and noone can concentrate very well.

On the other side there is a teacher, who has a great relationship with his students, but who has´nt a very excellent knowledge. The atmosphere in the classroom is great, but the teacher is probabay not able to teach more difficult knowlegde. So the students can´t reach easy  better marks.

In conclusion I think that both types of teachers aren´t very useful for the school system, because both have difficulties to teach that everyone can understand it. So I have the opinion that a good teacher needs both, a good relation with the students and an appropiate knowlegde, so that the lessons are useful for the students. If you haven´t one of these two abilities, you should´t become a teacher.
