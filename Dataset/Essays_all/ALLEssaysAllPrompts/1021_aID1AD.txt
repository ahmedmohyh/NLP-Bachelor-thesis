In the following text I will write a text about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." 

First we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy. Young children get up with new smartphones or other things. The children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy. 

Second I think young children haven't a own opinion and look at the persons at the television. The persons give us a wrong point of view. 
On the on hand parents have more time for oneself or other things. And the young children watching Tv and have fun. On the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching Tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity.

The televison has positiv points, because young children learn at the television colours or other things. But a negativ point is that she learn things that she don't need for example bad words. 

I think that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long, because they need conversation with other persons and activitys.
