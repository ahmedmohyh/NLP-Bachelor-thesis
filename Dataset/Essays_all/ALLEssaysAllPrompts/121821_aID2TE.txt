In todays world you only get a good job if you have a good education. So good schools are a very important  and thinking about that we come to the results that teachers are very important too. In every school there are the loved teachers and the hated teachers. But by whom we really learn more?

Many students do not like to go to school. But there are this reasons why it is not that bad. One of this reasons are the friends another one is the favorite subject or in some cases it is the teacher. Everyone likes this teacher who relate with the stundents because then it is not the same boring schoolsituation like the rest of the time. For exemple the lesson biginns with a little joke and everyone smiles. To such a teacher is very cool but it also can be to much if the whole lesson contains jokes and you do not learn anything.

The opposite are the teachers who are just professors. Most of the time the lessons with this teachers are boring and everyone would rather go home and take a nap. Sure sometimes it is very interessting how big their knowledge is and that they can answer almost every question. But if they are speaking without a single break it is to much and to strong for most of the students. 

It is very important to find a middium thing between the both kinds of teachers. I agree that it is important to learn something so the teachers should have a good knowledge of the subject that they taught. But it is also true that they should relate with the students so the lessons are not that boring. In the and I can say that I personally it dependes on the subject but I learn most if the teacher makes some jokes because then I really listen. If a teacher just speaks for the whole lesson I do not get anything. Every student has his own things how he likes to be taught.
