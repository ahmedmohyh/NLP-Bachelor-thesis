It give arguments how agree  withe the statement.
Thies are maybe that the students have more fun in the school or sand maybe the could laern better.
But the arguments how disagree this are when the knowledge is not so coud about the theme the can not  know every thing  what they need. One argument for disagree is that too  when outher students have the knowledge they can worke better as the stundents how have not knowledge.Anotherone is that they could understand the hole subject when they have the knowledge  .
So I thing that the knowledge is so importent for school because evryone have too know the knowledge of the supfject and you don't understand the  theme because you don't have the knowledge. When you don't haye the excellent knowledge you don't speak whit outher stundent hou haxe the knowledge because you do not know what they spaek about.

So you can say that the exelent knowledge  is so importen for the stundent but maybe in one time it could be better  when you relate well.
