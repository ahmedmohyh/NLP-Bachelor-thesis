In the following essay I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". 
For that I will give advantages and disadvantages of television advertising directed toward children. 
One Advantage of television advertising directed toward children is this: If the children watch something especially prepared for them, they naturally want to have that. So it leaves to the consequence that the children convince their parents to buy them what they have watched, which is good for the creators. Another advantage is that the children are getting inspired because of many different television advertising. 
Therefore there are also disadvantages of television advertising directed toward children. They are being manipulated by the ones who prepare that especially for them because of the ilusion they create. The television advertising let the children think that the things that are shown are great and real because they are so young the cannot seperate that from reality. So they want to have them and convince their parents, which is good for the ones making the television advertising but not for the children because of the manipulation.

So in conclusion, I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. They are two young to see the difference between television and reality and its easy to manipulate them to get money. Apart from the point that too much television is not good for children, in my opinion the advertising only includes advantages for the ones making it.
