nowadays television is a common thing, everybody has one at home and you can literaly watch everything on it from disney movies to documentations. But is television a good thing especially for young children?

In one hand television can be very helpful when it comes to knowledge, there are many programs whitch offer you a bucket full of new thing like documentatons about certain animals or just videos about climat change. Children at this young age learn very fast so its kinda a good thing to let them watch these things. At the other hand its good for them to see how the world looks and acts outside his country, like what are the other personalies out there what diffrent kind of culture do we have. So if you dont have the money or time to travel and to get to know other cultures than is television a good thing for young children, its also way easier to understand throught television.
Furthermore, there are also bilingual and learning programs would could help the children to make progress in learning and communication.

At the other side, televesion can increase your outgoing and social life because you'd rather sit infront of the TV then going out with friends and get to know knew people.You loose many friends it seems like your television is your friend. Furthermore is the communication between the children in bad situation because children dont need to talk to others face to face anymore they can do it throught television what leads to lonelyness and can also lead  to depressions in bad cases.In fact that watching television for a too long time a day can also lead to bad manners,behaviours and agression towards the people around him.

All in all, there are some good sides but also some bad sides about television for young childre.In my opinion there should be an age limit for children and also a time limit for how long they are allowed to watch because television has influence to your behaviours.
