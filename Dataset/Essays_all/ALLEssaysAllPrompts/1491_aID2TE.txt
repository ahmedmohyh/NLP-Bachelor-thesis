In the following text I am going to discuss whether I agree with the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." or not.
The first reason why a good relation with the students might be more important than excellent knowledge is that most of the students feel better when they have a good relation with the teacher. Then learning might be easier because concetrating on the topic might be better. The next point supporting the statement is that students who feel good in the lesson and have a really good relation with their teacher might listen better so they would have more fun in school (which is especially important for the ones who hate school and are totally uninterested in learning something new).
But an important argument against the statement is that the relation between students and teachers has nothing to do with really wanting to learn something. Stundets who really want to learn something do not need a good relation with the theacher - they need somebody who tells them everything they have to know. So my last point is that even if the teacher was the nicest peron in the world he would not be able to teach the students how they deserve it: If he does not know enough the students does not learn enough. But that is what they deserve!
To summarize everything I can just say that I disagree with the quote. A teacher's exercise is to teach the students correctly and if he does not have enough knowledge to do this and rather makes jokes or something like this he does not do his job. Of course it is important that the students and the teachers have a good a relation because learning is more comfortable then but if I had to decide I would definitely say that the knowledge of the teacher is more important than the relation between the teacher and the students.
