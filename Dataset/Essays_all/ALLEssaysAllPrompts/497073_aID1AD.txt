Young children don't really know what it means to buy something, they don't even know what money is.
When they see something in the televison, they want to have it, becaus the people who are using it are very happy. Children can't think of the future as we can (e.g. when the toy is broken or when they are too old for it). Money isn't important to them and they can't imagine what a specific price conectet with a product means, wether it's a fair price or not. They aren't able to connect all those things togheter.
Young children aren't allowed to buy things by themselves, so advertising directed towards them shouldn't be allowed. The parents have to buy all the things for them and they have to decide what they want to buy, not their children. Parents have to do a lot for their children. The last thing they want is an annoying son or daughter who wants someting unnecessary and expensive.
A reason against this statement would be that the people who make those television advertising have to pay a lot of money for that and that they somehow have to earn money with their business. It's a good strategy to advertise directly toward young children, because they are easy to convince and nobody can say "no" to such a cute little person.

As we can see are there more reasons to agree with this statement. It's unfair to advertise towards somebody who can't buy it by themself and who doesn't know the consequences of the purchase. I totally agree with this statement. Advertising directed towards young children is like an unequal contract and should be forbidden.
