I agree with the statement that ads shouldn't be directed to little childern. There are a few reasons, the first and for me to most important is that the childern don't really understand what they are seeing. They can be manipulated easy, even easier than adults. If they see an ad on televison they probably will go and stress their parents, and thats sure not what those ads are for. But the conflict isn't only moral conflict, it's also a simple financial conflict, because most companys won't make ads directed to young ones because they simply don't sell off. There is a too small target group and the ad will probably cost more than it earns. But there are also arguments against my point, as an example, when a child series comes on television, what kind of ads are they supposed to broadcoast? I don't know if it comes out good if they will broadcast ads from parfumes or stuff like that because the small childern won't need it and the contents of some ads isn't supposed to be watched by 3-year-olds. But then there comes the point with the manipulation again. I don't like it when small childern are raised that early as a "perfect consumer". They should learn to have their own opinion and not to listen just what the television tells them, like sadly a lot of young people do. Actually, I'm completely against the idea of young people watching tv, I think it isn't good for their later life. Of course when they start to understand what they are watching, then it's completely fine, but I don't support the idea of sitting young people and babys in front of a TVor a smartphone just to keep them quiet. There needs to be another solution, and then we wouldn't have to question us if we should direct ads to babys and childern.
