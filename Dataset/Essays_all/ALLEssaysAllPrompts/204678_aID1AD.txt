Advertisement is a very large segment of our industry. It shows the big aim of all trade; making money. But within which borders is this still ethically acceptable? How far are is one allowed to go to sell our products? Can one target children?

I say no. Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. It should not be allowed, because it means attaking the weakest part of our society for selfish means. It is a missuse of our psychological understanding of children's minds. Of course, one could say that seen this way the advertisement targetting adults is nothing else but a missuse of psycological human understanding. But adults generally are rational, responsibly living and have had some life experience while the consciousnes of small children is only developed to a small size yet. They don't have any life experience, they are not able to be responsible for themselves, to understand what it actually means to 'buy' something, they are not yet critical thinkers.

Therefor the parents should be in charge of what a child needs and what should be bought. And directing all this advertising towards the children only makes it more difficult for the parents to raise the rational, critical thinkers we all want to be with in our society.
