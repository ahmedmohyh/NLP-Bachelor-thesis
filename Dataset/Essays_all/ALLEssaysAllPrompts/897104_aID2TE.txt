A good teacher is more than just necessary. If there weren't good teachers it wouldn't make any sense to go to school or learn. There are also different ways to define what a good teacher is. Is the good knowledge about teaching or the ability to relate well with students the most important thing?

For students it's very important that the teacher understands their wishes and problems. If a teacher can't imagine what the students need there wouldn't be any trust. And a relationship builds on this. So it's really necessary for a teacher to relate well with students to make clear that he's here to help. When students like their teacher they are more motivated to learn something. Moreover the students would accept more of the decisions the teacher makes. If a teacher doesn't relate well with students there would never be a good atmosphere in the classroom and this atmosphere is important for the learning process. Furthermore the students wouldn't like to work with the teacher.

But there's also the other side. A teacher should know how he has to teach someone. That's the reason why he has to learn teaching. A concept how to activate a class and getting them to participate at the lesson is very important. Furthermore you need for every situation a solution and there it's not enough to relate well with students but really to know what is to do. You can relate well with students but have no control over them and this is what should be avoided.

In conclusion I think both points are important and essential to be a good teacher because a knowledge of teaching students wouldn't learn anything but if students hate the teacher or don't get well with him it would be very hard to work as a unity with the class what is very important.
