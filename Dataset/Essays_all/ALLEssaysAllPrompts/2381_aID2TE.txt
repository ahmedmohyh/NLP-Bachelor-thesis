Beeing a teacher is one of the most difficult but also one of the mostly needed jobs in the world. They have to be good at there subject and get a good enough relationship with there students to be able to display there feelings to make the lessons as efficient as possible.

Obviously knowing your subject is an essential part of beeing a good teacher. If you know spanish fluently but teach math without knowing the simplest techniques of problemsolving, you can hold your class in spanish for sure, but it wont help your students understanding math.
The same counts for relating with your students. You can be the best on your subject but not having a way of explaining it to your students because they dont like you and won't listen, you will do no good either.
In my opinion it is more important to have a teacher beeing nice and likeable instead of him heaving a perfect knowledge of his subject, as long as he knows at least the most important things he has to teach me.
Beeing in class can be boring sometimes, especialy talking about a topic you dont like. If you have a teacher knowing how you behave, in fact knowing how you are, it is way easier to find a way of telling you about this topic. You'll more likely listen because you like the teacher.
But as allready said, if he is totally incompetent about what he is talking it wont help you in your final exam if he was allways a nice person.

The best way is a the middle of both. Having a teacher knowing what he is doing and beeing nice would be perfect. Unlikely this is very rarely and that is incredibly sad.
