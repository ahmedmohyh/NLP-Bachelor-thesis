Television-advertisments are more and more directed to children that are younger and younger. But sholud advertisments for young childs really be aloud, I will explain you my point of view in the following paragraphs. 

Young children watch a lot of cartoons and other series targeted at them, so by putting advertismentss befor and after this kind of series could help promote toys and other thing. Also the ads would not come up after some ation movies and would not annoy older people. Whre else then on television the kids see the advertisments, nowhere so this is perfect. Plus the simplistic language could also help the kids so they might hear other words they are not used to hear in normal circumstances.

Advertisments for smaller children should be prohibited because it is unessecary and they do not understand the most of it any way. If small children see to many advertisments the could be tricked into thinking the world is full of toys and other good stuff but really it is not. They might harass their parents because the want all the things they saw on televission but the parents probaly are already at the limit of their strenth and in most case the probably do not have all the money to buy everything. The avertisments for young children should go over the parents because they know best any way what is good for their kids and what not.

I think if you do not abuse your position as an older and broadcast advertisment that are reasonable and in reasonable amount it is totally correct to make avertisments for young children aged two to five. But in the end you have to thinks about them and their parents to not overflow them with false impressions.
