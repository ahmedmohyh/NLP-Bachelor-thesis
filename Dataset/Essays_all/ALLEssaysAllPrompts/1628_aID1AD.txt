On the one hand I would say its not so good that parrents allow their children to look tv in this age. The reason for that is that its very easy for children to switch between the programs and so they are able to look films like James Bond or something like that. So the children are able to see maybe death people or people which kill other people. This is very fatal and very easy for the children.

On the other hand I would say its a good thing to allow children in an age between two to five because today you can see many programs which are only inventioned for little children. This programs can help your children to learn math, english or german. But this effects are combined with fun, so your children want to look tv and have fun and the parrents are also happy because they know that their children learn something. Another point is that there are many systems for the parents to safe their children. One example is a system that block all oher tv programs, so the children are unable to look films like James Bond, or a system that conrol how much time the children spend looking tv and if they look to many tv the system turn off the tv.

Honestly i would say parrents can allow their children to look tv because their so many systems to safe the children and the effect that the children can learn something by watching tv is also good. Due to this the children have much fun and this is  very important.
