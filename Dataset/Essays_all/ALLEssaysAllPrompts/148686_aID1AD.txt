Television advertising has become very popular in our community. Old peolple watch their news on the television, the middle-aged enjoy watching movies while young people are wathing their favorite series day by day. Children got entertained by the children programme on the Disney channels. But there is also a younger group who enjoys watching television: the babies, the young children between two and five. Should the television advertising be allowed toward this young group? Is this group too young for watching televison?

The television advertising can be a good entertainment for the little. If  the parents are occupied with their house work,the television can be an easy solution to make the children sitting calmly in their chair and not distracting the work of the parents
The little children have also a possibility to learn something from the television. There are a lot of children programmes which have the aim to teach the children. 
But there are also risks which one should not exclude. The programmes on the children channels are not always that informative and helpful. There are a lot of entertainment which does not make any sense. $
The television can have a bad impact on the health of the children, their eye-sight can get worse by watching a lot of television. 
In my opinion the children group aged two to five should not be allowed to watch television daily. The television advertising is not necessairy for such a young group. The children should rather be playing with their cars or barbies than watching television programmes. There are better solutions to entertain the young children.
