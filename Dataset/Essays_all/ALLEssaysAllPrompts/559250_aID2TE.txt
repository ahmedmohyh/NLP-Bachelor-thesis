There are two kinds of teachers: the ones who  have a good relationship between the students and the teacher himself and the ones who an teach very well. In this essay I try to explain which ability is more important for a teacher
When the teacher manages to relate well with his students, he can create a good (Lernumgebung). Like that the students are more efficient, because an annoying subject won't stop them from learning it, when the teachers make some jokes, for example.
But making a lesson funny doesn't mean that it is easier to learn. Let me give you an example: Your funny math teacher tries to explane you a really hard excercise, but even if you would like to understand it, you and the jokes can't help. So in this situation you would need a understandable teacher, although it might get annoing.
I think that both abilities are really important, but in my opinion the ability to teach well includes, that the teacher is able to relate well with his students. Otherwise the teacher chosed the wrong job, because he has to work with young people all the time. But I believe, that the level of the school makes a difference. I think, that in primary or secondary school the relationship between the students and the teachers are really important, so the ability to relate well is mor important. But in higher schools, for example at highschool or university, students go there to study. I'm now at high school and because of that I prefer a teacher who can teach his subject well.
