A good teacher is often described as being very social but also knowing very much about their subject. But what is more important- a teacher who can relate well with students or rather a teacher who has an exellent knowledge of the subject being taugth?

A teacher's job is to bring knowledge to the students. That is why it is very important that teachers have a great and wide knowledge. How could a teacher be of use, if he or she did not know the subject him- or herself? If the teacher needed to look everything up in Wikipedia, the teacher would not be needed. But we also have to look at it from a students perspective. It is way more motivating to go to school and participate in the lessons, if the teacher relates well with the students. The lessons need to be funny and witty, but also have lots of diversion. Otherwise school is getting boring and students start to slack off or stay at home. Furthermore is it very important that a teacher is understanding, if students come up to him and ask him to explain something again or to change the date of the exam. It will always be easier for both parties, if they have a great relationship. 

In the end it is hard to comt to a final conclusion, which is more important, because as mentioned before a good teacher would have both abilities. While a cool and nice teacher may make a more entertaining lesson, a teacher whith great knowledge may be able to teach more interessting things. And in the end students go to school to learn new things and get a wide knowledge. That taken into account I will say that it is more important to have a boring teacher knowing many facts than a cool teacher. School is where students learn new things they can enertain themselfs at home or in the freetime.
