A lot students didn't have such a good relation to their teachers because of several reasons. But is it a good relation to teachers a "must have" or do you also can learn much without a good relation to the teachers? Nowadays we have a lot of teachers who have much knowledge but is this all they need to teach student?

When all the teachers have the knowlege but didn't relate with the students the cannot teach them because when student and teachers didn't relate the teacher cannot teach them as good as if the are good related. So the students can learn thing but with a better relation he could learn more.

Nevertheless all the teachers who teach on a important school must have all the important knowledge because when the teacher didn't know anything and want to teach the student it doesn't helps him when he is good related with the studnets. and also without a good relation the teacher can teach maybe not as good as with a good relation but it works.

In conclusion i can say the most important point is the knowledge but it's good when the teacher also have a good relation to their students. 
so its is better with a good relation maybe it helps you also a lot but you can also learn without a good relation.
