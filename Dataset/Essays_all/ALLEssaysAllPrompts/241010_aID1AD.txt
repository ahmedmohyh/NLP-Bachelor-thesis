We live in a world full of electronic devices and one of them happened to be the television. Nowadays children start watching TV at a really young age and are also influenced by it. Because with their favourite kids series they also watch advertisements. So if advertisements really do influence children at a young age, should it be forbidden for companies to direct their advertisements towards these children?

One one hand it could be that kids aged two to five don't even comprehend what they are seeing on television and do not react to it. So there would be no reason to forbid advertising towards young children. You could also say that it is the job of the parents to keep their children away from danger such as these advertisements.

On the other hand you could say that it is morally not correct to try to influence audience at such a young age. Consequently the government should lawfully forbid it because it should not be allowed to act legally in an unmoral way and especially if it concernces helpless kids.

In my opinion there should exist some sort of law that does not allow advertising directed towards young children but to me it seems really hard to draw the line between what is directed towards kids and what is wanted to influence an older audience. For example if you have a look at the Evian advertisement with babies dancing and driving rollerblades in it you could assume that the advertisement is directed towards babies or children too. But when you think about it, an advertisement about water would originally not be directed towards them.
