When students know that the teacher cares about them and wants to have a good relationship with them, it would be possible. It will make it easier to work with the students. They are more intrested in the subjects of the lessons and will learn more, because there is a person in front of them, who is intrested in them too. 

But, is it really useful to have a teacher, who relates better with his students than to have the knowledge about his subject he must have to teach his class well? It is important that the teacher is well educated and can teach his students with a large knowledge. He must be able to answer the students when they have querstions in each situation. 

Students would be more interested in school and would be better prepared for the lessons, when they have a teacher who relates better with them as other teachers. He is like the 'cool' one, who understands his students and is more prefered as other teachers. 

In the opposite, school is here to learn subjects like math, english, geography etc. It is not nessecery to have a friend as teacher. The teacher has to be an autority person who stands in front of a class and can teach them well. 

In my opinion, there have to be both of these two parts. A teacher has to be an autority person who is able to answer all the questions and has to have the largest knowledge in front of his class. But on the other hand, a teacher also has to relate well with the class to have a good relationship with them. This is useful and important for the work with his students which will be much more better, when he is accepted by them.
