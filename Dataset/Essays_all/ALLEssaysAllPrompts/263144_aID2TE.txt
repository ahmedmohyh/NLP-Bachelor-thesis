I partly agree with this statement, as there shouldn't be the necessity to choose between the two options but a combination of both. A teacher with empathic capacities surely is a great help to the students, but only in combination with knowledge. There is nothing worse than a teacher not exactly knowing what he's doing infront of the class.

For exemple there's on the one hand a mathematics teacher incapable of relating to the students. She is a real genious and brilliant when it comes to any mathematical problem. But her explanations were meant for an audience with a high standard knowledge and we couldn't understand her way of thinking. 
On the other hand an art teacher who always tried to build up a good relationship with her students, even though it didn't work that well. She always gave in, no matter what we requested and was a complete disaster regarding any form of teaching. Furthermore, her artistic abilities were inexistent and her advices inpracticable. With the time she lost more and more credibility, what lead the students not to listen to her anymore. Also the fact that an art teacher did not know that Picasso invented the cubism and had to be reminded from his student was an additional reason not to take her in consideration.

So yes, the ability to relate with students is extremely useful, but in my opinion, the knowledge of their subject is far more important.
