When you aren`t in the class befor your A-Level, I thinks it is very important, that the teacher relate well with the students. The students are joung and school isn´t a thing for them they doing with fun. Some students maybe don´t feeling well in school. In this point it´s very important that the students have fun when they´re going to school and that they want going to school. 
But on the other hand when you´re in a class next to your A-Level, its very important that you have a teather, who have excellent knowledge of his subject. it´s important that you learn very much and the right facts. When the teacher isn´t well with his subjekt, it´s not easy to follow him in ist lessons.
And the end it´s you need a good mix. In the first classes you need a teacher who teach you the learning, that you know how you can learn well an with fun. The besics are important. In the classes befor your A-Level you need this basics. You have more lessons at a day and more informations. All this Informations you must know for the A-Level. In this classes your are older and your personality grew to. So it´s for you not so bad, when you have a teacher, who don´t relate so well with you, like the teachers befor. You have to know the informations of your A-Level, and this is the only way. When don´t ge your A-Level but your teacher relate very well woth you, it don´t help you.
