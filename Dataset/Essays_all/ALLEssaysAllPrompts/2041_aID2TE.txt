In every school there are some teachers not having the exact knowledge of the subject they teach but maybe have a good connection to the students. 
On the one hand, the teachers with better knowledge can teach the students more detailed and the students will have it easier at the university. If a teacher hasn't got an excellent knowledge of what he teaches maybe he tells the students wrong things. So if the students write an exam in university or in school they will wrtie wrong answers because they have been taught wrong. 
On the other hand, to the teachers who have a better connection to the students will be listend to better. For example if  you have a teacher you like and sit in the lesson you wont talk very much with your neighbour. You have more respect and sincerity to the teacher. Maybe the students would have more fun with learning the things than with a teacher they don't like. If a teacher makes jokes and laughs about silly things you say in the lesson or to your neighbour there will be an easier situation. Then it would not be like school where you have to be but it's like being with a friend.
Another aspect is that every teacher knows different things. The teachers come from diefferent universities so they got taught differently. So what is the excellent knowledge? Nobody is perfect and has an excellent knowledge. 
In my opinion, a teacher which has  a better ability to relate well with students is more important than a teacher with excellent knowledge. A teacher has to be friendly and nice to the students to get the respect. If a teacher isn't nice to you, you wont be nice to him and wont have fun listening to him.
