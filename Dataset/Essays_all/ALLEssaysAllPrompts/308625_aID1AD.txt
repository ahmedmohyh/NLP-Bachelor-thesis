Television advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed. Children under five years don`t have an idea if a product is good or not for them. They aren`t able to think critically about something and so they think everything they like is good. 
The general problem is that television advertising can have an influence on a childs way of thinking. For example if there is a young boy with play-gun in an advertisement, another young boy would also like to have such a gun. But often these guns look very simmilar to real guns. So the young boy wants to have a gun. With this gun he points at human beeings while playing with it. In the end it`s possible that he doesn`t see a difference between real life and his game.
Another example is young girls playing with barbies. They think the barbie is very beautiful and they want to be like her. Later in their life they won`t look like a barbie and they fall into a depression. And if they hadn`t seen the television advertising, they wouldn`t have had a barbie and now a depression. 

I think the real problem is that television advertising directed toward young children is seen. Children shouln`t watch TV all the time, they should go out and play with their friends. If they don`t watch TV a lot, they don`t see a lot of advertisement and the problem wouldn`t even exist. If they see the advertisement only a few times I don`t think that this has a bad influence on them because they will not remember the product. So a few advertisings for good stuff are totally OK but it shouldn`t be too much.
