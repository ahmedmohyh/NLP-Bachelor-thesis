Advertising is very important for selling products. Cars, hair shampoo, food und drink, shoes or holiday flights - all can be advertised. A good marketing is the A and O. But some television channels show advertises for very young people. Is that correct?
Sometimes people think, there's too much advertising on TV. Childs can see so much things they want to have. But look at the age of them. A three years-old child can't understand the world. Sure, it's possible that a young girl sees - for example - advertising for a new Barbie product and want to have it. But so young childs wouldn't go alone without the mother (or father) in a toy shop and they need money to buy it too. So the parents decide what they buy their child and what not. 
And advertising for such products is in special magazines or on the street too. When the child isn't watching television, she looks over the shoulder of her father in a magazine. You can't save your children from all types of advertising, that is impossible. 
An another point is, that it's difficult to forbid such advertising. It can be, that a ten years-old girl likes the same things that a five years-old likes. So it isn't realistic, that television advertising for young children will be forbidden in the future. There are tv channels like "KI.KA" who don't send advertising and this channel is for young children. 
So I think that television advertising for young children should be allowed and I don't see a chance for people who think, it shouldn't be allowed, that they will have success one time.
