If a teacher has the ability to relate to students but does not fully grasp the subject he is supposed to be teaching, I believe that he is not qualified to teach that specific subject in school.
Teachers are only human themselves so it is understandable if he or she is not fully motivated to teach on a bad day or may forget the correct answer to a question and has to thing about the task he has given to the students for himself.However I think a teacher who has spend many years studying an aspect that is meant to be taught to children in school should always prioritize knowing how to convey a message or information onto his students rather than trying to find new friends.
On the other hand a teacher that is skilled at addressing students the right way can also be very useful.For example if a techer is in always in a good mood and communicates with his students in a way that gets them invested into the lesson or might even spark more interest for the subject that they are being taught it clearly leaves a positive influence behind.
If however a teacher lacks the ability to use critical thinking and combine certain topics with each other in order to give the students an easier time at understanding the topic in question, then thereby the teacher may confuse his students,leave them clueless;Or maybe the student has misinterpreted the answer to the matter.
So argueably there is a sweet spot which is not easy too reach between knowledge and the way/circumstances that the information is being taught to a student.In other words a teacher that has perfect knowledge about the topic in question but actually does not know to explain and teach others the what,how and why something works in the way that it does,will result in the students not being able to follow or use the information which was given to them.Not to mention how unmotivated students become if a teacher shows no sympathy or fun to the students aswell as the process of teaching their subject.
In conclusion I believe that the sweet spot for the art of teaching can be found however it is really difficult for a person to reach such a thing everyday.
