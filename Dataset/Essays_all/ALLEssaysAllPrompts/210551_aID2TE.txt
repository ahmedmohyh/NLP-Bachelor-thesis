"Knowledge is power," said the famous English philosopher Francis Bacon and according to this statement it is important that everyone can go to school and learn as much as possible. Nowadays it is the duty of every child in Switzerland to go to school. But how much do we actually learn? Teachers are an important part of our school system. They have to explain many different subjects to their students and they try to expand the children's knowledge. Thus, a kid's success in school depends partly on his or her teacher's ability to teach. But what quality of a teacher helps the most to improve a kid's result?

Personally, I believe it makes everything a lot easier if a teacher is able to relate to his students and does therefore know how to explain a subject in a way the kids understand. Of course it is also important that the teachers have a certain knowledge of the subject. However, in these days it is possible to look almost everything up, either in books or in the internet. It doesn't have to be a bad sign, if a teacher isn't an expert on a certain subject, because he can prepare him- or herself well for the lessons and he may even be able to explain the topic better, since the memory of researching and trying to understand some facts related to the subject, are still fresh.

In conclusion, I have to say, that I fully agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I believe, that everyone is able to be a great teacher, as long as he or she likes her students and is motivated to explain them everything as best as he or she is able to.
