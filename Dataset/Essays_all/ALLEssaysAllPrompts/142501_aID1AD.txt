Watching television nowadays has become a common pleasure in the daily life of people at any age. Lately, watching television got some harsh critics because of some shows, that do not have a good reputation. But not only shows got harsh critics even advertising did. So I will abord the statement if television advertising should be allwoed towards young children? 

First of all, there is no harm if children at a young age are confronted with television advertising. Children have friends and they get to know such things really fast. Secondly, even without television advertising there is no prevention, that could abandon the knowledge of a child. The child will get to know the TV sooner or later and even if it is later than sooner they need to learn to cope with it. If the parents want to protect their child, the power is in their hands and they can not forbid companies for trying to make profit.

However, a child should play outside in its youth and not be stuck inside in front of a television. Television advertising directed towards children is cruel and reckless. The companies use the mind of a child because this mind has not a personal opinion and can be formed easily. Children at a young age like whatever looks fancy, even though it may harm them. Second point, a child can develop itself better without television advertising. It is not influenced and can truely become the best version of themselves.

To conclude I want to point out, that it is the parents will what to do with their child and they should not try and  screw a profit for companies. Because the parents are mainly important for the developpment of a child and not television advertising. I would consider, that television advertising should be allowed towards young children, because I can not see any harm.
