A teacher has to relate well with students, cause if he dosn't know how the students think, it's impossible to teach them something. If you say important things only once and don't use diffrent medium like sheats, blackboard or beamer, the students wouldn't learn anything. Of course the teacher should also have a bit of knowledge at the subject. If not, he wouldn't be able to teach the students something.

The knowledge of the subject is more important, cause the Teacher needs stuff to teach the students. If he has nothing to tell, the students wouldn't be able to learn something. It wouldn't be a big problem if the teacher relates not that well with the students. Every one who wants to learn, does this also if the connection to the teacher is not perfect.

In the other Hand the teacher could show the students how to learn their stuff from the internet, if he relates good to them. It wouldn't be that importent to have a excellent knowledge if he knows how and from where the students can get it. 

But a bride knowledge of the subject would probbably allow the teacher to give the students good informations, which they can understand even dough they don't relate well with the teacher.

In my opinion the ability to relate well with students is more importent, cause if the teacher doesn't have a bride knowledge, he is able to learn it ore to tell us how to learn. Relation is not that easy to train.
