Advertising directed towards a specific croud is probabally the most efficent way of marketing. But should it be allowed to show adds directed toward children aged tow to five on television.

Young children can very easliy be manipulated with one way beeing television advertising. If children constantly are spolied with adds of some toys for instance, they most likely want their parents to buy them that specific toy. This    then requires some reliable parenting. 

On the other hand, if television advertising directed towards children would be forbiden, there wouldn't be less advertising between the shows or children programms. What mostliklely would happen is a change of topics ot these adds. Instead of showing adds directed towards children, there could be adds containing contend whitch maybe shouln't be shown to children. Ofcorse thats the extrem version of what could happen but I think it illustrates my point very well.

And after all children probabbaly even enjoy watching these adds as they normaly are created in a funny way.

Television advertising directed towards young children should still be allowed. As they are directed towards young children, they rather watch these than others. Alltought there has to be some sort of rules attached to it. Adds containing overly agressive marketing should be forbidden.
