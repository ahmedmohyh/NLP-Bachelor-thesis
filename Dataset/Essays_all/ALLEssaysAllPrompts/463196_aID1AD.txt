Television advertisments are necessary for the television programm. Beyond the advertisments for children there are also advertisments for other ages. Not only to fill the gaps but also to pay high streaming prices, television stations are forced to show off brands in their advertisments. These short clips range from the luxury car you would like to own to some delicious chocolate. 

The advertising on television is based on the aida concept. The concept is about attention, interest, desire and action. The attention of the yound children is caught by things they like. For example after a happy film there follows a advertisment for puppets or other things to play for the children. So these children would like to action and buy those things. Mostly the parents of the children will have to buy these stuff. It should be allowed because on the one side there are the brands wich are making the advertisments and on the other side therer are the children and their parents wich are consuming. There is no reason why these advertsiments should`nt be allowed. At the end the parents are still the consumers wich buy those things for their children to make them happy. In fact to allow these advertisments the parents have to stop their children from being on the television.
