I think children aged two to five couldn´t really dicide what is good for them, so the television advertising is not very fair because the children are realy easy to make to like something. On the other side they are´t able to buy something their self, which means that they could only say their parents what they want on the other side this advertising is not fair to the parent because the children have no idea what money is and they arent able to dicide if something is cheap or expensive, they would only be a pain the until they get what they want. Another argument for the advertising is that the parents don´t have to allow their childrens in that age to watch TV, its not very good for that young childrens to watch TV. So if the parent would´t allow their children to watch TV the advertising wouldn´t be a problem. But of course that doesent mean that television advertising directed to young children needs to be allowed. I think it is absolutly not fair to send advertising directed toward to young children it should be forbidden, if the producer want to make advertising he should make soeme advertising for the parents they could dicide musch better what is good for their children then themselve.
