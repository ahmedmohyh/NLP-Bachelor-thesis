I only agree with this statement to a certain degree. Of course it is true, that being able to relate to students and having adequate social skills is important. But in my humble opinion, this doesn`t suggest that teachers should put more effort in relating to the students, than having actual knowledge of the subject. If my teacher keeps telling me that he knows how i feel, that doesn`t change anything about his own incompetence. The right thing to do, if you ask me, is to find a balance between the two. In this moment, there are exactly 18 minutes left on my clock and i feel like i have said everything about this subject. So i think i`ll just keep on rambling (if you think that the overall quality of this essay has gotten worse in the next few sentences, then now you know why). 

Of course, this also brings up the question : How do you define excellent knowledge? For example, if my teacher knows everything about a subject (and i mean EVERYTHING) and just keeps shoving it down his students throats, then he won`t succeed in having good students. The way in which he presents these facts is also important. The key is to have some variation in your way of teaching, so it doesn`t get too boring for the students. 

You have to have a bit of both. If my teacher keeps on telling cracking jokes and proceeds to keep the subject interesting, without giving me any kind of good preparation, then he obviously screwed up. He won`t be able to prepare me for my graduation and he just straight up failed. Most of the time in life, there are two sides of the coin, and if you neglect one side, you won`t succeed. You can turn it anyway you want,in the end, you need to have both as a teacher : The knowledge itself, and the ability to transfer that knowledge into the brains of your students. Because that`s exactly what you are here for.
