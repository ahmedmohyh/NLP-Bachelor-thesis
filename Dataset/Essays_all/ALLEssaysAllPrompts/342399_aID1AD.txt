There is a lot of television advertising. Every twenty minutes there is a advertising break for about 10 minutes. These breaks contain a lot of advertisement and some of them are directed towards kids. Now there are people who want to ban television advertising directed towards children.
Children are unfluenceable. Very easily. If they see something that seems cool or looks pretty they want it. You just have to make a advertisement about a toy, mske it look ultra cool and kids think you can't ive without it anymore. 
On the other hand, children have no money. At least usually. The parents are the ones who need to pay the stuff for their kids and parents are rhe ones deciding which toy they will buy their kids and which one not.
Advertisement directed toward children is something not very nice where you can make easy money but in the end it is the responsibility of the parents.
