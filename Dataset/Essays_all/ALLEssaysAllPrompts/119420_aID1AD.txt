I think it gives facts for and against this statement. Television advertising can have a big influence to people. And people from one to 90 years old watch television. Television advertising is an important fact because the technology becomes better and better. 

The reasons to agree with this statement are, that the advertising on television has a big influence to children. And when much advertising is on television the children are more happier. The thing is that the advertising for children is cool. It has cool music, many colours and happy children. The children want to watch more and more television. But the advertising isn't the reality. When the children only see television advertising they want to have the same games as it shows in the television. But for the children it is important to see the real world, to play with other children and be thankful for what they have. 

On the other side it is also good when children are in contact with the technology. They also have to learn things. So they learn what an advertising is and what influence it has on people. Maybe they also learn that not all the advertising is good and that the most things are false. And that they don't have to buy this things because not all is necessary. And they see how the world is focused on money. People want to make money with their products, but also for advertising you need money. 

I agree with this statement. For me the advertising is too much for children. The influence is too big. The children can have a good life without this. Without the advertising the children see the good things in the world and are thankful. With advertising they want more and more games or other things.
