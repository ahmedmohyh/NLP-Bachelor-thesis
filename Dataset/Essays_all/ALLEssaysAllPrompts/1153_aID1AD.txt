There are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed. I think that Children in the age of two to five are too young to understand that they are manipulated by the commercials. They will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate, so that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing. Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them. That's why televison advertisement that's directed toward young children causes trouble. On the other hand it's good for the economy if many things are sold, but I think, that children don't understand the advertisement and just want to have the newest best toy and in the advertisement every toy is shown like it's the best of them all. That's why it's unfair to show children these commercials. The advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but I think that they are just too young to judge.
