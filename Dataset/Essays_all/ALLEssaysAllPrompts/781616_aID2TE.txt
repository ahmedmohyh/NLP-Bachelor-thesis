Lately there have been discussions wether it is more important for teachers to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or the abbility to relate well with their students. In oder to increase the motivation of a student it is certainly important to get along well with the students, but is it more important than a perfect knowledge of the subject?

First of all, teachers need to have a certain level of knowledge of their subject, otherwise they would not be able to teach their students anything and would have to face a lot of difficulties. If they reach an excellent level of knowledge it does not really matter because students don't have to get this far, except at universities, which I exclude in this essay. At highschool level, teachers just need to teach their student the basics of their subject in order to prepare them for further studies or a future job. So having an excellent knowledge of their subject is certainly good for them but doesn't really help the students.

On the other hand it is important for the teachers to relate well with their students in order to increase their abbility to learn. If students are not able to relate themselves with a teacher, and as a conclusion his subject, the motivation of learning will definitely decrease. If students do not respect their teachers it can lead to bad results in exams and it will not matter if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject or not.

In my opinion this point is very important for students to realize because if they cannot get on well with a teacher they should definitely try to do so. If they do not, this will make it hard for them to study the subject even if the teacher would be capable of teaching them a lot of things that would go more into detail. As a conclusion I can truly say that for me this quote is absolutely true.
