There's absolutely no doubt that going to school is much more better if one know that the teacher is a friendly and kindly one, with whom one doesn't have any issues or personal problems. One can enjoy the lessons, which obviously can improve the learning. On the other hand it happens very likely that the students just start relaxing and leaning back during those teacher's lessons, which would be the contrary of the learning improvement. I can tell by own experience that one as a student is much more concentraded in lessons where the teacher is stricter and taffer. Furthermore a teacher is not being paid to be the students friend, but to be their teacher and to learn them things and stuff so they're prepared for their future. One could even say that teachers are even a little bit responsible for their students and obviously for their knowledge. Of course one could also say that visiting lessons of very strict teachers is anything else but enjoyable, if they like shout or if they're having bad mood,which could swap over to the students. Furthermore a teacher with a good character who understands students and like to help them is good for everyone especially for those who haven't got a good realtionship to their parents or have issues in social life, such a teacher can be very important and such teachers often are very necessarly to. To sum up I would still say that the knowledge we are being taught is the most important thing for us, for our future, but i think a teacher should always at least try to realte good t his or hers students. To find the perfect mix this is the art of being a good teacher.
