Many researches have lately shown that children, who are at a young age in contact with social media will be more intelligent and succesful in life. In the following I will discuss wethter television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
This leads me to the first point that children should get used to see all different sides of social media.Of course they shold not watch TV all day but sometimes. It could also help them improve their language and not hear the style of their parents' language. Additionally, children would be entertained the whole time because every 30 seconds or so there is something new going on.
However, it is not good for them because it could make them dumb if they only watch advertisments all day. Children should go outside, play with friends and have fun. Children cannot be raised watching TV because they are getting lazy of it, they probably do not want to do anything else anylonger. Moreover, children tend to get grumpy if they do not get what they want and after watching TV they possibly do not want to do anything than watching TV.

In my opinion, I am very happy I did not grow up with watching TV and the advertsiments but going outside and seeing the nature, in order to learn something because at that age you just kind of learn by doing and not watching. I believe it should be prohibited for children at that age and parents should not let their children watch that often TV because it is not healthy for their growing brain and decreases their intelligence.
