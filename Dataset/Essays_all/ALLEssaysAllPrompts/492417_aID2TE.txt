Having a good relationship with students is really important for teachers. If there's a teacher who always shout at their students, the students aren't motivated anymore to attend the lessons and follow the explanations of the teacher. If the teacher is just interested in making students learning, the motivation is very low. So if the teacher is planning a funny lesson students really appreciate the teacher and may will pay attention too in a course which is more boring. A good teacher has to know the individuals in the class and know what they like to do, if they are patient, if they have a lot of energy, if they won't make stupid things and how long they're able to concentrate. Based on these things, the teacher can plan the lesson that they won't be boring for the pupils but meanwhile will be interesting.
But in my opinion a teacher's ability to relate with the pupils is not the only thing that matters. Because if somebody is able to cope quite good with the class, but has no idea about the stuff he is going to teach, he or her isn't a good teacher too. So if Mr. Wollishofen likes teaching his third class math, but always when he's asked a little more complicated question he has to ask his mathteacher-collegue, this isn't very handy. In the other way, when there's a mathgenius as a teacher but he or her isn't patient in explaining things twice, it does'nt make any sence that this person is working as a teacher.
I think that the best of all is a mixture of going on well with the class and having a good knowledge of the subject itself. Because it's the way the students can profit a lot.
