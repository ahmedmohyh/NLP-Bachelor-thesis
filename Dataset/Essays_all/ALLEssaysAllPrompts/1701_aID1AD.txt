In this text im going to write about a difficult topic named "Advertising", it includes the discussion, whether direct advertising should be allowed for children (aged to to five) or not.

In my opinion it should be allowed, because the advertising wont harm the children. But in a fact the children could use that time more effectively to learn or play with other childs to make experiences.
In another point it should't be allowed, because the advertisment will make the children addicted to it. 
The time, in which they have to deal with that advertisments, is not that long, if the parents are controlling their children. In another point it is a very good method for firms to earn money, because the children will make the parents buy stuff.
In my opinion the parents have to watch at their children, to keep them safe for too much advertisments.
In a fact the places, where advertisments are going to be shown have to be seperated. It would be too much for very young children to only see advertisments all the time. There should only be places like on Tv or on screens in the city. Otherwise the children are going to be addicted to advertisments and the stuff, which is advertised in the spots. 

In my opinion advertisments at children (aged two to five) should be allowed, but it should be seperated and limited. Also the firms have to check, what they're going to advertise in their spots. And in my opinion the parents have to watch their children more carefully and protect them.
