Today nearly every child has the opportunity to watch TV. In this case there meight be the question, if television adversing directed toward young children should not be allowed. 
In the modern world we are living in, it is really important to know how to use modern medias. Thus parents agree with their children sitting in front of the TV the hole day. What they don't think about is the influence, television advertising do to their little babys. 
This probleme is not just about television advertising, the much bigger probleme are the modern medias themselves. In my opinion, young children(aged two to five) should rather spend their time in the forrest instead in front of a scream. They learn much more while spending time with their friends, than playing any stupid computer game. 
Moreover I think, everybody should have the possibility to do what he or she wants to do and a television is mostly more interesting to a child than a garden. 
My little sister is eight years old and she owns an IPad since she is six. I never saw her spending time in front of our TV, because she prefers the IPad. That's why in my opinion the question if television advising should not be allowed is today not important. The young children of today don't use a television, so what does it matter,if there is television advertising or not?
All in all, I think it is much more important to think about the education of young children and how to improve their lives instead of talking about such unneccesary things like television advertising.
