Would you want the bad influence of television advertising directed toward your child? I suppose not. And there are some good reasons why not:
They need toys at teir stage of development. Young children need to play with things they can touch, and toys which are invented for the stage they are at. Televisions are far too fast, altough there are series for children on TV, which is a benefit, they learn quick to change the channel, and the risk is too big, that the parents don`t pay enough attention, because they need time for their own and their child watches something else.
The development of young children is influenced badly. Their brains are not developed enough to be able to make a whole out of the things they hear, and the movement of the lips they see. That`s an ability they learn with time, but because the diffrent signals they receive are not received at the same time, they may develop speaching problems.
They learn at an early age, that electronic devices belong in the daily life. This increases the risk of addiction in their life when they are older, and altough it isn`t proved yet that elecronic devices have a bad influence on our health, there are incidents to this theory, and especially for  the young children we should be careful until it is proved, that the theory is wrong.
Children are the weakest part of our society while, at the same time, the most important one, because they will create the future, but at an early age, that`s why they need our protection. To provide abusing the TV as a toy, which it is not, to help them developing quikly and in a natural way, to avoid later problems like speaching faults or addiction, we should not allow television advertising directed toward young children.
