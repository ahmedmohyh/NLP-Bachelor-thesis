The advertising to young children in television

It is clear, that nowadays where more and more children are alone at home while their parents are working. They often spend this time with the television running in the background or even actively. While they are doing this, it is early evening or even afternoon. The channels realised that and send advertisments suitable for a childs eyes. They love to see the brandnew Lego or Playmobil sets and spend hours imaging how it would be to have such a set. As soon as their parents arrive at home, they try to convince them to buy such a thing for their child.
Many people claim now, that it is mean and rude from the televison channels that they bring such a problem to the homes of young families. But I have to say, that these channels make it exactly correct, what should they advertise if not playing things for children? It is the time of the day where mostly young human beings watch tv and the advertisments for typical adult things like razor blades or new films would make absolutely no sense, as young children would be scared of the trailers. The objectivity of an advertisment is, thath the product will be bought more often and this can only be generated, if the people who can and will buy the product will watch the advertisement.
To the people who say that it should not be allowed to make typical children advertisements I can only recommend to visit such a channel headquarter where they decide what, how and when they advertise their products. 
On the other hand I can understand the problem the parents face, because it is really mean for them if their children come everyday with a ney tow they want to buy. Another factor is, that these advertisements often show things like special effects which the actual product will never be able to do. So therefore the children get frustrated and angry and this is not what a parent wants.

My final conclusion is, that it should not be forbidden, because then it would even get worse.
