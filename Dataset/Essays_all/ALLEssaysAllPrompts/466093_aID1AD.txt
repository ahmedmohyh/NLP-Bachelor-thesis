Today, children are watching television several hours a day because their parents are stressed and have no time or energy for them. The simple solution is to put them in front of the TV.
What the kids see there are advertisings for toys and other stuff which children love. But should such advertisings directed toward young children be allowed?

For the industry of these toys and other playing stuff it is important to promote their things in the television to find new customers.They know exactly that the kids are watching television and also advertisings. The customers are the parents of the kids which have seen the advertising. They go and buy it because they want their kids to be happy. Maybe they do not buy everything but often they cannot refuse them and buy it- a good way to get new customers.

For the parents it is not easy because there are so many different advertisings on television which their children see and they cannot afford to buy all these things. But most of the children will not stop asking for the toys  until they get what they want. The advertising directed toward young children causes this problem. The parents have to spend the money for such things because the advertising supports the children to wish these toys.

In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because the parents have to raise their kids tough enough to say no to such things. When children always get what they want there is a problem in how the parents raise their children. Another problem is that the kids do watch too much television and this is the main problem in my oppinion. The reason why the industry has so many advertisings directed towards children is because they know that the children watch TV the most of all people.
