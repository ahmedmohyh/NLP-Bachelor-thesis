Often teachers have a big knowledge of the subject which they teach and can not understand if pupils do not get the taught elements. There are also teachers who do get the students and their problems to understand something but at the same time they do not have an excellent knowledge of their own subject. So what is more important, to have a excellent knowledge as a teacher or the ability to relate well?

Students sometimes struggle to understand something but often that is not the problem. It is often about the connection between the teacher and the pupil. The student can not explain what he does not understand and the teacher does not see what he did not explain quite well. This is often because the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject but the standards are too high for the pupils. He thinks because it makes sense to him it is just as easy for everyone else.
Another problem is that even the teacher does not know everythig about the subject he teaches. For example in primary school I used to have a French teacher who did not know every second word we asked him and he had to look it up in the dictionary. 

In my opinion it is very important for students to have a teacher who understand why they struggle so they can help. But as I see it a teacher should also have a big knowledge for his subject or at least show the pupils that he is interested. In the end I thinks itis about the ballance of understanding the students and the knowledge of the teacher or rather the passion of teaching it.
