A teacher has to built up trust between his students and himself because a student can't learn as good when he doesn't feel respected or supported by the teacher. Every person needs a good enviroment to learn properly. For example, in a third world country the school education isn't that good, because the students have problems at home with poverty and the teachers don't think it's important to support them. When the teacher cares about the students, but can't teach the subject well because he doesn't have the knowledge to do so, the children will be in danger to learn less than other students in the same country. This leads to undereducation and they won't have the same chance in the workworld as the better educated students. On the other hand when the teacher doesn't relate well with his students, they won't even try to give attention to the subject he tries to teach. Especially in the teenager-phase the young students will act rebellious, as they don't feel respected in the important phase of growing up. 
I personally agree with this statement, as I had exerienced something equal. I had a french teacher in my sixth schoolyear who couldn't connect with me emotionally. When I forgot to do my homework, she just screamed at me and scared me to hell. With the time, I started to intentually forget to do the homework, because I didn't want to learn french properly. Today I regret that I had this rebellious behaviour, as now my worst exams are written in the french lessons. It could've turned out a lot different, if this french teacher in my past had tried to relate well with me.
