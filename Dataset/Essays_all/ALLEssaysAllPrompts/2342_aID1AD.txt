I agree with the statement that television adevertising directed toward young children should not be allowed..
My first argument is, that there are a lot of children which are addicted to Tv or other electronical devices. They don´t want to meet other kids or play outside, because they only want to watch TV, because they think that the TV is their friend. Often it´s very easy for children to change the TV shows and switch to programms, which are not made for kids. Young children get influenced easily by thing they see in the TV, for example sterotypes and bad behavior, which is often shown in TV shows. 
But there are also some shows, which are made to teach them, even if they´re not in school. These kind of shows with good informations often teach them about friendship and how to behave, but there are a lot of shows that doesn´t.
 I think the best option is to let them watch TV channels without comercial, which show the shows where kids can actually learn a lot about treating others. Their parents should watch with them as often as possible or ban bad channels for their kids. But in my opinion children shouldn´t watch TV a lot to make sure that they don´t get a bad influence and play more outside or with their friends, because thats the better way to learn how to behave, getting friends or treat others.
