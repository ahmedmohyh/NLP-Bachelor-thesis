Commercials are an important factor in our society, where you are confronted with advertising nearly everywhere. Not only on the television, but also on the street, through shields and logos attached to a wall or on a car.

Everybody  knows this feeling: you are watching a movie at home and during the commercial you suddently become hungry. Even if you just had dinner you have the desire to take the car and drive immediately to the next shop to buy a chocolate bar. But as soon as the commercial ends, this overwhelming feeling disappears as fast as it appeared. Obviously, this is an exagerated exemple, but it's pretty much the goal of the publicity industry. They want to induce you to buy a product.
A child has to learn how to deal with the manipulation coming from the media. If you don't get used to it as a child and learn how to control your emotions, it could be too late for you. You'd  be constantly buying things you don't really need and be loosing money in the meantime. 
You have to know yourself better than anyone else. Especially your response to certain commercials. There are researchers working only to find out how to stimulate certain regions of your brain and connect the product in question with pleseant feelings and memories.

So no, I'm completely against this statement.
