We all have an image of the perfect teacher; very intelligent, open for any question and having an answer to every single one of them. And in the meantime this person should be really nice and you should be able to laugh with them from time to time. But if I am to choose between someone who doesn't know what he is really talking about but is really nice and relates well with us and someone who has excellent knowledge of the materia he teaches us, I'd have to say that I'd rather be taught by the latter.
 
Firstly because learning is about asking questions about things I don't really understand in detail or would like to know more about. And if my teacher can't answer all of them, then I wouldn't really be profiting from the lessons.
Secondly, even if the teacher is sometimes kind of too strict and may seem as though he doesn't really get us, it wouldn't annoy me, because one time or another I will have to get along or even work with people I don't like or can't relate to, so it really would only prepare me for later anyway.
Lastly, I have to say that a person who knows just everything about his passion - I assume teachers are passionate about their choice in studies they made - is really inspiring. It motivates me to learn from someone who is really passionate about his job and knows just about everything there's to know about his materia.
 
Whilst I really think teachers should have both the ability to relate well with their students and the aility to answer every single one of the questions being asked, I think the latter is more important because of reasons such as motivation to lean more, accuracy of lessons being taught and because there are always going to be people we don't get along with so we might as well be prepared for that.
