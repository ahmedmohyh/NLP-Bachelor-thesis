Television advertising is an effective way to get people into buying new things, things they might not even need. Small children aged two to five might watch shows like "teletubbies" or "the Mickey Mouse show". Inbetween they need small breaks in order to let the previous information and morals from the show sink in. But should those breaks be filled with adverts for them?

Young children - especially around the age of two- maybe won't let the adverts affect them too much. They might not really know what exactly is going on. They beg for their mothers to carry them around and they love their old little teddybear who would belong in the trash bin because it is all chewed up. They live very much in the moment. They get affected by emotions and their environment, though they might not feel heavily related to those ads. 

However, at the age of five, they sure know what they want to have and they begin to be thoroughly influenced by the fun little adverts. It is ethnically not correct, because the parents are the ones who pay and the young children longe for the toys in a manipulative advert. These advertisements often make people conditioned to an excitable, unconcerned feeling because of a combination of something enjoyable (for example a summer party)with the product they are trying to sell. Five-years-olds might get envious of the other children playing with these fantastic new toys on the market. They want to have, what they don't have at the moment. 

Adverts, that relate to these young children are effective. Furthermore we should ask ourselves if it is a correct way of influencing those young children. It is possible, that they don't necessarily care as much as we might think, because they are too focused on living in the moment. However psychologists found out that those little children are very much influenced by their surroundings and in my opinition we shouldn't confront and them with the marketing world of today's society, as it is manipulative.
