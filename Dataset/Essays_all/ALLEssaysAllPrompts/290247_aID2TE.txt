On the one hand, a teachers ability to relate well with students is very important. If teachers can not relate with students, schools become a prison of authority with no consideration for the inmates. On the other hand, teachers need excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, else the understanding of the subjects by the students might suffer. 

One reason for teachers to be able to realte with students is that better understanding of the way students think and act allowes teachers to pass on the knowledge of the subject more easily. Imagine a robot trying to teach quantum mechanics to a plant. The two have nothing in common, no relateability. But even so, should the plant not be responsible at all to aplly themselves and learn the subject, even though they do not understand the lecturer? It should be the plants job to figure out how to learn on their own, if their lecturer can not help them. Professors in university can not relate to the students the least bit. They have a day job as a researcher and now and again, they have to stand infront of a vast amout of people and teach them. They have no reason to care about the students. They only want to be done with it. 

But a reason for the importance of excellent knowledge of the subject matter is that the professor can answer any question, levels and levels deep, going to the absolute of his experiance in the field. He can explain everything in minute detail and do it from eight different angles. 

The knowledge he has, he can try to pass on. But if he lacks that knowledge, in order to be able to better relate to students, there is no knowledge to be passed on. Prople can read and learn from books alown, but to become an expert, students need teachers.
