The influence of advertisment on kids ist horrible. You can really controll their opinion, since for trend, wishes and shopping wishes. That's how the most kids trends began and this trends are allways huge. That's the same point why u should allowed to show the clips. The kids are an importent market to sell. When thy grow up with their mind spread with those things the're used to it and don't want live without that. That's why the stuff will be long on the market and a good selling thing.For the one who sells the things with those clips it's important that it stays allowed to show advertisment. For the kids and their parent it make to go shopping so much harder. If the kids are really in the stuff you can't bring them away from this. I think advertisment is usefully for the stores, but not fair for the kids, because they can't diffrengiate the advertising and what the seller want. They just like it and want it and that's really really dangerous, because we don't know why the stores exactly sell the stuff to kids and maybe they do bad things to them. That's why I think advertising should be not allowed.
