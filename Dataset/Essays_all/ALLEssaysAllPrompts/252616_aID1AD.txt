Television advertising is definitely something that has annoyed everyone of us at some point. Especially disturbing are they when you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a five to ten minute break filled with those advertisings. The question now is if those television spots should be restricted for young children because they are not appropriate for them.

Young children aged between two and five are still in the state of growing up. The whole day long they learn and discover new things in their surroundings. So, we can say, they are highly influencable. Of course, nowaday there are so many brilliant TV shows for young children from which they can learn so many things. For instance they can learn how to count to ten or what the different colours are called. But obviously in between there are commercial breaks. For the newest shoes or a movie that is going to come out soon or even for another new show on TV. The children who sit in front of the TV and wait until their show goes on, they watch those advertisings and probably going to be influenced by that. So if there is a incredible new toy out in stores, they run to their parents and beg them to go and buy them that exact toy. Nevertheless, even if the advertising is going to be restricted to youg children, there is still a high possibility that they will see advertising for example when their parents are watching some TV shows.

I do agree with the statement, because television advertising has a really bad influence on young children. So, in my opinion, it should definitely be banned from television.
