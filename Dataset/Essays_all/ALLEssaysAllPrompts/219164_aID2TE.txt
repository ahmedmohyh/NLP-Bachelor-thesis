Everyone knows them; the teacher who knows his subject in every detail, but he or she can`t taught it how it should, so anyone understands it. It`s a problem, because the students don`t learn with success. But the other way round, that teacher who is able to relate well with the students, but doesn`t know enough abouthis subject, isn`t good either. The question is, in my eyes, what`s worse? 

Is a teacher`s ability to relate well with his students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject? I don`t think so. It is possible to improve one`s ability to relate well with the students, but it is much more difficult to improve one`s knowledge of the subject. For example my physics teacher; he doesn`t relate well with us (his students), and first, we all had problems with physics, but with the time, it got better, and so got we. Our grades show, that he must be doing something right now. I have no doubt about the qualitiy of his knowledge, not at all, and the only diffenrence is, that he relates better with us than before.

The aim is and always should be to offer the students the best knowledge. They should learn as much as possible, they have to improve their skills in mathemathics, english, biology, geography, history... To achieve this, it is the most important thing for a teacher that he or she knows excellent about his subject, and everything else, like the abilityto relate well with the students, can be learned and will follow.
