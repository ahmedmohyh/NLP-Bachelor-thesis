At the age of two to five children should learn to know the world. The real world and not an invented cartoon-fantasy-world with talking fruits and too thin barbies. Thats not good for them and maybe it could even effect their childhood. 
But not everything on television is bad. There are so many good shows like Dora, who is teachingthe children englisch, or a good animal-show, to get to now new animals and the parts of the world they live on. Shows like this are in my opinion important for kids. It's a good preparation for kindergarten or school. I personally wished I could have watched shows like this. But are these kind of shows really good for them, aren't they putting to much pressure on our children? Kids at this age should have fun and don't have to be interested in geographics, english or biology. But on the other hand, we have the other kind of TV-shows. They show them a fictional world with people with too big heads and eyes, a too thinn body. I've read many storys about young girls with eating disorders just because they wanted to be like their idol. A fictional caracter. Even if some TV-shows show us not a real image of real human beings they could inspire our litlle ones to do great things. Many shows are about friendship, helping each other and being a good person. The question now is if  kids really understand what's happening in front of their eyes or if they are just happy to be animated, because these days parents don't play very often anymore with their kids. They are to busy with work and other stuff to go outside and play with their kids. 
So in my opinion TV-advertisement should be allowed in a good balance between cartoons or animated shows and shows to improve childrens knowledge. But not too often!
