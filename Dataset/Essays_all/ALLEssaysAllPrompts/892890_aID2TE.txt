Every teacher has his own methodes of teaching a class. The way he teaches depends strongly on his personallity. If it's better for the students if the teacher has an ability to relate well with the students or have an excellent knowledge of the subject, isn't and easy question to answer.
I think first you have to say, that it depends on what school you're talking about. In primary and secundary school the students have a main teacher, that teaches them about 90 per cents of their subjects.The teacher in these schools must bild a personal relationship with the studens, so they are able to judge their students social abilities. That's why I think, in these schools it's way more important for a teacher to rather have the ability to relate well with students, then have excellent knowledge of the subject. In grammar schools the students normally have a different teacher for each subject. The teacher doesn't have to grade the students social skills and therefore, they don't have to build up a relationship with them. That's why I think that in this case an excellent knowledge is way more important, than an ability to relate well with a student, even thought it is never bad.
