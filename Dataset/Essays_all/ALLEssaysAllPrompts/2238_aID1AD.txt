Of cause there are many advertising in the television today, but there are not only positive facts the show them little children everyday because young children are not able to chose between many things and so they maybe want to have many games or something, but maybe the parents do not have that much money to buy their children all the things from the advertising. Also there is a problem because not every advertising is for every children for every age or sex. And in every advertising in the television are things to use inside a house or on the computer and so the children do not learn how to play with their fantasy or other kids outside in the nature. Also the fact that in the advertising is shown with children have to play with barbies and which have to play with pirates is not good for kids. But there is also the fact that it is easy to talk young children in to something, so they want to have something from the advertising from the television. This is maybe negative fro the parents but positive for the industry because children are very good in talking to their parents that they want to have something from the television advertising. So the parents maybe buy something from the advertising in stead of buying something with is not shown in the television. 
In the christmas time of the year the advertising in the television show much more games for children and so the children watch television and the advertising and put the things from it on their sheat of paper for their wishes.
Of cause it is good for the industry but also for the kids bacause the kids can choose their games and presents for their birthday and for the christmas time. 
So young children learn how to choose their own things.
