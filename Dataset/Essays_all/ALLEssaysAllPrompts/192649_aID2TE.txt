A major part of our knowledge,we have learned it at school. For a student it is important that the teacher knows the knowledge he is teaching, but also the teacher should be able to relate well with the students. With the following points, I will show me point of view.

Students do often look up to the teachers. Sometimes they want to be like them, so it is also important that the teacher is able to understand their students and does not only teach stuff like a robot.

Students do have their own problem outside of school and it could be difficult to concentrate. Every person has struggles, it could be at home, with friends or he just has a bad day. They get distracted with their thoughts and are not just focusing on school. So when teachers can relate with this, it makes it easier for the student at school.

They have other priorities. All pearents tell us that the most important thing is education, but a lot of students do not think like this. They have hobbies and other things beside school which they prefer doing. If a teacher can relate to this, the students feel more understanding.

I think it really important that the teacher can relate well with students as well as having a excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. Teacher were also students at one time and just because they are teachers now, it does not mean that they are different persons. They had the same problems, while they were at school. When they can show the student that they understand them, so it makes it easier for student to be actually at school.
