I disagree because I personally believe that both are equally important!

I think if a teacher doesn't relate well with students it doesn't matter how much they know, because they will not be able to pass it on to the students! 
The students will not take the teacher serious or give their best because they might not feel like they're taken serious. 
For me it has always been important to have a teacher that you know takes you serious, is there if you need help and wants the best for you, which sadly wasn't always the case.

On the other hand it's stupid if a teacher relates very well with students but has a lack of knowledge of the subject they teach, because it is important to pass on correct information. A lot of students have questions regarding the subject and it is important for the teacher to answer them correctly. This is not possible with a lack of knowledge.  

A good teacher is able to understand the students and relate well with them but also pass on correct information and give, if needed or asked for, more information or extra excercises.
