This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.

Companies which sell for example toys or games are doing much television advertising directed toward young children. Children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child. So the companies make much money with these advertising especially at chrismas time. So it is kind of good for the industry and the TV channels.

But kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss. Besides should the media not be directed to so young kids. Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media. 

I would prefer it if the advertising of toys and other childish things would be directed to the parents and not to the child so that the parents can choose what they want to buy and the kid is happy about that one thing and does not want every toy in the advertising.
