Many students and their parents think if a teacher can relate to his students good he can teach them better then a teacher who knows more about his subject then the first mentioned teacher but can not relate to the students as good as him.
I do not agree fully with this statement. In my opinion a subject can be more interessting with a teacher who can relate with the students and also a subject can be worth because of a teacher who can not relate with his students. But if the teacher relates too good with the students, students will not have as much respect as they would have if they were not so good related. If students do not respect their teacher the teacher can not teach them because they will not listen to him. But it is not enough to have a good relationship with the students you also have to know your subject very good because if students mention that you only know a little bit about your subject the students are not interested in listing to you because they think you can not teach them anything.
So to put it in a nutshell both atributes are very important and both are needed. Maybe not in perfection but a good teacher has to have a good relationship to his students and should know his subject really good. If one of these atributes is missing the teacher will not be able to teach the students effectivly.
