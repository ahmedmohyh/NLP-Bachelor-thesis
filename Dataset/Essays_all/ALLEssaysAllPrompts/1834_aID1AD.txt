"More and more childrens get influenced by the television adverising", thats what I hear sometimes from young parents.
But is that correct and should we forbit that?
In the follwowing I will list one argument for an some against this statement.

I think the only pro argument to this topic is,that we can't be sure, that these young children understand the advertising and became influnce.

But if it is so, there are many arguments for this statement.
The First and really important point are the false impressions. Trough the advertising of drugs like alcohol or cigaretts, they could think its a good thing. So the chance to comsume these drugs in the became more attractive.
In addition another problem is the much showimg of food. The childrens watch to so many unhelathy food, that they became influence and eat more and more of them, that they could get overweight in the near future. They lost their natural kind of eating.
In this case they learn that the people have to be beutyful neraly perfect like these in the advertising, they study it since the little childhood.
The last an and even bad argument is that they see many new and all times better toys as they just have. They want to get the new, better and cooler toys. They would be never happy about the things they already have. 
If we look into the future the familiys which have not enough money to buy their childrens so many new things, the childs would have complexes of less.
