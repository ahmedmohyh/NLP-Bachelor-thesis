We've got about ten different teachers. I like some of them, and others I don't like. That's because I have priorities for what's important for a teacher. I'm going to write about wheter it's more important for a teacher to relate well with students then excellent knowledge of his subject.

It happens from time to time that students ask their teacher a question and the teacher can't answer because he/she doesn't know. This is annoying, but in the end we actually don't really care because if the teacher doesn't know something it can't be that important. If students then even hanve to learn something despite the fact that the teacher doesn't knows it, it's very depressing. 

Another thing linked to the point above is that I wonder why I have to study something that not even my teacher knows.

In a very interesting subject it is quite nice if you can ask your teacher anything and he can answer your question. E.g. in biology it's interesting to ask everything about supplements in the human body... and even more interesting if the teacher can answer.

A subject can be boring, everybody knows that. And then if a teacher has no ability to relate well with his students it turns into a disaster. 
Nobody would listen and then most of the students would fail the test.
But if instead the teacher knows how to relate with his students hi can make his lesson interesting and he knows that he doesn't have to just give his students stuff to read, but also a film to watch or an activity...

Finally, I must say that I totally agree with the statement. A teacher can know everything about a subject, but if he can't get his students to listen and pay attention because he has no ability to relate with them, his class gets boring. On the other side, if a teacher doesn't know everything about his subject it's not that important if he gets his students to really understand what they have to know.
