This statement is wrong because if children get confronted with the danger of advertising really early they could resist them later in life because they know that advertising tries to make you buy something. Another argument against this statement is that advertising for young children helps to get out of stress before birthdays and Christmas. Children get inspired from the advertising and so they know what they want for birthday or Christmas. This helps stressed parents to know their childs wisches. A third argument against the statement is the fact that advertising influences also adults. 

Otherwise do children not know that an advertising tries to influence you. If they see an advertising they get trapped by it. Also can't children resist the psychological strengh of advertisings. And as the third argument children can't build their own opinion about the product because they believe everything the advertising says. They can't build their opinion because they can't imagine what it means to see a product they once saw in the television. 

I think that television advertising directed young children should not be allowed because they aren't able to resist and they haven't got the knowledge to decide whether the product is as it is shown in the advertising or it is diffrent and not as cool as they thought.
