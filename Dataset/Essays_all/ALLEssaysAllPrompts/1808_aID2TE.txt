In the following text I will discuss about the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

On one hand it is important that the students know everything they can know about the subject and they can write a good exam because without the knowledge about the subject they will never write a good exam.

On the other hand without a good climat in the class they will learn not enough because it is easier for the students to learn when they like the teacher. With a "nice" teacher they will probably learn more in the interessting lessons and they will have better greats.

Against it, is that in the following life the students must make a good job also when they have not a great boss and in school they could learn to deal with this problem. When they do not know how they must deal with it they may can lost his or her job.

An other point of view is that teacher which are not interessted of a good climat may not be teacher because a "normal" teacher wants that his students get good greats and that they like it to learn in his lesson and not that it is ennoying or uninteressant for them.

To sum up I think that it can be the teacher's ability to relate well with the students because he wants that his students learn something about his subject and not because he wants to be the best and lovely teacher of the students. A teacher is the boss in school and in my opinon he has the task to work for a good climat in the class but to taught the knowledge of the subject, too.
