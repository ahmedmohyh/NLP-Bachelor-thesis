I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is. And while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something. This means, that this kind of advertising can be very efficient, because more and more younger children watch television on a regular basis, so more and more companies direct their advertising towards this age group.
This means that children are manipulated more and more often, and in my opinion that should not be allowed. When children are heavily influenced by advertising, this leads to children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do, and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents, who will probably give in to their children more and more often, because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again. As probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised, children will probably eat more sweets, which could lead to more children being overweight. And as people often keep eating habits when growing up, this might increase the already big problem of obesity in the future.
Additionally, parents will spent more money on sweets and mostly unneccessary things, which can be a problem in families which are not wealthy.
Therefore, I completely agree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed", because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families.
