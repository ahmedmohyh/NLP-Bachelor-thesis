Television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more. For many families its a possibility to give their children something to do. But children cant learn to do something alone und so they arent interested in plays for their age. I think children aged two to five should not be allowed to watch TV, because it isnt good for a right education and their own development. In our society everything is used with media and you need it to live. Many parents make the mistake also with their children. They grow up with the same media problem and learn in young age how to use it. Another point is, what you see on the TV. A few years ago you had the possibility to watch series, which are also for young aged children. Nowadays you have the modern serien with guns and sexual things. It isnt save to watch TV to five years and also the ages after. Parents never really know, if its right what their children watch. We have many adults, who havent work, sit at home an do nothing. They sit the whole day at home and watch TV. Adults, as parents, are like an idol for the children and show with their lifestyle whats right and whats wrong. When young aged children to have the possibility to watch TV, you could imagine in which familiy the child grow up. The first ages are the most important years for their future life and in this time you have the best possibilities to teach them. In age from zero to five and also after they forget nothing what they have done. So in my opinion its the best way to give them something to do if you havent enough time for your childre, but the baddest way in the future of the children and not very ethical for the education.  For chiildren aged two to five it should not be allowed and the years after only a very short time and very strict.
