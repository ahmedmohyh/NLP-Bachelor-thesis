The abilities which teacher aught to have are very indifferent. In this essay, the importance of two of them is to be discussed: The knowledge of their subject and their ability to relate with students. They will be looked at from different angles and arguments shall be listed below.
First of all, the a teacher without knowledge isn't any good, it's like a cyclist without legs. So it is not usefull to relate well, if you don't know what to teach. As a matter of fact, a certain level of knowledge is the fundamental ability of every teacher.
On the other hand, if you can relate well to students, they will immediately like you better as a person, because of that, the will have more motivation to go to school and maybe even look forward to it. A cold teacher who is just teaching and doesn't really care about the students's problems can easily get students to dislike school and he decreases the motivation.
So it has to be a mixture of the two abilities listed, but which one has to be higher valued? With increasing age, students are used to school and they dont need that much attention as in their first years, because they have to take responsibility for themselfes and can't hide behind the teachers back. This is the complete opposite with the knowledge. Young students do not know a lot, so the teachers have to teach them the baseic knowledge. Whereas older students know a lot and the teacher teaching them has to know even more.
As a conclusion of the thesis above, I think that there is no particular answer to the question above, but it depends on which agegroup you are teaching. In case one is schooling young children, empathy and relation with them is way more important than knowledge, but as soon as the children grow older, knowledge becomes more and more important. In addition, neither one of these ability should under any circumstances go anywhere near zero, there has always to be a healthy mix.
