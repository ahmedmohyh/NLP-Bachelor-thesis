A child is watching his favourite Television programme, Spongebob. During the time he's watching this entertainment programme, there's always a lot of advertisement. Because it's during the day, the advertisments are explicit produced to reach the interest of the kids. For example there's always this nice advertisment for the new edition of the Lego's. But is this acceptable? Doesn't the kids get manipulated and brung to the point where they want to buy it? In the following essay I'm going to introduce you into my opinion...

Advertisment is a huge business today and it has become very essencial. The ones who aren't good at advertising are going to fall soon. Advertising has become so important today, that it controls a big part of beeing succesful or not. But do they have to advertise at kids from two to five?

I'dont believe that it's a good thing to advertise infront of young children, because they are still so easy to manipulate. It's clear that many businessmen take an advantage of that. It's like fishing, you just have to present your bait good, and you will catch one. Another point is, that you got almost controlled by the advertisments. If a child sees the new advertisment of Nivea it might think automatically it has to be like the beautiful women in the advertisment. In the worst case you get so much controlled of the media, that you start questionning yourself and think you have to be like the women in the advertisment. I don't believe it's good to give the young kids such a feeling. It just would be a lost of individuality.

So because of the different arguments I'm going to say that I'm supporting a censorship of avertisments for children in the young years.
