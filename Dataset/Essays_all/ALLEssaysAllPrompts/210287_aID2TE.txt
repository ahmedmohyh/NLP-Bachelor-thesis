I think, that a good teacher needs to relate well with students and needs to know what he's talking about. If a teacher can't explain well what he's talking about, it's very hard for the students to listen a whole lesson about things they don't even understand. I know this problem myself, and I sometimes just don't listen because it wouldn't help me understand it, so I rather repeat everything at home for the test. For a good explanation of the subjects in class, the teacher needs also to relate well with students. If he can't explain, either the whole class is very bad in the exams or they have to rest very long at one subject until everyone has understood it. But sometimes, if the teacher relates well with students and can explain good, he doesn't even have to have an excellent knowledge of the subject, he just has to read something theoretical about the subject with the class.  For me, it's more important, that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students than to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
