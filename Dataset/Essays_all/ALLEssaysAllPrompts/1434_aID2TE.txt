What are the qualities that would qualify a teacher as being excellent? That is a controversial topic on which many experts have stated their opinions. But it also is a relatable topic that not only experts have opinions on. As the society knows, there is no perfect teacher. At least the last eleven years of school have shown me that. Nobody is perfect! But even if we agree that no teacher is perfect, which features would be more important than others to have as a teacher then? 
A lot of people have an opinion on that and there were even movies made about it. Movies that show people running into a job as a teacher on excident and having no idea about any of the subjects. But at least those people always have empathy and know how to communicate. In the end everything usually ends well and those people become great teachers. 
While that of course are just movies and nothing you could translate into reality, I think that this scenario might actually include some truth.
I do not think that it depends on which grades we are talking about. It does take excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught whether the students are close to graduating or still in primary school, but the level of excellent knowledge as a teacher teaching an eleventh grade is just harder to achieve than when teaching a first grade. 
But a teacher also needs to understand his/her students and their problems and mindsets not matter how old they are. 

Summing up I think that the quality of empathy and the quality of excellent knowledge both are extremely important. Nobody benefits if you as a teacher know everything about your subject but you do not know how to communicate that content, but neither if you can relate to your students but have no idea what to teach them. 
In my opinion empathy might just be a little bit more important though because even if your knowledge is not excellent it still exists and you can still help people
