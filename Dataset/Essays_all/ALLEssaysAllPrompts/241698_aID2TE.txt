A teacher's task isn't always a very grateful one. They're hated by many students and some of them can even be bullied. It's essential to keep up your authority and to strengthen it. 
All in all it's quite a dilemma: Either you take your job too serious and try to teach them new knowledge with all it's consequences like to kick a student out of the room if he doesn't remain silent or you get along too well with your class and they start not taking you and your subject serious anymore. In this essay I would like to expose and alanyse the question whether the realtionship with your students or your excellent knowledge is more important as a teacher. 

"School is a place where you get to learn essential things like reading and calculating and you comprehend more how our world functions" is what many people expect from schools. Consequently, they expect the teachers to be educated perfectly. To be a man of your subject is only one condition to learn students new things. Have you ever seen a teacher that did not possess any knowledge? 

The atmosphere in a classroom is way more important, cause it's the first step in order to get your people motivated. The knowledge that a teacher tries to bring to his stundets is already based on a decent relationship. 
The key to become a successfull teacher is that you demonstrate the people that you're litterally living for your subject which gives a huge impact on your people. Here a little anecdote from an old French professor that my grandfather knew. Perhaps he didn't teach them everything perfectly but still over 60% of the whole class decided to study French. They did this because he convinced and impressed them way more with his attitude than with his knowledge. 

So in my opinion a good relationsship is necessary and way more important for young students.
