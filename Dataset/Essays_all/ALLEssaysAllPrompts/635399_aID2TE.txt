We all are or were in a school. We all had good and bad teachers. But why were they bad or good? Is it because they had an abiliy to relate well wiht students or that they had an excellent knowledge?
First it's important that the teacher has a good relation to his student, because this has diffrent positive aspects. One is that when the students have a good relation to the teacher they like to go to this lesson. When someone like a lesson he learns more than, when he don't like a lesson. Another is that this teacher can explain things better then other. They know how to tell the kowledge to the stundents that the stundents understand it.
But this type of teacher has also disadvantage. When he don't know enough for the subject the student learn wrong things and sometimes the teacher can't help the students when they have questions. It's possible that students have a to low level at the end of the year.
Another teacher is this who have an excellent kowledge of the subject. This teacher always know the answer of question and can help the students. 
Often have this teacher a problem to explain the subject to children because their level are to high. And when the students don't understand the subject they don't like it and it's borring for their. 
Both aspects are important because the students learn better when they like the subject and they learn the wright things.
But I think it's more important that the teacher has a good relation to the students. Then the stundents like to learn and also like to go to school. And I think this is the main point when you go to school.
