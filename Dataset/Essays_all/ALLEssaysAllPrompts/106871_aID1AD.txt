Our life includes more and more technic. It brought many advantages for our live for sure but it has a negative side too.
Technic became a big part of our live and with it television. So a point for letting children watch television at young age is, that it could be good to confront them with it already in a young age. There are also themes in the television where children can learn from. For example a film about animals or other cultures. On the other hand the mother or father could, instead of showing their child this film, look with it at a book about animals. In this case the parents could spend time with their child and be interactive with it.
But if a child only sits in front of the television it will have less time to go outside, play with children of the same age and do what children are supposed to do: Playing, running and use their creativity. That brings us to the next point. The evolution of the creativity of a child could be more difficult. And I think that is the worst part about this. If the child has never learned to occupy himself it won't be able to when it's olter too. It will continuou sitting infront of its television or computer. To build relationships will be more difficult.
So I think you deffinitely can't forbid children in young age to watch television because their parents are responsible for the education of their child. But I think one should give the parents more informations about the effect an overdosed consume of television could have in some cases.
