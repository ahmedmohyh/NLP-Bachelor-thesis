Nowadays many young children already watch TV. Because of that, they also are exposed to advertisements. But the question is, if it does any good or bad to these children.
First of all, advetisements do have an influence on the one who watches them. Especially young children can easily be influenced.This leads to the wish of needing and buying all these stuff, which is very bad.
Another point is, that these advertisements often are based on a joke. Young children won't get these jokes, and can so be offended through the advertisement.
As an personal opinion, I also think such young children shouldn't watch TV. Normal DVDs are ok, but on TV you mostly just watch trash. Because of that, children who should touch and feel things just sit there and do nothing all the time. This can lead to serious motivation problems in their later life.
On the other hand, advertising also have a good aspect. Not for children aged two to five, but if they are a bit older thex begin to understand the use of advertisments. They don't believe anymore that everything said on TV is true and this helps to develope their analytic ways of thinking.
I think young children mustn't be exposed to advertisments, but neither should they be exposed to too much TV. In my opinion, watching in these boxes isn't good for children of any age. They should go outside and make their own experiences for life. But in the end it is the decision of their parents and their responsibility to care good for their children.
