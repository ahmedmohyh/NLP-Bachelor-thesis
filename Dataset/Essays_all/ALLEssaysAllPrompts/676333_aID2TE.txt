The influence teachers have on children is often discussed. It sure is important that teachers themselves really understand what they are talking about. If they are experts in what they are teaching, children should be able to ask them everything and they should be able to explain everything. But isn't it way more important in what way teachers try to communicate and how they act around students?

An argument that speaks against this is that someone that doesn't fully understand a theme might be unsure of himself and because of that it's harder for him to answer questions that are a little more difficult. He might as well not completely understand what a child is asking and then give answer that goes into the wrong direction.

On the other hand it is much more important for the teachers to be able to understand the way students think. If a teacher tries to explain something to a child, he'll be the most successful if he tries to explain it in the simplest way possible. With complicated words the student won't understand anything, even though his teacher might be a professor.
Another important thing in the relation between student and teacher is sympathy. If a student likes his teacher, he will be much more attentive in class and try to be productive. If he doesn't like the teacher he's unmotivated and won't make any effort to learn anything from him.

In conclusion I think that both parts, being able to connect with students and having an excellent knowledge, are important. But only a teacher that is able to understand the childern's thoughts can explain things in a way that lets students make progress. In my opinion relating with students is more important. But if a teacher has good knowledge and can combine that with great explaining skills he gets to a whole new level of good teaching that lets students and teachers enjoy working together.
