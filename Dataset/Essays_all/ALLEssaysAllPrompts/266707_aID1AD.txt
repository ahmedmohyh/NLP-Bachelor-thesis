First of all television advertising means all the adds during the break of a film. Now the question is, is it legal to direct one of those adds toward children?

Now I think that the young children are much more easy to influence them so I think it's a clever marketing strategy of those big concerns for example LEGO or other things like that. And which parent wouldn't love to buy to their child the newest action figure or comic or whatever. It's also the charg of the TV channel which adds they bring at wich time but for me it's their right to place those add spots at the right moment so that as many children as possible are watching TV. It's as well a question of money. It's obviously that the channel gets more money when they put the adds at the time the concerns wants. 

On the other side I think it's not correct to use young children as a moneysource and so maybe to make the family poor or less rich. It also depends on what they are selling. Many concerns sell stuff that is getting better and better every month and so every child wants to have always the newest one. So for me it's manipulation and is's a really dirty strategy. 

All in all my opinion is not clearly on one side. Well I a critical point are the parents. It's their "challenge" to don't let their children watch to often TV. I think it's llegal to direct advertising toward young children as long as it is children stuff so it can't contain erotic stuff or something like that.
