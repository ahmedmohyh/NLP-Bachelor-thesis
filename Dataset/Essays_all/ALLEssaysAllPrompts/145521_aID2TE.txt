For me the statement is false and true at the same time.

The teacher needs a good student- teacher relationship and the teacher also needs knowledge for the subject. If he only has a good relationship with the student, it won't help for the whole life of this student. The student' wouldn't learn something if the teacher also don't know what he is talking about. He isn't a teacher for this student he is just a good friend for him. 

If the teacher got no good relationship with the student, the student can't learn a lot. He won't like the subject because he don't like the teacher. If they have a good relationship he has much more interest and he isn't bored to have the subject by this teacher.  Perhaps he got good skills in this subject but if he thinks the teacher sucks, he got no interest to learn something because he just don't like the teacher. He just want to wait until the lesson is over. To be a good teacher for the student, the teacher needs knowledge and a good relationship.

Both things are important. The question is just in which combination. I personally think that it's more important to have knowledge of the subjecht then a good relationship. A teacher needs to be a teacher and not a good friend who the student wants to introduce to his family. But im not going to say that it isn't important to have a good relationship. They mustn't have the perfect relationship. It's enough if the teacher is positive and supports the student and isn't boring the whole time. There are many students in a class so he can't be the best friend of everyone. At the end both things are more or less important. For me was just the combination of the knowledge and the relationship wrong.
