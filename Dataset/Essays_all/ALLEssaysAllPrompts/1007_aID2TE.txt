In the following text I am going to give reasons for why I would agree or disagree with the statement.
The statement tells about the relationship between teachers and students. Is it more important to have a good relationship between them or teach them the subject as best as they could without any kind of relation? 

First of all I think, if a person wants to become a teacher, the person has to be kind of friendly, because you have to teach children every day and as you know, children are that kind of people, who alyways like to have friendship. They don´t like to have arguements, also with their parents. That is the reason why i think, it´s impossible being nasty, if you are a friendly person normally. An other reason, why i think it´s better to have a good realtion betwenn students and teachers, is, that students often learn about the behaviour of their teachers. So if a teacher wants them to lern about a subject as best without any kind of hapinness or confidence the students couldn´t learn about patience and any kind of stuff, which they have to know in their future, like being confortable and friendly.

A reason against a good realtionship between students and teachers is, that students aren´t that concentrated on ther work, if they make fun with their teacher. Maybe also the teacher is teaching them stupid stuff to make them laugh. But I think this is the only reason against a good relationship between them. 

I think, the school is a place, where you have to go with a little bit of fun. If you only go there with fear it´s not good for you future life. That´s why I think, a good realtionship between students and teachers is more important than the excellent knowledge of a subject, when you are not able to teach it with a little bit of fun. Students want to have fun while learning boring stuff.
