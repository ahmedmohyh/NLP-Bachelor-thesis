Television is something that can influence peoples about they`re meanings and looks. Many peoples look Tv every day and there childrens do it too. The most of the television programs for childrens are made to feel them happy. Thats good for the evolution of a child. On the other side, there is the problem that some childrens think different and are not able to understand the happiness of a tv program. They will think than different and will be different in there character too. 
A other problem is, that it can`t be able to do a tv program for all childrens together. Like the old peoples, are childrens by them self different too. For example, when a really intelligent children looks something witch it knows allready but in the television it is present different, than the children will be irritated.
I think that the most important thing to allowed television programs for childrens is, that they can make choices about what they want to look about. It shouldn`t be only one program whit they can
