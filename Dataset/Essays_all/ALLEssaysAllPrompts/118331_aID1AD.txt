A positive aspect is that television advertising is an etertainment for children. Sometimes you can learn while wachting television, when it is a documentary about something. 

On the other side young children between two and five years shouldn't watching television. At first it isn't good for the eyes, and when the figures in television not speak correctly children learn the language false. Children shouldn't watch often television, because then they seat all the time. They need activity, they must go out and move. In this age children learn a lot for life and television don't help they for that. 

My opinion for this is, that young children don't need to watching television. In this ages the children must play with each other and have contact with other childrens. I think in the age between two and five children need many activity and must learn things they need later for life. 

Finally we can say that television advertising isn't good for young children but it should be allowed. Then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not, it's their own opinion.
