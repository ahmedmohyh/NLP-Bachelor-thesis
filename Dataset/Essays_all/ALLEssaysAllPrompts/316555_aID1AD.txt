If  young children are watching TV and seeing the newest Lego or Playmobile stuff they are fascinated and are running immediatly to their parents to ask them to buy it. So towards who is TV advertising directed?

A good thing about TV advertising directed toward children is that parents get new ideas what they could buy their children as a present if they ask for. 
But then the advertising is automatically directed to the parents because they owned the money to buy their children something if they are as young. So in the end it is not something parents are happy about because they have to spent much more money they wanted to spent because in the TV advertising only the best and most of the time the most expensive things are presented. 

You can say that a child is calmed down if they sees so many things they wanted to own and got new ideas what to play or what they should talk about with their freinds. But it is like the opposite because if children want to have something they started crying as long as they get what they wanted.
So for parents it is not a free time when their children are watching TV because they are always intterupted if a new cool game is shown in the TV advertising and their children are asking to got it.  

It is a good thing to show your things you wanted people to buy in TV but if you show childrens stuff it is not very efficient because they can also go with their parents in a shop like Toys`R`us and buy it on their own with the knowledge what you wanted to buy your children.

So in the end TV advertising directed towards young children is absolutely not necessary because parents are getting poor by buying too much stuff which their children not needed. It is also not directed towards children but towards their parents so you can not talk about TV advertising directed towards children.
