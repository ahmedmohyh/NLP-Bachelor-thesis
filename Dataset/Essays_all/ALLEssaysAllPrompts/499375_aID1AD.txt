Advertising is all around us. It`s an important part of economy. Companies need it to get people to buy their products. They often advertise on the internet or what`s even more effective: on television. What if there`s a company that is obligated to get children to buy/want their products, for example a toy? Should companies be allowed to show their advertises, which are directed toward young children on television?

Everyone is free to do whatever he or she wants as long as its not harming anybody. Are those advertises harmful for young children? Companies have specalists, which know exactly how to manipulate a kid, so that the kid absolutely wants to have the advertised product. They may want for example the toy after they`ve seen it on television, but the parents have the money and can still decide if they want to buy their kid that toy or not. 

Televison finances through money they get from adversiting. Children tv channels depend on that money. If adverting toward young children was banned, some tv channels wouldn^t be able to exists any longer. Another question is, if that`s acutally something bad. Two to five year old children shouldn`t watch tv anyway, it very much influences their intelligence and their ability to learn. So if maybe there weren`t as much kids tv-channels any more, kids would be more successful later in life. But we absolutly have to acknowledge that there is the internet, where the kids can have their harming screen-time. Or also even get to watch adversiting. So maybe the companies would just switch from television to the internet to make their adverises.

My personal opinion is, that we already have way too many laws and that`s it makes no sense to ban television advertising directed toward young kids. Everyone should be deciding for their own kid. If one really doesn`t want their kid so see such advertising, he or she should ban all electronic devices from the ho
