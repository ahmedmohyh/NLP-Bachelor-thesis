I think this statement depends on the situation and the student. Is a teacher able to relate very well with students, the lessons are not just a speak from the teacher, with all the information the students have to know. When the lesson is created in a way, in which the students got involved, in which the knowledge is presented interesting, the students are motivated to be active. If they are active in the lessons, the students learn much more, and they can also keep this knowledge for a longer time. In a situation like this, the teacher isn't like an enemy for the students and school gets less boring. For children, or also adults, who don't like going to school or even have got problems with learning, a teacher, who can relate well with students, is the better possibility. If the student is interested in new knowledge anyway, it doesn't really matter, what kind of teacher he has. But if the student wants to learn more than just what is teached in the lesson, a teacher with a big knowledge of the subject would be more useful. Because then, the student has the possibillity to expand their knowledge also much more and satisfy their needs of new information. In conclusion, I think teaching in the best way, depends on the people who are listening to the teacher. If there is a student with a reading-spelling-weakness, he better should get a teacher, which is able to relate well with people and who can motivate them to learn. If there is a student, who we would call a nerd, a teacher does not have to have the abilitiy to relate well with students. He just has to have a big knowledge, which he can give to the student.
