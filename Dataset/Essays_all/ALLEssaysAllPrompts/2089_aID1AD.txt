I agree with this statement and in the following text I'll explain, why:
First are there series and movies on television which shouldn't be allowed for young children, because maybe in the serie someone died or kill a person. This could be really dangerous for the psych of a child. 
Second are there movies or series with no background story or sense. In this age I think they should whatch something, where they can learn for example a language or names of things. Movies like 'Barbie' are just for 'making money' and not healthy for the brain.
On the other side is television something, what you can't hold back from your child. Maybe the kid whatch movies with their friends or when they visit the grandparents. I think whatching a movie is okay, if they can learn something. Maybe a movie with an ethical question, easy to understand for children. It's important, that they don't  whatch movies, which make them dumb or are reclame for toys or food.
In conclusion I would say television is okay, if they can learn something or they whatch something, which don't make them dumb or are unhealthy for the brain. And its important too, that they don't whatch to much on a day. Maybe just 30 minutes or one hour. That should be enough. But in the age from one to three I would not allowed my children to whatch television. They should grow up with the knowledge, there are other interesting things, not just something like television or a smart phone!
