The statement "TV advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is about what impact ads can make to humans especially to young children.

It depends on their parents. If their parents are strong and do not buy their kids everything they want to have, ads will not have a big impact. It also depends on which ads are showed. If there are only advertises about things that kids do not need like insurances or cars no one will bat an eye. It will get interesting when advertises are shown with kids as target. The children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the TV. But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine. So it is very important to show the children who has the power. In addition children from two to five are not that good in arguing. They will just say something like: "I need this toy (please) buy it Daddy!" and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it. The children have no other choice than accepting this, except for begging or crying. But if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children while they are crying they will soon stop doing it.
Another fact is, that some ads which children should not see are shown at night or in the late evening. So there is no danger that children could see ads they should not see.

So I disagree with this statement because smart parents are stronger than any advertise and if they are not they should think about their role as a parent.
