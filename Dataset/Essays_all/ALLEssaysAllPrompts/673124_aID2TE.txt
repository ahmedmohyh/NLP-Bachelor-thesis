Excellent knowledfge or the ability to relate well with students?

Is it more important that a teacher knows a lot or that hehas the ability to relate well with his students?This is what we talk about in this essay.

It`s important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge because if he can`t explain you the things he teachs you, it`s very difficult to learn them.For example if i have to learn maths but don`t understand it, i needn`t go to school because my teacher don`t understand it too and isn`t able to explain it to me.

But it`s also important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students, because if he isn`t able to relate well with his students, his students won`t follow in class and learn nothing even when the teacher has a excellent knowledge.For example if you sit in class and the teacher talks to the class but nobody listen to him, nobody learn something.

To sum up, it`s important that a teacher is able to relate well with students and that a teacher has an excellent knowledge. So in my opinion is an axcellent knowledge as important as the ability to relate well with students because if a teacher hasn`t the ability to relate well with students or an excellent knowledge, the students won`t learn something.
