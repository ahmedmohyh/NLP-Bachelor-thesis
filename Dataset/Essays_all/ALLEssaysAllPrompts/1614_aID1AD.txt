Telivision advertising is an very important topic in our every day lifes. Nearly everybody who watches something in the television knows about all the advertisings.
Today I will give you my opinion to the television advertising directed to young children. 

An argument for advertising in the young age is, that the children get prepared for their lifes in an highger age. When they grow up with the advertising, their parents will propably explain to them how they have to work with it and they should not let influence theirselves from the advertising. 

But on the other side, children can learn also in an higher age how they can devoid the influence of the advertisings from the television. They will propably not change anything on their attitude to watch television and to watch advertisings. 
Another point is, that children in this young age can not understand the advertising completely and they want to have all of it, if their parents would allow this. Here is an example: "If there is a toy, for example a dog, in an advertising and a little girl, 4 years old, is watching it in the television, then she would ask her parents directly if they can buy them for her. Her parents would propably say no and the little girl would be very sad." This example should show, that the children let influence theirselves too much from the advertisings, because they do not understand what the producers want to reach and their parents can not devoid this. 

As you propably can see in my arguments, I totally agree with the statement, because I think that children in this young age should not be confrontated with this advertisings.
