In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples. The first reason is that young children at the age from two to five can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a consequence it should not be allowed. My second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives. The third and important reason for me is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich. The children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their. There future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television. My last reason is that children at the age of two to five are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves.
