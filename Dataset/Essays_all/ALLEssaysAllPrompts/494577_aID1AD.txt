Modern family households have changed very much in the last few years. It's usual that every family has a television, an Ipad or mobile phones at home. So there's no way, a toddler doesn't come in contact with the new medias. The big advertisment companies have discovered this fact. In order to sell things, they advertise for small children, because the're still in their learning phase. A childs mind works like a vaccum cleaner as soon they can learn something new. A product shown in TV will be recognised in store by the young toddler. It wants to have it because it's related with good memories from the TV. The parents are then nearly forced to buy the product. In the end, that's exactly what the companies wanted them to do. 

I think that's one of the main reasons why TV advertising on young children should be banned. Back in my days, we didn't have a TV, so I think I got less influenced then todays kids. It's a shame, that this is allowed, because small children can't protect themselves from the big influence of a TV commercial. Furthermore, I think children between this age schouldn't even be allowed to watch TV, because it doesn't improve creativity. Instead they should play with Lego or with other leisure things that aren't electronical.
