They controll our childreen.
Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television. As many smaller childreen (aged two to five) believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion yet, they are a popular victim of advertising companies.
  There are ads for toys, kids food and the newest sport articles. The ads are often  straight directed towards young childreen with the use of childish language and by creating a happy and concsious atmospere with backround music and certain matching colors in the spot. 
It leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore.
On the other hand your kids are always well informed about the newest trends. Therefore it is possibly the best way to find a way between getting your childreen some of the goods but not always and when ever they want. 
But advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality. Articles shown in ads compared to their real quality and outer aperience often contains a big differnece. In the ads everything looks perfect, ervery girl or boy is smiling and ervery product is shining as the products are are made looking perfect for the ads with the help of modern computer technology like photoshop.
That's why I think there should be certain rules for the advertising companies which they have to follow, for example to downgradse the use of photoshop to influence the childreen. Because they bring parents into difficult situations where it is hard for them not to upset their childreen when they see the actuall product compared to the image which was presented in the ads before.
