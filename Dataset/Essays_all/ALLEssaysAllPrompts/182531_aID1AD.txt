Companies spend  a lot of money on advertising and one of the major advertising platforms is the television. During the advertising breaks they try to reach several different customer groups. Not only acccording to their age but also to their education, living standard and relationship status. But should it be allowed for the enterprises to stream advertising in television which is directed to young children or schould it be forbidden?

First of all you should ask the question if the young children understand what is meant with the advertising. Do they realize that it is played and not real? During the early years a child is influenced by many factors. How do the parents treat them, what are the doing in their free time, how do the friends treat them and for sure also what they see in the television. During this process the personality of the children is formed. Now is it good for a child to see that another child has the newest bycycle and it has to still drive the one from two years ago. This could lead to some serious problems for example that the child is depressed because it never gets new things due to its parents which can not afford a new bycycle for it.

But you could also say that if you are allowed to advertise directing all the other age group why shouldn't you be allowed to direct small children? For the companies it could be highly profitable because children can be very hard to shut down if they want something. And if a child sees another child having fun with something they want to have this kind of thing too to have fun. 

From my point of view it should be allowed to advertise directing young children as long they are themed and made according to their age. For example that no violence is shown or something illegal happens. And why not make an advertise for the new bycycle or just a chocolate bar. As long the children are not afraid of it it should be allowed.
