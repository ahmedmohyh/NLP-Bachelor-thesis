I think the televison has a big influence to us and specially to young children, because they can't know that a lot of this isn't true. I think it isn't fair for the children if they watch tv advertising. But I think it's also a part wich the parents have to control. Parents shouldn't let their children alone in front of the televison. And if the child want something after he watched something in the tv the parents have to explain their child, that there is a lot fake and that he doesn't use it.
A great idea is also to give the child early the possibility to say what it want. So if the child becomes some money for birthday or for christmas the child should have the possibility to buy what it wants. Also if it isn't a good idea. If the child hasn't some money it can make an other descision. Maybe it can wish it as the next christmas present. The parents have just to look, that the presents have a reason and they don't buy everything for their child just because it wants it.
I think it isn't a big problem, because a lot of the children series are in the internet and you can stream it for free or make an abo. So if the parents won't sit next to their child, when it is watching tv this is a simple solution.
From the side of the producer I understand, that it is easy to make an advertising for young children. Because many parents can't say no to their child. And the producer is just intrested, that the advertising works. And some adults are sometimes glad about advertising with children things, because they can find easily a nice present.
I think televison advertising directed toward young children isn't nice, but you can't make a rule contre this. So I think the parents have to look that their child doesn't watch it. And if advertising directed toward young children scholdn't be allowed, a lot of other advertising sholdn't be allowed too.
