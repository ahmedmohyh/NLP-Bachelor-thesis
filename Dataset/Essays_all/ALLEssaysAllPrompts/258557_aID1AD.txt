Nowdays the tv is one of the most important way to spreat advertisations. Many people talk about the bad affection of the television advertising on young children.

First of all children can be very easily be manipulated. Whatever comes out of the television children take a example of it. If a advertisation for toys comes up, children mostly go and begging the parents for it till they buy it. Thats how the producer sell their expensive toys.

Secondly the advertisation disturbs the children during watching their favorite serie or a film. A children should be able to watch tv without any unnecessary breakes.

On the other side it can have positive afffection to the children.
There are also advertisations on tv for good things like futher schools etc. which can educate the children.
