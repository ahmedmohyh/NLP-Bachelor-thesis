The question of what makes a good teacher is difficult to answer. In order to teach a subject with the highest benefit for the students, the teacher should not only be able to relate well with students but have an equal amount of knowledge of the subject he is teaching.
Without the necessary amount of knowlendge of a certain subject no teacher can spread the important imformation a subject has to offer. School is all about learning new things and gaining knowledge. It is the task of a teacher to keep the students interested in a topic of a subject that they have never heared before or would not consider outside of class. 
But knowledge on it's own is not enough either. A teacher can know as much as he can, but in the end it is the way he teaches his knowledge to the students that is important. Someone with a lack of empathy and understanding of a students view on certain things can have a hard time keeping his students interested. 
Same goes for a teacher that may have a good relationship with his students and can relate to them, but does not know enough of his own subject. A teacher can be an idol and a person of inspiration, he should be able to answer questions and offer information about anything topic related. If that is not the case, the students might lose their respect for their teacher or stop paying attention to his class, because they think they can not learn anything more.
It is of vital importance that a teacher can provide a combination of knowledge and the ability to relate well with students.
