Saturday evening, you are watchin a good movie. Then the movie is interrupted and you see an ad. Then another ad appears and you get slowly but surely angry. Television advertising is nervous but sometimes they show some good products. But what about the children? Should the advertising direct towards young children?
I think it shouldn`t because if they show an ad with toys which the children want, they will cry until they get it. So for the parents it is not just expensive, their life gets more stressed. Imagine every day the same. Your child is watching TV. After a while an ad is shown during the break of a serie. Your child is excited and wants this toy. You say no, it stars to cry. At a point you have enough and you go to buy this toy. So this produces more costs for you, you have to work more. On the other hand you can say no and let your child cry, it will stop after a few hours. But you won`t have a relaxed evening because the child may say no to things you want that it does like going to bed.
An other argument is that it interrups the serie the child is watching. Maybe it doesn`t understand what they show but it wants his serie to move on. It gets sad maybe starts crying, so you don`t have tranquility.
I think it should be allowed because young children often don`t understand what they show in the advertisment. They only see some, sometimes funny, mini-films. They don`t realize that this is an ad. 
I agree with this statement because I think this is not okay from the advertiser. He takes children in the ban of his product, only to sell more. And sometimes an ad shows things that children shouldn`t see. So it`s better when an ad isn`t directed towards children.
