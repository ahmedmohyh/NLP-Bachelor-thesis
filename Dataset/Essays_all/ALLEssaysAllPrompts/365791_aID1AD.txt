Advertisement has become more and more popular. Recent studies showed, that the average american watches several years of TV-advertisement in an average life. Thats a lot of time, and therefore it is absolutely worth discussing witch TV-avertisement should be allowed and witch ones not.

"Ich bin doch nöd blöd!" One sentence and most inhabitants of Switzerland will know to witch brand this slogan belongs. It is absolutely necessary that a firm is known immideatly by its customers. For this effect, especially toddlers are great persons. What a child beleves it its heart will stay there very long and it need moch effort to make the child think diffrently. They beleve what you say them even though it might not be true. Furthermore, we live in a free country, where basically every TV-spot is accepted as long as it is not violating any laws.And exactly that point is important for brands and firms, they need to have the possibility of being diffrent.

But as metioned before, toddlers developpment is to little to make a difference between real and fantasy. If you let the thinking of "the more I buy the luckier I am" succed in them, they will pobable never loose it again. In addition to that, they don't have any relationship to money, witch makes them beleve that they can have everything, as long as their parents do buy it for them. That is not true but nether is it true that consuming maokes anyone happy in  the longer therm.

In my oppinion, TV-spots for toddlers are somehow immoral, and should therefore not be seen on TV. It is a sign of weakness if a firm nedds to manipulate the smallest of our society just to survive or even make profits. Small children are worth being protected and therefore it should also be possible for them to be educated by their parents rather than by unperonal, lying TV.
