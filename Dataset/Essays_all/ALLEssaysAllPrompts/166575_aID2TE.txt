The aim of this essay is to show if the abilitiy to relate with students or the knowledge is more important for a good teacher. 

First of all it is really important for a teacher that he has a good knowledge and knows about what he is talking. A teacher needs to be someone that is an expert on his subject. If he does not understand proberly the schoolsubjects he can not be able to explain the things to the students. If the teacher explains things wrong he can get into deep trouble, because if he asks things that he had explained erylier wrong at an exam, the whole class does not trust in him anymore.  

On the other hand a teacher needs to relate to students. The teachers knowledge can be perfect but if he is not able to relate to the class, he can not perform his job, wich is to leran things to students. I have a personal experience with that problem. For example my math teacher is brilliant and I am shure that he understands everything he says but he has a problem to relate with us. He is just not able to explain things to us that we understan it and that is a big problem.

In my opinion it is not possible to say if the abilitiy to relate or the knowledege is more important. As a teacher you need both aspects to learn something to students. In conclusion I think a good combination of both makes an excelent teacher.
