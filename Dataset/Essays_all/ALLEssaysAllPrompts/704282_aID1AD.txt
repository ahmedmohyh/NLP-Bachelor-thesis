I think that not all adverts are bad for children. For example an advert that presents vegetables could encourage young children to eat more vegetables which is good for their health.

However adverts for toys that are new to the market and very expensive can put the idea of needing to have them in their head. The parents will then have to tell their children that they can't have it which is a struggle.

On the other hand if the parents don't want to argue with their children about stuff they have seen on television adverts they can just minimize the time spent in front of the television. Because it's the parents task to have control what their children see, not the governments. Let's say a child spends 4 hours a day watching television they will see more adverts than a child who watches one hour per day. Therefore the first child is more influenced by those adverts and will have more desires that his parents will have to decline. 

In my opinion adverts directed toward young children should not be forbidden since it's not the task of the government. but they could change the adverts and the time they're shown.
