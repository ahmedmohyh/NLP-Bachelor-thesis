Teachers have an important job, they are responsible for the next generation. But is it more important that they relate well with students or is the knowledge more important? To answer this question it is nessecary to make a difference between the different classes. So for youger pupels which do not know the school and the prodedures there very well, it is more important how the teacher relates with them. The right way to communicate with the younger pupils is very important because they can be impressed easyly in a good, but in negativ way,too. So when they do not learn to like the school and learning early they will not be motivated to work for good graduation marks or maybe they are afraid of specific teachers. But for the older ones whoos graduation is not far away the teachers knowledge can decide about the marks of for example their A-levels.
But this does not mean that it is unnessacary how the teacher relates with the older ones or that teachers from the younger classes does not have to have a good knowledge about their subject. 
All in all teachers must know how to relate with pupils without taking away their fun while learning, and anyway be able to teach them very well. But the focus has to be different in relation to their age.
