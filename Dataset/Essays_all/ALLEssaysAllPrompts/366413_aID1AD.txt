You often see young children on televison. They look cute and impress the people. Is this also a good experience for the young children or will they going to have problems later? Television advertising directed torwarted young children between two to five should not be allowed. There are many arguments for and many against.

First I deal with the positiv site. Young Children are very likely seen on Television. They look cute and impress the people. Often the children has fun and a lot of people who know it. For companies it is also a big bussines because children are not as expensive as older persons but mostly has the same effect. When they will forbit advertising torward to young children they will take more freedom from the humans.

The negative site is much longer. Children aged two to five are to young to understand and to decide that they will be seen by the whole world. Oftens the parents would like thaht theirson or daughter will goining to be a star. They push their children all the time and forget that the children has to be protected by the parents. The young children should enjoy their young life without any stress and strict plans. It is also dangerous to present your young child on television because there are nearly the same problems like in the social network. It could be that the child later get mobbed by ohter children.

They are clearly more facts against advertising direted torward young children. In my oppinion it should be not allowed because it is to dangerous for such young children and they could not decide by themselves.
