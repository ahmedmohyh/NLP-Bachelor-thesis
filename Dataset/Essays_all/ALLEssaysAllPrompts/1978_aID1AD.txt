The statement i will write about now is that television advertising directed toward children under five years old should not be allowed.
Against this statement is the argument that the young children are learning the language with this ads. They are interacting with the television which may be positive for there development. 
Another argument is that the kids may be entertained. They maybe have fun when somebody in the television speaks directly with them.
In addition even if there are negative aspects in the advertising the children are not influenced very much because the brain does not remember very much when it is so young.

On the other side children can be influenced very easy, much easier then adults. That can be negative for the development of the children.
The second argument is that children do not need advertising because the adults buy all things anyway.
Also the people in ads sometimes do things that children should not do or they say things children should not say. Examples are maybe illegal or dangerous things to do or very unpolite words to say.
Another point agreeing with the satement is that in ads often topics are mentioned wich are not good, topics with a bad influence on the child. That are topics that are only for adults like alcohol or sex.
All these negative aspects have a negative influenece on the child and his development.

After all these arguments I think it is important to protect the cildren from the media in their early years. It is more important that a child has a positive development with aspects that are important in the later life. I would say that the advertising makers are so good that they can influence the children very negative and that would not be good. So finally I agree with the statement and in my opinion advertising directed toward young children in the televison should be forbidden.
