I think this is a very interesting statement and I am going to share my opinion on it : Indeed I think to a certain degree the teacher`s ability to relate with the students is more important than just there knowledge of the matter. This is because at least in primary level most teachers know enough to cover everything on the subject and all the question. But if on the other hand the atmosphere in the class is bad because the teacher and the students have a bad relationship the students are automaticall not very interested in whatever the teacher tries to teach them, also they just won`t work as well as if the relationship was really friendly. On the flipside this relationship can`t be to friendly because then maybe the students think they can do whatever they want whenever they want. I think this is especially very important in first to sixth grade because there it is really important that the students don`t loose the interest in school which they probably will if they hate going there because the teacher just can not relate with them. I think the knowlede gets more important every year from the sixth grade on because know the kids found out what they want to learn more about so the teacher should also be able to teach them new and more interesting stuff. At the secondary level I think the mixture of both is very much needed to be a good teacher just because some of the students are going to be very into the subject so you need to be able to answer their questions and therefore need some excellent knowledge. So in the end I can not agree nor disagree with this statement but I can totally understand why people would think both ways.
