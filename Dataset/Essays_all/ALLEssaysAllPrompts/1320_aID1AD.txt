One of the main arguments that advertising should be allowed to be directed at children aged two to five is that advertising helps selling the products. Children are easy to influence and the parents listen to their children so that they buy the product the small boy or girl wishes for. It is very easy for a company to sell their products to children when they advertise it correctly so it is easier for them to keep the head above the water and stand out against the other companies.
Another argument for advertising is that advertising can give new birthday present ideas for children. For example Hans is a two year old girl that doesen´t know what to wish for his birthday so he turns the TV on and boom there he has an idea and he runs to his parents but they say that this is too expensive. Hans is sad and cries the whole day so advertising isn´t good for the children.
It isn´t good because the children can´t decide what they are influenced by so that they want something that they don´t really need to have. For example Hans got the toy he wished for his birthday but he just played once with it because it isn´t like he wished it to be. So the money for the toy was wasted and Hans is said again. Poor Hans.

Another argument against advertising and the most important one is that young chldren don´t have an own oppinion so they are very easy to be influenced by the companies that want to sell their products so thery don´t respect the children and abuse them.
In the end you can say that advertising toward young children should be forbidden because the children don´t have an own oppinion and can´t decide what they want to buy they just want the newest and best toy they saw on TV and the parents need to waste their money but the children are still unhappy. So i agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
