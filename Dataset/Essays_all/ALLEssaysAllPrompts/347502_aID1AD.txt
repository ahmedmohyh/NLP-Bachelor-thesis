The question that televsion advertising should not be allowed for children at age from two to five years shows up many pros and contras. 
In the one hand, TV advertising may confuse children. For example, when they are watching their favourite programme and suddenly it disappears, children may be sad or confused. Another reason is that almost every child is very unpatient especially when they are bored. So they always need to be entertained and should never be interrupted.

In the other hand, being honest, children at this young age do not really notice when an advertising appears. They probably think that it is part of their TV programme. Furtermore, advertising is not here just to annoy us. People make much money out of it. 
Children especially at this age should take breaks and should not rest for hours in front of a television. They should move their body enough and play outside instead of just be lazy at home. And this is exactly the reason why advertising is important. For example, a child needs to pee but his programme is much funnier and more interesting than the toilet. A child will never come to the idea that it should stand up and do whatever it needs to to. So a TV advertising is just like a reminder for the important things in your live.

To sum up, I think that advertising should not be prohibited because there are many reason against it. Maybe this people who are responsible for advertisings, should shorten it a little bit but never prohibit it completely!
