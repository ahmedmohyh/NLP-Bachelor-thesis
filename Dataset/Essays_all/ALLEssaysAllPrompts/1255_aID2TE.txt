it is important to have a good relationship to the stundents because the students are more interested in the themes when they know the teacher is behind them and helps when something is wrong.also they better know the stuff when they like the teacher because the learn more from him because thy liked him.it is also important that they have the confidence to talk to their teachers about the problems everybody have.excellent knowledge is also important because the must known the stuff for the futur their going to be.every lesson is important to the students because they learnd it for life and they need it anytime.it is good for the way they want to go, like stuiying or for their exam.the best thing is if you have a competend teacher who gives you the ability to learn something from them. stundents learn only if the taechers is liekly a friend or something in that way because they feel nice with him.for most of the students is a good knowledge everything because they need it for their future job they like.for that reason i think they have to make a oppotunity from both statements:the ability to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge.thats my opinion because the reasons i have taken.also every student have an other opinion to the teachers one of them you can like an other one is in your mind realy bad.he gives bad grades and you dont know why.the person besides the teacher can be very cool and smart and on the other side he is the devil in person like.but not al teachers are likely bad they are angels in our mind they dont compare the students with their older sister or brother.you have an fifty fifty chance to get the good teacher at once and get good grades from him for your ability to work in the lesson and you won a price for that:youre grade.in that mind it is not everytime your fault that you have bad grades it is your teacher because he doesnt like you.so be confident and talk about your problems.
