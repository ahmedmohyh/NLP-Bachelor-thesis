A teacher's ability to relate well with students is important. But is it more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? In the following text I'll try to answer this questions with some different arguments.

If a teacher has a big knowledge of the subject he is teaching, he can mostly answer all the questions students are asking. But if he can't explain the answer or the stuff in a good understanding way, it's not very helpful. It's important that a teacher knows how to interact with the students. He should understand how they are thinking. I've made my own experiences with a teacher who knows a lot but can't explain it in a good way. In physics, we had a teacher like that and after one year, I hadn't learned anything.                                                                                                                                                                          But some times it's even the other way around. The teachers are very social and understand all the problems of the students. That's sometimes the problem with substitute teachers. They often haven't studied the subject the should teach. For students it's the same problem again, they don't learn a lot.

To summary I would say that having a big knowledge of the subject a teacher is teaching is as important as being able to relate well with students. If a teacher is just good in one of them, the students won't learn a lot.
