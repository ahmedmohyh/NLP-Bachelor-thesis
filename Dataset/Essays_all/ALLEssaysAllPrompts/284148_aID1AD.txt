When I was young at the age of five, I went out playing with other kids football and other kind of plays. But I also actually watched television. And I remember that many friends of my didn`t watched television, because their parents forbidden it. For me it didn`t make any sense.

Clearly every parents told us children, watchig to much television is bad for us. My parents also thaught this, but for them it wasn`t such a danger. They thaught it is okay watching children shows for example like Spongebob, Tom and Jerry or all the Disney shows. I loved it to watch this shows. Especially at weekends, every morning at seven o`clock when all the childern programms started. And it was also nice to talk about these shows with other children in the kindergarden and after in the primary school.

And while talking about all the shows, many children told me it is very bad, watching so young so much TV. They said to me, that their parents have told them it isn`t healthy for people watching to long television, actually for young children. The eyes will become more weak, also the brain. Their parents alouded them to watch television only for one hour in the week. Some families I know, don`t use television still today.

In my opinion, it is okay to let children watch television, but not to much. Childeren also have to learn other things, to go out have fun with other kids. But I find it almost brutaly to don`t let a children watch TV. Some things you also learn thigns by watchin TV
