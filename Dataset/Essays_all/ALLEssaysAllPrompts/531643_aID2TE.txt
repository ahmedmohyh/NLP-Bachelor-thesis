I think that both are very important and the best would be if the teachers were equally good in both.

 It is important for the teacher to relate well with students so the students respect him. If the students don't respect the teacher they won't learn from him, because they wouldn't listen to what he says. When the teacher relates good with students they want to leanr from him, they listen and concentrate. 

But the techer has to know much about the subject being taught. If the teacher doesn't know well about the subject the students can't learn from him even if they wanted to. The teacher has to know more about his subject than the students because they won't have respect from him if they have better knowledge of the subject being taught. If this happens he wouldn't have either of the abilities. You can't teach someone something you aren't sure about. The students will never understan everytihng the tescher taughts and if he doesn't know much they will learn almost nothing.

I disagree with the statement because I don't think that one of them is really more important than the other. I think if you have great knowledge of the subject then to relate well with students is more important than to get even more knowledge. A teacher needs to be good in both so that the students can learn from him.The most importnant for a teacher is that the students learn from him.
