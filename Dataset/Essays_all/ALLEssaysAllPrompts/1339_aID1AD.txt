I don´t know if I have correctly understand the task. But if the statement is television advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should not be allowed, I ask myself which children at this age are interested in television advertising? The feelings (Wahrnehmung) of this young children isn´t good like at a erwachsenen human. The children don´t know what they see there at the screen. Maybe they see there a tree or an animal and they say: "Oh, there is a horse!" They are happy to see this and because of this I don´t think that they want to know what the message of this television advertising is and which Absicht the director of this has.

So I disagree with the statement (in hope of the right understanding by myself).
