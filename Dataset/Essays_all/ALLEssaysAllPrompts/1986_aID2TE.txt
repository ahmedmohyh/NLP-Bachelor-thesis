Last week I got a new teacher. He was kind of quite, kind and polite. We had much fun together but as we started to learn for our enxt exam, we got into some troubles. We worked on diffrent topics but he couldn't explain at all. After the worst exam results ever we started to think about the method of our teacher.

First of all it's important for everyone to reach a high level of knowledge to pass the exam. The more you are prepared the better you can handle following tasks. Even if you don't understand the topic you need to pay attention to get the next one. It's important because today you should know everything to survive the school. We reach the point where you can't just ignore the teacher. Everything is connected to other topics and you are expected to be able to follow instructions or tasks which u can't do if you just jump to the next topic. Also it the teacher is gets money for it.
On the other hand it is not nessecairy to be best friends with your teacher. it can help you but it must not. If you are a smart pupil it will be enough to just give clever answeres to get acceptalbe marks as a result. If you are polite to the teacher he might likes you but that doesnt pushes you to better marks. According to that you should've a nice athmosphere in class. It isn't really helpful if the teacher and his class are joust angry about each other. 

To sum it up I think it is important that the teacher can explain best to you and give you the knowledge you need. On the other hand it would be a nice add-on to have a relaxed situation while the lessons. It is not nessecary to be polite but it can help. To come to an end i disagree with it that you should be more polite as a teachter then to teach somehting.
