There are many competences a teacher has to fulfill. But which ones have a high importance and which ones not? Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

If a teacher does not know much about his subject, how can he teach it? The job of a teacher is to hand his knowledge to his students. This is not possible without some basic knowledge. What should students learn from a teacher without it? It is always wonderful to observe people that are interested in their subject and like to inform themselves about new aspects of it. This fascination and thirst of knowledge concerning a topic is something that everybody should have. Teachers that know much can "infect" their students with their motivation to know many things.
But maybe these teachers cannot hand it to the students in the right way. Their lessons could be dry.

If a teacher behaves like an ass or just messes up with his students, nobody will like his subject. The students are not motivated. It is not likely that they will have a profession in this direction. So a teacher can hand more interest to his students if he relates well with them even if he does not know much about his subject. 
But if the students notice that he does not own much knowledge, they will describe him as incompetent and not listen to him anymore.

It is clear that a good teacher should have both competences. But if I had to choose, I would take a teacher with excellent knowledge. I personally have made this experience. I have choosed biology as subject even if I really do not like our biology teacher. I just cannot get him. He annoys me very much, but my interest in biology is stronger. My biology teacher knows very much, also about new technologies and theories. For me, it has not the same priority to relate well with my teacher. If you have the will to learn, only the knowledge of a teacher counts.
