Of course it is an impotant thing that a teacher is able to get along well with the students. Then often students like to go to school and have fun there with the teacher and the class. Maybe some of them even work better with such a teacher than with a teacher they don't like that much. But students are sent to school to learn the subjects they are taught. This is the reason for going to school. And when they don't get the same knowledge with a teacher who relates well with them as with a teacher who doesn't the reason for going to school isn't fulfilled. 
Against that fact you can say that the motivation of the students who have a teacher like in the statement is much better than with a different one. And because of that they also work better and harder so they also get a good knowledge. But maybe it's also very different. With that really good realtion to their teacher the students are probably more relaxed with the school stuff. And that would be negative for their knowledge in the certain subject. 
I think the knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than the teacher's ability to realte well with the students. I disagree with the statemenst because an extremely good relation to the teacher often isn't good for the knowledge you should get. You don't take the school as serious as you should anymore. But the school has the function to teach the students different subjects. And as i've already said that's the most important reason for going to school.
