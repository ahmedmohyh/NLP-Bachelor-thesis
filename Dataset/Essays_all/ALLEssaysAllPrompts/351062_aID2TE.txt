In this essay I will go into the topic of whether it is more important that teachers have a connection to their students or if their excellent knowledge is of better use.

First of all, I think it is also important that a teacher has in-depth knowledge about their subject because obviously you have to totally understand a topic if you want to teach it to others. In my opinion this is so important because there's always this one student coming up with the most complex and confusing questions where you have to understand everything about the topic to give this student a satisfactory answer.

On the contrary, I believe that it is definitely important that students have a great connection to their students. Because I have had a firsthand experience where we had a teacher with mostlikely excellent knowledge in Mathematics, but many disliked him as a teacher, didn't understand the topics simply because he wasn't able to put the message across to us. This was probably due to the fact that his connection to between our class and this teacher wasn't the best. So I think it is absolutely mandatory for a teacher to be able to understand their students and vice versa.

Conclusively, I think that having a good connection to your students is definitely more important than the brilliant knowledge. This is because if there's a good connection it will be easier to pur the message across and it is also a lot easier to make interesting lessons.
