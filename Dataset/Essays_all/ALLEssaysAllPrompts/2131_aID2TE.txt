A stundent spends a lot of time at school learning from different typs of teachers but what is it that makes a good teacher? 

Students always have their favourite teacher and a teacher they totally dislike, it mostly has to do with the teacher's appearence. So stundent most likely listen to a teacher they like more carefully and learn more then from a teacher they don't like at all but knows much more about a subject. 
On the other hand a teacher is there to teach as the name says, so a teacher who relates well with student but doesn't know much about a subject isn't really useful for the students education. 
Every teacher has different areas he or she is good at for example a history teacher might know a lot about WWI but not so much about the American history like what happend with the Dust Bowl. Still in that case a teacher can look it up in books or the internet or in a film. It is easier to learn something about a theme then changing ones personallity. 
If a teacher is extremly into a subject and loves it a lot he could pull the students with him into that subject just because of the strong and interesting emotions from the teacher and a teacher who isn't connected to the subject couldn't build this emotions.

I think a teacher should have a little bit of both because it should be fun going to school. Every teacher is different and has her/his own interests and abilities but they should try to relate to the students to make the lesson the best experence for all.
