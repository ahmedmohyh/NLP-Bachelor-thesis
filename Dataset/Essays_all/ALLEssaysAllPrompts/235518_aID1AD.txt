It is very controverse issue if children should advertising directed through the television. There are many people which thnik children should not watch television at all because they just get manipulated. But there are also people which find it ok or a good idea when children watch television just to keep them calm or to lern things like by Dora.

At one hand many people say that telivision manipulate children and that advertising would make the situation even worse. How often run childre after a commercial to their parents and ask them to buy this things? Furthermore young cildren are easy to influence and thats very bad espacilly because children should rise in a safe area without any commercial influences.

At the other hand why should companies advertising parents for staff whitch is espacilly for childeren? And is it not the responsibillity of the parents to ,,safe´´ their children from commercial influences? So if parents do not want that their children get directly advertising by television than keep them away from it or just let them watch non advertising channels.

In my opinion it very hard to descide. I think it is not so bad when children were advertising for things that are useful or intelligent like a shining football but it is very bad when the commercial just advertising crep which is extreamly expensive and the main funktion of the commercial is manipulate the children. But I know that it is hard to say which things are useful and which not which are good commercial and which are bad. 

We see there are positive and negative aspects of advertising children directly through television. And that it is nearly impossible to say which is a manipulating commercial for unusful things.
