I agree with this thesis because young children especially at an age from two to five are more likely to be caught by an advertisment. While they're watching his or her daily programm, which has an educative meaning for the children because it is the age in which they can learn the most and they schould do learn the most, the advertisements will lead to a feeling of need which would be connected with a greed. The parents where 'forced' by crying or similar to buy a product which the child doesn't want but which it has to have. Advertisements would manipulate children at all an in peticular at this age. 
For example the christmas business. The time where all companies can make and want to make the largest profit possible. Therefore they will make more advertisements and the cycle starts again. 
Another argument is that the time wasted by advertising spots could be filled by educative content like movies, series etc. so instead of interrupting the childrens programm with manipulative advertisements they could be prepared for life in the long run. 
In order to conclude I would say that advertisements in the television programm of children is just a manipulative and somehow criminal way by the companies to gain as much profit as they can out of children, the weakest part of our population. Therefore the government should strictly prohibit something like that.
