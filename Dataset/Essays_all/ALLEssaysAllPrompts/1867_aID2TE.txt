How much students learn at school has many reason. One reason is how good a teacher is. The statement,if a teacher is better for the students when he has a good relationship or when he has a exellent knowledge of his subject he being taught is a hard question.
On the one hand it is good when a teacher know his subject very well and he can explain and talk about a theme. This type of teachers are competent in their job to share they knowledge. When he can also talk about situations he lived , it is a good way to learn for the students.
One the other hand it is important to relate well with your students. As a teacher you has to be able to talk with your classes in a interesting way. It is not good when you know many things and you are very competent but you are not able to "aggieren" with the students. It is not enough, when you can talk about your subject and give many informations, when you can`t relate with them. The student can better learn when the teacher give they the information in a friendly and funny way. They will learn more.
I agree with the statement because i find it important too, that the teachers teach in a good relation with their students.
