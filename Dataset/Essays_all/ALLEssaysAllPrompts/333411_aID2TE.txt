A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent kowledge of the subject being taught.
 
Of course a teacher's ability to relate with students is important to some level but never more important than the actual knowledge of the subject. A teacher need to be able to give their knowledge to his or her students, but if they cannot relate to them how are they going to implant their knowledge in the students? 
What is most important though is to even have the knowledge because if you do not have the knowledge it will not help the students that you understand and are able to relate to them because you have no knowledge to teach.
The problem with this statemnt is that it is neither false nor right. A perfect teacher should have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught and also be able to relate with their students in order to give their knowledge to their students.

I do not agree nor do I disagree for exactly the few reasons listed above. I believe the excellent knowledge of a teacher is very important but it will not help me, if my teacher does not relate to how I would  be able to understand the subject. But if I had to decide on wether it was a true statement or not I would say it is a false statement. 
Because I would personally rather have a teache that knows the subject well than a teacher that does not but can realte with me.
