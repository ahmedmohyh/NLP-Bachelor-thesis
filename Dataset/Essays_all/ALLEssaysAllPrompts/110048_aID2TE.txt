A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.


At my opinion ,the ability of a teacher to relate well with the students is one of the most important things at school. In many cases students hate the subjects just because they don't like the teacher. But if the teacher relates well with the students, they enjoy the class and are more likely to listen to the teacher and learn something. It doesn't matter if the teacher's knowledge isn't excellent. One of the reasons is that they will still try to learn what the teacher teaches them. If a teacher has an excellent knowledge but doesn't relate well with the students, they won't even try to understand the matter. It is better for everyone, the teacher and the motivated students will enjoy the class and most students will learn the most important parts of the subject. In the other case, the excellent knowledge is just useful for the most motivated students and the rest of the class won't even learn anything. 
Another point is that if a teacher can't relate well, he won't be able to teach the stuents everything he knows, but the better he relates, the more is undersood of what he wants to say.


These are the reasons why I think that the teachers ability to relate well with the studens is way more imortant than the actual knowledge of the teacher. It is better if everyone knows the important things instead of just a few people that know everything and just listen to the teacher because they like the subject.
