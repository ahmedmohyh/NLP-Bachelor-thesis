Back in the old days, students got slapt on the finges with a ruler or simply in the face if they didn't behave well. Today it gets more important to be nice and gentle to one another.
If there's a good relation between the teacher and the students they will be for shure more active and show no or at least less hate towards the teacher. The lessons will have a better atmoshere and all together less problems will come up, but also the students could may be more laid back and have a talk to each other (though this depends on the teachers way how to teach).
However, if there stands a professor with excellent knowledge in front of the students, they may be less attentative due to the far to complex input (, but that's not always the case). Furthermore, such a teacher tends to make harder exams.
But in general, if one has a serious question, a professor is much more likely to give you the right and a satisfying (or complex) response.
If it were to decide on one of these two qualities of a theacher, I would go with the good relation. But for a perfect teacher, what I have never seen yet, it certaintly needs more abilities and also good knowledge.
