I don't agree with this statement.Because I don't see how this could harm these children. At that age they probably don't even understand the advertisment and if they do it is still the parents decision to buy them the product.You could argue that children being influenced at such a young age might be damaging in the future for their self-esteem (because the presenters of the product are models and show the children a beautystandart that they can't reach)  or they start to be very materialistic. But to avoid that children shouldn't watch TV at all because they also see advertisements directed towards adults and that influences them pretty much in the same way, although they may be less intrested in those.The way capitalism works makes it nearly impossible too avoid any kind of advertisment, children in our day and age are going to be confronted with it everywhere not just in television but also on the internet. I feel like they are too young to be on the internet or watch a lot of television but since most parents keep their children quiet by putting them in front of the TV or giving them a laptop to play games on. So it is unavoidable for the children to encounter any kind of advertisment. In the end it is the parents responsibility too judge what their children are allowed to watch and to explain to them how to deal with what they see. 
So advertisement directed toward young children isn't something that should be banned. Because in most cases it's just making them want something and when their parents don't buy it for them they learn a valuable lesson, that they don't get everything they want. It is nearly impossible too keep them from becoming materialistic so it is again up to the parents to teach them to be also happy without all too many things.
