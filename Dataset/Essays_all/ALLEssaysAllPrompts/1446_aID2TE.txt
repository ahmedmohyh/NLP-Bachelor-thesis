I think that both abilitys are equaly important. 
On one hand teachers have to be able to relate to their students. Understanding the needs of their students is nessecary to find suiting exercises that will be interesting to the studens. That will also lead to a more effectfull learling. Besides that the lessons should be as fun as possible and the teachers should spred interest. It´s important to portray the information to the students in a way that they will remember. If the students find the teacher boring that will lead to boring lessons and following up to that the students wont like listenting in the subject and will write bad marks.

On the other hand it´s equaly as important that the teachers know what they are talking about. For exsample when a school hasn´t enough theachers and the art teacher has to give PE lessons the children wont learn as much and also wont respect the teacher as much. Besides that the teachers a have quite a huge responsebility. They have to make sure that every stundent reaches the best marks possible and to give the stundens the best conditions to reach their goals for example degrees or going to university.

To sum up I would say that knowing what you´re teaching is equaly as important as making sure that you are teaching it in the most interesting way possible. The combination of knowlegde and interest will lead to the studens having the best marks and the most enjoyable lessons.
