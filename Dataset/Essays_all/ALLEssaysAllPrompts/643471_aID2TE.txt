Since education is one of the most important things in life, and has to be taught thorougly and correct, it is fundamental for a student that the teacher helps them to gain excellent knowledge of a subject. Especially because the teacher might change after a while, or when going to college or university. Then it is of no help if the teacher has related to you well but wasn't able to explain the subject to a student the right way.

Of course you could argue that it is also important to be able to have social contacts and being able to relate to other people is the right thing to do, but in a school it should be a more professional environment in which you should be focussing mainly on the subjects and not other people. 

Another point is that it might be wrongly understood if a teacher seems more like a friend or a classmate rather than a person of authority. This could lead to students not taking school seriously enough and having delusions that the whole world only consists of friendly people and that there is no competition. Especially when you're working it might be one of the most important things to know that there is always competition and someone who is better, faster or more intelligent than you. With that in mind it is possible to have higher goals and more succes in business life, because you're always trying to improve yourself and to be a better person.
