In the following text I will discuss the question if a teachers's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
All students in one class are really different, some want to learn a certain subject and are really interested, others are bored and have other qualities you will not find at school. Therefore it is really important that a teacher can relate with all of them or at least trys to relate well with all of them because otherwise the ones who are not interested in his subject or do not understand everything will be quickly really annoyed in his lessons and stop learning things at all. 
A teacher defnitely needs the ability to relate well with his students to have a warm atmosphere in his lessons where everybody is able to learn.
But anyways I would not say that this is more important than having excellent knowledge of the subject the teacher teachs because as I said before there are always some students who are really interested in the subject who really want to learn more about it. And when they have to experience that the teacher actually is not really sure about anything neither, that he cannot tell them anything new,they would obviously not be well related to the teacher.
Moreover one go to school to learn, not to be best friends with the teacher. Who would still go there if you got the feeling that they are as stupid/smart as you? Nobody. Then the teacher should have maybe better become a psycholgist.
Because of that I am really convinced that having the ability to relate well with the students and to have excellent knowledge of the subject is really important to be a good teacher.
