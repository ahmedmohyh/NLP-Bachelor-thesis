"Knowledge is power". Everyone is familiar with that phrase, but is knowledge the only thing being necessary? Does a teacher with much knowledge but with no clue of treating his students right has the capacity to teach them? Do they listen to him and learn something if they do not feel good in class? In the following essay I will treat this questions and give arguments and examples. 

In order to teach a class a teacher has to know about the subject he is teaching otherwise nobody would listen to him nor would he be taken serious. As a result the teacher would not be treated respectfully what could end in a catastrophe. 

In contrast to that we should also bear in mind that not only the knowledge is important to gain that sort of attention and respect, additionally there has to be as well a capacity of being able to build relations with the students on a respectful, serious but also friendly basis, so as to reach a suitable atmosphere for learning.

To conclude there is to be said that both is important, knowledge and the ability to relate well with students as nobody has the motivation to listen to somebody who does not treat him as he expects to be  treated. But naturally the knowledge of a teacher is beneficial as well because finally it is his job to teach the pupils and without knowledge this is not really possible. So according to my opinion a teacher has to fulfil both ideas and if he is not capable to do that he does not fit to the role of an teacher.
