I think that it's important that a teacher has a big knowledge. But mostly, a teacher with great knowledge turns out to be cold and unpersonal. They talk like machines and without any feelings. So, they don't relate well to the students. For example at university, I don't think that the teacher has special treatment for every student. He just wants to bring over to you what he knows, and hopes that you can do something with this knowledge. I think that's also important because students would feel treated like children if the teachers weren't talking like they were talking to adult people. But in fact, especially for young students, it's important to be an idol. In primary school, you couldn't have a teacher that treats the children as if they weren't subjects. If they're older, it doesn't matter this much anymore. As soon as a student knows that he's learning for his own life and not for others, he is also capable of learning if he can't relate well with the teacher. Of course, it's still even better if the teacher has the knowledge and you as a student don't feel like being treated like an object, but a subject. But there aren't a lot of teachers that have such great knowledge and still don't feel like something better or have to talk like they do. A student will still feel dumb when he has to ask a question and the teacher doesn't seem to understand why the student doesn't already know. For him as a teacher, it's already clear what you as a student want to know from him. So, if the teacher can't hide this well, it will seem like you are stupid if you didn't get already what he was saying. That's the treatment that can't be avoided if a teacher has great knowledge.
