I disagree. I think that television is not that bad for children even if they are just two years old. Its good to get used to technologie as early as possible,because you will need it anyway in  the future. Some aspect might be bad for children, for example Rtl with its stupid shows. In my childhood television was a big part. When I came home after Kindergarten or some years later from primary school, I always watched Pokemon, One Piece, Naruto or Yu-Gi-Oh. Today i am 18 and I am still watching some of these series. It is also nice to talk with your friends about series they watched and what they liked most. These series and the advertising coming with did not hurt me. I will do my Abitur next year, I never had bigger problems in school and I did not had a bad childhood. Even while I was watching a lot of television, I was spending most of my time outside with friends. We often played what we were watching in Tv, for example Pokemon Trainer or with Yu-Gi-Oh cards Duelist. These experiences made my childhood better than it would have been without television. I also think that it is difficult to keep children away from television if it wouldn´t be allowed for them. 
All in all i would say that television wont hurt our children, if we, as parents, brothers or sisters are taking care what and how much they are watching. I think we all know the sentence " Go outside ans play, the sun is shining."
