Is the relation between teachers and studens more importaned than the excellent knowledge?

In my opinion booth topics are very importaned because if the teacher doesen't has a good relation to his studens they are less motivated and they  wouldend learning that much. As I said the relation is very importand but it's not good when the reltionn goes to far as example when the studens are meeting the teacher at home and eat together. The teacher is a person with must be respected by the studens because he had the pover about the grades. Sudents think they can manipulat the teacher and at this point the teacher must be strickt because his job is it to theach the studens and not to be there best friend. 

As I said in the beginning a reation is importand to motivate the studens but a teacher must know when it goes to far.
