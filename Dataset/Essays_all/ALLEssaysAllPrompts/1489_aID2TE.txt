In the following essay, I respond to the question if "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.".


I will start with the arguments for the teacher with excellent knowledge of the subject.
The first argument is that a teacher who knows more about the subject can answer the questions of the students better.
Maybe he is longer on the school and has because of that more experience with the subject.
If a student has a complicated question, that is really hard to understand he can answer that question.
On top of that the students can learn more, he knows how to make good tasks that prepare the students for their following life.
He can use his knowledge that the teacher got from all the years of studying or teaching, to use it on the students.
So the students get more knowlegde from him.

After listing all the arguments from above I will now come to the arguments for a teacher that has the ability to relate with his students.
There are many arguments for that kind of teacher, so the first one is that the motivation of the students is higher if he relates to them.
Maybe they know when someone that understands them, teaches them a certain subject, their motivation is higher. Another point is that the atmosphere in the
classroom is better if he relates to them. The argument that is for me the most important is that they respect him and have a better connection with the teacher.
When they have a better connection they could learn more or could have more fun in the lessons and that is for me what counts the most.

After hearing both sides, I came to the conclusion that a teacher with a better ability to relate is more important, because the arguments were better.
