Television advertising is an important thing to reach as many people as possible. Every big company uses this type of marketing. But young children are very easy to manipulate, so should it be illegal to direct television advertising toward young children? 

Our society is full of products and consum, we should keep our children safe from this type of consum, which can be bad for them. They should not define themselves over brands of clothes or some new toys. Also kids of poorer people could be bullied in kindergarten because they haven't got the new toy or something like that. Television advertisment shows what everbody should have and what's trend in the moment. This could be the trigger for these children to define themselves over this trends. There is, for example, a new Barbie on the television and thay say, that the cool kids should have this Barbie. This could be a trigger for mean words to kids that don't have this new Barbie. Another opinion could be, that there is nothing negetiv about television advertising. The advertisment is just an information about new products and the parents can decide on their own what to buy. On argument is that those young children aren't interested in toys of other kids. They aren't this mean like older children. 

In my opinion television advertising for young children isn't a really bad thing. We all grew up with those advertisments. It's important that the parents make a decision what to buy and what is good for their child. In addition to that I want to say that a children shouldn't watch this much television in general that the advertisment effects the behaviour of the kid.
