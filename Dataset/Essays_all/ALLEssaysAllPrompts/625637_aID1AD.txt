Some peole say, that telvision ads dirceted to young children could be a problem, because they could be influeced by them and they could drain the money of a poor houshold, but kids at his age normally don't have money. So should those ads still be allowed?
Ads work on the concept ofinfluencing people to buy their products or to believe, that something is good. If such ads are directed to two to five years old children, that are easily influenced by anything, could be dangerous. They could be influenced by companies, so they'd be an easy target for further ads and could be bound to a companie, believing everything the say.
Furthermore, especially referencing to toy ads, they could push their parents to buy them anythig they want, because they've seen itin an ad and that could be damaging for housholds tht don't have that much money. It's similar to the phenomenon of microtransactions: If you give them the permission to do that, by bindin your credit card to your account, they will ypend as much money as they can, since they don't uderstand the conceptof money.
But why giving them everything they want? If you're persistant, you can fend of the demands of your child. They themselves don't have money, so aslon as you're in charge, you can block everything. No one gets everything he wants.
In my opinion, the fact, that the parents are still in charge is the reason, why those ads should still be allowed. It doesn't matter how hard kids get influenced, as long as you don't give them everything they want.
