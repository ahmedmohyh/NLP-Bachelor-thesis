"I hate maths, but I like my teacher very much, so I want to be good at it!" A statement like this is something you hear very often when you ask students about their favorite subject. If the teacher is a nice person, the students are having more will to impress the teacher and get good grades. But is it really just a good relationship to his studens that makes out a good teacher?
First of all, of course has a teacher to know his subject very good to teach it and to answer all upcoming questions. But he can do that on multiple ways. He can just force the students to learn that stuff he tells them to learn, or he can interact with the students and ask them about what and how they want wto learn. In the second case, the students are more likely to have a good reliationship with the teacher. Because of that, they more often get good grades.
But your teacher cannot be your best friend. A little distance between teachers and students is important, because the teachers have to controll the students and give marks, and thats not whats going to hapen when they spend their weekend together.
The best knowglede of a subject doens't helps a teacher, if he's hated from his students. They won't even listen to him, or they would critise all of what his doing or saing. If the relationship between a class and its teacher is bad, the teacher won't give much effort to prepare good lessons. As a result of that, the students will learn less and the reliationship will even get worse.
In conclusion, I would say a good teacher needs both, the ability to relate well and excellente knowglede. Without one of these sides you cannot be a good teacher, but the ability to relate well helps a lot to motivate your students to learn a lot. Better be a likeable teacher with a few lackes in knowglede, than a hated teacher with an excellent knowglede.
