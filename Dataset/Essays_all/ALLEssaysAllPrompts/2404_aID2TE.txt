In the following I will discuss whether it is more important for a teacher to have the ability to relate well with students than excellent knowledge of the subject taught. One argument for having the ability to relate well with students is more important is the fact that teh students are not afraid of sharing their thoughts. In some cases there are teachers who are very strict so many students are afraid of saying something wrong and this leads them for not participating in the lesson. Another argument is that the students like a teacher who has a good relationship to his students. Furthermore they are not afraid of sharing their thoughts. But there are also arguments for the other opinion such as this one: A teacher who is very kind and casual is not taken serious by many students. So this causes students for example to not doing homework and not preparing for lessons. This leads to the fact that many students do not understand the certain subject and gets bad grades. One more argument is that students with a very strict teacher whose relationship to the class is not very good but who has the excellent knowledge of his subject understand the topics in this certain subjects. One reason is that they always do their homework and prepare for the lessons to not make it possible getting a bad grade. The teacher is also able to explain certain topics the students did not understand. 
To summarize in my opinion it is more important to have the excellent knowledge of the subject being thought than having the ability to relate well with students because otherwise the teacher is not taken serious and this causes that the students do not understand many topics.
