A lot of students have problems with their teachers. Everyone knows a teacher who has excellent knowledge of his subject but he cant get the students to understand it. So the upcoming question is: Is the ability of a teacher to relate well with the students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject.

At first you could say that school is not about having a good relationship to your teacher. It is about to learn so you can use your knowledge later in the university or the job. If the teachers dont have excellent knowledge they might explain it wrong or you do not have the same ammount of knowledge as other students which can be devastating later in your life. If you learned something wrong for once, it is hard to learn how it ís right.

On the other hand you could say that if there is a bad relationship between the teacher and the students you might learn nothing. It does not matter if the teacher has excellent knowledge or no knowledge at all , if he cant teach it to the students. Furthermore teachers have in a way a raising role. Teachers also learn how to work with children and teenagers so they should have the ability to relate to them.In an environment where there is a very bad atmosphere it is very hard to learn and many students cant handle the pressure.

 I agree with the statement. Of coure the best thing is , if the teacher has excellent knowledge and can relate well to the students. But in my opinion a good relationship makes learning possible. You can learn more than from a teacher who knows a lot but cant relate.
