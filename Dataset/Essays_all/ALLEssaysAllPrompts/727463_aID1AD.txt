Advertising is a good thing because without it, the companys would make much less profit. You can change a viewers opinion to something by just showing him an advertissement. Of course it depends on how good the advert is, but if it's a well based one, it can influence many peoples mind. But is it okey to influence a young child? 

A child at the age of two to five didn't even had a chance to build up his own opinion to some kind of topics. Also it is way easier to change a babys mind then it is to change the mind of an adult person. Kids can so easily get fascinated by some colourful, with music and nice voices filled adverts. They aren't smart enough to think about the dialogs in adverts and if there is a advert, lets say about a new yoghurt, they want their mothers to buy them this yoghurt if the advert attracts them. They don't know if the product is made with some unhealthy chemical stuff or if the company is bad and the workers have to work way to much for way to less money. 
And this is the point where the companys can make so much profit. A young mother don't want her children to be sad, so if the kid says he wants this yoghurt, the mother is most likely going to buy it. Without the children as a group which you can attack with adverts, the economy would be way smaller.

For companys, kids are a good object for advertising because they are so easy to convince but I personally don't think, that you should be able to distract such a young childrens mind by showing them unreal things. In my opinion you shouldn't be able to show adverts in childrens TV programms. I mean you just have to look at the advert of "Kinder Milchschnitte". The advert has absolutely nothing to do with the product, but they are showing some nice animals and happy people who are eating this cream filled chocolate thing. What kind of world were living in, if we have to attack a young childs mind to make profit of it.
