Advertising directed towards young children 

Last night when I was watching a rerun of a movie on TV I noticed that every 20 minutes of Film I had to fast forward the next fifteen to skip all the commercials. Because of the change of nutrition fastfood companys gain a lot more money and can spend more on TV commercails. Obviously most of the commercials are directed at young children since they are a lot more influencable then grown ups.

You could say that every company have the right to stream their commercial on TV if they pay for it. This leads to a diversity of TV chanels wich are completely free and everone has acces to. Also the TV channels have the possibility to stream more expensive content leading to a happier viewer. 

On the other hand those commercial actualy have an influence on what children spend their money on. If you look at the way people eat you can see that it has become more and more unhealthy and that lot of people, also the young, eat a lot of fastfood. This is caused by all the ads on TV. 
Also the influenced actions of the customer leads to a verry inefficent overproduction of goods wich then leads to foodwast and shortages or the overusage of natural resources.

In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to advertise "bad" products towards young children for they are the new generation wich will one day be a majority. I'd rather have a smart and healthy people desiding over my life. AlsoI think we should go in the complete other direction meaning we should advertise more for a healthy and energy efficient lifestyle.
