what is television today? Tv has a lot of crime or horror series, but of course there is also a lot of television for children. For children it is very important that they do not grow up with only smartphones and i pads and co. For them it is also very important to play outside or with playmobil or lego. For example, a child that plays alot with a smartphone is unhappier than a child that plays with barbies. And that is the same topic as television. A lot of parents let their childrens watching tv for the whole day, like this they do not have to look for the childrens. 
The question is not if watching television is dangerous for children, the question is how much television is okay for a child. Like this, i guess, you can not say that watching tv is dangerous for a child. It is very important that a kid does not watch television in a way too often. 
But watching tv could also have some positive effects. For example, today are there alot of prorams where the children could learn english or something else. The programms are full with child kindly animations and children are very happy when they can watch their favorite tv programm. 
And now to the part that it should not be allowed: How should someone controll , that children are not watching tv, i guess that this is the choice of the parents. There are a lot more things that should not be allowed, for example parents should not be allowed to smoke when their children are arround. 
Like this I am going to say that the state should be concentrated for more imortant toppics than watching television for children.
