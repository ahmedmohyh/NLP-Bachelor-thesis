In todays society a lot of money is invested in education. Therefore the requirements for a teacher, ecspecially on a higher level, is rather high. These requirements are an often controverse issue. This essay will discuss the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".

Having successfully accoplished a degree in a certain subject in university does not mean you are fit for teaching. Abundant knowledge does not make you a teacher but much rather the skill to pass your knowledge on to others. A teacher should know exactly how to interact with students. If the teacher does not understand the students problem, then he will not be able to teach efficiently. He should also be able to motivate the students. Nothing can be taught if you don't know how to teach.

On the other hand the fact that a teacher knows the subject is the fact that makes him a teacher. If you want people to listen to you then you should know what you are talking about. It also outlines the difference between a primary teacher and a highschool teacher: the amount of knowledge in a certain subject. Also, very intelligent student might be bored in the lession if the teacher does not know much more than they do. Nothing can be taught if you don't know what to teach.

In conclusion both factors are essential for professional teaching. Before you start teaching cou need to not only know what you are teaching but you also need to know hot to pass on your knowledge. One could also argue that the requirements varie in different levels of teaching. A primary teacher might not need excellent knowledge of the subject but much rather the skill to relate well with students while in highschool the students are much more indepentent and it is more important for the teacher to know the subject than to relate well with students.
