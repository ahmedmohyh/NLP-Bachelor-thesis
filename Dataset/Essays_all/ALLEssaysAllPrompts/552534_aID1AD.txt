    From the passed century, one of the most used inventions in western societies and elswhere must be the tv. This picture-feeding box has gained a cultural status to the point that almost every household owns at least one. What started mute and with black and white images evolved after a long time into full HD flatscreen television. But something that didn't take an equally long time to settle itself among the standard program were avertisements. The question now is wether or not such ads are appropriatly viewed by the younger generation of tv-watchers.

    Television can turn out to be useful for unexperienced parents, because when such parents have trouble to find a timetable that includes watching the baby seven days a week as well as enjoying their time off and doing their work, they put the child in front of some children show. The child will most likely stay there and the parents can enjoy some time off. Should tv get forbidden for children of the from two to five, this can't be done.
Furthermore, the people behind the ads can too easily make use of these children being still young and naive. They can take a certain toy and make it seem extremely fun for the targeted audience and suddenly the child knows what it wants for christmas, eastern, its birthday and whatever else.
Watching tv in general bad for the development of an every child's brain, that alone could be a reason to forbid tv at all.

    And like that the answer is met. Such a young audience is way too young to be set out to manipulative advertising that wants their parents money. And in my opinion, children that young shouldn't watch tv
