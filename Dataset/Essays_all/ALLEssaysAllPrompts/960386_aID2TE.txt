I agree with this statement for the following reason.

At first it is very important that the chemstry between the students and teacher is good. I think you will learn better if the relation with your teacher is more relaxed. But as a teacher you have to find the right mix. He can not be the type of a friend but also not the type of an boring adult. It is also very important that the teacher does not teach in a boring way, for the students is a various lesson more effective than a stubborn lesson. In this case, the studens would go to school with more motivation, so the students will automatically learn better. But One point of critic could be that the students will not learn anything if the teacher has a leck of knowledge.

At the end you have to take your own meaning about this question, but I still agree that the relation is more important than the knowledge.

P.S= Why we have to do this shit?
