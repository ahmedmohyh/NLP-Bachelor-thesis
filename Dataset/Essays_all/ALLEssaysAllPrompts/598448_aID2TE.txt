We all know how it is to sit in a class with a teacher you may not really like. Maybe you even try to raise your hand as much as you can because you like the subject but you also know in the back of your head that you can try as hard as you can but the teacher just doesn't like you. Very often teachers don't relate well with the students or they relate very well with them but their knowledge of the subject is not the best. What is better for the students?

On one hand I think that the teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important because the students will automatically learn better. They pay more more attention on the lesson when they like the teacher and they learn with more fun. That leads to better learning results. His knowledge of the subject is on the second place then if the students connects learning with something good and fun.

On the other hand the knowledge of the subject being thaught is also a very important part. If they would teach any good knowledge at all then the students wouldn't get better. Especially in today's world it's important to have a very good knowledge and not only to know how to have fun in class. The teacher is in the front and he has to have an excellent knowledge about his subect. That's a must. Then if that's not the case the students may learn something that's not true or that doesn't have evidence.

In conclusion I think that the teacher and the subject are always connected with eachother. One doesn't work without another. In my opinion the teacher should of course have an excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught but he should teach it in a fun way and to relate well with the students. Then it's important to teach students in a good way then they will need it all their life but if they won't have it connected with something good they will probably won't remember it as well as they could in the future.
