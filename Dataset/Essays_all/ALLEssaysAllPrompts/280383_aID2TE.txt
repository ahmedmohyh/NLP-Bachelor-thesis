Teachers

A teacher has to like his subject and he has to teach the children in a way, they understand. It's very important to relate well whit the stundents, because if he's not that friendly and if he doesn't show motivation and happiness, the stundets are going to be annoyed and will not like the subject of this teacher. If a teacher knows everything about his subject but talks to the pupils like they are stupid because they made mistakes, he's not going to be liked. He would give them the feeling that they are not as good as they may be, or that they shouldn't talk in his subject and say there opinion. Also anybody would like to talk to him or say something important. But if the teacher is very friendly, lets the pupils do what they want to, talks to them very good, but is in no way strikt, then the stundents would like him just because he lets them do what they want to and not because of his person, his subject or his talent. So I think a teacher has to be open minded, friendly, he has to listen what the stundets have to say  and to know what he's talking about. If a teacher teaches his subject in another way, like do crazy things and explain it in his way, the stundets will learn better and would like to listen to him beacuse the teacher would show motivation to learn the things he teaches them. There should be a balance between relating well with stundents and his knowledge of his subject. He absolutely needs to know what he is talking about. But he can't forget, that the students know anything about the subject when they start to go to school, and that he then really needs to realte well with them.
