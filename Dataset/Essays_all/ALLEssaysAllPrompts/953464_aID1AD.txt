What's in favor that television advertising should be directed toward young children is that maybe they get more tired and so they sleep better. An other argument is that there are children who wake up better when the televison is on. An important point is that it's also important what they look in the television and how long they look. For example when they look every evening the children tv-show "Sandmännchen" before they go to bed it's not as bad as when they look the whole day "Spongebob" because some tv-shows aren't good for the brain of the little childreens. 
Something that's again the televison advertising is that they maybe do nothing other as sitting infront of the television and so they don't have social contacts which are important for every human in every age. It is also better when they would play outside for example in the garden because to be in the nautre is also extremly healthy for little kids. 
In my point of view it should not be allowed the directed advertising of television toward young children because I think it's not good for their brains and creativity when they have this direct advertising. It's more important that the play outside and with other little kids. Sometimes it's also good for them when the play lonely in their rooms so they can talk with themselves. In my opinions it's bad for them when the sit the whole day infront of a televison listening to unreal figurs. So I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed.
