After five years at the KUS it is clear to me that the teacher's influence on the student's learning process is not to be underestimated. The willingness to do something for a certain subject increaces if the teacher and his pupil get along well and if he is able to make him understand what he wants to say. Every student is individual, which is why there is not one right way of teaching. The right way has to be found by the teacher. For him to be able to do so, he has to relate with his students and understand how his class works. The fact that someone posesses much knowledge does not make him a good teacher.
Another thing that I learned is that not the teacher is responsible for what I do, I am. Also, I do these tasks for myself, not for him. I do not have to like the person who stands in front of the class, I only have to listen to what he says. For me, his knowledge is important, not his personality.

In conclusion, I can neither agree nor disagree with the statement above. In lower grades, it is more important to teach children how to behave in school or to show them different ways of studying. Then, knowledge of a specific subject is not necessary.
The older the students get, the more experienced they are concerning school. They should appreciate the opportunity they are being given in our education system and study voluntairly, so the teacher can focus on actually teaching instead of telling his students how to behave. He can help them by respecting and trying to understand them better. It will make school much easier for is pupils.
