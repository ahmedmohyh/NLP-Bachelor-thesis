Televison advertising directed toward children in the age two to five is a general topip wich should be discuss.
The question is if should not be allowed or if it is okay to confront young children witch this kind of advertisig.

For the first point it is important to say that in general children should not spend time with televison. They should go outside and get their cognitive skills. 
On the one hand it does not care if advertising directed toward young children because they don not have the age to decide what to buy. They need the go from their parents. 
On the other hand they could be influenced for the future. The struggle is that nobody can control what kind of andvertising dirceted to these children. 
Another point against advertising for the little is that they could see something what they could not get. For example because of the money condition of the family. This could be not good for the selfconfidence of the children. It is a big disatvantage to show children in young age how ,,important'' material thinks are.

I think televison advertising for young peole should be not allowed. On reason for that is that in my eyes it is unimportant for the industrie. Things for those kids could directed to the parents maybe. 
Another reason ist that young people do not need any kind of advertising, they are not in the age to know what is important for them. They would just begin to thikk about material things.
