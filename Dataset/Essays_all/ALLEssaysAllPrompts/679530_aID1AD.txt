Essay

The following text is about the question if television adververtising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. With young children is meant children aged two to five.

Television advertisements have different qualities. Some are very deep and you think about it a long time after you have seen the advertisement. And others are not as deep and do not have a specifial meaning. They are just dumb or inappropriate.

Children aged two to five understand only adwertisements with clear meanings and which are easy to understand. They can not think about the advertisements the same way as adults or teenagers can. If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed. 

On the other hand advertisements directed toward children aged two to five with a deeper meaning can be allowed because they would not understand. They would not understand because they can not think about things as adults do and if they understand, deeper meanings mostly have an important lesson to learn.

To sum up it depends on what advertisement. If the advertisement has a deep meaning or does not show any bad things such as violence then it can be directed toward children aged two to five. However, if the advertisement shows things the children should not see it should not be allowed.
