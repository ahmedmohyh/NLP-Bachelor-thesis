Young children are often influenced, especially when they are aged around two to five years, the time where they also pick up the language and begin to speak. So television advertising could be very decisive for children in this age group, leading to a controversial discussion whether or not children in this young should be allowed to watch advertising in television directed towards them, as they could be influenced by bad behavior, the early idea of selling products or in the other hand influenced positively by le

It is known that young childrenn are easily influenced by their family, their friends or even through television. although adverts are crucial for the television business, their goal is not to educate children and there are also plenty of examples, why children shouldn`t be watching adverts, although they are directed towards them, as they may include for example violence or bad behavior in general.

Furthermore the goal of adverts is often to sell something and children definitely shouldn`t be faced with these kinds of adverts at this young age, beacause they are also learning from their environment and selling products shouldn`t be a part of a four year old`s life.

On the other hand you could say that television advertising directed to this age group could also have a positive influence by healping them to learn a language mathematics, although adverts of this kind are very rare. Another positive influence could be teaching them good behavior, but unfortunatly companys aren`t interested in this kind of adverts, wich is why there are hardly any of them.


In the end I think the negativ aspects overweigh heavily, as there are plenty of adverts wich do not help the children to learn something but rather to influence them in a negative way. The danger of children seeing violence or bad behavior should not be put on the line for some companys profit, as children are and will always be the future of this world.
