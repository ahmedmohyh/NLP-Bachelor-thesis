Television advertising directed towards young children isn't an easy thing to discuss about. On one side it may leads to more creativity and ideas. On the other side it's a deangerous thing because children get an unrealistic picture of how everything workes and how poeple are supposed to be or how they are supposed to look like. For example Barbie with her long, blonde hair and small legs. But this is not realistic at all, it depends on the genes and other factors. Another aspect against advertising towards children is that many spots versprechen way more than the product really does, they cheat by putting in sound effect and interesting background as well as computer animation. Children ecpect these things to be exactly as they have seen it  in television, they aren't able to see how the actual product will feel to play with.

In fact, advertising is an easy way to find the perfect gift for christmas or your childs birthday. But do you really want your child to play on a gameboy, feeding some unreal animals, instead of going out, playing with other kids or going to the zoo? I think that this in something very terrible. Kids in this young age need to go outside and play with others, learn from playing '' real life'' and from communication with others. This is the bestway for kids to grow and learn. Beacause ot this, i'm against advertising,
