The major issue that this type of advertising comes up with does mostly relie on the parents and not directly on the children. 
Sure the children watch these ad´s but the parents still buy the products. The adults should be aware of what their kids actually need. The parents may have some problems with their child if it really wants this product, toy or whatever. But the parents are the ones with the power of the decision they make.
A positiv fact that might appear through the advertising on television could be that the adults get information about new products for their children which could actually support or help them. They might get to know about aout the reason because of which their baby is crying. There once was an commercial which dealed with a special kind of illnes about which most people don't know about.
Another point which should be mentioned referring to this statement is the fact that many children with this age don't even watch TV. These advertisement can not actially reach that many viewers. And if it should be the case that kids watch these commercials they propably won't be able to understand the content. They can't hanlde these information. 
In conclusion I don't think that this type of co0mmercials should not be allowed due to the fact that they won't have a major impact and if there should appear some problems referring to whishes the kids have, their parents should hanlde these little "problems".
In addition to that I personally think I'm not able to argue and judge about that statement  because I'm not really influencend and I don't watch TV that often.
