The thesis "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." is very controverse. First of all, it's the teachers job to have an excellent knowledge of his oder her subject. They are supposed to tell their students a lot about it. They studied a long time and have to be good at it, but teachers should also be social and empathetic. It is also their job to teach the students and to relate with them. Sometimes you can have the feeling that a teacher can understand you better than your family. Because students are spending a lot of time with their teachers. Students often want to learn more about something when it is interesting and the teachers can do that. They are responsible for the education of their students and also for their psychological health. Sometimes school is very exciting, but sometimes not. The teachers have to know that and have to try to make the students stay ambitious. That is a lot of work. In my opinion it is alright to know much about a topic, but teachers do not have to know everything. Especially in 10th grade or higher, the teachers learn together with their students. It changes from a monologue to a dialogue. It is way more important to get along with the students and to be a person, who they can trust instead of just teaching them.
