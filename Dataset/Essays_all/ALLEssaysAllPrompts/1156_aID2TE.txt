A teacher is not only a person who teaches his students in maths or physics. He is also a person the students have to trust in. If the class doesn´t like a teacher, they won´t learn much because the don´t see a reason in doing what they are told by a person who is just talking about the content. If students like their teachers very much, they will succeed better grades and they will be happy in class. But nevertheless a teacher should have an excellent knowledge of the subject they want to submit. A teacher who is the best friend of his class and always goes on class trips with them is happy with his students but it doesn´t help anybody if there is a happy class with a happy teacher and nobody knows anything. Another problem could be that a teacher who cares a lot about his students has to keep in mind that the students still have to respect him as the boss. If the teacher puts himself into the roll of a friend, he will see soon that many problems with respect will follow. But you always have to see differences. A teacher in primary school is not only there to improve the education. He is also a key element of the children´s life, so he should not be too strict. There, it would be even good if the teacher would stand for savety and happiness. Later, at the college, teachers won´t behave like parents anymore and that´s good. Children will learn to respect older people this way. But there ist a time in between. This time is not easy. It´s very hard for the teachers to care about the individual standings of the students. 
In my opinion, in this case it is very fine that humans are all different. Some children will need a strong and strict teacher and some will need someone who understands them and their problems. Others will need both. But mostly there are both kinds of teachers at each and every school. Some teachers even will be something in between, so every student can find people he or she likes and who make him or her feel a bit more save at school.
