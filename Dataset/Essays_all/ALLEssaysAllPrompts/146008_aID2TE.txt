Learing is a process. This means theres no way for a student to absorb information in an instant. Well, this might sound obvious to everyone. That's what we're going to school for. That's the reason to have teachers at all. So it is also clear that the teacher need to relate with his students, if he'd just talk and the students couldn't follow his thouhgts, it would have the same result as when the teacher just told them to read a complicatet book, which they wouldn't understand. For example: who would have understood Newton's basic physical rules just from a book, without seeing it, without having a teacher to order his thoughts?
Locially a teacher can't do everything alone. The students have to work togheter with their teacher to learn, that's why the teacher does not need to have good psycollocical skills only but must understand himself with the students.
However, when looking at teacher's ability to teach students, there are more than two factors to consider: the teacher's understanding of the students argumentation, the teacher's support in difficult situations, the test exercieses, which sould be on the same level of difficulty as the ones solved in the lecons; to name only a few.
The knowledge of the subjectbeing taught might be the most important because without suffisticatet knowledge of his topic the teacher won't be able to teach it anyway no matter his relation to his students. And on university level the relation dissapears completely because the qualitiy of the knowledge being in thaught is more important. However it is clear that the  teacher can't just force his students to learn but rather has to make sure they are following his way of thinking. The teacher therefore does have to relate well with the students. However, it must be considered less important than good knowledge of the subject itself, otherwise the students can't understand the entire subject.
