In the following text I will explain if for a teacher it's more important to have excellent knowledge of the subject or a good raltion to the students. 

If a teacher has only a excellent knowledge of the subject but has no relation to the class, no one will like to go to this teachers lessons. The good knowledge is a pro point for this type of teacher because he will make challenging lessons and teach all of the difficult stuff. But if he can't relate well with students, the students may not ask questions if they have some, because he is always reacting badly or if he explains the difficult stuff it could be possible that he can't really explain it in a good way for the students and they won't understand what he means. I think this type of teacher is only a good teacher for students who like the subjekt anyways and understand the difficult things with a bad explainingn or even on their own but students who find the subjekt difficult to undrstand won't learn much there.

Now we take the oposite example, a teacher who has a good relation to the class but his knowledge isn't that good. I think most of the students would like to go to this teachers lessons because he is very nice an likes to be with the students. But the contra point is here that he can't teach the students at a high level because he himself hasn't enought knowlede to explain the subject. So in the end with this type of teacher the proböem is tha t no one will learn much because of the missing knowledge of the teacher, so students will like him but won't learn anyting. 

Now we can see, both of the extreme examples aren't good teachers at all. In my oppinion there is a mix needet betwene the two examples to be a good teacher. He needs to have some knowledge, not the best but enought to explain the students the subject and answer their questions and he needs a good realtion to students so he can cope with them and they like to go to his lessons.
