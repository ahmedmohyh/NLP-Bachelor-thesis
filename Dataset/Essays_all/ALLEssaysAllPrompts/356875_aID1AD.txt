Television and other medias like the internet are a huge theme in our society. There are many pros and contras. But should young children have already contact with it? Is the influence positive or negative?
Our world is full of medias and there can be found things to every theme you ever want. Is this good for young children? It can not be, some people are saying, there is to much that this young eyes shouldn't see. Television should be forbitten to them. Children should play outside and not sit inside in front of the TV.
But computer and things like this will be very important in their life so they should grow up with it to understand it. And in in this young age they won't understand much they see so it isn't important to be afraid that they could be traumatized or something like this. It's a part of our life, why it shouldn't be one of the children life.
The decision if children should watch TV or not should be a thing of the parents, they know what's the best for their children. I don't like to say anymore so I will stay and snore. TV is rubbish, I'd like more to have a fish. They are much more interresting to watch than television with promotion of swatch.
