Often teachers don't realise how big of an impact they make on their students. For example, the teachers feedback often is the only feedback the students get for their work in a certain subject. The teacher grades every test the students takes. The students look up to their teachers, their mentors. And they want to do good in their exams. 
But what if the teacher is unable to relate to the students? If they don't have any empathy for their problems, if they aren't patient enough to give their students the time they need to make progress?
Then the student feels missunderstood and gets frustrated by time. The students may ask themselves: "Why care about the opinion the teacher has about me? Why give my best, if it doesn't get acknowledged?"
On the other hand, the problem can lay with the teacher. Somtimes they are brilliant at the subject the studied. Maybe they are very passionate about it, but not about teaching itself.
And in that case they get frustrated, if the students don't give their best.
It's important to really think about your career choices and to realise, beforehand, that teaching isn't the one thing you want to do for the rest of your career.
Because the best teachers are the relatable ones.
