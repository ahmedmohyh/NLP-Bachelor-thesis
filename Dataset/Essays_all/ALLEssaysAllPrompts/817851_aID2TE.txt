It is important that students get along well with their teachers. That way, they will feel more comfortable, pay better attention and be more motivated during the lesson. If the teacher lecturing the class is not sympathetic, students won't make the effort to work well during his or her lesson and they will be less concentrated. But a "friendship" between a teacher and his students can also lead to an unserious atmosphere in the classroom, meaning that the students might respect the teacher less and just see him as one of their colleagues. This is often the case when the teacher is at a younger age, because he or she just got out of school and therefore remembers quite well what students feel like and so they often have a better ability to interact well with the students. 
However, it is also important that teachers fulfill the expectations they are given and teach the students as accurately as possible. They have to educate the students and prepare them for university and their adult life. This is most likely not possible if they don't have a good knowledge about the subject they are teaching. 
For me it is more difficult to attend classes where I don't like the teacher lecturing but I have to say that sometimes these are the classes that I learn most in. Of course, this is not always the case.
On the other hand, it is more fun to attend a class of a teacher that I like and that I know makes a good and interesting lesson. 
Personally, I think the statement made above is not absolutely correct. In my opinion it is important that the teachers and students have a good relationship and communication with eachother but it is not more important than the teacher's knowledge. I think both of these characteristics have to be balanced to guarantee a comfortable learning atmosphere.
