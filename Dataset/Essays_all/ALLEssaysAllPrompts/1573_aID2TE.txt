It is important that the teacher has a good knowlege of his subject, so that the students get well educated and do not have a lack of intelligence in some topic.
But it is also very important that the students can relate to the teacher. Because of that they will have more fun during a lesson and will also work better because of the fun. Also it is easier for the students to "handle" the teacher and talk to them. 
But there has to be a difference between the students and the teachers. It is not good if the student think that the teacher is their friend. The teacher ist an autority person and you have to respect them especially in school.
If the students do not treat the teachers with respect, some teachers will loose the controll about the class and will not ne able to bring the students to work. This is probably going to happen to teacchers with a low self-confident level.
On the other hand it is good if the stundets have a partner to speak with except his parents amd his friends. When there is a family problem the teachers have often a better knowledge how to handle the situation and have some ideas how to solve the problem. Also they know why the students is quiet in the lessons or it not at school.
 
I peronaly think that it has to be mixture of both. Still the knowledge is the most important part but if the students can relate to the teachers, both will have more fun durimg a lesson. 
And I think that there has to be a difference between the students and the teachers. Even though the teacher's ability to relate with the students is pretty good, they should not be acting like friends but like teacher and student.
But if they trust the teacher the stundets have an perosn to talk to when they have problems and they cannot talk about these with their parents or friend. The teacher can help the students and will understand because the student acts in a ceratin way.
