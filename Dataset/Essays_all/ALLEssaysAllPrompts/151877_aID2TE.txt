The teacher

In our time, with diffrent problems is a good education for the children essentially. The teacher most be to have a good connection the children. They are learning for their future. For this future is the key also the learning in connection with other people essentially. I'm agree with this statement.

A very important point is, that the students learn to work with other people. The teacher symbolice a leader for the students. If this leader don't have a good "relationship" with his partners, the studens don't learn this, because they didn't have an education in connection with other people.

The psychological aspect is an essential point, too. The teacher can make the students a damage in their psycho, because the younger students are very (empfindliche) psycho. The teacher is very strong or angry, then could be that the children don't have a motivation to learn and are shy.

In summary, the teacher most be in a leader position. He leads the students for their future. Shurely most the students help the teacher in their connection as well. But the teacher is in a higher lever as the students. The teacher has more "rights" (hier ist gemeint: mehr Verantwortung in der Schule). 

For a good education is the knowledge very important, too. But in the young years is the relationship between the students and the teachers more important.
