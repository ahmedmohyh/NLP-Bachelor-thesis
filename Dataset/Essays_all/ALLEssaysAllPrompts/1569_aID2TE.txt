In the following essay, I will talk about the statement: ,,It is more important that the teacher relate well with students or is the excellent knowledge of a subject more important?"

One argument for a well relate between pupils and teacher is, that the school and the subjects in school become more important for students when they like the teacher and have a good relationship to his or her.
Because of that it can happen, that the students lose the respect for the teacher and nehmen the school nicht mehr ernst. When the teacher is not acrease enough to the pupils,the students wont be conzentrated and this is an argument against a good raltionship between steudents and teacher.
A second argument for is, that the students wont be have so much fear, when they know that they can ask the teacher what they want and the teacher answer friendly to the students.

At the end I would say it is more important that the teacher relate well with students, because then nobody feels sad and have fear to go to school. It can happen that the pressure is not so big for the students and that is a positive reason i think. Also the fun to learn can grow, and this is a point, which should be better for pupils in the future.
