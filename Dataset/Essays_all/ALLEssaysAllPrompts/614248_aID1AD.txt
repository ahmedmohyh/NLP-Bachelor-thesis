The aim of this essay is to clear the contovers statement "television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". Then nowadays more and more young children "growing up in front of a TV". So for many people leads this to problems and they want to disallowed it for young children.

On the one hand, the children are very interessted by the TV, so they can stay hours in front of the TV and watch children series. That makes it very easy for parents and they can do other important work or clean the house. 

But on the other hand, children should go outside and have fun with other children or play with the parents instead of sitting inside in front of TV. If children only sit inside in front of the TV, they will lose there social conactions to other people and there social skils will disappear. 

In my opinion, this ban for young children is a good idea, because children should play with other children instead of watching TV. But how should this ban work? How can we contoll it?
