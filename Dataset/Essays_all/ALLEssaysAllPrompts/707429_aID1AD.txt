I think, children generally shouldn't watch television a lot. Perhaps sometimes in the evening half an hour, but surely not more. When they watch too much television, they see definitely advertising, which they shoudn't see. But if they watch just rarely television, they won't have any disadvantage by the advertising. In contrast, when they see this and the parents can tell them, why does it exist, they can learn something. When the children know about the use of the advertising, they know in the future, that they can't take all this things like it was said. But this is the parent's work.

For example, when a child see a toy on television, he will have it for any reason. But the child has to learn, that he doesn't need all this stuff. First, the child will cry and shout and so on. But when it receive the toy, he thinks that the next time, he will be offered an other toy when he want that. On the other side, when the parents doesn't give him the toy and explain why, the child won't agree, but he know for the next time, that crying doesn't helps. For the parents is the second way much more complicated, they have to dispute with their child (and this can be really annoying) but a few years later, they have less problems with their child because he know that he doesn't receive all he wants.
So to resume, I would say, that advertising - especially television advertising - isn't bad when the young children just watch them rarely. But when they see this too much, it can
