We start with the question: should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed or not? 
First of all, we have to know, that children are also humans with the same rights as an adult or as an educated person. So they can be manipulated by the advertising in the same way as an older person. For my opinion, it's allowed to create and show children-advertisings to children with the age two to five. you have to see, that only the kids whoms parents gave the okay can watch TV. In all of the cases is the mother or the father responsable for his child and especially what it is watching. And when somebody watch television there is every time advertising. If qou do not want your child confranted with this things, you have to forbit it or controll it or you have to speach with your children abaout the problems who can folloy - this is the only way of prevention.

But we also have to focus on the psycic of de child. Television can be good, interessting and educating but you can also watch horrible things wich injure you mentally... this goes to the question if it is usefull to watch television in general. Apearently, kids withe tte age of two are really (anfällig) in brutal stories, dangerous situations or even pictures with a world wich is not perfect. because they do not know it better. So it is very important, that you as a parent take the responsability and talk to your child, to his behaviour to other children and help him to understand the differents between the virt   the okonly the boys and girls
