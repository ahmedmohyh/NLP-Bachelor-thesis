Nowadays there are many parents who do not care how long and which kind of TV channels their children watch. This could have big consequences for their education, but do the parents have to forbid to watch TV to their children?To my mind, there are two points of view to this question. 

First, many parents let their children watch TV to entertain them so they are not bored. For me this is not bad because I learned a couple of facts by watching TV. Furthermore, the producer from the kids channels also had the aim that childrem can learn from its series. In addition, our generation is very influenced by the internet or the TV, so it is good that the children learn early what TV really is and what sort of channels are there and they also able to learn the language better. 

To the opposite many parents do not let their children watch TV and they somtimes do not even have one. They only let their children play outside or to play with toys. They have the argument that there is only "rubbish" in the TV which make their children stupid. I am not saying that this is not true but it is to abstract. 

To sum up, I totally understand both sides because both of them are right. All in all all is a question of how much and what kind of TV channel it is. In my opinion it is not good to let the children watch TV everytime but the solution is not to just forbid it because lots of children like to watch TV and for example in the morning when everyone is still sleeping and when it is cold outside the children are glad to watch TV so they can pass a little time and it is also easier for the parents so they are able to sleep longer.
