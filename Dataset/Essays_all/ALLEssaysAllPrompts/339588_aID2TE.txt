Teachers are often rumoured to have a little knowledge or to be not able to explain things in the right way. Another negative thought is that they cannot handle with their students. So what is more important and what should the perfect teacher have?

Firstly, it is essentiell that the young people are in favour of their teacher. If you disliked a teacher you may loose the interest even though you liked the topic. 
Secondly, a good relation between a student and his teacher is convenient to talk or to change information and questions and to make conversations with a more experinced. It helps the student to feel better and to follow the class.
Furthermore, students want to learn and widen their horizons in school and with a nice teacher they could reach a new interest in the subjects they may have disliked before.

On the other hand, the huge knowledge of a teacher should stay in the middle as well. Without an excellent knowledge the teacher could relate well with students but both cannot profit.
However, the ability to have an answer to every question is a thing that a teacher must have which is why they also have to study before being a teacher. 
Lastly, you may also get in favour of the subject if there is a teacher in front who helps you to understand all the things you have ever wanted to.

On the one hand, the ability to relate well with students helps to keep or get in favour of the subject but on the other hand there is no use of school if the teacher did not understand his own subject being taught. In my opinion, it does not really matter if the teacher cannot handle with the young people but without an excellent knoweledge there is no sense learning or improving your skills. At the end of the day the student must be ambitious and make an effort to widen his horizon because the teacher can only help, the student has to do all the work on his own.
