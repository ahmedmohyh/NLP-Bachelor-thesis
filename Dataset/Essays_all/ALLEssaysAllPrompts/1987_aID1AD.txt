The following Essay is about "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be alowed, do you agree or disagree with this statement?"
First young children should not sit in front of the TV. Instead of watching advertisements which tries to explain the world for these kids, they should play outside and explore it for themselfes. Flowers and trees are also outside and not only in the Television. you can see Planes in the sky and not only in the TV where they are speaking. This is blurring of their realitiy.What advertisements show should be real and known by the children.
Then why is there advertising for children aged two to five? Programs like Kika wo are made for children, don't show advertisements. So what are these channels kids are watching? And even if Kika shows advertising,then at a time, normals kids should sleep.
On the other hand advertising, espacially advertising made for young children gives inspiration and more fantasy. They get to know about things they'll never found in nature. They get to know how something works and it's easer to understand it.
Advertising directed toward children is concepted for them. So you won't find words they don't know or things they don't need to see. It's all made for they're age, so it's no problem for kids to watch it. For example Lego Duplo only works with sounds children know and with easy forms in their joy (like a Train is just a role with three balls at each side to let it "drive"). So it's just fun for them to watch advertisiment because they just don't realize it.
Finally I think it's right than children should play outside instead of watching Television but if they do it's also okay if they see advertisements as long as they are concepted for them. I think that they really just don't realize it because it is like the series which are shown.
It's okay for them if planes can speak, that only fits in they view of life, in their fantasy.
