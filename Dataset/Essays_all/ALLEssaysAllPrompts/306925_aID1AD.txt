Today many children are sitting in front of the TV most of their freetime. Even in the morning before the parents are awake. In this essay I explain the arguments why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

First of all if children watch TV they mostly like to watch cartoons which aren't very intelligent and from which they not really can learn something. But most parents let their children watch TV, so they can do other things, for example working, or they can sleep longer and the children are happy and quiet and dont't distract them.
An other reason is, that when children watch to much TV they become less creative. In Tv the stories are given and you only have to watch and listen. This children loose the ability to imagine a own story. Children which play with toys do that every time thay play.
Lastly you can also say that children which watch to much TV don't know what to do in their freetime if they can't watch TV. They are addicted of watching TV. Most of this children aren't sportif and have problems with their body. Watching Tv is not very healthy.
