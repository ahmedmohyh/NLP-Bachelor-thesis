What's the utopic idea of a good teacher? - Friendly? - Contact with the students? - Inspired? - Teaching the main themes? 
Well, let's have a look on a teacher who gots a good ability to relate well with studends. 
1st he gots a fantastic climate in his class. He's more a friend for students, but is this a good thing? To be more like a friend for stundens would be a big problem because you have lost your authority towards your students. They could think, they could do anything they want. So but if you can handle this, you could be a motivation for them. You understand them and you can fit the teaching material to their mood.
But is this what we want? A "psychotic" for the students? We want a teacher who teach them the teaching material that's given.
A teacher who had an exellent knowledge of the subject he tought had more opinions to reach the stundents for the thema. He could make some themes more interesting and teaches the theme aswell. But what's with the aspects of life? A school is more than just a building with people inside. Thoose people have feeling and other problems. So can a teacher help them with just no good relation to them? Can he build up some empathie? I don't think so. I think there's a loss of humanity. 
Authority against humanity.
It's just an easy question if you just have a look at the main aspects: authority against humanity. Everyone would decide humanity, but you have to look at all. So i think both teachers have some good and negative aspects, but if you can combine them, that's the best way. A teacher with understoodness but with authority and good knowledge for the tought subject would be perfect. He knows when it's time for fun and when he have to show his authority to control the students.
