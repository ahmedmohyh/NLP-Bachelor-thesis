Today many teachers try to relate well with theire students and think it´s not important to have got an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But is that really important? Because the students want to learn something for theire future, won´t they?
On the one hand many young teachers try to be a friend for theire students. They think the distance to them isn´t as big as to the older teachers so they can built up a better relationship. For example they make many jokes and try to take care of the interests of theire students. Most students like that and like to come to this lessons, even if they do not learn so much.
That leads me come to my next argument because on the other hand the teachers aren´t paid for having fun with theire students. They have to teach, so the kids learn something for life or they need for the University. 
Also when you always have got fun in school you don´t concentrate and learn anything. For example the teacher make many joks the students don´t learn or they aren´t in school because the teacher always make excursions to built up a good relationship, you don´t learn anything too.
In my opinion it´s important, that teachers taught theire subject in a good way even if it isn´t funny at all time. They don´t have to be friends. It´s important, that they try to be friendly, but they have to teach all theire knowledge, so the students learn all they need in theire future. That means that a good relationship isn´t as much important as good lesson.
