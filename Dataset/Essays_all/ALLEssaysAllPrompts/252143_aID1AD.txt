A lot of children like to look TV but is this good for young children or should that not be allowed?

One argument that is should not be allowed is that the parents can not controll what the children watch and that on the TV ist has also a lot of serie that are not good for children. 

But on the other side we can say that it has very good and helpful series and that children also can learn something. For example a serie in french helps learnig french. I know a lot of children how learned a lamguage with series on the television.

But the problem is that when children start looking television they can not stop with them. They are to young to unterstand that a person can not look the whole day TV and that this isn't good for a person.

A third problem is that on the televsion it has a lot of publicity and that the children are perfect victims for that.

So my opinion is that televison is cool for children and that they can also learn something but that it is very important to controll the children durant their televison advertising.
