"Advertising"

It is a fact that nowadays television advertising is a normal thing. Everyone who watches television gets in touch with it. But should it be allowed to be directed toward young children?

Television advertsing is a popular way to catch our attention. Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too. This is a good thing for the people who advertise because if children see something they like they tell their parents and the parents buy it. Furthermore, they should get in touch with advertisments because if they want to watch television they have to watch the advertisings too. 

On the other hand it is not good if children see an advertisment for things like chocolate or any other kind of sweets because they would want to buy it although it is not healthy for them. Advertisments often do not tell the truth, for example Kinder Schokolade, they say their chocolate is healthy because it conatins milk and nuts. We know that it is not true but young children believe what the advertisments tell them and get fooled. 

In conclusion I think that it should be allowed because although it has many negative aspects, it is a normal thing. They will get confrontated with it anyways so why not at the age of two? They can learn to not believe in everything the advertising promises and the earlier they learn it, the better. I think that if they watch television they should also watch the advertising because when they grow up there will be television advertising directed to them too.
