My answer to the question if I agree with the statement "televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a "no". 
Although I see, that it depends on the object of advertising, I don't think that general advertisement should be directed toward children. Because children are children, they are young, and some things they can't and they won't ever understand. For example would they immediately be sad or disappointed if their parents told them they couldn't afford that automatic play car that are always shown in between their favourite cartoon disney show. Children can't think rationally enough yet to see beyond their own desires. 
In my opinion it is wrong to manipulate children into wanting things ,they may not even be able to afford, just for making good money. I see that there is theoretically speaking nothing wrong with directing advertisement toward children, because in the adult world it happens all the time, because that is how economics work, but in reality children aren't in that state of thinking yet. Their only thought in their head will be: "Oh I want that cool robot Figure" and not: "Oh I wonder if mum could afford that. I'm going to wait patiently for christmas season and ask if I may get it." Children that want something but can't get it are a true piece of work. It's hard for me to picture a happy, all flowers and rainbows family if the child every week asks for a new cool toy because it is apperently the 'Thing to get' when you're a five year old. Many children often cry for something they want, let it be chocolate, let it be a toy, but I believe that - if advertised directly to the children themselves - it would be much worse. Espacially if those things are sold as 'unique' and of 'brand', which not would make them more expensive but the kids would also grow up to only want brandy things anymore.
