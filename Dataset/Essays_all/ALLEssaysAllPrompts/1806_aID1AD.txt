During the last couple of years television advertising became very popular and today nobody could imagine watching television without seeing any advertising. Television advertising is made of many different categories, for example: food, health, fashion and toys. Especially toy advertising towards young children is a much discussed topic.
In the following text I will state my opinion on the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

First of all I think young children between age two and five shouldn't watch too much television in general. They should rather play with real toys or play outside. I think that this is way better for their general development and health. I agree that sometimes parents need to take a break and it is an easy way to put your child in front of a television and if in this case it's just about few hours a week it's totally fine for me. In my opinion parents always should have on mind that their child gets manipulated by advertising just as themselves and I think most of them already have experienced that the child requests much more toys after watching television ads, especially in christmas time. I think this isn't just the case in age two to five but also as an adult or teenager. For example when you see the new iPhone generation in the commercial break and think about your old phone, which hasn't got enough space for all the applications you desire, you want to buy a new mobile phone even if it's not the new iPhone but just some newer better one. But you have to have in mind that as an adult you should be able to resist and as a child, which is verey easy to influence, you haven't really got a chance to resist all the toy advertising.

In conclusion my opinion is that you shouldn't allow any advertising on television channels for children, because it's not fair to influence them while they can't really decide that they don't want to see the advertising.
