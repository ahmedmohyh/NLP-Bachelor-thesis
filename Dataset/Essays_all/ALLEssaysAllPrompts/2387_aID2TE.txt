In the following statement I will talk about the importance of exact knowledge of the subject being taught in contrast to the teacher's ability to relate well with the students. 

On one hand if a teacher doesn't have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, then the students won't be educated well enough. They will lack knowledge in this specific subject and may not understand the conections of the subject right. In the next test the student could get a worse mark because of his lack of knowledge. A wise teacher can give his wiseness to the students and make them into well-educated young people with a good education.

On the other hand if the teacher can't relate well with the students he may not understand how students think and act. A teacher with the ability to relate with students has got in most cases a better relation with his students. When students rely on their teachers, they can be more interested in learning something from him. Also the class may be more interesting because the teacher knows what students are interested in and how to motivate them the best. 

In my opinion the ability to relate to students is more helpful to teach the students than the excellent knowledge of the subject, because a lesson with a wise but strict teacher is more unmotivating than a lesson with a teacher who relates well with the students. A teacher who can't relate well with the students often gives them more homework to do. With so much homework the students don't have enough freetime to follow their dreams and do what they want to. This can cause great preasure and lead to depressions within the class.
