When young children watch a lot of Televiosion is that not good. Children, who watched the whole day Televioson are not happy. Many children, who watch a lot of Television, have not learned to play. For example they didn't learned to play with "lego" or playmobil". It is very important that children learn how to play, because that is good for the live and the phantasy of the children. 

When children watch Television at the morning, before they go to school or in the "kindergaten", then I think it is very big problem of the parents, because they should know, that it is not good for the children, when they watch a lot of Television.

But many people with children are working a lot and they don't have the time to look at their children. And then it is very praktik for the parents when they can say, "yes my child you child you can watch Television". And then the parents don't have to look for their children, so they don't have any work with their children.

I think it is very important, that parents take time for their children. 
When I was a child it was very important for me, that I can play with my legos or playmobil. I have learned a lot when I have played. 
Me and my famelie, we don't have a television at home. My mom and dad think, taht it is better for me and my brothers, when we don't watch a lot of television. We watch also a little bit of Television, but on our computer. But not a lot. 

I think chilrdren should watch a little bit of Television, but not the whole time. They should also have enough time to play with their legos or playmobil or cars
