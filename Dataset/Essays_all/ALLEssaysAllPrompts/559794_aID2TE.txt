First of all I think if the teacher's ability to relate with students isn't well it isn't useful to know all of the subject. It is more important that the combination between both factors is the right. So if the teacher has a excellent knowledge of the subject but his ability to relate is bad the students have no profit. But if you are a teacher your knowledge of the subjects you taught must be at a well niveau because if it is not you may should sit behinde the books. So that you can give the students the informations they need about a subject that they understand all about the subject and also get a well knowledge.

In my point of view both is important. There are two sides of this statement and in my opinion it is more important that the teacher's ability to relate with students is well because only then the students can profit of knowledge of the teacher. Because of my opinion I agree with the statemant that "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."
