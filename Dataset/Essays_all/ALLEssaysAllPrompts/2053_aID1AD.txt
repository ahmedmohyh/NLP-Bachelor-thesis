Having not watched television in a long time, I just recently turned on the TV and sat down for a while.
But I was not able to concentrate on the program, as I saw a television advertisement, which was obviously directed towards young children.
A question came to my mind: 
Should television advertisement directed towards young children be forbidden?

First of all, the biggest benefit of advertising thing for children aged two to five is that is helps these young people to develop new interests, as they probably do not know everything they can do (and/or play with).
For example, if a child has never even heard of Lego, it may get to know it by watching advertisements created for chilfren of its age.
Secondly, parents often do not know what their child wants, or wants to try.
They could find out what their child finds interesting by letting it watch said advertisements.
However,such young children do not really understand advertising and its way of influencing your opinion, so they are very easy to catch by an advertisement that was created with these children in mind.
Additionally,  advertising directed towards children aged two to five probably influences the way that these undeveloped minds develop, it makes them gettin gto know the world of consum very early in their lifes, which is not good.
On top of that, many children are easy to convince to change their opinion towards something, as their minds are not as far developed as those of older people.
This can be seen by parents who want their child to do a certian action, and all they have to do to get the child to doing this,is telling it that this action is fun, good, etc.
Older people may be more resistant to advertising, but children of young ages are not as much.

Concluding I can say that advertisements in general are okay and fun to watch, but advertisements directed towards children aged two to five should be forbidden or restricted by law, as it influences them too much.
