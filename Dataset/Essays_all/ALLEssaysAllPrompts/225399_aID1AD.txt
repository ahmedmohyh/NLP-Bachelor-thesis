Should television advertising not be allowed toward children aged two to five?

Well, it really depends. Children in this age usally watch tv channels that are specificaly made for children in this age. For sure these channels also have advertising breaks. But this are advertising spots made for children. So these children don't get offended in a sexual or violent way by the tv-spots.
If we look at the statement in this way, do I personally think, that tv advertising doesn't have a negative affect on young children. Because of the tv advertising the have a little bit of a contrast between the series and programms tey watch. Tey lear something about new products and learn to love and want new toys. After they have seen the tv spots, the go to theyr parents and ask the if the get the new products. They usually to the and in this way the tv spots have an positive affect on the economic of they country. 

But what arguments support the statement? I personaly think that tv isn't that good for children gernealy. Children in this age shouldn't be sitting on the couch in the livingroom and wath tv. They should be outside on the playground. They should be explorimg the world and playing with theyr friends. But this argument i against tv in general.

In fact you can say that tv advertising is good for the world and bad for the children. I think it's important that the world economic works, because it's this what makes our children growing up in a good area. And that's why i say television advertising is good for our children and shoul be allowed.
