In today's television programms there is a lot of advertisment of different products and for different ages. A lot of people are watching television and all of them have favourite channels. There are hundreds of different channels and every person can decide which one she or he wants to watch, there are channels with less advertising and some with more. 

There are channels for two to five year old children, but even there advertisment is shown. Little children do not understand how advertisment affects them, they just watch it and then, if it is something they do not already have, they want it. 
That is exactly, what the companies look for, they want smaller children persuading their parents to buy it.
If companies want children to have it, then the advertisment cannot be brutal or with violence, because then, the kids would be frightened and they would not want it anymore. That is why they make it funny, happy and colourful, so it is not bad for children.

In my opinion it is not good, that the companies use smaller kids as clients, i would prefer it, if they would direct it direcly to adults, because they can decide, wether it is useful for them or not and if they want to buy it. Smaller children do not have the thinking to decide if it is good or bad and it is always the parent, who buys the toys or the other things their kids want.
