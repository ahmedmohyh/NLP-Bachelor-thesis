There is so much on tv's. Today the publicity is exploding even tough in the tv. There's lot of manipulation which is made threw television advertising. From time to time the publicity for children is getting much more. I think every child is watching tv and is also allowed to do this. So the television producers take their chance and manipulate the young children which are impressed by this publicity. They believe in their true as well. 
On one site there is television advertising for children which is useful and full of interesting informations. These informations could support the childhood and could take a good influence on their behaviour. 
On the other site there is a lot of bullshit in tv. So the thing is that the young children believes instantly in these curious opinions. That's the main problem! When a young child sees something dangerous in tv then the most of them want to try it. These things should be forbidden. The influence which these things can take is so big. I remember when I was five. I wasn't allowed to watch normal tv advertising or series. I just watched things for children. I think that could be a good solution because on these chanels there is no television advertising or manipulation or whatever...
I think it's difficult to forbid the tv-producers to make publicity for the children. Even when it's forbidden they would do it as long as they could. They don't care about what's forbidden and what's actually not. But we can prohibit that there's no advertisement on the channels for children.
