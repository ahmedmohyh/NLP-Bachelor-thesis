I agree with this statement.I think it is more important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with the students than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
It is also necessery for the student to have the basic knowledge,that he can use later. But if the teacher cannot communicate with the pupils of the his class or cannot make an interesting lesson, than the students will not learn and will be bored.
If the lesson is "exciting" , they will enjoy it und learn more fast. 
A deeper knowledge of the subject is important too ,because they need it in exams, in the life and in learning other subjects, so they can build up every small part of the knowledge and facts.
For instance, i had a really bad und useless physikteacher. He was really boring,nobody learned anything,the pupils talked the whole time of the lesson,that was really loud.We did not get any homework,that is why i did not understand why sould i sit down at home, open the book und write some extra work. In my mothercountry there is no oral grade,it is important what you have in your mind und what you know und write on the paper (test).
But there are also some special teachers, they were born to be tachers.I really loved history and i really enjoyed all of the lessons. He could relate well to his students und gave an excellent knowledge of the subject. We may had to learn three hours a day only for this subject but i could say that i know what happened on 08.20.1000 in Hungary or 05.26.1675 in Russia and i could say how they influenced the history, other countries and our days.
