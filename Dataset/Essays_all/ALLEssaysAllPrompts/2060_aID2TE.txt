The follwing essay is about the question, if  a good realtionship from teacher to student is more important then knowledge of the subject he teach them.
First of all you have say, that of corse a great realtionship between a teacher and his students is helpfull. 
For example the teacher know his students well enough personly, to say if he his a good student or not. Many teachers only see students like numbers, each student have a number for his exam, for his a level and so on, but only a view see the person behind this number and for sure this is really important.
Also many students see there teacher as bad person, they don´t know their teacher personly neither. So, if a teacher is able the relate well with students,  it is a very good thing for their working clima.

But is that even more important then the tought knowledge of the subject?

Just imagine, a teacher has a great realtionship with his students, they talk many lesson about their personl problems, their last weekend and their family and so on. All in this class have very nice years in scool, untill the a levels. The teacher was a nice person, but not a good teacher, the whole class have to repit the whole years because the coudn´t make the a levels. The teacher had not prepar them enough.
So you can say, that a good teacher, makes him a good teacher, if he explain well and not if he is personly a good person. This is the sence of scool, the teach the students and not more.

All and all in my opinion you have to find a good comprise between a ,,good person teacher´´ and a ,,only good explainer´´ teacher.
That ments, that of corse the focus have to be on explaing and teaching, but also know the students well and not seeing them just like nummbers.
