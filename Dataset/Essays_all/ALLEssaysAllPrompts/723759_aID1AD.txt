Television toward young Children
Some people think the new technology is bad for all. Computers, mobile phones and the television too. Young children where aged two to five sit the whole day in front of the TV and do nothing. That can`t be good. What if there were a rule that television advertising directed torward young people should not be allowed?

This is a good idea because the children will go out and play with their friends. But on the other side the parenst have to watch all the time what his/her child is doing. So they haven`t a break, they overwhelmed. Unfortunatly the TV is not good for the eyes. If they are looking TV since they`re young children they will wear glasses. On the minus side it isn`t every day sunny. On a raining day they can`t play outside. They will be bored all day. But no, the will play with their games. with lego, barbie or playmobil. They will do something. In fact when they look television they learn something. And we all know young children learn fast.

Finally I think this rule is a bad idea. The parents can make the rules. They`re able to say how long his\her child can look TV. The young children can do both, look TV and play outside.
