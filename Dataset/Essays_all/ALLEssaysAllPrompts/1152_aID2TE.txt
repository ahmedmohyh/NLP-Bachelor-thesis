There are different types of teachers all over the world, but is a good realtion with the teacher more important than education?
On the one hand, it might seem as if students don't want to have a good relation to their teachers, because it would be uncool, but the atmosphere is better for learning and more children will want to go to school voluntarily as they feel comfortable going there.
On the other hand, students need to be educated to be well prepared for their future life, as not few will want to go to college after school and others start working. A good education is the key to success, nobody employes a non-educated person. So teachers should be well informed to give their knowledge on to the next generations.
Thinking further in this aspect, the country they live in will not always have the needed amount of workers, as every year hundreds of people take their advantage of rent, so students have to be brought up to the point where they can replace the people in rent to keep their country financially stable and also bringing in rent taxes for the future.
But to ashief this, students need to go to school and want to educate themselves, for which teachers, who relate good with their students are a better motivation for the students.
All in all I think that having good realtionship with teachers is an advantage, as it keeps students motivated, but just because of that, the aspect of a good education and with that, a teachers excellent knowledge of their subject, should not be left aside. Combining both will make a good package.
