There's several different aspects about advertising directed towards young aged children. One good aspect for example is that children get to know what's out there on the market to buy for them. 
But on the other hand there's also the bad aspects for expamle there's no reason to show advertising to young aged children because they don't have any money themselves to buy it. And therefore the parents of the kids will end up buying something with their money for their kids because advertising made the kids thinking they need that specific thing even though they don't even need it. 
I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising directed towards young children on TV. I think it is not neccessary to show such advertising to the yound kids because we already live in a materialistic world and there's no need for trying to get young kids to wanting something they don't even need. The kids these days will be manipulated by advertising soon enough.
