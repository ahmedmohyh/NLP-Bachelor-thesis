In todays universities teachers are not trained knowledge, but skills to communicate with them. 
In my opinion a teacher that can relate to students,hinders their learning at school most of the time. 
There are some  positve aspects to a teacher that can relate to students. He can better understand their situation and react according to that. Furthermore, he presumably gets more trust from the students and so they listen more to him and learn about their subject like that.But the negatives far outweigh the positives of this. 
Without a good knowledge of their subject the teacher could give wrong information to his students, which hinders the learning procces immensly .Also, Teachers without enough knowledge of their subject can´t explain the topics properly and can´t react to students asking question. This could easily lead to students loosing interest in their subject. Another problem is that teachers, relating to  students also leads to a loss of respects for their teacher, 
And without respect its hard for a teacher to control a classroom. 
In my experience this holds true.  Most of the teachers today try to form a relationship with their studetns, which leads to them not  being able to teach in that time. Furthermore, they bore some people with these attempts, who loose interest in these subjects completely ,  who have to teach themselfes instead.  But this arguments are not true for every age group.Children aged 12 or less need a teacher who relate to them more then older teenagers, because there the subjects in school get more complicated and teenagers are not as dependent on their teachers anymore. Because of this reasing I came to the conlcusion that knowledge is more important for a teacher then anything else.
