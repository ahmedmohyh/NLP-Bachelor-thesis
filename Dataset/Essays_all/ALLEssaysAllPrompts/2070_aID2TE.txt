The following statement is on the one hand true and on the other hand not really. School isn´t for all stundents easy and they have maybe alot of problems to learn in a classclima. In this case its important that the teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But generally the teacher must know alles about the subject being taught to teach the students that what he have to learn. If the teacher hasn´t knowledge it´s difficult to teach and make his job, but the students learn nothing and so the students have to work alot at home and learn from himself . But that isn´t the reason to go to school. If the teacher hasn´t a excellent knowledge but a good, it´s also good. On the other point the students who have from the beginning no fun to go to school, lose their courage, don´t go to school anymore and in the past they have problems in the exams and not so good possibilities for the future. By good teaching it´s also really important, that the teacher´s ability is good to relate well with students. For learning you need a free head und want to learn in a clear climate school. School is not good every time and also for teacher sometimes it´s hard to work with complicated students. In this case the students can´t learn very good, if they have only a good learning student without heart.
For a good schoolwork an lots of year to the time you work, it´s really important, that a teacher have both points, which are written in the following statement. With these two points it´s easier to like school without problemes and have a better perspective. It´s sometimes good as teacher to make something ,which is fun for the students and dont only go to school to teach the topic in the subject very fast. If this is a case , more and more students don´t want go to school anymore. Maybe only a litlle joke a day is something good . 
A teacher need both and with only one of that it can´t work in the right way
