In a society where nearly everybody can take part of media advertising ,concerning young children, is an issue.
So it should be considered if it should be forbidden to advertise directly to young children.

On the one hand it is very easy to influence children in that age. They have no experience in life and are not steady in their mind. So if they are manipulated in young age it can have big influence on their later life and on their behavior of buying.Later in their life it could influence the way how the children as grown up spend their money,which is of course the background why big companies advertise. They could get in financial problems.

On the other children in that age have no oppurtunity to buy things. So if they want something they have to ask their parents and in that case it would not matter if the kids are manipulated or not. You could also consider that companies have to advertise in television and also directly to children. And adult would never buy an toy because he wants it. He does that because the children want to have a specific thing. So if a company wants to sell something they have to make the children see it. Since most children watch television it is the only oppurtunity.
Furthermore children in that age should not watch so much television at all. It is already an issue that big c0mpanies have a reason to make such advertising.

All in all i think it should be allowed to direct advertisements toward children. I think in few cases it can influence the behavior of children when they grow up. But since children can not buy something by themselves in that age it is not that big of a problem. And what is really striking is that companies have to sell their goods so advertisement also have to be made.
