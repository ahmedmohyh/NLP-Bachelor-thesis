I love beeing in school and learn new and interessting subjects. Why do I like going to school ?
The one thing is that Im very interessed in almost everything and I allways want to improve my skills. Its very important for me to know whats going on in the world and to understand why. In school you get in touch with this things and you get taught and get taught how you can save your knowledge in your cognitiv thinking part in the brain. 
The second thing why I like going to school is that I usually have a really good time with my friends and also with the teachers. Its more fun during the lessons when the master of this topic is happy and optimistic, then bothsides have a positiv feeling and learn more things. 
But I had a personal experience with a teacher. I will draw you a picture of that situation. My first school day, I was 15 years old and very exiting and nervous meeting the new students and teachers. Then I sat in this english lesson and the teacher came in. From the first time she gave me this feeling that she doesn't really like me but I said to myself: I think too much and in the next lesson it will be better maybe she just had a bad morning.
Now I started with the third grade of high school and she still gives me the same feeling as on the first day I met her. At the begining I was totally optimistic and I was so interessted in this topic, in all of this topics but she took my motivation and is frustrating me all the time so now english got one of my badest subjects in school. 
A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important then excellent knowledge of the subject. Thats one of the truest sentences I've ever read. As a teacher you have to give youre students the feeling that they are good in what they are doing and that they can reach their goals if they want to.
