As manking grows and technology advances, we face more and more conflicts. Today we live in a world of media. It is all around us and sometimes to difficult to find refuge from.Television advertisingt is just another form of media. This media is directed towards different groups of people, even small children. But should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed? 
Advertisement directed towards young children should be allowed, because we live in a society, a state, where we the people of our country have the freedom to say and think anything we want to. An advertisement is nothing but an extension of a thought or a statement. One could think of it as a message. And one should be able to screen anything on television or send any kind of message that one wants to.
Yet this statement is meant to manipulate and change the thoughts of the viewer on a subconscious basis. These targeted viewers aren't able to judge or censore this commercial in any way.They are driven to ask their parents to buy them this product, because they do not know how to react to it yet. Censoring and obsorbing media is in my oppinion an abillity that has to be learned in time. People who are older and more mature are able to do so and are less affected by this.With the freedom of speech comes great responsibility, which can not be abused. So I believe televsion advertising directed towards small children should be forbidden.
