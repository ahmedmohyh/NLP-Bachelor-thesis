The question is, if it is more important for a teacher to have a good relationship to the pupil or to have an excellent knowledge. Of couse it is important that the teacher knows his subject well otherwise the students get the wrong information and a worse education than others. When a teacher is good structured based on well studied facts it is easier for the pupil to follow the lesson. That leads to better results. It is also importend that the students are prepared for univerity which would not work if the teacher has no excellent knowledge.

But on the other hand is the atmosphere in class a lot better when the teacher relates well with the students. When the atmosphere is good the students like to go to school and the motivation in the lesson is higher which leads to better results. Another point is that when the pupil like their teacher it is a lot easier for them to aks questions or to say that they did not untderstad something. A teacher is a person who you can also ask for advice in personal questions and who can help you to deal with problems at school or maybe at home. But the students would just ask somebody for advice who they like and trust.
 
That is why it is so important that a teacher does more than just giving the students the information. A teacher can be a rulemodel and that is something they need to know. It is importend how they relate to their class because that influences the motivaton. You could have the best knowledge and be the worst teacher anyway because you need the students to listen to you. That is the most difficult and important job of a teacher. These are the reasons why i think that a good relationship is definitive more important than an excellent knowledge.
