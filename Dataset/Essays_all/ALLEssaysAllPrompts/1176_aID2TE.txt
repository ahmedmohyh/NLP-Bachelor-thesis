In a part I agree with the statement, because if the students feel good during the lessons they learn more and it is easier for them to ask the teacher, because they are not afraid. Sometimes the problem is that the teacher is to strong and that the students are so afraid that they don`t ask if they didn`t understand things. So in this case it is more important that  the teacher`s ability is  to relat well with students than the excellent knowlede of the subject.

But on the other hand if the teachers knowledge is not so excellent and the students have some diffulct question, it is possible that the teacher can not answer them.  And it is embaresing for the teacher and maybe the students lost a little bit of the respect for their theacher.

When the knowedge of the subject being taught is too excellent the teacher forget that the students are only students and no professors or something like this. So his lessons are to difficult to understand that the students have no opportunity to get good grates. They must work very hard at home to understand only few things the teacher thaught. 

Otherwise I think it is easier for a teacher to grate the students if the knowledge of his subject is excellent. Because in this case he know excactly what the student must know and what the student must not know. 

My one opinion is that a mixture of both of them would be the best. The teacher needs a good knowledge of all the important things for his subject but also a good relationship with her students.
