the following text is about the benefits of a teacher's ability to relate good with the students. For people in general, not only students, it's important to have a good connection with other's. If someone likes the person in front of her/ him they are more willing to listen. There is definetely a connection between a good relation and a good learning enviorement. A teacher can has endless knowledge but if he/she doesn't find a connection to the students they won't like the lessons and won't be willing to learn anything. Different studies show that higher the qulification of the teacher is the less is the degree of esteem when you ask the students. So the teachers ability to fascinate the students for the subject is more important than anything else. of course the teachers need some knowledge but the knowledge is definetely not the most important quality. for high qualified teachers the stuff often seems to be self-explanatory which makes it a lot harder for the students.
