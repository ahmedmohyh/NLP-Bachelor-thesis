In the current time, it is normal if there is much advertising on TV, and there are also not many rules about how the companies have to do their advertisings. The television advertising should not be allowed to be directed toward young children because influencing them with advertising is not ethical acceptable. In the following, I will show my point of view.
Firstly I will show the positive side of allowing television advertising directed toward young children. The most important point is that the companies want to influence young people for getting profit of them or their parents. This is the selling-tactic of the most companies of the world, but especially showing kids television advertising is much more effective than showing the same television advertising older people. Secondly, it is also well for the economics. The more younger people watching television advertising and are buying the products, the more jobs are getting created. And these jobs prevent the people of getting poor. 
The positive side of television advertising is strong, but the arguements are not ethical acceptable. 
However, there are many negative arguements. First, television advertising directed toward young children should not be supported by any estate, because it is in any way incorrect that companies are allowed to influence younger people. Furthermore, it is not ethical acceptable that a company influence young children because every person should have the freedom to think how they want. Another point could be the cost for beeing allowed to watch television. Espacially in the estates like Germany or in Swizerland they could get troumendous.
At the end, television advertising directed toward young people should not be allowed because the negative side is much heavier than the positiv side.
