Most parents advocate the fact that their children often watch TV and sometimes also see advertising. Is it possible that a strange television advertising can have bad influence on children aged two to five and have to be forbidden? Or is this only a claim made by some advertising-haters?

Nowadays, in every house or flat exists at least one electronical item on wich you can watch tv. Therefore it's difficult to bring up children without to let them see television. But for childre it is very important for their futur life to play outside, experience the world and have fun.

Research shown, that almost all parents don't know that very young chrildren shouldn`t watch too much television because of the advertisings. Therefore, informational days for parents with young children would help a lot. They would also learn, that there exist some channels with no advertising wich are especially made for children. 

Advertising is mostly made in tv programmes who aren't made for children such as blockbusters or other films. In my opinion it depends on how the parents educate their children.
