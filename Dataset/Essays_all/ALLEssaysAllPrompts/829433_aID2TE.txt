There are so many good and bad teachers on schools in Switzerland. But why are some of them better or worse? Scientists are saying that the relationship with the students and the knowledge of the teachers are  factors for a good education. Now the question is: Is a teachers ability to relate well with students more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

I think a ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught. A student won't learn anything if there isn't a good relationship with the teacher. An excellent knowledge isn't enough to be good teacher.You have to know how to treat your students. But at least a good teacher needs a big knowledge and a ability to relate well with students. For example: A teacher who has the ability to relate well with students can't teach them alot without any knowledge. Another example: You can have the biggest knownledge on world, it will be useless, if the relationship with the students isn't strong enough.They simply won't listen. 

Finally in my opinion a good teacher needs both: A big knownledge and a ability to relate well with students.
