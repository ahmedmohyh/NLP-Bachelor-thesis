Essay: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. 

Children love to watch their favourite tv-show on television but the advertising between the shows is in most cases unsuitble and just disturbing. 

Firstly, many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see. They have no idea for what are the producs for and so the advertising makes no sense.
Secondly, children often believe what an andult said without doubt. So they also believe what the advertising says and that is often overacted and unrealistic. On the other hand, young children will not know the topic of every single spot after they switch off the television. 
Furthermore, advertising is made for manitpulate people that they buy a product. Children are easier to influence and they believe every nonsens which the advertising says. So it is dangerous to give the children wrong knowledge or destroy childrens imagination. 

In conclusion, I have to agree with the statement. But in my opinion such young children should not watch television at all. It is just unhealthy and children tv-shows are mostly trash. But at least it should e prohibited that there is advertising on children channels.
