Nowadays young children spend a lot of time watching television. After each show they are confrontated with television advertising.Can young children already understand television advertising? Should television advertising toward young children not be allowed?

Television advertising toward young children should be allowed because advertisings show them new things children have not seen in their lives before. Children can get informations about the existence of new toys for instance. 

Although there are some advantages of advertising for young children there are many negative aspects as well. Children aged two to five can not understand the advertising yet. Young children get manipulated because advertisings present a wrong picture of the amount of things they need during their daily life. If children get confrontated with an advertising for example about the newest toy they really want to have this toy as well. They beg their parents to buy this specific toy although their play rooms are already full of stuff to play with. On top advertisings often do not present suitable toys for kids. There are a lot of advertisings of new play stations and video games. It could be possible that children do not want to go outside and play anymore because the advertisings show them new interesting electronical toys which can have a negative influence on their health if they just sit inside the house and spend hours in front of the screen.

In my opinion television advertising toward children should be allowed with strict rules. I would not allow advertisings which show electronical items because I think young children should not spend too much time in front of screens.
