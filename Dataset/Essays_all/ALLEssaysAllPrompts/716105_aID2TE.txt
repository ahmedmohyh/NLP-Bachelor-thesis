Everybody has already felt like beeing in the wrong subject, because its to difficult and the teacher doesn't mind it how students feel about. But how would it look like, if the teacher would try to relate well with students? Is this ability more important than a excellent knowledge of the subject?

In my opinion its a theacher's job to find the middle of beeing an excellent teacher and to understand the students. Normally students like lessons,where the teacher trys to understand them and try to make the lessons more intresting.
Automaticly students will learn more in the lessons and they would make there homework. 

But if there is the knowledge missing, the lessons would get boring and the teacher would fail it. Of cours it is the job of a teacher to know more than just the things who were asking because they studied this subject for a long time. But from the view of a techer its more difficult, because they wont to succes in there subject by having good marks in a class, but this would get complicated if there is missing knowledge and motivation.

I think it isn't that important for a theacher to get on that well with students, beacuasue the have to know themselfes if they wont to learn something or not. But otherways, the lessons would get difficult because the students would miss to make the homework. They would just pass the lessons and that wouldn't be the mind of it.
