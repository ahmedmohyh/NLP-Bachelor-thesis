I agree with this statement. But today`s young children are even without the television confrontated with advertising and other things which children some years ago haven`t ever seen. Maybe in some years it will be normal that a five year old boy is using a handy and can explain his father how to use his computer. When I`m travelling i can often see how the parents give their children electronic devices like an Ipad. Like this the children are occupied and the parents don`t have to look after their kid. The children are already used to see advertising everywhere so I don`t think that with a televsion advertising they would have some damage. When the children are watching tv and an advertisement appears where for example the newest thing to play is introduced the children want it. Like this the parents get more and more in an obligation to buy their kid everything. My personal problem is that the children nowadays play with their phone and not with their friends anymore. All the social interactions while playing a game with other kids aren`t there anymore. I think later they willl have problems to get in contact with other people because it`s the time of 3-7 years where children have no problems to play with any child. I cant`figure out any advantage if the television advertising is directed toward young children. It`s normal that every company wants his own advertisement in the tv beacause it`s a good maybe the best platform to find new people buying their product. And it`s the right of every company to show an advertisement but if it`s for children up to five it`s not okay.
