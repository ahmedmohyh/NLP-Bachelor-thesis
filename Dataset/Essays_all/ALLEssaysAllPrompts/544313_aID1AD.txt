Today every management needs to do some advertising to make their porducts more attractive and to make your that the product is wellknown. For exempale if adverts are shown on televison, adults just skip the channel. But young children are fascinated by the products and they want to have one. 
Exempale given: In an advert a new toy is shown, and because it is so colourful the young child wants one of these and starts screaming until it gets one. Some parents just buy it without thinking about it. 
But isn't that selfish and disresponsible of the producer and the whole management to manipulate the kids? Should advertising on the television, which is directed toward young children even be allowed?

In one way it's scary that adults and kids can be manipulated that easily.I mean adults and teenagers are old enough to decide if they want to buy it or not. But children are to young to understand and they can't help themselves. So you could say that they are vicitms. 
Producer use children for expanding their products. So i think that it shouldn't be allowed. They can direct toward adults and older children. 

But on the other hand, there isn't just advertising on the television. There are screens and other devices which show adverts. So just by not allowing advertising on television directed the young children the thing isn't done. The kids wan't be much safer.

To end up you can say that producer are looking forward to expand their products and to make profit. I think that it it would be a step forward when televison advertising toward young children were forbidden. But it wan't change much. There are adverts everywhere and the producers will find an other way to get the attention of the children.
