I often hear from my friends how cool it is to call the teacher by the forename and how deep they can talk to them about other thematics. Some teachers pass their breaks or lunches with their students because they are so close. 

As a teacher you mind having a good athmosphere during the lessons. With being nice and a good link you find a connection to the students. You do not have to be the strict teacher as we know it in sitcoms or how we have it here in Wattwil. When you link to the students it is not only easier for the students, it is also nicer for the teacher. The students are more open and try to help the teacher. We are all humans and everybody needs help sometimes. 

The other thing is that you may do not have the absolute knowledge of the subject. Of course, not every student likes going to school and they even more like it when the lesson is not about the subject all the time. But as a teacher you have the task to learn them something in detail. Only when you know everything about a subject you reach the professor level.

It is also possible that you lose authority when you relate too well with the students. May be they stop doing the homework because they are not kind of afraid that there would be consequences. As a teacher you also have to be strict in a way. 

In my conclusion, it is important to relate well with students but not too well. The students still have to see authority in you as a teacher. You have to be strict but also easy. You should show them that there are limits when you overstep them it will not be easy for you. Of couse, you can laugh with the students and still talk about other things instead of the subject but there is a time table which yiu have to get through.
