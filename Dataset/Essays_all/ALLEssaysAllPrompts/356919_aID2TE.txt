enlgish essay

In the following essay i ll discuss the statement if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowlege of the subject being taught. 
The pros for this statement are that evry student feels more motivated to learn if the teacher is able to relate well with the class. It s not only more fun in the lessons, u also get more intested in the subject that's being taught. But the teacher is not only there to teach the students about the subjct the school wants him to, he also is there to teach the students something about life. He should be teaching his students about his own experiances at school, what worked and what helped him passing the school most. And thats why it is realy important that a teachers is able to relate well with his students.

On the other side a teacher have to have a really good knowledge about his subject. If students that are intrested ask him something, he should be able to respond correctly. Not evry teacher have to teach his students about life, sometimes it is bether if he is really good in his subject and can answer all the questions the students ask him, This is specificly true whereever you don't have to work with other people and more with numbers, like in math or physik. Here it is most important that the teacher has a really good knowledge about the subject being taught.

In my opinion it really comes down to which subject is being thaught. In frech or history i prefer a teacher that is able to relate well with the students, in match and physiks i prefer a teacher that has a really good knowledge about the subject being tought. But eather ways a good teacher needs both. To teach his knowledge that the students have to know and want to know so that the  students understand evrything, a teacher needs the ability to relate well with his students.
