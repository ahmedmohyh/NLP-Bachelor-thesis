We all have that one teacher you really like as a person but he just doesn't know a lot about his subject. He tells some jokes and funny storys but you never learn anything about the subject. But what is more important? Getting on well with your students or knowing every little detail about your subject you are teaching?

First of all it is very important as a teacher to know what you are talking about, so you can answer the questions your students are asking. If not, they will immediately recognize it and maybe think that you are not the smartest one in the room. The students won't listen to you and won't learn anything.  If you know everything possible about your subject, you are well prepared for your classes and you can explain absolutely everything to your students. They will like it and find it interesting. 
But not always! If you are not very nice as a teacher and you dont get on well with the students, you have no chance to teach them something because they just shut down and won't listen to you. On the other hand, if you relate too well with your students, they won't take anything serious that comes out of your mouth. You shouldn't play around too much with them.

As a conclusion, I think a good amount of both, knowledge and a good relationship with your students, is very important to be a successful teacher. You need to be kind and funny but you have to be good in what you are teaching. You can't just talk about something you don't even understand and think your students will understand and like you. Because if you go to school, you don't want to waste your time there learning nothing. The secret is to be the perfect mix out of nice and strict and to know your subject.
