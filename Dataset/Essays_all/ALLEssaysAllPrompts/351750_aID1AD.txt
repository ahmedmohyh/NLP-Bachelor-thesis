Television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed.

The television is a media, who is very common and important in our life.
Between Films or Tv-shows is mostly a break for the advertisement.
That's Marketing in our modern world. And that's an important part of the business of many organisations and labels.
But is it really important to refer television advertising direct toward children?

First of all there are labels which refers especially to young children. For instance Barbie, Hot wheels, Playdooh and also sweets who are made for children. So you can say that the children are the most important group for this label. But who thinks that the children buy all the stuff on their own? The parents have the money and the parents buy the stuff for their children.
So why do the labels don't make the advertisement for the parents. For example:"Happy children and happy parent", as a slogan.

For a second point, isn't it morallly wrong to refer the advertisement direct toward young children?
They should play, they shout learn and they should grow up. But they should not be the victims of the desire which is always hidden in every advertisement.
 
At least the children should not be part of that society which thinks just at profit and the money they made. They should not be consumers. They should first learn what is really important in their life befor they think about other stuff.

As a conclusion I think that television advertising direct toward children should not be allowed, because children are too young to think about all these things and they should basically learn, play and have fun!
