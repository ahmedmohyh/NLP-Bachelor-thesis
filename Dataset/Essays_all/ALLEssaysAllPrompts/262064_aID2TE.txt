We all have teachers.We have been taught of someone since we were children. And we all had teachers we like more than others. But does it say anything about their ability to teach, if we like them or not.

First of all it's the case that we are just more willing to go to school, if there in front of us stands a person we like. And if we are more motivatet for learning and paying attention it makes us better in school. So it's important that you have a good relationship with your teacher.

Second if you have personal problems in school you're not afraid to ask the teacher for help. And that's the only way to become better.

Untill now we saw that it's important to have ah good relationship with your teacher, but is it really more important than having excellent knowledge of the subject.

This question is really complicated to answer.But as everyone knows you can't just put a nice guy in front of a class and hope he could help his pupils in maths just because he has a good relationship with them. So you also have to know what you are talking about.

Now imagine that the the theme at school it's too complicated for you,and it doesn't matter how much effort you take, you don't get anywhere. Isn't itthen usable to have a teacher who understands that theme so well that he could try to explain you that in the simplest words? Yes it is.

As you see it's important to have a good relationship with your teacher but technically it's just more important that the teacher knows what he's talkig about.
