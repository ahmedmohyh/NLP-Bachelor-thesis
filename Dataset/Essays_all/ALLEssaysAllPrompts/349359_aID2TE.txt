The teachers ability to relate well with his students is the main point to get liked by the students, and this i can say from personal experience. This is at the same time the hardest part to master. The best teachers at the school are those who are liked of the students. The teacher can only give his knowledge to his students if there are interested and willing to take the information from his teacher, this stands close in relation with the ability of the teacher to relate with his students. Knowledge in case of a teacher has to be on a certain level simply to get a teacher. The actual knowledge that a teacher has is way bigger than what he has to teach, so the stuff he teaches is very basic and easy for him and he most likely he can give that information in a understandble way. Of course it is important how much knowledge the teacher brings to his subject. For example the teacher's subject is geographie. Then it is realy apealing if he has good knowledge and can give some extra information, but to give this information he has to relate good with his students because if he can't he would just run through the stuff he has to teach and wouldn't try to give the students a better sight on this specific subject.
The job of a teacher is in his own a very social job. The whole day you communicate with other people and students, and try to give your knowledge further. When you now can't relate to your student it is impossible to get them intrested or willing to take that information for them selves. So as a final conclusion i'd say that the ability to relate with the students is the core part of being a good teacher. The excellent knowledge is of course also a nice tweak to bring with you as a teacher but is put in the backround by the social part.
