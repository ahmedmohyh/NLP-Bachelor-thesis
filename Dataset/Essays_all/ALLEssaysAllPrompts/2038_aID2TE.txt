In the following "A teacher ability to relate well with students is more important than excellence knowledge of the subject being taught" will be discussed. For many students the atmosphere in school is very important. If you relate well with your teacher you will do your work in the subject well. Every person will think like this, because we all like a good working atmosphere. If you can compare the ability to relate well with students with the ability to have excellent konwledge of the subject everyone will be happy. In my school are teachers with whom I relate well. The atmosphere is good, and everyone of my class is happy when we have this subject. A controversal is, that we also have teachers who have got excellent knowledge of their subject but the dont want to relate well with students. As a student these teachers arent sympatic to you. We as the students like to learn something in the subjects, but when we dont relate well wiht the teachers everyone isnt happy if we have to learn only what the teacher wants. 
My opinion is, that the ability to relate well with students is very important, but it should be compared with a good knowledge of the subject by the teacher. In a nice atmosphere we all learn better, and for teachers it is also nice if they can relate well with the students they teach, the do not only have to teach their subject in a way that no one wants to learn something. They can compare their knowledge with their kindness to teach the students with their subject in the best way.
