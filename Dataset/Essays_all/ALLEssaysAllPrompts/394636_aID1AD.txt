These days much of the television advertising is directed towards young children and many think it is wrong but is it really that bad that it shouldn`t be allowed.

First, I would say that advertising directed towards young children is a bad thing because children are very easy to convince to do something or to buy a certain thing and the companies who are making this television advertising use that to sell there stuff.

In the other hand if a child want something it doesn`t mean that it would get it automatically because the parent won`t buy something or do something just because there children have told them.

But even tho the parents won`t buy or do it it doesn`t mean that they wouldn`t buy or do something if the children want it really bad.

At the end I would say that even young children aren`t that stupid to buy or want anything what they see in the television.

To sum up I think that telivision advertising should be allowed because it is not that worse at all it doesn`t harm young children and I also think in some cases it could be very handy.
