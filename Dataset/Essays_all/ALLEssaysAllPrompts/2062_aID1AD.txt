I think the problem insn't the advertising it's the television in general. Kids aged two to five aren't interested in advertising. They do not think about stuff like that. They more are looking at stuff of their age. Kids are looking channels in wich mostly no advertising ist showed (talking of german television channles). So they are only interested in their series and make mind of their topic. I also think that most of the advertising kids aren't able to understand. They would ask thier parents or just forget stuff like that. So advertising shouldnt be a big problem for kids of a younger age. Maybe it become a problem because they just look at it and think that everything that is said must be true and correct. They do not question it or something like that. They aren't able to make their own mind about if the advertising is good or bad like adults or older person do. But, as I said, thats not the problem of the advertising, it's the problem of the television in general. If kids aged two to five were not allowed to use the television by their parents, the chance that they look at advertising that could have a bad influence on them is not given. 
So my opionion is that the problem isin't the adverising it's more the television in general. Also series are advertising but just in an other way. So if parents wouldn't allow young children to use the television allone this problem could be stopped. They would not get the chance to look at something that could be bad for them because the parents would stop that and without their parents they couldn't use the television.
