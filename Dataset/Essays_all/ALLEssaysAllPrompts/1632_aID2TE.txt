I think that being great at interacting with students is the most common thing teachers are bad at. If a teacher 
can´t cooperate well enough with his students he is not able to give them the exact information he´s trying to give. Furthermore - no one has "excellent knowledge" in a subject there are always a few things even a teacher doesn´t know. And anyways what do I do with a complicated biological structure or explanation if I don´t understand it and will never ever refer to it again? On the other hand if a teacher can communicate well and easy with his students he may or may not explain things which are difficult in an easier way, because he knows what his students can effort. As well as spreading information on an easier way a teacher with a good bond with his students can also understand them better on a personal level. A teacher is still someone who a student should trust, he doesn´t want anything bad at all. He is responsible for his students for both parts : Teaching them and taking care of them. So in general I would say, that a teacher´s ability to relate well with the students is more important than having great knowledge about his own subject. If he knows the things which are important for the theme or subject it´s enough. He shouldn´t bother them with anymore extra stuff that´s less important for their education.
