There are several requirements to teach a good lesson. Two of them are knowledge and the ability to relate well with students. This leads to the question: Is the ability to relate well with students more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

It is very important that the teacher has a good knowledge of the subject, because otherwise he cannot answer questions that occur during the lessons. Also he should have a little bit more knowledge than he needs to give lessons, because he then knows what's important and what's not. Also it is important that he understands when he has to update his worksheets, for example when there is a new discovery in biology. 
On the other hand the students won't learn anything, when the teacher cannot relate well with the students. If the students are unhappy with their teacher, then they will loose their motivation and will learn less. Also the teacher should have the ability to see when there is a problem and he can't react, if the students don't talk to him, beacuse they hate him. Also the teacher is more informed about social problems in class that could lead to problems that cause the students to learn less. 

I think it is important that the teacher can relate well with his students, because otherwise the students will loose their motivation. In the end they will learn much more, even if the knowledge of the teacher is not excellent. So I think a teacher with a good knowledge and the ability to relate well with students is better than a teacher that has no ability to relate well but has a better knowledge. So I finally would agree with the statement.
