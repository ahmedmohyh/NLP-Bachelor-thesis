I think the best way would be to have a nice mix. Any child should be able to watch a few minuets during the day his or her favorite series. It's not just that series make dumb, there are a lot that actually really help children to learn something. The child during the age of two to five has the most cappacity of learning something. So if a child watches a show like "Dora", where they are learning words from english why should that be bad? 
There acutally have to be some boundries, because if you let your child watch too much television it will become addicted and will forget about his/her social live. That would probably be the worst, because every kid should still play more outside with his/her friends than be at home and watch television. The other point is, if you let your child watch as much as it wants to and then just say it should immidiatly stop, the child will become angry and begin even maybe to cry. Thats why there should be some boundries. Maybe one houre per day is enough.
One other thing is that if you don't let your child watch any show it will not be able to talk with friends at school about any show and so it could become bullied by the other chidren.
