In that case I would disagree with this statement. In my opinion the ability of a teacher to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge of the subject which is taught are both important to study students in a good way.
In my point of view it is useless for the students to have a well relation with the teacher, if the teacher isn't able to teach necessary content which you have to learn in this subject. In that same way it is useless for the students if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject but isn't able to teach the students, so that they understand the content and have fun with learning in this subject.
For example a teacher nowadays could work with modern methods like Laptops and showing things with a beamer to catch the students interest and create a well relation with the students. 

In conclusion I wouldn't say that a teachers ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because both are important to study the students in a good way.
