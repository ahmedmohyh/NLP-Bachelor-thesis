In my opinion the relationship between a student and his teacher is as important as the knowledge of the subject being taught. I agree that it's easier for a student to follow the lesson when he likes the teacher or when the teacher makes fun. But school shouldn't be a place to go for having a good time. It's important to learn something helpful for our further career. The intention of coming to school shouldn't be having fun. If it is, school is probabley the wrong place for you. It's always great for a student to know the teacher itself is interested in the subject and his knowlegde is excellent. Students like to ask questions about everything even if it's not exactely the topic the teacher was talking about. The students appreciate when the teacher is able to answer the question anyway and there's no embarassing moment for the teacher. When a student knows that a teacher is sure and knows what he's telling you, there is automatically more respect. The danger of having a good and funny time during the lesson is, that sometimes the teachers aren't serious enough and the students don't obey them anymore. 

To resume my views: I think it needs a good balance between learning and fun. I agree it is much easier to go to school when you like the teacher and you know when there is a problem you can count on him. But personally I think the big knowledge of a teacher is more important because he can teach you basical (and other) things for your life.
