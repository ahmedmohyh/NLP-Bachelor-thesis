There are many ways of advertising. You can make a television spot, a radio spot or you can hand out papers. How you advertise depends on what you want to advertise. If you want people to go to the casino, you wount advertise directly towards children. So this is an important point. 
If you have a doll or a new lego-house you want to sell, you have to advertise directly towards the children. You have to use a lot of colours and make your product lool like it's the best thing on earth. You are able to influent young children very easily. They don't think so much about money and how usefull something is, as adults. When they like something, they want to have it. Even if in a few months there will be a new, better doll. 
Television advertising is one of the easiest ways. People who watch televison have to look at the spots during the breaks. Especially when it's a nice spot, they will start to think about your product. And as this is your goal, it's the perfect way. 
It's not easy to advertise something directly to children. They don't often listen to the radio and they don't go the the city. So televison advertising is one of the only ways you can make them wanting your product. 
But is it okay to abuse the fact that these children are so easy to influent? Everyone is influentable. The advertisin-industry works with influenting the people. They know what you have to do, to influent a person. It's their job. 
Television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed, because of the fact, that there aren't any other ways to advertise a product. Even if it's moraly incorrect.
