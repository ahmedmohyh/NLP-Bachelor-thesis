Today its normaly when children play with Ipods, Ipads, Iphones or if they look tv all day. In live its better and in school also: Children should go out and play with other children in nature. Hike and seek is much bether for the growing up of children then looking tv. If the children are always looking tv then they dont learn anything countable for their later life. Shortly said, they get worse. Playing games like Monopoly or Memory on a Ipad is not the same like playing the real game with real figures. Television adverstising is not forbidden, it shouldnt be forbidden, but it should give a maximum of time where children can use it. The time should be limited because to much of television advertising is bad for children. A pro is that children can learn from it. But its not the same learning process like when you learn it by doing. Also the contact with other children could get lost, because you dont actually need other children to have fun with a television. You dont need stron books.
I think television advertising should be allowed for young children(aged two to five)but it should be limited because with books you learn better and quicker.
