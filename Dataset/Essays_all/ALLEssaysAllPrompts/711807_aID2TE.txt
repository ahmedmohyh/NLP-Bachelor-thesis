In my opinion I would agree with the following statement because for me it is very important to relate well with the teachers. If you relate better with the teachers you also will learn faster because this makes more fun like that. But in the controverse, a teacher also should taught the students something. Because it could happen that you relate well with your teacher but your teacher couldnt teach anything. In this case the fact that you relate well with your teacher do not is important. But in normal cases a normal teacher should be able to teach and learn you something. In this cases you could learn faster and better if you relate well with your teacher. But I think that first of all it is important that a teacher could teach good. After this you may could learn faster if you relate good with the teacher. And also for a teacher it is important to relate well with the students because for him it is normal to teach, but if he relate well with the students it also make more fun for him to teach this class or this students. If he relate bad with his students for example because they do not do the homeworks or things like that. Then the teacher gets angry or a bad mood. So the following sentence of this is that he has not the motivation to teach them well because they made him for example a bad mood. 
So the conclusion for me is that a normal teacher should be able to teach well and then it is important to relate well with the students.
