The teachers where often the persons who get the stress with the parents. The students don`t learn so much or the only get bad marks where often things they get to hear. But how must a teacher be ? This quote say that ` A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.`
A teacher who is the best friend for the students get often a better feeling for the students. He know what the need and how he can push them to a person with nice marks. But what is when the teacher don`t know all of the subjekt maybe he teach wrong things or don`t teach important things. A teacher who know all of the subjekt and love the theme can be more intusatic. The students know when the teacher know all of the subjekt and hear the informations better. But he must du it with the wright technik. When he knew all but give the students only a paper with a long text the students get bored of the lessons. He must du it with a nice form. Maybe he could do it with a presantion or he only tell a story intusatic. The students know after the lessons more information as the would read some pages in the book.
When you summerize all facts is a teacher a person who must look on many things. He have to be a nice person to the students, use the right technik and need an excellent knowledge of the subjekt. So I don`t agree to all of the statmant I would say it is important to have a good conection to the students but you also need an excellent knowledge of the subjekt. So it isn`t easy to be the perfekt teacher.
