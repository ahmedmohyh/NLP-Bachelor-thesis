In the following essay, we are going to discuss, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subjcet being taught. I am going to mention a few positive and negative points about this topic, otherwise you can write a whole book about this topic.

A teacher's goal is obviously to teach the students a certain subject in school. An excellent knowledge might help you a lot, to explain things easier but also it is just as important to have a good relationship with the class, so they actually listen to the lecturer. In order to create a great relationship with the students, the teacher should have fun during the class with the students: make jokes with them, make the class for them exciting and so and so forth. 

Also, there are cases, where students go through a tough time in their life during school. It could be anything, from having problems with the family, to getting bullied in school for no reason at all. As a teacher you should take yourself into a father- or mother-figure for the students, so they feel save being around you and ask for advise at any time. This helps to build up a strong relationship between the teachers and the students. 

Good knowledge of the subject being taught by a teacher is selfexplaining. Every teacher has requirements for a certain subject, which means every teacher needs to have a good knowledge about the topic they teach.

In my opinion, I think that the teacher should be able to relate well with students rather than having excellent knowledge about the subject himself. If a teacher has good knowledge about the topics in his subject, but does not know how to teach the subject to the students in a proper way, will not have a good relationship with the students aswell, so this means for me personally that the teacher should have good abilities in both sides.
