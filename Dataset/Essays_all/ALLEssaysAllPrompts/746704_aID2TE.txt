Suppose we have a teacher who relates well with us students, but has no clue about his subject.
I ones had a science teacher called Mis. Knox. I always liked science and was looking foreward to the lessons until she told us that midges are attracted by sweet blood, wich is commanly said but wrong. It depends on your sweat and if midges like it or not. Since then I didn't trust the information she was giving us and I didn't enjoy  science anymore.

If a teacher has an exellent knowledge of his subject he or she can add many interesting, often unimportant informations that make the lessons more interesting than s/he is a good teacher. But if the teacher isn't able to show his passion for his subject it usally gets dull during the lessons. History is a good example. Our new history teacher was the first person to show me that history could be interesting, she told us about the thing she finds weird and crazy. That gave her lessons a personal touch.

I think the most important think is that we understand why the teacher likes his subject. If he has an excellent knowledge and can't comunicate it to us it's no help. I thinkit's more important that the teacher knows what he's saying than how well he's relating with the students.
