Is the relation between teacher and students more importsnt than the knowledge of the subject being taught?

I think building a good relationship to his students is the most important task of a teacher. Some of the students in german schools just don't feel comfortable in class while the teacher is present. Some of them are even afraid of telling their opinion in class because they know that the get laughed at of the students and also of the teachers. 

I was in the USA for 10 months and at my high school, you could feel the good ralationship between the students and the teacher. You were able to laugh WITH the teachers and you could go to them and tell them stories and the problems of your life. They always listened to you. And with this good relationship the teacher was able to give the knowledge to the students on another level. The level was more personal and the students were comfortable to ask a question in front of the whole class without being ashamed of it.

I think that an excellent knowledge is a "must-have" for every teacher but the difference between a good teacher is if he can relate to his students or not, so I totally agree with the statement above.
