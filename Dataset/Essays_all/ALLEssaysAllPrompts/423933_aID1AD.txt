Television advertising

Nowadays television advertising is an important topic. With those ads people get manipulated to be better consumers. Children are an important group of custmers because it is easier to catch them with advertising and they do not really know that there is some advertising company behind who gets all the money. The youth of todays society should not be more interested to consumption than we already are. Children should therefore be cancalled as an important group of consumers. If we do not intervene children will more and more just care about money and consumption. Like that they would lose other kinds of values such as liberty, friendship, privacy and happiness and so on. They would be educated just for buying more of a particular good. Nowadays every data that is given by us is collected because of the huge surveillance we got. This together with the advertising is used to get to know what people want in order to make them better consumers. I personally think we should definitely not let this happen to our kids. In my opinion the world is already more than keen enough on money so we should not never allow television advertising which is directed to young children. This would be even worse than what advertising is doing whit all other people. Television itself gets more and more important and that is why the advertising would work more efficient too.
