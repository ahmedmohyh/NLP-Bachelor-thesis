The ability torelate well with students is very important for teachers. But is ist really more important than exellent knowledge of the subject that the teacher teaches?

On one hand the techer has to be accepted from the students, otherwise he has no chance to teach something to the students. They would ignore the things the teacher tells them. Sometimes, when the students ar borded, decide to do something completly diffrent during the lesson. For example they draw pictures or talk with an other student. If the students think that the teacher doesn't like them, they often start to dislike the subject wich this techer teaches.
So I think it's quite important that the teacher relates well with the students. Without that ability it's nearly not possible to teach a class.

On the other hand its very important as a teacher to know about what you're talking. If you doubt aubout what you are talking, the stundents will know that and start to doubt too. The wouldn't listen anymore because the thought: This teacher doesn't know anything, so why should we listen to him? The teacher would make himself to a ridicilus person, like a clown. But when he relates well with his student, they might will accept him with these lacks in knowledge.

Finally I think both ablitys are very important. A techer, who has only one of those will can never be a very good teacher. But when you relate well with your students as a techer, you have won a lot. The only problem then is, the students won't lern enough. So I agree with this statement. It is more important to relate well with students than to know everything of the subject the techer teaches.
