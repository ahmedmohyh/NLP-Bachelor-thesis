With the upcoming digitalization and the frequent use of television and the internet it is normal for children, even of a rather young age, to watch a lot of TV. They might be enjoying a cartoon, but the frequent advertisement pauses will eventually be directed towards them. In this essay it will be discussed whether television advertising toward children of the ages two to five should be allowed or not. 

Firstly, if parents let their kids watch television programmes by themselves it can not really be controlled whether they are exposed to and influenced by television ads. Parents would have to be with their kids while watching television and not let them see the advertisements in between the actual programme to avoid that their children are influenced. However, one could argue that if parents let their kids watch television in the first place, they must be okay with them being influenced by different advertisements. 

Another argument that one might bring up, is that the advertisement probably isn't directed towards the children, but towards their parents. In other words, are children even affected by seeing the advertisements in TV? It is said that children can not possbibly be influenced, because they are not directly the customers of the stores and brands placing the adverts. Opposing to this, one could say that children who see an advert in television could be telling their parents to buy or consume whatever was shown in the advertisement, which would then indirectly lead to the parents being influenced by the television ad. 

In coclusion it can be said, that parents as well as the ad-placing companies have an influence on whether children are affected by the advertisement or not. In my opinion, parents should pay attention to what their kids are watching, but it is not really necessary to forbid television advertising completel
