Teacher's ability to relate well with stundents or their knowledge

Of course it is important for a teacher to know something about what he is teaching. Although it will not help him much if he cant teach it to his students.
For that he needs to be able to relate with students. 

One could say that it is impossible for a teacher to teach something if he does not know anything about a subject. But he can do research and maybe even ask other teachers for help and then explain it to his students in the next lesson. But if a teacher is incapable of relating well with his students they might not even listen to him. If a techers students do not listen to what he is saying they willl not learn anything, also they will not listen to him in the next lesson so no progress is posible. 

If a teacher has a lot of knowledge and can realte at least on a low level with his students they have a high chance of learning a lot. Not every stundent likes every teacher he or her has but still it is posible for them to pick up the informations given. Even if a teacher is very bad at explaining one will still learn a bit about what he is saying. If a teacher has only litle knowledge on a subject but can explain it very well students will remember a lot of that knowledge. These student compared to ones with a teacher who as a lot of knowledge willl know less but they should know it more exact.

All in all one can say that a teacher needs a bit of knowled and the ability to realte with his students at least at a low level. It is nearly impossible to teach if one of those two things is missing.
