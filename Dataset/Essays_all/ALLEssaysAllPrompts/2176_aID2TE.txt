In the following essay I am going to discuss whether it is more important that a teacher is able to relate well with students or that he has excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
On the one hand it seems to be highly logical that a teacher has to have excellent knowledge in the subjects he is teaching. Otherwise a teacher is simply not able to explain special matters to his students. Whenever someone is explaining anything, he has to understand it himself. Therefore teachers should definitely have excellent knowledge. 
On the other hand it is a fact that students are not really able to learn anything whenever they are felling uncomfortable. Unfortunatly this often happens when a teacher is not able to relate well with his students. Students might be afraid of a teacher or a class, because they think that the teacher does not like them or likes to push them into embarrasing moments in front of the class instead of helping them to get better in the subject and get confident. 
In my opinion both, the ability to relate well with students and the knowledge, are important for teachers, although the relationship to the students is a little bit more important than the knowledge of their subject. Even when a teacher has only the basic knowledge but a good relation to the students he can make his lesson interesting and the students will learn the basic facts at least. If it would be the other way around, the students would be either bored or scared and they would probably not learn anything.
