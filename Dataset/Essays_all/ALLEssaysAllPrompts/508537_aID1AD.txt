Hello and welcome to my essay which is about whether advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not. I think at the moment there is to much advertising in general. Especially on television there is so much advertising that it is annoying. ALso I dont understand why there is advertising anyway since almost nobody watches it. When people see that on the television the programme stops and adverts start playing they mostly go away anyway for example to pee. I think television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed, spare atleast the young kids from this. It really worries me how much today's world is only about money where even ads for small children are produced. Small children might see something that they like in the ads and force their parents to buy something totally unnecessary. Also i don't even know if small children aged up to five watch so much television that it does make sence to make ads especially directed towards them. So in conclusion I agree with the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed". First of all advertising is something that people normally don't like. Second, many people don't watch ads anyway since they just use the ad-time on television for a break. And my last argument is that I don't think children aged up to five watch enough television that ads can actually make the children think about something.
