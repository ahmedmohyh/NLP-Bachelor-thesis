I agree with this statement, that students need a good relationship with his or her teacher. A student has more chance in the lessons, when you understand good with your teacher.
 The lessons are so, that the teacher´s help their more lovely students more than others. If student´s have more knowledge, than others,which is often in some subjects the fact. So when the student don´t relate well with his or her teacher, then the knowledge is not helpfulier.  
In the most situations the student become a bad abitur, because they don´t have a niche relate to the teacher´s. Some students know the teacher´s from the fifth class and so the teacher´s have a relate to this students, but not to the other, which come later to this class. But the relate don´t make students clever, so the knowledge must have all students, for a better relate. the lessons has more fun when the relate is right and the students have the knwledge. So my oppinion is, that a relate to the teacher is important
