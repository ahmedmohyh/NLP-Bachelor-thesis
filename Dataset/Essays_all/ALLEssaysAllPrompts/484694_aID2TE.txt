The personal relation to a teacher takes a big role in the education of students. This is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject. In this essay, I will compare arguments for and against this statement. 
First, I want to talk about the personal motivation which is definitely raised, if students have a good relation to their teacher. They can work together witch their teacher as a team and find solutions for problems. In connection to a high motivation, the working atmosphere in class is much more comfortable. 
I think the work atmosphere plays a big role in the efficiency of a school lesson. Students can work out better discussions when everybody takes part and tries to describe his arguments. 

But beside all of that, you can not have an interesting conversation without a well educated knowledge about the subject from the teacher. This knowledge is the base of the whole lesson and has big influence on students motivation. Because students realise, when the teacher isn't prepared and only reading down quotes from a book.
You can have two extreme situations. On the one hand it's possible that the teacher-student relation is a very good one, but only with that, the focus on the subject matter is being lost and the learning effect is much worse, because it's more a spending of free-time together with the teacher and chatting about daily things like the newest post on instagram. 
On the other hand, when the teacher has a big knowledge, but is not able to motivate the class to learn, due to the bad relation between the teachers and students, the learning effect also descents to nearly zero because nobody wants to learn. 
So to summarize this essay, it's important to find a way between, where you have a well working atmosphere in class and a well educated teacher.
