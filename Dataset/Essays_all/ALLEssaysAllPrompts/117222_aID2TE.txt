I think this statement is generaly true.It depense which school it is. In the first two years in the kindergarden for example it`s much more important to have a good connection to the studends/childreen than to have a good knowledge. But I don`t want to say that a kindergarden teacher didn`t need a knowledge it`s just not so importet like in the primary school or in the secundary school. 

In the primary school it`s a bit diffrent. There needs a teacher bouth skills. The primary students reached a age were it`s hard to get them under controll but it`s also the beginning of her life. In this time they hafe to leran the most importent things and the basic of life so I think it`s very important that the teacher knows what he`s talking about.

I can`t say how the situation in the secundary school is because i never was there but i think there`s also depense in which niveau a teacher have to teach.

In the gymnasium, where I am, are both areas importent. After ten years of school sometimes the motivation get lose and in this moments it`s important that the students like the teacher. If the teacher isn`that much good it automaticly make that a student didn`t like a subject. But otherwhise it`s important to learn as much as possible and for that is an teacher with a big knowledge a duty. 

At the moment I never was at the College but I heard from my cousin that the connection to the teacher aren`t so good. It`s more important to learn all the details about the subject. It`s the last part of learning in the life and in my opinion it`s important to learn all the smal and specific things for the job in the future.
