If a teacher's ability to relate with students is well, he always asks the class if every student is concentrated and if every student understands what he just said. And he would know which students understand slower and which are faster. So he could individualize the lesson for every person until everyone understands the stuff. 
I think cou can't say one of them is more important than the other. A teacher should always relate well with his students but should look that everyone understands what he is teaching at the moment. The perfect teacher would try to do both of them. If a teacher doesn't relates well with his students they will start to dislike him and maybe won't respect him anymore.
