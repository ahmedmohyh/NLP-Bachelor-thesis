At first, young children, especially in the age of two to five, shouldn't watch television, because that's not so good for their health. They will grow up and it's not good for their eyes. It's also not good, because if they always watch TV, they won't go outside playing with other children from the neighbourhood. So why should television advertising should be good? Young little children shouldn't be there to watch it.
They could also get influenced by the television and they admire the person in the TV or they want to be like them. They also could get the wrong idea of things in the world, which isn't good. They should learn knowing the world by their own experiences and not from the TV. It isn't the TV, which is always right.
The good thing is, that they can learn something from watching television. They can learn knowing what they want and persuading their parents to buy the things from the TV. If the parents do, what you want, you hae them under control and that's difficult to manage. You can learn it in the young age, when you're still little and sweet and nobody can say no to you.
If the parents let them watching television because they are annoying, they will see the television advertising and it's good for the market. Many parents let their children watch some things in the television to be quiet.
It's also good for the parents. The parents know, what they want and they don't have to ask them all the time or find out on their own. It's easier for them.
In my opinion I agree with the statement above. Television advertising shouldn't be allowed towards young children. It's just not good to influence such little things, nearly babies. They should go outside to let them play in the garden or on the playing field. They can do television advertising if they want, but I hope nobody sees it, because they are outdoors to do better things than watching TV to see it.
