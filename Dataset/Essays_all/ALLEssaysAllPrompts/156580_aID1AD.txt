It depends what the advertising is about.  Advertising which are about games and stuff children like is often not good for the children and for their parents because they make the children wish these things and sometimes is this hard for the parents if they don't have the money to buy them these "unnecessary" things. Children are easy to manipulate. I think that's the reason why the toy industries make a big profit because of their advertisings. Sometimes advertisings toward children are good if they entertain the children and not only "force" them to buy their product. These kind of manipulative advertisings aren't good because they can be the reason why children argue with their parents or that they cry a lot because they won't have the product. The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." is a bit too extreme written or thought because why should television advertisings which are made for children be forbidden for them? It's better when they watch these sort of advertising instead an advertising which is about "toys" for adults. 
It think television advertisings toward children are O.K. if they are not that manipulative that the children are forced to buy the product and have to argue with their parents about it. When a child sees an advertising on TV he should think: "Oh what a funny and entertaining advertising." instead of:  "OMG! I need to bring my parents to buy me this toy."
