Why should teachers always have excellent knowledge of the subject? Teachers have to explain the subjects well. Teachers should have more knowledge of the thing than students. But they should also not have a too excellent knowledge of the things. As an example, if they know too much everything will be to detailled and the students do not understand what he means. 

I think, teachers should always know more than students and they sould be excellently prepaired for the subject. If they do not know more and a student who is very intelligent it's not good if he do not know more.

Altough a teacher should has a knowledge of explain something to the students. The thing to be a good teacher is, when he could explains something difficult in an easy way, that every student will understand. And to be prepaired and not to present the subjects boring. 

But, teachers shouldn't know too much. As an example, I had a teacher who was very intelligent and knew much more than we should know after this subject, but for him the theme was so clear, so he couln't understand, what we do not understand so it was very difficult for us and also for him, because he couldn't explain the thing. 

It's important to have an excellent knowledge of the theme, but the teachers should also teach, and explain well.
