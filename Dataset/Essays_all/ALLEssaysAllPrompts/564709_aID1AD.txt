Every time you switch on the television, there is advertise. But it does not only make adults buy things, it does also influence young children. Is it fair to bring in this television advertising directed toward young children?

On every chanel on the television companies are making advertise to influence the buying habits of people. But I think you have to make a difference between adults and children. Adults often can control themselves, so that they know how to spend money.But when childrem aged two to five see these toys on the television, they mostly want it. I think advertise is like poison to people, not only to children but to all people. When you watch television and you see a new perfume or the new summercollection of a brand it makes you think about something you may have never thought about if you have not seen it on television. But somehow you can either learn to deal with this poison or you can be poisoned, that is something you and your parents decide.
But I also think that the problem is the way advertise is made, is wrong. Often the actors in the advertise are smiling and they seem to be pretty happy having the product. So young children automatically think that this thing has to make them even happier. Then they make their parents buy them stuff, which in some weeks is lying in the back corner and the chilren have only touches it once. Spoiled children also do not learn how to be creative when they are bored. 
I think that the fact how children deal with the advertise has alot to do with how they grew up. 

I think that the advertising has both good and bad sides. It should be allowed because in that way they learn how to deal with it, also when they get older. So if you learn not to buy everything only because the television say so, you generally do not have problems when you are older.
