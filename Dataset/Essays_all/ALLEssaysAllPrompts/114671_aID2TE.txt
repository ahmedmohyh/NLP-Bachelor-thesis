To answer this question, we have to ask ourselves what the purpose of a teacher is.
For me, the purpose is about passing knowledge to his students so they can preserve and add to what's known.
A teacher must have a deep understanding of the subject being taught regardless of how well the teacher can relate to the students.
But that doesn't mean that a teacher can be unable to relate to his students. For the students, it is alot easier to learn from somebody who they feel close to.
But when a teacher doesn't have a deep understanding of the subject, they can't explain the questions from the students without sticking to their basic answers.
But a teacher doesn't have to be able to answer every question. These questions should only help students who don't understand the subject themselves by giving them additional things to relate to. For example, when someone doesn't understand how things fall due to gravitational forces. It is not important for the teacher to figure out which thinking mistakes the person learning is making. The teacher can know very well that the student is asking himself why things are not falling off of the earth's atmosphere, but are instead sticking to the ground. 
By simply giving anecdotal and and visual references the teacher achieves his goal to pass on his knowledge. When a student is able to find these hints by himself, a relatable teacher is not needed.
So in general, the younger the students are, the social skills of a teacher are more important. And the older they are, being able to have a deep understanding of the subject becomes a more important requirement.
