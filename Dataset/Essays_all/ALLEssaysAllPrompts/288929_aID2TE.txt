What is a good teacher? A lot of people say that a good teacher has the ability to realte well with students, which  is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject.

Supporters of this statement claim that a lot of students do not like a school subject if the teacher can not relate to them. In their opinion teachers that are able to relate well with students motivate them. These teachers understand students and this gives them the ability to adapt to students. That way  the student's passion for this certain subjet rises, which probably leads to better grades.

But there are other opinions. The main reason why people disagree with this statement is because they think that subject knowledge is more important. They state that a teacher's task is to teach students. They fear that a teacher, that can relate to students well has a lack of subject knowledge.

In my opinion the ability to relate to students is the most important. Theachers always have a good subject knowledge since they studied. For me personally, there is nothing more motivating in school than a teacher that is able to relate to us stundents. A passionate, relateable teacher encourages students to be good in a subject.
