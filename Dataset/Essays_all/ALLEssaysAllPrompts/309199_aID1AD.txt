As a child I always used to watch KIKA. My parents tought its the only channel which should be alowed to children because there is no advertising and they don't try to convince and manipulate the children to buy something. The other TV channel was Superertel. Superertel had a lot of advertising in between a film and I liked that. It was for a child like me very intresting to see what the most common trends are and what I could wish for my birthay or christmas. But should it be allowed to direct TV advertising towards children? 

TV advertising is directed towards every goup of age so why should it not be derectet towards children. If you watch TV you also need to accept that there is advertising. The Parents of children need to decide if they want their children to watch TV. Nobody gets forced to watch TV so if you don't want your child to watch advertising you can skip the breaks or your child just dosen't watchs TV. There are also some channels for children with less arvertisement (e.g. KIKA).

Every advertisement company knows that children are very easy to manipulate so they take the opportunity espacialy in chistmestime to influence the children. So on one had you can say that they use the maturity of children and on the other hand you can say that it is just a business and it's just a logic strategy of the companys. But the argument with the use of maturity imediately loses its power if you keep in mind that watching TV is voluntary.

In conclusion I think that it should be allowed to direct TV advertising towards children because nobody gets forced to watch TV and there are ways to overcome the advertising for example in a filmbreak. For companys its very important that they can show advertising and manipulate children because there is no better way to reach them then through advertising.
