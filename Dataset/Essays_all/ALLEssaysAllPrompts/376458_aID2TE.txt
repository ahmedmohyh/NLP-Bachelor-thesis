Is the abiity to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject?

Every student had the experience, that no matter how hard he learns he fails during the exam. And especially in this situation a teacher has to be your contact when it is getting difficult. Then a teacher can show, how good he is.
A teacher has to have the contact with his students, if not he can't reach his students and teach them a lesson. But there is a small border between having a good relationship and having a friendship with the students, often a teacher wants to be afriend for the students, because he thinks he would achieve more than just being serious and mean. But this friendship leads to bad concentration and unseriousity, because if a student writes a bad test he thinks it is gonna be ok, because the teacher is his friend and will gift him points and a good mark.
At the other side just having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, won't give you the contact to your class. If you cannot reach your students and if they don't understand your theories, then every knowledge of the world won't help you. The teacher is an important job for the society, this job affords subject knowledge but also human knowledge, if a teacher doesn't fulfill this criterias he has got the wrong job.
