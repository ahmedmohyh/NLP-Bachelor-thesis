We live in a digital age. Advertisement is done mostly over electronics. So it is not surprising that most comercials aren't directed to all people but on a group. But is really every group equally sensible for comercial or shouldn't advertisements be directed towards young children?
Infants are easyly influencend by their environnement. They repeat everything they heard, they act like their partent and their speach resembles the one that television characters use. But this is, most of the time, a  good influence which makes the children learn new words. As comercials also follow certain rules which involve the avoiding of profanity those product promotions might be perfect for young children to get to know more words and evolve their grammatical skills. On the other hand this might lead to an increase of television usage of the younger generation, which is a bit counterproductive, as the children wont go out and learn something about the environement.
What's more is that this may be the perfect way of communication between parents and their children. Often enough infants don't know how to express themselfes if they are in need of something. But with the comercials the could just reuse the phrases they heard there and the parents automatically would know what they want. But with comercials only for them so early in their lifes this might lead to an decreas in the quality of later generations, as they might believe everything they see in advertisements. 
Comercials will alway be directed at certain groups and the younger generation is born into an age where everything is digital and communication happens mostly over the internet. Sooner or later they get influenced by comercials but on the internet there is, most of the time, no one which controlls if the rules aren't broken, so television might be the perfect method to influence young children in a good way.
