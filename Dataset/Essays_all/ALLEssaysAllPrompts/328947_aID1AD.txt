In the today's world it is a normal thing that a young child, in the age of two to five, is watching TV with the permission of the parents. They also have to watch some advertisement during the breaks of the cartoon. There are some television adversitising directed towards young children. Some little children are playing with the new toy dog that can talk and act like a real dog. Or the girls are laughing and giggeling with the brandnew barbie. But does the television advertising affect the children?
And now the question is: Should the television advertising directed towards young children be allowed?

The advantages of showing the television advertising to young children is that they will see how many different toys are there with them they can play. Not only smartphones or tablets. When the young humans like them then they will buy some new toys. So they probably will spend more time playing toys than watching TV. This would be good for the fantasy insteed of staring at the electronic thing.

On the other hand there are some disadvantages. Firstly the advertisement influents the opinion of the children. They will annoy their parents to buy the toys and the parents don't have another choice and will buy them. There aren't only good toys that the children can use. In the advertisement they also can show some violence or sexual scenes. And that's not the right thing for the young children who are in the stage in which they find everything curious. The parents trust the channel that the children are watching at, but when would show to the little kids some brainwashing advertisements the parents won't be glad about it.

To sum up there are some advantages and disadvantages of showing the television advertising directed toward kids. In my opinion I think it's not a great idea to influent the mind of the children. They should decide by themself. In my point of view the director shouldn't produce television advertising for young children.
