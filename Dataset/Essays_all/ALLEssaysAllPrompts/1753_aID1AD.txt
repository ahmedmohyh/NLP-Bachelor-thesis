Many little children already watch Tv-shows on programs, that are aspecially for them. Often there are many advertising between the movies or series. That`s why many people dicuss if it should be allowed to show television advertising directet to young children, aged two to five. 
We live in a consume time, where it`s important to have many different and new things. But children at this age are too small to understand the value of many things. So it`s not good to train them already at this age for buying and that it is cool and neccesary to have many for example toys. Often the little children can not even understand or realize what this advertisings are for.
But we also should consider, that nowadays children grow up with media and all of the modern technologies. We should try to introduce them in the media stuff in order to try to hide it. Litlle children should already start to deal with the big amount of offers in this world or with the electronics. Also there could be a big problem to realize this wish of no advertising for little children. Because often there are only two or three children programs on Tv, and there are times where the shows for older children start. But sometimes the 4-years-old children watch them too, for example with their sipplings. Then they also see advertisings, and you can`t fully isolate the little children from the advertisings. It would be too complicated to seperate the shows for different aged children on different programms. 
I think this is okay to show advertising on show
