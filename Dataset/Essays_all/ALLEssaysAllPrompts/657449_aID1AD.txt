  Do we already have to try to influence young children? Do we have to try to sell something to them, even if we know that they believe almost everything? This is a difficult question.

  We all know that children, especially the young ones, are so easy to influence and that they believe everything that anybody tells them. So it is also a very easy thing to convince them, that there's something that they need to have and that it is the best thing for them. Maybe the children will be very disapointed about something that they have seen when they were watching television.

  TV advertising is like telling them a story.The world is often perfect and the children believe it. They don't find advertising as anoying as we do and maybe they see something that they love and they have a wish for. Nobody says that it is not fair to make your child believe in santa. And this is similar.

  I think that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.Not believing that everything in advertises is true is just another thing that they need to learn when they grow up. And in the end there are still many parents who watch TV as well and maybe they see something that they'd like to have for their children.
