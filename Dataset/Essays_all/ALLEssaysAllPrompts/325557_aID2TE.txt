The teachers and the students both have some responsability to make a lesson interesting.
If theachers don't respond to the questions and statements delivered by the students I think the students won't learn anything. Students need a motivation to get up every morning and attend classes from 8 til sometimes 5 o'clock. If you just have to sit 45 minutes and listen to the teacher telling something which  maybe isn't understandable because it's thaught in a very formal way the teacher also creates a distance to the students. There should be some distance but I think it's important that we can trust our teachers and be able to ask them something despite the fact that it's maybe a stupid question or a question which maybe not fit in to the discussed topic.
Maybe the teacher does not even want to comprimise because he thinks he is to smart to make a mistake and only sees a problem from his angle. Of course the teacher should have some knowledge to be able to teach the students something and it's necessary that he gives some inputs on which the lesson can be build up on. 
But it's also very important that the students bring some interesting questions and statements otherwise it will not be a very taughtfull lesson and  the motivation for a specific subject will get lost. The students have to be critical and think about what the teachers are teaching them. We should not just assume every thing is right if the teacher told us so.
