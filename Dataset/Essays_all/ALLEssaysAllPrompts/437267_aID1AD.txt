The intention of this essay is to say if television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five should be allowed. It is in fact quite annoying that while watching Television advertising always interrupts the best part of a film. But what happens when children see direct advertising, should there by a law for what they are allowed to see?

On one hand, we all know that children are influenced by everything and quickly convinced about doing something. They are even influenced by hidden intentions, some of them better or even worse. The TV Industry is of a course a good media for advertise directed towards the young people and can have a really bad influence on their habit as for example the duration of watching TV through the day. There should not be any erotic advertising on the television and also no war scenes in them.
On the other hand, young children should not be left alone and their parents are responsible for what they are allowed to see. It is not possible or at least not a good idea to control all the channels on TV, because they have an intention that is definitely not (always) a harmful one. Additionally young children do not really care about what is on television between their favourite series. Even if the see an direct advertising, most of the time they do not really understand.  

To conclude, from my point of view you can not control who will see the specific advertising and as a result it can not be prohibited. In addtition, parents have got the responsibility for their children and consequently for what they are allowed to see.
