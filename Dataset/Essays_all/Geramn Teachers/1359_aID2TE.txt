A teacher´s ability to relate well with  students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. There are many different oppinions to this statement. I think that the oppinion to the statements depends on who you are. I´m a student so I´m going to describe the oppinions of students.

I´m on the EBS in Elmshorn and in my oppinion teacher havte to have a really good realationship to his students. If the teacher is nice the students are nice back. That means that the students like the lessons from the teacher and want to learn in his lessons. If a student don´t like a teacher he would be never interested to his lessons and just want to talk to other students. Than the other student can´t concentrate  too. To have a really good lesson the teacher have to get every stundet in his class to the point that they like to learn. 

So in the end I would say that it´s more important for a teacher to have a good ability to relate well with stundet that have a excelent knowledge of his subject. Becouse if the stundents are at the point that they want to learn they can get more clever that a student who doesn´t want to learn but has a teacher with a excellent knowledge of the subject.
