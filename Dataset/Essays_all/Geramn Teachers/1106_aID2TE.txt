The question if a theacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than execellt knowlege of the subject being taught is hard to answer. 
A teacher is a person who's job it is to teach childern and young adults the subject he or she studied. But on the other hand a theacher not only theaches his or her subject but also how to behave and things like what's right and what's wrong. And how could he do that if he couldn't relate well with his students? 
There are arguments for and also against the statement above. 
I could agree with this statement because there are many situations where a  theacher has to do more than just teach his subject. An example for that could be that if there's a fight inside the class, it's the theachers job to see who's right and who has to apologize. Or if a class has an argument with another theacher, it is his job to relate with the students and help them to come to a conclution. 
Another point is that everyone wants to have a theacher who isn't emotionless or only intersted in the subject he teaches. It's always more fun to get theached by a theacher who can bond with the class, joke around and espacially understands the pupils. 
Nevertheless I could also disagree with the statement above because it is much more important for me to get my good and fair grades than being friends with the theacher. Because there is always the danger that if a theacher doesn't like you or likes other people a lot more, that you get an unfair grade and that's not what should happen. 
I would always prefere a theacher who is emotionaless or at least doesn't count his emotions and relations with the students into his grades. I could argue that his main job is to transfer his knowledge to his students so it is really important that he has excellent knowlegde over his subject.
In conclution I can say, that I prefere a nice and friendly theacher who is strikt with grade and the behavior in class but with whom you can also joke around at times.
