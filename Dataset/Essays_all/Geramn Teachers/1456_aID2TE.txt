A good STIMMUNG is important in class to make the students more motivated so they want to learn and get good greats.
A good relationship to the techer is also important but not as important as excellent knowledge of the subject. The students have to learn to get better with the teacher even they dont like him. Later they also have to work with people they dont like too and they have to be nice so its a good lesson for life and a step of getting older and growing up. 
Its the job of a teacher to teach the students and not to be their friend. A respectfull and sometimes funny relationship is alrighgt but he have to stay in distance to the students. They are not only in school to have fun and meat friends. Sometimes school isnt the greatest place in the world an its hard put you have to learn. And when the students are nice to the teacher he wants to be nice too and it can get to subjective greats and 

All in all is the teachers abillity to relate well with the students not as important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
