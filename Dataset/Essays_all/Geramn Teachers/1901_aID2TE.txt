One point that the statement from the top is correct show that the distance between teacher and student do not be too big because the student need to know that the teacher is there when you need him or her. Another argument says that the statement is wrong because it is not more important to ability to relate well with students. For example it is also important to knowledge the subject of being taught. An example for this is that teachers need to know more about his or her students. 
I think that the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" from the top is correct because I agree totally with it because the teacher and the student must have a friendly base to communicated better.
