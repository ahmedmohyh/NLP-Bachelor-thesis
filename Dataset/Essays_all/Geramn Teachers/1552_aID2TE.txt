How does a relationship between teachers and students need to be for a perfect learning process? That's a question which is hot debated since years. So what is more important: A good relationship or a perfect knowledge? In the following I will discuss that problem.
One definetly important argument against the statement is the fact that a teacher's and school's first exercise is to clear up their students about their specific subject. And for that task a teacher really needs to have an excellent knowledge about their topics. Without it our school system wouldn't work.
Another argument against a "friendship" between students and teachers is that an always caring teacher who, besides teaching, also needs to take care of the students private stuff, runs into danger to forget is original exercise and risks to ignore his lesson task. 
However, we can't ignore that a friendly relationship also has got his positive side. If we think about how some private problems sometimes influenced our work clima it would be a nice thing to have a teacher with who you can talk about it. That's a more unexpected way of teachers improving our work habits.
At last we also need to say that a teacher, who knows his students exactly is more able to analyze their way of working and uses the best way to transform his knowledge.
In conclusion we can say that a teacher definetly needs knowledge to teach his students, but also he needs to know them that good so he can improve their kind of work and in the end their grades. In my opinion I feel more like an object you need to give a grade when a teacher leaves out his relating part with his students. But also for a student there is nothing worse than a teacher who always steps over the border of a real friendship and a teacher-student relation. And, like always, a perfect mix of both sides would be a nice goal for newcomer- teachers - and maybe also for those who don't realize their own behaviour in front of their class.
