The given Statement is very generel, but first of all, a teacher who has the ability to connect well with his students has a lot of advantages. He hopefully motivates to get deeper into the topic he`s teaching. Lessons make more fun, so you get a better feeling for learning and going to school. Also you like to get into the conversation about more topics seriously.When you are really into  a topic, you can get the specific knowledged from somewhere else, for example websites, books , Studies or professeros. But on the other hand the aspect of knowledge in the subjects , that are taught should not be forgotten. The profession of the teacher is there to teach his specific topics and subjects , not to be a friend. When we say that the school prepares you for youre later life there are to main things not regarded, because besrt knowledge always gets you advantages in any job , country or culture. Also the social interaction skills of the Students are not tested or trained. If you got someone who you can easily connect with you can learn and listen to him more easily. But one of the main abilitys you need to have in your later Life is not trained. Another aspect is, that if you want to learn, you always you need to do things by yourself, which is also a thing that you should learn in school, so you make yourself more indepented from other people, so sympathy doesn`t matter. But in this case the question is more where the focus of the school should be. Also without conversation without knowledge doesn`t makes sense in a school, so with a teacher focused on knowledge, you train if you want to graduate at a university. In my opinion the ability to connect with people is the kost important tool to teach , but the aspect of knowledge shouldn`t be forgotten. But if you can combine these things it is for sure the best way of teaching and learning.The Ideal of a teacher results in the combination of knowledge and empathy.
