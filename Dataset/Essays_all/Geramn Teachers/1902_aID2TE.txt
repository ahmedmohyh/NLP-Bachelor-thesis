A perfect teacher should have both: the ability to relate well with his students but also an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. But which of both aspects is more important?
On the one hand it is very important for teachers and students to have a good relationship because it helps the teacher to understand students' problems or difficulties but also helps the students to open up to their teacher. If a teacher does not know anything about the people he is teaching and is only focused on the subject it might be very hard for students to follow the lessons. They also might be scared to raise up their hand for an oral participation in fear of saying anything incorrect. Therefore it makes class much more easier for pupils having a teacher with a good connection to his students.
But on the other hand it is also necessary for a teacher to have an excellent knowledge of what he is teaching. The first reason why students have to go to school is because they should learn things and improve their knowledge. Therefore it is very important for them to have someone teaching them everything they need to be taught which is only possible if this person itself has a good knowledge.
Additionaly, regarding their future students have to learn to get along with anybody. If you are bad at something you can not just say that it is another person's fault but you have to work on yourself. That is what you learn if you have got a teacher who has no ability to relate well with his students.
To put it in a nutshell, having a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is way more important then having a teacher with a good relationship to his students because students are able to learn more and get better grades and also get prepared for their future.
