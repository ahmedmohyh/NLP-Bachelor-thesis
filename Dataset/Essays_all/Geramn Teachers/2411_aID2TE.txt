Is a teacher who can relate well with his students better than a teacher who is an expert on his subject? 
As an argument against this question one could say that a teacher with a perfect social connection to his students is important, but if he or she has a lack of knowledge in his subject, the students cannot learn all the information.
Maybe they have more fun in school, but with a teacher who is not perfectely prepared for a lesson or with a teacher who is only able to teach his subject in a low quality students lose a chance of good training for their a- levels. 

But there is also another view on the question. A teacher who can relate with the students is a gift. Not many teachers have a good connection with their students and as a conclusion, students are not motivated to work with them. So let's assume that there is a genius in front of class who can tell you everything about his subject, but nobody acutally understands him or is willing to listen carefully. In fact, hardly anybody has learned something at the end of the lesson. This is of course a very extreme scenario, but the point is clear: How much does it count to have an expert when nobody learns much?
So in fact, in my opinion, it is really about the social qualities of the teacher because even when students sometimes don't get an excellent teaching, they still learn more from a relateable teacher than from an expert who cannot convince his students enough to listen to him.
