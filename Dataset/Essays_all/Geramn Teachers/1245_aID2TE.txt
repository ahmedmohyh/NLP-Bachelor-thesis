A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Well-being in class has priority because if you have a good relationship to your teacher it is much more easier to learn in class and you haven't got any fears of making mistakes. It has to be the goals of the teacher that every student is interested in his lessons and shows initiative also those quiet students.
The second point is why you're going to school if you know everything about this subject. You go to school to learn more about something, to get interested in this subject and to find your strenghts and weeknesess. The teacher's is able to help you and improve your skills.
If you have excellent knowledge about a subject you have got some advantages to the other students. It also shows that you're really interested but if you haven't got such a well raltionship like the other students may have, the teacher thinks you know everything, accordingly you get less help than the other students. There are also some students who were better than the others so they could help those students who have difficulties to solve exercises. 

Concluding I would say that it is really necessary to have a good relationship between students and teachers. I think there are a lot advantages for each partie. But I think if you've got excellent knowledge in some subjects it is much more easier to work in class. The question is why you go to school when you know everything? I think you could go to the university.
