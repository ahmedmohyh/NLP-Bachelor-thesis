This essay is about the question if it is more important for the students that the teacher has the ability to relate well or that he has an excellent knowledge about the subject he is teaching them. In the following Text I will bring up arguments for and against the two possibilitys. 

At first I want you to emegine a situation where the teacher is completly not abled to understent how the stundents are learning the best. in this situation he is not abled to relate with them which makes him beeing not abled to teach them because hi can not figure out the way they are learning, which makes it very important for a teacher to be abled to relate to his students.

Also the students will have more fun with a teacher how is abled to understand them, which makes the learn more easy then without having fun. so again it is Important for a teacher to be abled to relate to his students.

But lets not forget about the point that a teacher who has no knwoledge about the subject is not abled to teach that subject, so it is also important for a teacher to know what he is talking about.

And in the end a teacher who is abled to relate to the student perfectly will possibly not be respected by them and for sure will not be respected by them if hi would have no clou about what hi is talkig about. 

Summarizing I want to say that I think that it is important that a teachers finds the right small path between relating well and excellently knowing the subject he is teaching.
