I agree with the statement that the relation between student and teacher is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject, which being taught. A good relation is very important, because the learn effect makes profit of it aswell. If a student can talk about the problems, they have a person they can talk about with. A student with less problems, do a better job in school than students with many problems. If a students like the teacher or have a good relation with the teacher, he does have more fun to learn and also get better results. Also if the teacher likes the class, because of the good relation, I guess he'll also do a better job in teaching so both makes profit of it. 

But if the students have a relation which is too good, there are also negative aspects in it. Because maybe the students won't take the lessons serious enough and just do what they want. A teacher is a respected person, so others have to listen, especially students. And if they won't listen carefully what the teacher says, they won't learn enough in school. I don't think, that the subject which being taught is less important than the relation, because the knowledge of the subject is what you need in your future not the good relation to your teacher. 

Generally, I think a good student-teacher relation is a nice thing, because I can think for students it's important to have fun at being taught and having a good relation to the teacher. I can compare it to my schooltime. When I had a lesson with a teacher, with which i had a good connection I'll did way better than with a teacher which doesn't like and other way round. But a teacher always have to be a person, where the students can look up to and have to be respected.
