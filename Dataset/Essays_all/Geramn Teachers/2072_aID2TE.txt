The first thing people would say is: "No, of course the excellent knowledge of a subject is the most important thing in school." Well, I think a mixture of both aspects is a perfect solution. On one hand of course it is really important that children have a good or a perfect knowledge about the subjects teachers taught in  school. When students just sit in school and don´t listen or even understand the topic, it wouldn´t be nessacary to go to school. On the other hand it would be nice for students and of course it would be nice for the teachers too, to relate well with each other. The atmosphere in class would be more comfortable and students would feel more comforable too. When teachers have a good connection to their students, maybe they could understand how they feel in class and why they are better or worse tan other students. But when teachers don´t have a connection with their students, it may be that students feel like they won´t go to class anymore, because feel uncomfortable or something like that.
At the end I think that a teacher´s abillity to relate well with students is important but not really nessacary. The knowledge of the subject is even more important because it can decide about your future. For everybody who would be succesful in life, need an excellent knowledge of subjects and don´t need a friendly teacher. I think nobody becomes a millionaire only because he has friendly teachers.
