the knowledge of the subject is clearly more important than the teacher's ability to relate with students, because it doesnt matter how good your relation with your teache is when you fail the subject and cant pass the class. its good to do well with your teacher it makes many things quit easier for you but you must understand the subject to pass the class.  and when you have a bad relation with your teacher its bad but you can focus on the subject and easily pass the class. the worst thing you can do is to give the teacher reasons to hate you and dont follow the course. you get bad notes and at home your parents arent hyped of notes so your life at home doesnt be better so. sometimes its better to have a teacher whose relation with students is quit bad so you must focus on the subject and work for it to get the respect of the teacher to get goog grades. but when you have a very good relation with your teacher can it also helps you because he doesnt want to give you bad notes so ich talks with about your focus in class and tells you what you can do for becoming a better student and it gives you a good feeling in class and you have no fear to say something but when you have that relation with your teacher that you fall in an relax mode and dont do anything more and the teacher must give you a bad note. in my opinion it must be a good mix of having a good relationship with your teacher and excellent knowledge of the subject but a little bit more knowledge of the subject because when you have the knowledge and you get a new teacher youre directly good in his class so when you just have a good relation with your teacher it dosnt helps you in a new class. lol 34
