In this text i will answer the question, if it is better to have a teacher with exellent relation to the students or to have a teacher, who has better knowlege of the subject being taught.
On the first hand when the teacher has better knowlege about the theme, the students will learn more in this schoolyear, because the teacher can answer the questions better. The second to say is , that this teacher would be more strict and the theme would be better learned, because it gives no breaks when a student cannot understand a question. Then the student have to learn it at home and would be more selfconfident. At least it is to say, that the students learn, that the school is for learning and not for making friends. This would taking more time.
On the other side a teacher with more relation to the students can help students wich are not understand anything, but after a longer time all students would understand the stuff out of the lessons. The lessons would be nicer too, because the teacher and the students would learn more about eachother and the atmosphere would be more nicely. At least is to say, that the students will be better educatet working with other people they don't know.
My conclusion of this is, that a better educated teacher would be better because the students would learn more in the lessons and for me its more important than to relate with a teacher, because it is weird that a teacher want to be a friend of you but you are at school to learn something and not to make friends with teachers. So i can say that it is more important to have a teacher of exellent knowlege of being taught.
