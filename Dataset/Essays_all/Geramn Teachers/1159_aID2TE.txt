On the one hand, it is very important that teacher's and students have a good and healthy relationship. Recording to his job, the teacher has to be a person where the students can have trust in him/her. The teacher has to help the students in their school problems and also in their live problems. The students can learn something better about the subject when the relationship between students and teacher's is well and without any disagreements or something like that.A good relationship makes also a motivation for learning.  

But on the other hand, the teachers and students aren't allowed to have a kind of "friendship". The students have to understand that they can trust the teachers and that they are helping them in their problems but the students have to respect the teacher and talk with him/her polietly and not like with their friends in a kind of "youth slang". Although it is important to have a good relationship, the teacher has to be also a little bit strict. Without a strict person, the students can take the subject for example english a little bit to easy and then they are thinking something like "the teacher is so nice, it doesn't matter when I'm writing a bad mark".

Recording the both sides, I have the opinion that a good relationship between teachers and students is necessary because it's an important factor of motivation by students. But the students has also to respect the teacher as a "higher person" and it's also good when the teacher is a little bit strict because when they aren´t strict, there's the danger that the students are relaxing and not learning. 
All in all, an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than the teacher's ability to relate well with students. A mix of that, will be perfect.
