The statement is "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

On one hand you can say that it is very important for a teacher to relate well with his students.  Without the ability to communicate with his students it would be very difficult to teach them the things they have to know. They wouldn´t listen when he teaches and they wouldn´t do what he says. For example: If the class speaks in the lesson and the teacher wants them to be silent, they wouldn´t as he wants but talk even louder.

On the other hand the teacher can´t theach his students something he donßt know himself. He has to know the subject well otherwhise the students have no chance to understand what he wants to tell them. Another point is that a teacher should know the subjact well because he has to correct the students if they make mistakes. If he can´t do so the students will think they do everything right and repeat it. In grammar for example they will use the same wrong form again and again untill someone tell them that it is wrong.

In my opinion a teacher should be able to do both: have a good relation to his students and have a good knowledge of the subject. I think it´s even more important that the teacher can teach. The students should understand what the teacher wants to teach them and how they can solve the problem they stand in front of.
