In the following text y will show the pro and cons of the question it is importent that a teacher is nice with his studens or is it more importent that the teacher prefer the excellent knowledge in the subject. I think it is a very difficult question because, the knowledge in an subject is very importent to understand everythink and to show the studens the knowledge. The teacher musst teach the students well don, because they need a job when they go out of school and then tehy need a big knowledge in many themas
When the teacher has no excellent knowledge in this subject you can wright  tests or exames and than you can get a nice great, because you has not a big knowledge 
But wehen a techer give you a good mark, because the teacher found you very nice than it is very unfair, to a classmaid when he is better in this subject, but he became a very bad mark. 
But when you not so good at school, but you fight for good marks and the teacher found that good than I found you can get a good mark. Also it is importent that the teacher understand the students very well because a studend can more lern when the teacher are very nice and friendly to you. It has a more positive efect wehen a techer is nice to his studens,because the studens want to work than more and they are more motivat. Also when they had not excellent knowledge at school. 


I found both things are importen for the teachers and the students, because they need a good relationship to work motivat in school and have fun to work. But the teacher need also a excellent knowledge.
