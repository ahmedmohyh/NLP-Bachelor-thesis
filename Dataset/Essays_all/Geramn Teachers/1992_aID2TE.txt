Both is important. If a teacher is able to relate well with students it is as important as having a good knowledge of the subject he or she is teaching. If you can exlain the content very well thats one thing but explaining the important and right things is as important. A good knowledge is essential for a teacher because the teacher needs to be able to answer critical questions or help the student if they don't understand a topic. Without a good knowlegde they can't really do so. For example in the subject maths, it is imortant for a teacher to be able to do both.The teacher has to relate the topics to the students so they can understand even the difficult exercise but they also need to have the knowledge so their explanation is good to understand and correct. Teachers have to be fair and treat every single student with respect, the learning enviroment is very important and every student has to be happy in class so they can fully concentrate on what the teacher is doing. It is important that the teacher uses devices like videos ,... to make it easier for the student to understand the content. I Think it is important for a teacher to combine both, exellent knowledge and creating relatable explanations for the students. They need both to create a understandable and well structured style of teaching.
