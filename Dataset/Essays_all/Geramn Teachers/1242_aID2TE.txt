When dealing with a topic about school and teachers you always have to have in mind which role teachers play in the 'growing-up process' of your children.
It´s them ones children are facing almost every day for six to eight hours and therefore it's urgently necessary that teachers have the ability to construct a relationship to their students consisting of trust and respect. But nevertheless you cannot ignore the factor 'knowledge' as far as education is concerned. As said before teachers play an important role when it comes to education and that's the reason why you, as a parent, have to insist on a teacher who knows what he or she is doing. What's the use of a teacher loved by every student he teaches but unable to give a lesson properly. But a teacher who knows his stuff perfectly but is uncapable of constructing a relationship to his or her students is'nt a proper teacher as well.
In my opinion it is necessary to find a good mix. A teacher who can deal with the problems of his or her students but he or her also has to be able preparing the children for life. Only a teacher like that would be the 'perfect' one.
