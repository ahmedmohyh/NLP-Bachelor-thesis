It is obvious, that a teacher, who can't answer questions concerning his subject is not capable of teaching the students his entire topic. If I were to ask, for example, my teacher about something that is not exactly the current topic, but in some way connected to it, and he couldn't prepare for that, an expert could easily answer it anyway, whereas a more unprofessional teacher couldn't help me, I might be missing something on the subject due to a lack of more certain information. It also is often so, that an excellent knowledge of his subject helps a teacher to fully understand it, therefore being better at explaining it. For example, a science teacher, who understands the way an atom is build, always has an clear advantage to someone who doesn't, as this topic intersects with many others of his subject. However, a person, who knows his topic even to the last inch is incapable of being a teacher, when he can't relate to the students. What use is it, when you have a teacher, who has all the insight, but can't transfer his knowledge to the students? A teacher, who has mastered his subject, but can't understand how the students see it, is often to fall into complex explanation, only understandable for the most intellegent students or people, who already have that knowledge, while a teacher, who might have less insight, can empathise with the students and therefore explain it in a more understandable way. In my opininon, an teacher who has expert insight is of no use, if he can't explain it to the students, where a teacher, even with less expertise, who can relate to the students, is able of teaching them at least something in his subject. Therefore, I believe, a teacher first needs to be able to relate to students, in order to teach anything, than to be an foremost expert on the topic.
