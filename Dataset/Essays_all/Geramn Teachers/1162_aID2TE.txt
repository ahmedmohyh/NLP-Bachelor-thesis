My opinion to the subject if a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more impotant than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is divided.
The students have to learn important things at school, which are needed in life. That´s the reason why I think it´s very important to know nearly everything about a subject at school.
But I also think, that the relationship between stundent and teacher is important for the students to learn and to affort good results. If they like the teacher who is teaching a subject they don´t understand or don´t like, they will rather ask them for help than a teacher they hate.
The relationship also has a big influence on the teacher understanding the students and their problems. This also concerns problems children have at home with their parents. A teacher isn´t only a person students have to respect, but also someone they can talk to.

These arguments are the reason, why my opinion is divided. On one side, it´s important for the students to learn and a good relationship between teacher and student can have a good influence. On the other hand, it can be helpful to have someone the students can talk to if they have problems with the subjects or private ones. A teacher can sometimes also be a better person to talk to than the own parents, because teachers maybe identify more with the problems they have.
I think it´s good and important for a teacher to find the belance between teaching a subject and having a good relationship with the students, for them and for the teacher.
