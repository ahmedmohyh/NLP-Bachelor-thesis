It is always necassary as a teacher to know is subject nearly perfect to teach the stundents in a good way but it's also very important that there is a good connection between those.
A teacher is someone you often see more than one in a week so it's much nicer if he get along with the stundents.The climate in class is very important for good results and this often depends in huge way on the teacher. He should be someone you also would go to if you have a problem or a question. There are many stundents which have a problem but they don't want to go to their teacher because they are afraid e.g.
On the other hand it would be very bad if there is someone who's nice and trustful to his student but can't teach the students many things because then there would be no sense of going to school execpt of having a good time. 
Another positive argument is that the interest of a subject could be much better if the teacher finds the right way to get along with them. If a subject makes fun it is easier to learn for it and take part in the lessons. So if  there is someone who gets angry everytime a student says something wrong it is obvious that they dont want to take part in his lessons.
In my opinion a teacher should find the middle of both because this is the point of a good and competent teacher. The mix of someone like a friend and a respect person will make the subject learnful and nice at the same time.
