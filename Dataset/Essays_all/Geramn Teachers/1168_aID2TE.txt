In the following text I discuss how important a teachers ability to relate well with students is.
 I don't disagree and i don't agree with the statememnt fully.
My first reason is, that both of the things are important but your topic is a good graduation. Then you have to look how you can reach this topic and that topic you not only reach, if your teacher is nice to you. The teacher have to know everything about his subject and he have to explain the thematic easily for the students, that they have no understanding problems. One basacilly point is, that the students want learn more, if the teacher has a good ability to relate well with the students. Furthermore you can see that a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject, but a bad ability to the students, isn't a good teacher, because the stundenst so have no fun at learning and that is more than usefull. Important is that a teacher make both things well, so it's better for the students and for the teacher. Exspecially when you want to have a good graduation you need a good realationship between you and your teacher and when then he has an excellent knowledge about his subject then it's perfect. so you can see that nothing is more important from the two things, but both things together are really important.
