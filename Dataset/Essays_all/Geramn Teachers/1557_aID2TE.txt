The time in school is for stundents a very important time and necessary for the whole life of them. Also the marks are not less important to get a good job. Because of this importance the stundents must learn very much in school, but they must relate well with the teacher. Also for the teachers their job is not that easy the stundens thought. So it is important for them, too, to relate well with the stundents. 

It is not positive to have an excellent knowledged teacher, when he is a bad person, who treats the sudents very miserable. For example a stundent learns very much and understand all things in schol, but if the teacher hates children and is very unfriedlich to the stundens, the stundent will be bad in school. 
But on the other hand the teacher´s ability to relate well with students is not the only thing a teacher must be. If a teacher is friedliy an gives good marks always, the stundnets won´t learn anything.

So for me there ist no right answer and there are not only black and white. A very good teacher is fair and friendly, he does not hates a stundent for no reason.But he must be excellent knowledged of the subject and teaches the stundent, that they have an chance to be good at school. There must be an balance between this criteriens.
