In the following paragraphs I am going to explain some arguments regarding the following statement 'A techars's ability to realte well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught'. 
On the one hand it is important that the teachers get along well with students, because that's how they can teach their students better. If the teacher knows his students well he knows which methods he should use so that the students can learn the subjects. It is more important that the students learn at least a little bit than nothing. It means that is not as important that the teacher knows everything as he knows how to treat his students. 
On the other hand it is also important that the teacher knows a lot about the subject. It is their job, so they have to know everything about their subject. How are the students supposed to learn something if even the teacher doesn't know a lot about the topic. 
An other argument to support the statement is that the students are more motivated to go to school if they like their teachers. And if they like their teachers it is more likely that they learn more. It could be possible that if the teacher is nice, the students don't skip the classes and do their homwork. It is also easier to help and support the students if the teacher is nice. 
But to be realistic school isn't there to be friend with your teacher. School is there to study and to learn so that the students have good opportunities to get a job in the future. That's why it is very important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject they teach, otherwise the students won't be prepared fot ther final exams so that it is hard for them to graduate. 

In my opinion it is good when your teacher is nice. It really makes you want to go to school and it makes school more fun. But it is not necessary. You can learn as much as if you have a teacher you don't like.
