Teachers are human beeings. Like every other of the human kind they can be subjective or objective and have feelings and emotions. Relating well with students is a big aspect: To my knowledge is the way student and techer communicate with each other the effectiveness of how much the student can keep the things the teacher says in his mind. Ateacher who often makes students laugh and happy during teaching leads to better learning. Strong emotions are stored better in the minds of humans, teachers can take advantage of this and connect happiness with the subject beeing taught. If a grumpy teacher let students only read books or copy text from the whiteboard, the subject feels boring and less information is stored in the student´s minds. Interaction, creativity and the teacher´s ability to realte well with students are some examples to let the student better learn. 
But if the teacher does not or less know what he is teaching can lead to disadvantages for the students in the future. When the students do not learned what they should have learned then exams can not be fully answered, they need special help during studying in universities or at working. 

All in all I agree with the statement, excellent knowledge of a subject can not lead that students remember everything from a subject. Ability to relate with students is the best way to teach.
