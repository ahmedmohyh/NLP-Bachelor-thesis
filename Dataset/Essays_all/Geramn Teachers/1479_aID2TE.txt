While discuss about a statement like "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" you will hear many different oppinions.
On the one hand a good relation between the teacher and the students is very important because both of them should have fun in class. When having fun together the students will be listening more and take part in the lesson. Neither the teacher or the students want an atmosphere in that everybody is just sitting in the room and watching at the person in front. 
On the other hand it is of course very important that teacher have a good knowledge as well because at the end of the school everything that counts are the grades. If there's such a good relation and everybody is listening to the teacher it's absolutly unnescessary if the teacher isn't even able to explain anything.
Also  a teacher does not get paid for being friend with the students. He need to give his knowledge to the students. Of course it's generally good when there's a good relation but a problem here is that the students easily can't see their teachers as an autority anymore and more like a friend of them. When this should happen a teacher isn't able to teach his students anymore, because they just not see any reason to listen. 
I think it's part of the job of a teacher to find a perfect mix how to handle his students so that there's not this boring and strict atmosphere but the students still see him as an autority and show him respect. Of course that's something the teacher alone is unable to cause. To find a mix like this both sides need to interact with each other, so that they all will have fun in class and good grades.
