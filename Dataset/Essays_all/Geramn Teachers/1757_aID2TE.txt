Students often complain about 'bad or mean teachers' so maybe the focus of teachers should be mostly on their relation with the students than on their excellent knowledge of every subject.
First of all, I think a teacher is supposed to have an accurate knowledge of the subject to be able to answer every question and to be able to explain everything correctly so that the students aren't disadvantaged. But most of the students don't remember everything the teacher says and many subjects are just not relevant for school neither for life so it's not important if the teacher knows every single detail of every subject. In case there still is the internet that can easily be used in a lesson.
In my opinion students prefer teachers that are nice and care about their students. Also these teachers mostly don't want their students to get bad grades which is good for both sides. As a result students don't have that much stress in school which would probably lead to a lower number of cases of depression or burn-out. In addition it is possible that the students don't miss the lessons that often because they have a better relation with the teachers and aren't nervous or stressed before going to class. 
The difficulty to agree to the statement is the behavior of the students to their teachers. Many teenagers can be really disrespectful which is even more easy if the teachers are nice to them. So that is the important aspect to maintain if this ability was announced to be more important than the knowledge because if the repect is guarded there would be many advantages for everyone.
