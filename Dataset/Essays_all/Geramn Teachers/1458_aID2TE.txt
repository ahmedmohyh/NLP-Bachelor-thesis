The question wheter the teacher should relate better with students or have a better knowledge of the subject is a very controverse one.
Firstly when the teacher is the 'best friend' of the students but has no idea of the subjects, the students will have a good time with the teacher but when the time comes to write an exam, they will fail because they didn't learned during the lessons. But it is very important that the teacher has a good connection to the students because when they don't like him they won't listen to him even when has excelent knowledge of the subject. In my oppinion you need to have some knowledge but more importantly you also have to relate well with the students as a teacher. Because you can have the best knowledge in the world but when nobody in class is listening to you because you are very unfriendly you can't get your job done and teach something.
