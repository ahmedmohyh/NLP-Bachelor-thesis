Teachers do often have various qualities, some are more socially talented and some have a great knowledge of their subject, but which of these qualities is more important? Let`s take a look.
At firt I`d like to look at the fact, that teachers who can`t deal with students do often have problems to actually teach them, because they can`t get to the students minds. Because of that, they can`t give the students their knowledge and what good is it to know everything about a subject, if you can`t tell anyone about it, because you`re untalented? 
On the other hand a teacher with less knowledge about his or her subject often has problems to keep the students attention to the lesson, because it`s either borring or it makes no sense. But those do often have brilliant social qualities and are able to stick to the students minds and actually teach them something. Even if it`s not as much as a teacher with a big knowledge could teach, at least it is something.
In my opinion it`s better to have a teacher with social talents, than with a huge knowledge but without social skills, because tose teachers do often give their students bad grades, because the students don`t know anything in their opinion. A social teacher may not leave much knowledge in the students minds, but they are more likely to give good grades, because their expectations aren`t that high.
To summ it up I would say, that both options aren`t great and I think a fusion between the both possibilities would be the best case.
