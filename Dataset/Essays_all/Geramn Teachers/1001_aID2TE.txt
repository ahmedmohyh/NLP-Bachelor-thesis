"Is the teacher´s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?", this is the subject of the following comment, in which i show arguments for and against the thesis.

Nowadays it is usual that students think their grades are based on the relation between them and their teacher. Besides  one can recognize that students work better in lessons and write better grades when they like the teacher. So that are two reasons which agree with the thesis that the relation between students and teachers is more important than the knowledge of the teacher, which he teaches the students.
It´s a normal reaction, if one like how the teacher buildt up his lessons so that one can understand everyzhing well the student has more fun and gets ambitionat to learn more for school.
Oh the other hand it can go in the wrong direction. If the relation between students and teacher becomes too strong it can happen that the students don´t have enough respect for him/her any more. The consequence can be that the teacher has no chance to teach the students well, because they don´t take his lessons serious.

At my opinion a good relation between students and teachers is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. However it should not cross a special level, so that the teacher ist still seen as a higher ranked person. At this way students can be better at school but the teachers can also bring across their knowledge.
So one can say that the excellent knowledge from a teacher is just useful if he can relate well with his students so that he/she can teach them well.
