In the following I will discuss the statement "A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". 
One argument for the statement that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important is, that the students would learn more. So they would be better informed abou this subject. If the teacher really knows what to do and when he do, he could teach it the students in a better way, because then it is the most efficient.
But on the other hand an argument for the statement that a teachers ability to relate well with the students is more important is, that a strict teacher, who cannot relate with the students very well, makes the subject less interesting. When you do not like the teacher because of some reasons, you would not want to have this subject anymore. So you would not learn that much, when you are not interisted in this subject. 
To put it in a nutshell you can say that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But I think that the best way to solve this problem is a mix of both of the aspects: A teacher, who can relate well with students with a perfect knowledge of the subject being taught.
