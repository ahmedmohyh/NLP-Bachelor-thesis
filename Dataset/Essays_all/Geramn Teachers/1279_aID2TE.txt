I think, that a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is really more important then an excellent knowledge of the subjekt, because for the students is has no big effekt, when the teacher has a big knowledge of his subjekt but he can´t show it to the students and the students didn´t unterstand, than there is no adatude for his knowledge. Another reason for this is, a teacher must see it, when there is a student who can´t learn so fast as the other students, there are always some, they don´t come with, when the teacher makes a leason, if the teacher doesn´t release it, it´s bad for the student, because he don´t get a chance for it, maybe he understands it better in a second time. It´s also important, that the teacher knows his job and is the same to every student and don´t have one favourite student who makes the leason anlone with the teacher, because than the other stundent can´t show that they unterstand the thema too and so they maybe can´t get such a good mark for this subjekt. Another reason is, when a stundet doesn´t feel well, because he has got problems at home, with friends or in school, the teacher must see this and talk with the stundet about it, because maybe this is a reason, that he isn´t that good at school in the moment. Also the teacher must be a normal person because he or she stands over the students and they have to look up to the teacher and take him for real. But the teacher also must have a big knowledge, but an a level, that he can overbring it to his student, because they have their whole life bevor them and the schooltime is an big thing for it and their later job. All in one i think, that a teacher must have a big and good knowlegde but he must understand a student too.
