In my opinion it is more important that the teacher relates well with students than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Students feel more motivated by talking when teachers recognize that the student does not understand the stuff or the student does not feel good. Moreover, individual problems can be solved. School is not a building where students learn something about Goethe or Shakespeare, it is more than that. Students schould learn something, which is really necessary for their future, for example they have to learn to trust in people or to talk about problems even they do not like it. School is a location where students earn knowledge for their life and such teacher, who relate well with students, are really necessary. 
Students do not listen every time the teacher tells all his knowledge in an indirectly way. Students feel bored fast. It is nice, when the teacher knows so much but in the most cases the teachers can not share it with students because the students are not even interested in it. 
On the other hand it is also important to be taught by teachers, who have a knowledge. Every student has different goals and maybe some students are really interested in the subject, for example students want to become a Latin teacher, it is important that the teacher has a big knowledge. 
While writing this essay my opinion changed a little bit. I personally think a teacher should have both facilities. On the one hand he has to motivate students and has to be there for them and on the other hand he has to have an excellent knowledge of his subject the teacher is teaching. For me, it is important that the teacher does not only tell his knowledge, he really has to explain it so students understand what he  is talking about.
