The following text says if I agree or disagree with the given statement. 

In my opinion, the relationship between teachers and students is quite important. If teachers would for example be very rude to their students, the knowledge they might have wouldn`t be very useful anymore because students wouldn´t have fun in school, so maybe their grades could be influenced. But on the other hand, teachers who don´t have the necessary knowledge could also have a bad influence to the students because they wouldn´t understand anything. 

To conclude, you could say that it is not true that the relationship between teachers and students is more important than their knowledge of the subject because when they are not able to give knowledge to the students, a good relationship wouldn`t be helpful anymore. But in generall, a good relationship between teachers and students could be very helpful in conclusion to a good knowledge that teachers have.
