A teacher has to know his subject to teach it to his/her students. If his/her knowledge goes even beyond the things being used in the class, he/she can explain more complex questions that students may have easily. A tracher who maybe doesnt know every answere but is related well with the students could also take the time and research to a specific question and explain it to his students but not as fast as a teacher with execellent knoweledge. 
If a teacher has a good relationship with his students they have more "fun" during the classes and are willed to learn more than while a teacher`s class they dont like. The success of learning of the class doesn´t only relate to the impact of information which the teacher can bring to his/her specific subject but also to the will of the students to learn from their teacher.
So a good relationship between students and teacher can be more effective than bare knowledge of a teacher. His/her knowledgehas to be taught, it doesn`t matter how well they are informened if they can`t make the students understand it.
In my opinion a teacher has to know his subject well enough to teach it and everything that is relevant for his class. It is good if his knowledge goes even further beyond but not naissesary if all his students can understand the importing things. It is mroe comfortable for stundents and teacher if they have a good relationship because the students are willed to listen to the teacher and the theacher is willed to make compromises, longer brakes etc..
