The statement, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thought can be seen in different ways.
First of all a teacher is a person a student rely on because he has one of the most important autority rolls in his life. He should teach him for the future, he is the person that leads the children into adulthood and the world which is the reason why students trust their teacher in any situation. This lack of knowledge could lead to difficulties in the future of the children beacause they have not been teached well enough. 

But how can you learn form a teacher you do not get along with? If a teacher is fully imcompetent and does not understand the way students think and feel he will not be a person to relate on inasmuch ascget autority and respect. A child needs a relateable person inside school too, especially when a child has to bear with much pressure.

In my opinion a teacher is supposed to fulfill both of these, knowledge and the ability to relate with the reason that a child can get the best education.
By relying on the teacher and also have the possibility to get and keep the knowledge of a teacher a child has the best oppertunities to be lead into a good future.
