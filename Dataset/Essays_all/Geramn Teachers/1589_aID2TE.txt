Everyone of us know the one teacher, which is funny, but can't teach and the other teacher, which is very strict, but teaches a lot of stuff. But it is really more important to relate well with students then to have excellent knowledge? In the following I will answer this question and mention advantages and disadvantages.

First I want to say that it's of course important to have a good relationship between teacher and students, so that they can talk and have funny lessons together, but the teacher should be able to answer all questions of the students and also to plan a strict lesson in which he teaches the students a lot. So the students should be able to get a good grade in exams, tests or something like this.
Mainly it's important that the teacher teach the students a lot of stuff, so that they have a chance for a good school end. Everyone, who is interested in your grades, doesn't want to know if your teacher was cool or if your relationship was good.
For example if you have a nice teacher, who is funny and you have a lot of good lessons with him, but he can't teach you the very important stuff because of his missing knowledge. You have to study at home and learn everything by yourself to write a good grade. 
Or the other way, when you have a bad teacher, who is always strict and you can't laugh with him, but he teaches you everything and you can write a good grade nearly without studying at home. Which one would you like to have?
In my opinion I would definitely choose the strict teacher, so that I have free-time at home and can realx instead of always studying just because my teacher haven't got enough knowledge.

In conclusion I would say that the knowledge of the teacher is more important than the ability to relate well with the students, because the teacher decides about the future of the students with his decisions.
