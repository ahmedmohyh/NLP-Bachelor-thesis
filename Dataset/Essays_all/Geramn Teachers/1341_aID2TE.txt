For example me, in the english lessons I'm very shy because I have difficults to speek and understand the language. 
If i have a strengh teacher and bad classmates I don't say anything, but if I have a good teacher who are nice and relat well with me and my classmates I am trying to speek english. The teachers are the most important fact in school life, they can make your school live good and helpfully for your future, but also they can make it bad,and give you bade notes, after a few years you aren't motivated any more and haven't good grades for example in english.
Of course it is very important that students are learning english because it is a very populare world speech and you need it often in life but this is the point!! The teacher must do the lessons atractive and with fun, if they didnt do this, many students speek no word in englisch/other speech. And the excellent knowledge of  the subject are coming with the time. And I think it's in all subjects, if you have a bad biologie theacher and you give a shit of lesarning the facts and informations you can't be good in educating yourselfe. I hope in the future only people who can be nice with kids are going to be teachers.
