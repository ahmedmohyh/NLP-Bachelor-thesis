Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than knowledge of the subject being taught ? well, it is important that teachers have a good relation to their students because that is the first step to a good workingship. They have to give their students the feeling to be a team. So nobody has to be shy to ask something. 
But it is also important as a teacher to have a good knowledge of the subject which is being taught. Everybody in class has to understand the subject and if a teacher doesn't know how to explain it to a student or isn't able to tell something about this subject, this can't be a correct teacher.
Of course the knowledge of the subject shouln't be excellent, it just should be enough and good. But 'excellent' is way to much. 
In my opinion a teacher should have a good relation to his students and a normal knowledge of the subject being taught. This is my opinion about this topic because some teachers at my school who have an excellent knowledge of a subject, just don't know how to teach it their students. Their tasks are awful and nobody understands the topic. But if these teachers were nice they could explain it to their students but they aren't. I guess that they don't know how to relate well eith students.
