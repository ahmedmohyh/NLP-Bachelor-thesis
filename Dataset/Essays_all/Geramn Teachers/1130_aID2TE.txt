The following text talks about the question: Is a teachers ability to relate to students more importent than having an excellent knowlege about the subject beeing taught? 
To find out which kind of teacher is better or if they are both useless I´ll compare them to eachother.
I´ll beginn with the teacher who has the ability to relate to his students, but who has not a really good knowledge about the subject. 
I found two arguments for the pro side. The first one is that there is a good chemistry in class between the students and the teacher. That means, that whatever the teacher teaches the students, they I´ll understand. The second pro argument is, that the lessons would be more fun.
The contra side basicly has just one big argument. It is that the students won´t learn enough, and that has a lot of consequences. For example if a student wants to go to college after finishing high school, he won´t be able to reach the niveau of knowledge they request.
The teacher with a lot knowledge, who can´t relate to students on the other hand is not better.
On the pro side is only the argument that he technically could teach the students everything they need to know.
On the contra side we see that doesn´t really matter, because he can´t relate to them and so they have no fun and they won´t learn anything.

So all in all I think both types of these teachers aren´t really good, because they fail the goal of theaching students. The best solution would be a teacher who covers both, knowledge and the ability to relate to students! 
Coming back to the question, which one is better? I´d say the teacher who can relate to his students. I think that, because even if you learn nothing, you at least had fun! So I agree with the statement!
