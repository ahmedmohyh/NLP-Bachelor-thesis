I do not aggre with the statement "A techer`s ability to relate well with students is more important than ecxellent knowledge of the subject being taught" because students need to handle their school experiences and their pressure which causes by school things by themselves.
This opinion young people should have was taught them by their parents. They taught them to be independant and strong, to manage things by semselves. That is one point why I think teachers should not threat their students like babys which dont know how to act in life. 
Besides I think it is not needed that the teacher is warm-hearted with some studens. This could be a problem in various advantages of studens, because the teacher was threating one student better than another.
In addition to that I also thing that excellant knowleght of a sovereight, like the prof in school, is very impotant for teenagers to learn and study well. The prof is a person some people want to look up on. In the situation the prof relates well with his/her students there is no threatening or respectful distance between the teacher and her/his students.

In conclusion, the statement "A teachers ability to relate well with students is more impotant tha excellant knowledge of the subject being taught" do not work in my opinion because I think that the very important distance between stundent and teacher is missing.
