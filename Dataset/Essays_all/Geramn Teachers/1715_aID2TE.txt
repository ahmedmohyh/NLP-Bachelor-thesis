Most days at school aren`t easy for student and some teacher make it even worse.

If a teacher knows his subjekt well and can answer all your questions perfectly that is a good thing but if he can`t relate to his students and they can`t or don`t want to understand what he is teaching they won`t learn anything. Also if it is the other way around and everyone is listening and understands the teacher but he does not know the subjekt very well the students can`t learn anything and they would miss things they may need to know at the college or at a later job. Maybe they get good grades and a nice college but they won`t be as good as the other student and maybe they would fail. 

School is not about having fun all the time and doing what you want to do it is about learning and proving yourself so you will have a nice future and sometimes some students can`t relate to teachers but they have to listen carefully and try to understand the subjekt to get good grades and to know things for the future.

It is more important to get a subjekt told right than a teacher who can relate to his students well because that won`t get you a good college or a job with a high sallary even if a wrong told subjekt is as bad as a teacher who can`t relate with his students at all, but most likely that is not the case.
