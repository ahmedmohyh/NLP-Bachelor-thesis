A teacher is the backbone of future generations knowledge. They must not only teach the children the subject like chemistry or foreign languages but they must teach their pupils how to deal with problems in their lifes and how to deal with other people. 
So I find this statement quite contradicting because, like I said, a teacher must not only relate well with their students but he must teach them hisor her subject, too. It is good of course when you can relate to your students and understand them. It´s not only easier for you to teach them something but it makes it easier for the pupils, too. If you can relate to them they can relate to you. But it is a huge problem when you can not teach them something when you do not have any knowledge about your subject at all. When you are a teacher like this it is quite hard for students to learn something because you can not relate to them so they feel kind of alone in your lessons. In addition to that when you have excellent knowledge about your subject you are like in you own world and you are likely to drift away from the topic you must teach the students because you just have so much knowledge about the subject and are likely to give them every information you know even if the dont really need it in their test. So you have kind of hard lessons because the students can not really follow you. But when you can relate to the students and have excellent knowledge about the subject you are the perfect teacher. 

I do not agree or disagree with the statement because it is quite twisted. It´s not only important to have the ability to relate well with pupils but in addition to that you must know your subject well or even have excellent knowledge about it. Even when you can relate with the students you can not teach them anything if you do not know your subject. So both are important and not only one.
