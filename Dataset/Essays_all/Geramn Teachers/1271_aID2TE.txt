Does a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important tha excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? Pro's, Con's and my own opinion.

It's good for the relationship between the studdent and the teacher, but i think it has to stay on a normal level. The students are in school to learn something and not to have fun with their teachers. It would be good if the students and the teacher like each other, because the students are more confident to learn. If the teacher is very angry, the students just wont learn. Also the lessons have to be interesting. For students its boring to read all timme, they want to get involved, discuss with their Partners and so on. Also the teacher must know excellent about the sunject he is taughting, if this wouldn't be like this, he isn't a good teacher and the students wont learn enough. You can't teach addition in 9th Class if they want to get their a-levels. So it has to be a thing between a well relation between students and teacher and the perfewct knowledge about subject, which is being taught. I made my own experiences with this, i have better marks in subjects wiht teachers who i know well.
