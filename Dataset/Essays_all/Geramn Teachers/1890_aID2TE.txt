The above statement somewhat represents the clash of an older view on education versus a more modern view. In past times the people in charge of the education system really didn't care whether or not the students could "relate" to their teacher, they had to listen or they got some with the stick. The student's sympathy towards their teacher and how that affects the ability and speed of learning became more of a topic circa in the late 20th century. Important here is the term "excellent knowledge". Of course a teacher should (even must) have enough or good knowledge for the kind of school and the grades he will be teaching at, but if it comes to the question of him having more than enough knowledge versus him being unusually good at handling young students, I would always choose the latter. As physical punishment isn't accepted anymore in most modern countries and schools, the most common reaction among students if their teacher is - in their own language - "an asshole" (i.e. not in the least relatable, overly sturn) is rebellion. The most common form of which is just not to listen or participate in class, which leads to the student not learning anything. Authority just isn't as much of an accepted concept anymore as it once was (at least not in that sense). Another important point is language and manner of speaking. The way the teacher communicates with his students. If the teacher uses language in a way that the common student of today would descripe as "boring", which many "old school" teachers somehow tend to do, most of said students aren't very likely to listen.
The best teachers obviously are the ones who have it both but in the 21st century a teacher should really focus on his empathy more than knowing more than he has to.
