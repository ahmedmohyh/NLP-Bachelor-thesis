I agree with the following statement because it is really better to have a good relationship to the students, because if the students hate the teacher they don't want to learn something. The students can bulling the teacher and this not so good for the teacher. If the students like the teacher they are happy and want to learn something. If I like a teacher I listen to him or I have questions to our subject, but if I hate the teacher I haven't fun in the subject or I haven't fun to make my homework. It is really better to have a good relationship, because it makes more fun in the subject and the other students have fun too.
 If I love the subject I have fun to learn or to make my homework. It is really cool to present my homework, because the teacher is happy about this and I get a good grade. 
But if the teacher are not so friendly then I won't present my homework, because I know he doesn't like it and I get a bad grade, because he doesn't like me. If the teacher's are not friendly or they don't like us, then I haven't fun to go to the school. I think  to stay home but thats not good for my knowledge and my family won't that, that I stay home,because I must go to the school.
Many students won't go to the school, because they haven't fun in the subject. If many students have the same oppinion than it isn't good for us, because than we have not so many students and this is not good for the school and for the teacher. Some students get a bad grade because they are not so good in sport or something like else, but this is not a reason to give them a bad grade.
