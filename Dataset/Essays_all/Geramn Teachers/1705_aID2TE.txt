A teacher today is more than just a person who is sitting infront of students, telling and teaching them new knlowledge about the subject. It's a person who can and must be trustend, who should communicate and interact with pupils. But what is more important? The ability of the teacher to relate well with the students or an excellent 
knwoledge of the subject being taught? 

A teacher who interacts well with his students, who teach them in other ways and methods is often a very popular teacher becasuse of the fact that pupils want interesting lessons with differnet teaching ways. For example if a teacher plays games with them which can also give students knowledge, they talk to each other, maybe they move a little bit in their class rooms, but the main point is that they have fun in learning new things. And if they have fun, they are probably more motivated.

If a teacher does not interact with his students like its said above, if he is just giving his knowledge to the stundents like its written in a book, is he than a bad teacher? No he isn't. It could be more efficient! Maybe the students do not have so much fun just reading, writing and listen to their teacher but if he has got a perfect knowledge and good methods to give all his knowledge to his pupils than he's a a very good teacher. And when a teacher doesn't ralte well with students and doesn't interact with them it does not mean that students are not motivated. A teacher with excellent and big knoledge can tell storys which maybe are important life lessons.

Comming back to the question which teacher is the best, the one who relates well with his students or the one with the excellent knowledge in his subejct and maybe in generall knwoledge, I would say there can't be a winner. The one with the knowledge is maybe more effective but the one with the ability to ralate well with pupils can motivate them better to learn new stuff which is also a task for a todays teacher.
