The following statement is important,because this topic is for all humans relvant.
I agree with this statement.
On the one hand it´s importrant what the students learn,but on the other hand it´s more important how the students learn. 
When the studens relate well with the teacher they would have more fun in school and lern well.
Fun in school is important to learn,because if you had an teacher,who is not funny and is all the time angry,when you answerd wrong,you wouldn´t learn good.
In this situation maybe you get in trouble and you feel not good.
If the teacher isn´t interested to you and he does always "hard" lessons,you would be boring.
Maybe you had an problem  for example with your englisch speak it´s well when you had an good relationsship to the teacher and you could tell him your problem.
But when the relationsship to them isn´t there ,you can not tell him the problem and maybe you get an bad great.
All in all I can say the teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
