In some schools the relationship between students and their teachers is a very friendly one. So the question if a good, friendly relationship with students or a bad relationship but good knowledge about the subject beeing taught is more important, may comes up.

With a good relationship to their students, but a small knowledge of the topiche has to teach, the teacher has many different opportunities to structure their lessons. The positive aspect about having such a good relationship with their students is that the students can easily understand what the teacher wants to teach them. But with a student-orientated teaching method the teacher could not be able to teach them as much as a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the topic, but a bad relationship to his students. 

Even if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the topic he has to teach, the students may not listen all the time, beccause they may not like him. Of course this depends on the students he has to teach. If they are willing to learn the things their teacher explains them, it doesn't matter if they have a good or a bad relationship. 

So in my opinion it depends on the stundents and their behavior towards the teacher. If they want to learn new things and it is very relevant for them, even a bad relationship with their teacher can not stop them from listening and learning things the teacher teaches them. But a teacher with a great knowledge of the subject and the ability to relate well with students would be perfect for the students, because this is the way they learn the most.
