I'd agree with that statement. 
If a teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject it's not guaranteed that he's able to teach it properly. A teacher should be able to relate and understand students' problems to find the ideal way of teaching. 
Excellent knowledge is useless if it's not possible or hard fot the students to understand. 
As a teacher knowledge isn't the only necessary character trait that is needed, a teacher works with hundreds of children and teenagers as well as with his colleagues and thus should be able to socialise with them, should know how to treat people and not only depend on his own skills and experiences.
Once a student has a teacher that isn't able to properly teach it will be hard for the student to catch up and most likely would have to get tutoring classes and etc. 
A teacher should also be able to understand the struggles of the students, some might have problems with public speaking and some others with the pressure they have to deal with.
There will be students that are physically or mentally disabled. Not understanding or straight up ignoring those issues should not be tolerated since mistreatment as well as not recieving proper education (the class being taught by that teacher) will lead to immense problems later on in that student's life.
I'm not claiming that good knowlddge is unimportant but in my opinion the ability to relate well with students is something every teacher should have.
