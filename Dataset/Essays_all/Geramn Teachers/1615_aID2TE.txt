In many cases there is a conflict between two apparently seperate sides of teaching. Either the teacher is nice and can relate well to students or the teacher is very smart and knows everything about their subject. It is a well debated topic, whether it is more important for the teacher to be able to relate to the students or for them to have excellent knowledge of their subject.
On the one hand, a teacher who does not have excellent knowledge of their subject is prone to make mistakes or teach incorrect material, like a false date in history or an incorrect way of calculating in math. This can seriously damage a students chances later in life if they need crucial knowledge they are not given. It is also not good if the teacher cannot answer certain questions students have. They will have trouble getting the material taught, if they cannot help students when they are struggeling. A teacher who can relate well with students rarely has problems teaching them something, as long as they know what they are doing. They make the students want to learn because they have fun while doing so. They want to impress this teacher and show them what they can do and the teacher can praise them and make them feel proud of their work. Furthermore, this teacher can help and understand students on a more personal level, which often comes in handy when the student is having a particularly hard time understanding something. However this can only be done with the added factor of an excellent knowledge of the subject.
Trying to seperate the two aspects of relatability and knowledge is not smart. A teacher who only posesses one of these traits is not a good teacher. Saying one is more important is saying the other is not as important, which is just not true. Every teacher should be able to relate to and understand their students as well as know as much about their subject as they can.
