Now i am going to answer to the phrase if "a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught" 

I think you can`tsay this in this way or in oner sentence. The teacher must have a bit of ability to relate well with students that the lesson works well an the students are addicted to work with the teacher an lerning things together. Cause if the teacher has not a good relation to his students they often dont want to get taught by him. But he also has to know exactly wat he is teaching his students. It is not easy beeing a teacher and finding the right way that the course take part in the class an work well together especially with the teacher. So he has to find the middle between relate with the students and a good or well subject teaching 

It is important to have a good and friendly relation to the students while teaching them, because it is better and easier learning for the teacher and the students as well.
