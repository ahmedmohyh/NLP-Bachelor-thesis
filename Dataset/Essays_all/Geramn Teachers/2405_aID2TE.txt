In the following essay I am going to show you my opinion for the statement: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I am now going to list you my arguments against and for this statement.
My argument against this statement is that a teacher without excellent knowledge but well relation with students would not be able to teach his students. This teacher may deal very well with his students but if the stuff in class gets serious and complex then his well relation will have no value anymore, for himself as for his students. If so, the students preparation for their future will not run well, they will have problems and big, maybe even important gaps.
My argument for this statement includes an experience of myself with a teacher who may not be the teacher with the best knowledge but the one I can communicate the best. His explanaitons are very simple and easy to follow even though the stuff is complex. He tries to make everything easy and uses pictures and videos to make it easier.
To put it in a nutshell I would say that I agree with the statement because of my own experiences I made in school with different teachers.
