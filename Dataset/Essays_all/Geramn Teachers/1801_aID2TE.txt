Some People think teachers always need to know everything but there is a lot more what makes you a good teacher! In the following text I am going to discuss if the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught.
Of course the teachers should be safe in their topic and should know the most important aspects but we are all humans and nobody can know everything! We all do mistakes:teachers,pupils,parents because that is normal and it is also important to make mistakes. Furthermore the teachers should be able to answer the questions the pupils gave them but if we are honest sometimes there are very strange questions from the pupils. In my opinion there is a lot more what makes you a great teachers. It is the matching between a lot of different abilities like relate with the students, to have a good knowledge, to be nice and kind to the students. If you have the knowledge it is very good but it is not all about it. School is also there to exchange the knowledge of teacher and pupil. If the teacher had an excellent knowledge there could also be the problem that the teacher is maybe a bit arrogant because he/she is the "only one" who knows everything. 
In conclusion there is a lot more need than excellent knowledge for being a great teacher. It is good when you know a lot from you subject but the relationship which you have to you pupils is the main point. So: Yes, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught!
