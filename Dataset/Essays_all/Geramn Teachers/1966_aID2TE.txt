A teacher should have a good relation to the students, so they are not afraid to ask questions and to ask their teacher for help at subjects. On the other hand it is very important too, that the teacher has a good knowledge of the subject he is teaching too, because his lessons have a huge affect on the stundents and if the teacher has bad knowledge and just a few experiences on his subject, he can't educate the students well. Besides that a teacher should a be a person the students can trust and relate to after school. Fact is that a teacher with the ability to relate well with students knows the perspective of the students and how they think, so he can motivate them easier. He treats them as individuals and not just a group of stundents and this is important, because in this way he can help them with specific problems they have with the subject. He also realizes, if a student does not get a long and can take the pressure of him.
I agree with the statement, but both abilities are definetly important.
