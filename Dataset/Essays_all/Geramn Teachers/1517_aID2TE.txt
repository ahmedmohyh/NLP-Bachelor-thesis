A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I would not fully agree with that statement.
If a teacher is an excellent teacher and knows everything about the subject that he is teaching, but hates kids, it wouldn´t make any sense to be a teacher at a High School or something. A teacher should have to get along with his students. He doesn´t have to love them, but he has to get along with them.And the other way around, he should know something about the subject he´s teaching. If his students are really interested in the subject, but he doesn´t really know anything about it or the tells the kids that his subject is boring and he hates it, that would be the wrong way to handle it. A teacher should be passionate about teaching his subject and working with kids. The teacher shouldn`t relate too good with his students, because if he has a good relation- or friendship with his students that would be okay. But he would get in trouble for relating too good with certain students, if their relationship gets too close to each other.
I think a good teacher should have fun while teaching and should be motivated and should be able to motivate his students for his subject. Also, there is the point about the knowledge of the subject. If you become a teacher, your goal is to study a subject and to teach students about it and to bring it closer to the students. So if you don´t know anything about the subject you are trying to teach, then you shouldn´t be a teacher. I would not fully agree with that statement, because it is always important to have the ability to relate well with your students and to know a lot about the subject you are teaching.
