In my position as a student I know what it is like when the teacher just tries to get his stuff done in a short time periode. When the class dont feel save with the themes, the teacher should make sure, that even the last student will understand it, a class is just as strong as the badest one is. But it is also very important, that the teacher knows what he`s talking about, otherwise the students won't understand it either. Students will learn better when the teacher talks on their level, he shouldn't be like their friend but when the teacher is more relaxed the students will be too. When the atmosphere in the whole class is good it is easier to follow the subject and it's more like a fun time. Sometimes, when teachers are too strict, the students feel unsave but when they feel like they HAVE to do the homework well and they HAVE to write good tests, because of the teacher, the whole class get better results from their learning.
In my opinion it is very important, that a teacher can relate well with students, the class feels better when they feel like the teacher cares about them. A teacher should be good in what he taughts, but he don't has to have excellent knowledge of the subject. At least I agree with the statement, I feel definetly better with a more relaxed teacher, than with a teacher who is strict and just want to get his stuff done.
