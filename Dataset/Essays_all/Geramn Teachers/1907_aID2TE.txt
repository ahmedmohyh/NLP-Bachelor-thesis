First and foremost this essay is about the statement if the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
First of all it is an important topic. On the one hand arguments for the statement are that the ability to relate well with students maybe brings more harmony in school. Also it is possible that the students have more fun and motivation to work because the teacher is kind and not straight.
On the other hand taught a subject excellent is important for the students because they need to have a big knowledge for their school carrier.
Althought a good relation to the teacher does not bring good marks for example in the A-levels.
An example for this is also our teacher of politics. He is always friendly but we do not learn something and so nobody can choose politics as a subject in the A-levels next year. I think it is an important topic and so in my opinion the excellent knowledge of the subject is more important than relate good with teachers or students because the students future and so they need a big knowledge. Probably the students and teachers should react with respect but they do not have to be friends. For that we have our freetime and so we should learn and taught in school.
