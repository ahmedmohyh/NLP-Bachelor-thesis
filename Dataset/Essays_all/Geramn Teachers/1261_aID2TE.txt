In my opinion is the teachers ability to relate well with students not more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
When a teacher is bad to the students they can´t learn good because they are afraid that the teacher isn´t nice to them. Otherwise is it important that the teachers have to perfect knowledge about the subject, when thats not the fact, then they cannot teach the students and cannot tell something about the specific theme. The teacher doens´t should love the students and be very nice to them but he should be well and nice to them so they can learn good. When he didnt know someting about the subject he cant be a teacher. The statement says that its importnt to have an excellent knowledge, but i think that they must know the themes but it mustnt be excellent. While they be a teacher they can learn something too and some time tehy have an excellent knowledge. In my opinion the relation between teacher and student should be normal and well. When a teacher isn´t well to a student, he can get stress with the parents of the students and thats not a good fact for the school. I think both thinks are very important, without the well relationship and the excellent knowledge the lessons wouldn´t be good. 
So i think that nothing is more important than the other thing. Both facts are very important as a teacher.
