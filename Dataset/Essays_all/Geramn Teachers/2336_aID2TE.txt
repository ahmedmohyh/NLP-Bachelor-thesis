In the following text I'm goining to explain wether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent konwledge of the subject being taught or not. 
On the one hand the teacher will get less autoriter when he relate well with the stundents then when he's straid doning the lesson with excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but it's important to know the subject that you taught well bacause for example you can explain where this information come from.
But One the other hand to relate with their students is importent because most students learn better when they aren't stresst because of the teacher. They aren't afraid to question some thing because the relationship between teacher and students become more like friends.
When the relationship is more like being friends the students will be more confident to answer questions and talk to he and the class. When the teacher relate well with the students they wont get angry because of wrong answers or 'stupid' questions and the students will feel that and getting more confident. 
In my opinion both it important. As a teacher you have to know your taught subject very well but you also have to have a good realtionship with your students too. You must be prepared to explain things more deeply but the atmosphear has to be well as well. So I think that a mixture of both would be an idial way to taught students.
