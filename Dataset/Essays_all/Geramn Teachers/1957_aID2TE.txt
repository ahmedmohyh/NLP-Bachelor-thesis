School is a place where children should feel happy and safe.
The task of a teacher is to not only give his or her students such a place but furthermore to teach the students so they can achieve their dreams about their future life.
When a child feels as if the teacher doesn't like it or has the intention to make it look bad in front of the class when it doesn't know the answer to a question the child will start to dislike school and maybe even start to not go to the classes anymore.
On the other hand when a teacher can't teach the students correctly about for example political issues the students will have it hard in their adult lifes to understand different aspects of our society and our political system.
Children who have a good relationship with their teachers often have better grades so by telling teachers to be more personal with their way of interacting with their students it can be achieved to have a larger group of students with good grades and a better chance in life.
Often teachers are also there for helping students through difficult times for example when they have trouble with their parents or other students they can turn to a teacher and talk with him or her about it.
If soon to be teachers would learn more about being there for their students when they need help and give them a place where they can learn without having to worry about being humiliated in front of their classmates school would be a happier place for children.
In my opinion is the knowledge of the subject very important for being a good teacher and giving the students the ability to achieve what they wan't because of their wide knowledge but being there for your students and giving emotional support is important for being a good person, someone children can have trust in and look up to as a role model.
