I think a teacher should be able to do both. For the students, its very important that a teacher can relate them, but also be a good teacher, so both is same important. A teacher, who isn´t able to teach his subject to the students, may be funny, but students also want to be able to write good exams and the teacher couldn´t help them with that. If a teacher shows, that he can´t relate to them or understand them, the students don´t like him and they also show it in class. they won´t be motivated to follow the lesson. Students connect between the subject  and the teacher, which means that if a student hates a teacher, he also hates his subject, which could ahave a bad effect on his school carrier, because even after the teacher changes, the student still thinks that the subject is boring or terrible at first. this might change after some time with the new teacher, but the student will have a hard time, repeting the material he missed, because he couldn´t stand his old teacher. A teacher should know how to talk to the student and make them like him, but also take care of him position as  a techer who has to prepare his students for their future life. A good relation between a teacher and his students is very important, but so is the subject and knowlegde they can get from him.
