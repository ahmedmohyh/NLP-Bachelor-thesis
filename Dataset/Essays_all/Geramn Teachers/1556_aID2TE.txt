How should a teacher teach?

In the following I am going to dicuss if it is better for a teacher to relate well with students or if it is better to be more objective and showing them his knowledge.

Firstly, to look at these aspects you need to know how are the circumstances in which the students are learning.
If there is some trouble in the school and the teachers are terrified of the studens, it is kinda obvious that the teachers won´t relate well with their students.
The problem behind this point ist that because of that the teachers need to relate well with the the studends.
If there is no communication between these two parties, the students won´t listen to their teacher.
Moreover the students who would like to learn would be disturbed by their classmates.
On the one hand it is a big problem if the students and the teacher don´t come along with each other but on the other hand it is also a problem if the teacher is to kind to his students. If he won´t show strengh and knowledge the studends could think that the teacher is only joking around and has absolutly no idea what he is doing. That would also disturb the athmosphere in the class pretty badly.

In my opinion, the teacher should find a well balanced way between beeing funny and helpfull and beeing careless and showing and teaching his knowledge.
