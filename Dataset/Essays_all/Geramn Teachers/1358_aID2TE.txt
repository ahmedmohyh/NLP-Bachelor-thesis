In the following essay I will answer the statement whether a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

Everybody has got one subject in which he/she is very unskilled. In case of that he doesn´t do very much for it, because he accept that. In front of his parents he says then " I´m only bad at Maths, because the teacher doesn´t like me". That´s an easy argument and your parents can´t really say anything against it. In relation to this argument there is no problem at the teacher rather at the student. I mean the student is just bad and he doesn´t do anything to get better at this subject. I mean yes it is important that the teacher can teach the students well, but if the students don´t listen him/her because they don´t like the subject, there   is not a teacher´s fault. On the other side there are teachers who teach very boring and it seems like they don´t really like their job. In case of that the students need to like this subject to listen and learn from it. I don´t think that in the beginner years the students don´t need very much knowledge about a subject, because they go to school to learn and not to improve his/her knowledge. At the end it´s right that the students need knowledge for example in maths, because the knowledge you get in the beginning you need in the future to do other different exercises. So teacher´s can´t teach the students well if they don´t bring a bit knowledge with them. 

To come to a conclusion I have to agree with the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught", because in my opinion the students go to school to learn something and not to say what they learned before school. I think that is a very important point, so the teacher´s ability must be very well to give the students knowledge and not to hear their knowledge.
