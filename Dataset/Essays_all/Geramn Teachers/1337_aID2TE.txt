When it comes to teaching people have many different opinions on how to do it right. For the teachers it is is a difficult task to decide how they are going to present the subject to the students.
Many teachers just give their students basic tasks on the subject that they should work on. This method is fairly simple for the teacher and straight forward for the students as well, but when students have difficulties with some of the tasks it is always better to speak about these difficulties in the whole class rather than doing more tasks on this subject to get better. 
Students also talk more likely about their solutions or general mistakes in class when they have a good relation to the teacher, which is important for a better atmosphere in the class. It is also better if the students are more active in the lessons, and it is important that they speak a lot about the different topics so you can talk about more opinions instead of writing about your own ones. 
When talking about a certain subject in class you get to know others opinions on them and this helps students to be more open towards discussions because another solution to a problem might be better than yours. On the other hand it could be that some classes may learn less different topics when compared to others which would be very bad because the students might not have lerned certain things they need later in their life. 
This problem is very reliant on the teacher after all. There are some teachers who take their time to teach the subjects and still work very efficient because the students just have fun learning from him/her. In other classes students may not be encouraged to learn something because the lessons are just boring.
 
After all is really just depends on the teacher and how he presents himself and his subject to the students but the teachers should try to teach their subjects in a way where the students have fun learing rather than taking school as a punishment.
