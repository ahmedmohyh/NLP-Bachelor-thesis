It a contoversial statement if a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledgde of the subject being thaught. The students are splitted in disagreeing or agreeing with the statement. In the following essey I´m going to analyse both sides and conclude with my own opinion. 

The ability to relate well as a teacher with their students is an important subject in being a teacher. Nothing is more important than a human realation between the one who taught and the owns who learn. This relation makes the work for the teacher and the students more easily. They could learn more and better to get the best grades they could. Because the lesson based on a human and clean atmospheare. 

The other side is that a teacher should have more knowledge about the subject being thought. It´s also an important point. It´s a matter in school that students have to learn the right things. There musn´t be the chance that teacher taught their students not the right stuff. 
It´s important that in the end of the students career in school they are on the same level in their exams. And it´s the worst a teacher could do when not every topic is as taught as other students were taught.

To conclude I think it´s more important the teacher had an excellent knowledge of the subject he taught and also creates a human atmospheare in the classroom and the lessons. Every teacher have to fit the mixture of both statements as the students see fit.
