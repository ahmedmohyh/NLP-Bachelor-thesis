A lot students in Germany critisize theachers about their knowlegde. But is the teachers ability to relate well with students more importand than excellent knowledge of the subject? I am going to discuss in the following text this Problem.
On the one hand side is it better that the teacher has verry good knowledge of his own subjekt because he ist the person which prepair the students for the final exam. The final exam is made by the land and it is not importand for them if there is a teacher who are not able to teache the stuff  he has to teache. I have a friend who made last yerar his final exam. In Mathmatiks he has a teacher with verry bad knowledge of the subjekt. He got a five in the Maths exam and he can not reach his dream of the dual studiing.
On the other hand side is the knowledge not the importand streght of the teacher. He also should respect the students and make fair notes. A other well friend of me has a teacher with a lot verry detailled knowledge but he cant work with students. His explinations are not able to understand for the stdents. They have to lern at home a lot to undersdand his words. The opininion of my friend is that he whishes a teacher with less knowledge but therfore with good explination skills. His grade at the moment is almost as bad as the grade of my other friend but he has a better chance to improof the grade in the final exam.
All in all you can not say that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more importand than excellent knowledge of the subject. The techer schuld know as much of his subjekt as the students need for the final exam. He has to explinat the stuff well but if there are to much informations the students can not follow the teachers words in the lessens and have to worke at home a lot. So the teacher schould be a mixtuer between his knowledge and his explination skills.
