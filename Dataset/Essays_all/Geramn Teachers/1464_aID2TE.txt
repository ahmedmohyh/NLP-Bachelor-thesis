The following essay is about the question, if the relationchip between students and teachers is more important than the knowlege of the teacher.
The knowlege of the teacher is very important, because a teacher with the best relation to his students can not teach something he do not know. This argument works the other way round too, because a teacher that knows everything can not use his full knowlege, because the students learn much slower if the students do not like the teacher and it whould be very borring lessions. So I think thate there has to be both,  knowlege and relation, in a perfect relation to each other so the techer makes interesting lessons where the students are learning something. But I think  to make this perfect relation there has to be more knowlege than relation, because the teachers are teacher because of their great knowlege and not because they can relate well to students. I also think that its possible for a teacher to have excellent knowlege and relates well to students, because to have the one thing does not make owning the other thing impossible. All in all I disagree with the statement because I think for a teacher  is knowlege more important than a well relation to his students. I think only his great knowlege about the subject makes him qualified to teach this subject oher teachers with just normal knowlege about the subject can not be good teachers.
