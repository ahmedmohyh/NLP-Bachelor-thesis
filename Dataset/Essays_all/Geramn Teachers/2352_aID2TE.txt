Is it more important that a teacher can relate well with students than he has an excellent knowledge of the subject? This is a very important question for most of the students.

On the one hand it is good that the teacher relate well with the students, that can support students, who are not so good at school. For them it is not the main thing that they learn everything, you can learn about one subject, it is more important how they are teached. So they can learn the basics.
Where is the use of your knowedge when you can not teach it well?
On the other hand it is not a bad thing when the teacher is an expert on his subject. Speacially for good students, who want to learn nearly everything about one subject, it is helpfull when the teacher knows more than the main school knowledge. 
And when the teacher has a not so good knowledge it can happen that he says something wrong, that can be a big problem. Or the teacher can not answer about some questions of the students and so he will lose his autority.
I think everytime you can learn more about your subject, but the ability to relate with students is a thing you have or not. 

What is more important is hard to say. When you are high inteligent and know everything about your subject, but can not explain it to your students, you aren not a good teacher. And the same goes for when your the best friend of your students and can teach them everything, but you know nothing you can explain or worse you teach the wrong. So all in all I disagree with the statement, I think it's a good mix of both.
