One reason could be that the students listen to the teacher better if they like him and have a good relationship than if they don`t like him because in their opinion he might be a bad teacher so he only says stupid things anyway. Teacher is a job you have to be dedicated to because you have to be able to take the students with you and show them that the subject is really interesting. If a teacher knows everything about his subject and is really smart at all but he can`t teach it he isn`t any good as a teacher. In this point a good relationship to his students could help the teacher because he could imagine how his students can learn better and so on. Of course it can`t be too good of a relationship because if it is too good the students think they can do anything they want and the teacher wouldn`t mind.
I think that it is more important to relate well with students because you can get them more excited about the subject than he could when he just knows everything about it and it seems to be impossible to impress him. Another important thing is that a teacher has to like his students a little bit because if he don`t like them he wouldn`t give a shit if they learn anything. So it would be good if he would like children in regular. 
To become a teacher, you have to study your subject anyway so normally he should know enough about his subject. In the end it is all about whether you can teach the students or not. This is why I would say, that teachers should teach way more lessons before they actually become teacher so they know if it`s really the right job for them.
