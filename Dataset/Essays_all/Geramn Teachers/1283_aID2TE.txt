The task of teachers is to bring their knowledge to the students and to prepare them for exams and the a-level. The students have to learn enough so they pass the exams. 
But it is really important that the teacher is good with students and that the class and the teacher have a good connection and relation to learn.
It is about the atmosphere in the classroom. When students can be relaxed during the lessons they show more interest and and concentrate more.
They would write tests more easily when they dont have to be nervous that the result of this test can ruin all of their marks when they have the opportunity to  show what they learned during the lessons. Most of the students talk more during the lesson when they don´t have the fear that every wrong answer can be the cause why the teacher has a bad view on them.
When teachers relates well with students they would choose interesting topics or give the students the chance to show the best of them, these teachers support their students and I think that this is an important aspect for their time in school. 
When a teacher relates well with students the students are more motivated to learn for exams or do their homework. 
I think when a teacher connects well with the students the good marks willl come as a consequence because the studants aren´t better in the subject when they are stressed or nervous before the lesson starts.
