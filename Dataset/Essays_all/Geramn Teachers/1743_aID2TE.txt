Lot´s of students know one problem: Often they think some teacher doesn´t like them because the give bad marks. So for lot´s of students it´s very important that teachers relate well with all student´s. But is it really more important that teachers agree with all students well or it´s better that teachers have an excellent knowledge of the subject being thought? In the following part I´am going to analyse which idea makes more sence for the students and their life later.
The first point I like to mention is that in every class some students are mobbed by the others students. Students who are in the bad positon to be chucked by the others is very important that they can tell and talk about this porblem with one teacher. If there is no teacher who has a well relationship with students, students become depression and are very healthless because often they don´t want to talk with their parents. So for this reason it´s better that teachers have an good relationship with their students. 
On the other side it´s very bad when teachers don´t have an excellent knowledge of their subjects because students can´t write exams with grate marks when they want to finished school. So later it´s diffcult for them to study or become a good job in the realtionship of students from other classes and schools who wrote very good exams. 
All in all I think it´s very good when teachers have a well rerlate with their students but the more important point is that students have to learn all things with te excellent knowledge of their teacher. When school finished no one wanted to know if the students have a well relate with their teachers. The marks are the one and only thing they are looking for and nothing else. When students can´t relate with their teachers they have every time the chance as one hall class to go to the chief of the school and to tell them the reason why they wanted a new teacher.
