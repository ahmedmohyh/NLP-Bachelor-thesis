We're living in a time, where the schoolmarks are more important then a lot of other things. Specially in countrys with a final exam, like Germany, the exams a really important, because they're a big part of the final schoolmarks. And the biggest problem, is that these final exams in germany, called abitur, are not created by the teachsers self. So it happens often, that the teachsers dont even know, what will be in the exam. One of the important tasks of the teacher is, to prepare us for this exams. So it would be a really big problem, if a teacher couldn't teach his subject well. We wouldn't be ready for the exam and this would destroy our marks heavily. But the relation between students and teachers are also really important. It makes more fun to got to school if you have a good relation between the most of your teacher. You're more active and then you can learn easier in the lessons. If you have a bad relation with your teacher, its really hard to learn something in the lesson, because you know (or think), that he's hating you and you can't concentrate. So i think that its need to be both in the same time. A good relation between the teacher makes you more active in the lessons and the good knowledge of the teacher helps you in the final exams. It don't need to be excellent knowledge, because we're living in a time, where you can search informations about the subject in the internet, if you need to know more. But the teacher needs to know so much, that he can prepare you for the final exams and can teach you the important things. So I disagree with the statement.
