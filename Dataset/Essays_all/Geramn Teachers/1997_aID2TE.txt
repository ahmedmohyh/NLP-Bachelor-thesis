A teacher's ability to relate well with students is important, but also an excellent knowledge of the subject being thought. But which ability is more important?

If a teacher has lots of knowledge he can teach those poeple who are really interested in the subject more than a teacher who does not know as much. It is also important for the A Levels, because the teacher should prepare their students and if they do not know enough they cannot prepare them well enough and the students must study more on their own. Though when the teacher is strict and does not get on well with his students, the students often do not like to come to class. Some might not even come and then the great knowledge of the teacher is for nothing, because many students do not like to know about it. A nice teacher often motivates students which makes them better automatically. So a nicer teacher is especially good for students who are not so good at school.

I think that the ability to relate well with students is a little bit more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject. Of course he needs to know something about the subject, but just because the teacher is nice doesn't mean he is not clever. The teacher went to university and studied the subject so he knows at least enough to prepare them for the A Levels. An excellent knowledge means that he knows more then he needs to teach, so a teacher with a great ability to relate with students is more important, as he can still teach you and prepare you and you are probably more motivated to learn from him.
