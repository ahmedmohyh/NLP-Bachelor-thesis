The ability to relate well with students is reallly important in every class. The excellent knowledge of the subject which is being taught is for the education of the students a very important part too. In the following I'm going to show my position to this plot.

Students are more open to answer questions of the teacher, when they know that they can trust him and don't have to be afraid of the teacher's reaction in the case that the answer is wrong. If teacher's are good in talking about peronal themes with students the students can edentify with what the teacher is saying and so they feel more well in class. Students are often to shy. When the teacher is able to make them come out of theirselves the students have a better chance to follow the class and to take part in class too. Of course the knowledge of the subject is important for the good education of the students and without the teachers knowledge they wouldnt leran anything. If there is a teacher who has a bad knowledge of his subject but has a good relation to the students the students maybe wouldn't realize because they're happy in class and they have a nice teacher who doesn't make a strict annyoing class. The other way around isn't better. With really well knowledge you can teach the students very good and maybe they learn a lot. But if there's no relation between student and teacher the studends often don't have any motivation to learn for this subject. 

After all I woulg agree with the statement from the beginning. A good relation between both parts is more importnant because this is the fundament of a well teached class.
