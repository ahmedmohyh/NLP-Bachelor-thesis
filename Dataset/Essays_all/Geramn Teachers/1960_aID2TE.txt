The question, if it´s more important that a teacher relates well with his students than that he has a great knowledge of his subject is much discused in this days.

Of course it´s very important that teachers relate well with students because the lessons are more fun and the students are more motivated to learn. My old latinteacher for example was very funny and the lessons were a lot of fun. Because of this I enjoyed latin more and got better. This teachers also understand their students better and realize when they need help or didn´t understand something and help them. A problem with teachers who know everything about their subject but can´t relate to students is also that they don´t care about the "weaker" students in the class. They just tell the class everything once in a way to high speed even if some students don´t get it.

But on the other hand students can learn more from teachers who know a lot about their subject. These teachers also can explain things better to their students because of their big knowledge. The most important point for me is that students with a teacher who is able to relate well to students could have a disadvantage against students with very intelligent teachers in their final exam because this is everywhere in Germany the same but the intelligent teacher can prepare his students better.

All in all I thing that both abilities are very important to be a good teacher but to have a big knowledge of the subject is more important because these teachers can teach the students more about the subject and prepare them better for their final exam.
