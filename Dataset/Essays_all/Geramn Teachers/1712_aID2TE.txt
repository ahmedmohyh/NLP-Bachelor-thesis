In this essay I will dicuss if a good relationship between a teacher and his students is more important than the knowledge being thought. In my opinion, a teacher should be able to have both, a good realationship and an excellent knowledge of the subject.

It is very important for the students, that the teacher relates well with them, because otherwise they probably won´t listen to him or they will get bored very quickly. To learn a lot of things, a teacher also has to teach excellent knowledge. It might be a little more important, because the students will learn at least some things. If the teacher relates well with his students, but can´t teach the right knowledge, the students will like to go to school but won´t learn anything. In this case, the ability to teach excellent knowledge is more important. But a teacher has to know how to relate well with his students.
The best teachers are the ones, who are able to make the school a place where students like to go to and at the same time he provides the students with an excellent knowledge. When a teacher can do that, his students will learn the best way.

Overall, the teacher should fullfill both abilities, so the students will learn a lot. When one of the abilities is missing, they will probably not learn enough. One ability is useless without the other one. I personally think, that students will learn more when the right knowledge is being thought, so an excellent knowledge is more important, but the best teachers are able to handle both ablilities.
