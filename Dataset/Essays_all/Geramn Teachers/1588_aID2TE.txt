In the following text I am going to present several arguments and non-arguments to show, if the teacher's ability to relate well with students is mroe important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught:

The teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important, because pupils feel way more comfortable and follow the lesson. Me as a pupil I know teachers that may be smart, but can not talk to pupils and have social understatement. With teachers like this the lesson is mostly boring and nobody is really motivated and this is one of the reasons, why exams don't end very well for many pupils. Pupils will also have a better connection to the teacher. This starts with the greeting in the morning and ends with the smile in the lesson. In this case many want to go to the lesson, because it's not that bad and you want to learn something. Today not many will find much motivation for school, even not me, but when you have to go to lessons like this you won't be happy, but at least motivated. In the other case teachers have to present much information and give that to the pupils. A teacher should always have a good answer for a difficult question. Pupils always have questions and if the teacher doesn't have a answer for that he should probably learn more, because that is his job: knowing much and represent that in a good way. Also teachers should be really freaks in their lessons and really interest in this theme. They should give this passion and interesse to the pupils, so that it is more easier for them.

In my opinion is the term true. Most of the pupils will say that a lesson with a teacher, who has the ability to relate well with students is way better than a teacher who knows everything, but feels presseured in every situation. It makes just way more fun and you are also more motivated than otherwise
