For sure it is imortant for students to have had a good relationchip with your teacher. it could help you prity much by understanding important things. you also might have more fun at school. 
But on the other hand. The teachers job is to teach students and not to be their entertainer. He has to help them by lerning the things they will need for their exams. 
At the end just the things you have learnd were important. Not the fun you have had in school. It sounds awfull but it is the way it is. 
In my opininion and also based on my expeiriences at school. A good relationchip with your teachers is good. When you feel welcome in school and knew it wont be bad. It could creat4e a good atmosphere in your clasroom.
