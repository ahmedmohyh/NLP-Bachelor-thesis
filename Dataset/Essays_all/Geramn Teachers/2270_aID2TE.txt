This essay is about the realationship between teachers and pupils. To do this I will refer to the quote above.

Ofcourse a teacher need to have an exellent knowledge of his or her subject. He can not teach the students more than he acctually knows about the topic, so his knowledge should be as high as possible. But there is more than that, the teacher should also know how to teach this to the students and this is at least as important as the knowledge of his/her subject. Because the teacher can not using his exellent knowledge of his subject if he is not able to teach it well to the students. So for example he should involve the students in class and do not talk in front of the class the whole lesson. 
So there are other factors like the character and  appearance of teacher which matters a lot to have good results in teaching. Because in my opinion for students it is imortant to be willing to learn something from the teacher and this works better if the teacher is a person who is respectfull and/or cool. I do not say the teacher  need to do everything to do not get in conflict with the students, but nevertheless he should not have expectations to the students the can not fullfill. And if there if there is a conflict he should have a dialog with the students to solve the problem. so he should have a blance between like a friend and a person to respect. 

To put it in a nutshell, it is important for teachers to do not just have a well knowledge of the subject. Also he should be able to cummunicate well with all his/her students to theach them better. But you do not have just one good theacher type, there are many types and all of them have their advantages and disatvantages and every students can learn better with a different person. But all of them need to have more qualities than just have a big knowledge of the subject.
