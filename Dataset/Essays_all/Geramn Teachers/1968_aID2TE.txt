I don't fully agree with the statement above for the following reasons: 
On the one hand, the reason you go to school isn't because you want to be friends with your teachers, but because you need to get some general knowledge. Furthermore, it could really strengthen the relationships between the students of the class if they happen to have unpleasant encounters with their teachers, so they can talk about it and therefore grow stronger as a part of society and as a class. 
On the other hand, teachers with good social skills and good relationships to their students can help them to grow as a person and not to be afraid of being themselves, which a teacher that often shouts at their students or is unfair to them most likely can't. If, however, a teacher is likeable and gives his feedback in a friendly way, the students will be more likely to have a better school performance because they're motivated. 
But you also need to consider that, if a teacher doesn't have the knowledge that is necessary about the subject, he can't teach them what he's supposed to. Then it won't matter how friendly and likeable he is, because the students can't teach themselves. 
Hence I come to the conclusion, that it is necessary for a teacher to have basic knowledge about their subject(s), but they also need to treat their students respectfully and motivate them. If they do so, they can really make the students' interest in the subject become bigger and research some things they want to know, but their teacher can't teach them, by themselves.
