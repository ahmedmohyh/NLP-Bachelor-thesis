There are different opinions concerning the topic wheather a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Knowledge in all subjects which are taught at school are important for everybody's future life. By learning many different things you can improve your chances concerning a job for example. In addition teachers should control the spent time of students in the internet or the used medias which are famous nowadays. Students spend a lot of time with social medias or television. Of course there are different programms for learning in the internet for example but they aren't used very often.  
By relating well with students a teacher has a better chance to be liked by them. The students would become more motivated to learn something new at school by having a good relationship to their teachers. To trust the teachers is also an important aspect for a good atmosphere in class and a good relationship between students and teachers.

I agree with the statement that a knowledge of the subject being taught at school is really important. But in my opinion the combination of a good relationship between students and teachers and a well taught subject is more motivating the youth. A strict teacher might help some students but most of them need a good atmosphere in class. 
I also have some teachers who are in a very good relationship with our class. In addition it's not necessary for the future life to have an excellent knowledge of all the taught topics at school because you won't need all of them later.
