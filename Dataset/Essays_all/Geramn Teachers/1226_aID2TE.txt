Of course every teacher has to know about the stuff the children should learn. But an excellent knowlegde of what the he should teach isn´t as important as the quality to relate the students in a appropriate way or to explain it understandable for the students. 
Critics would ask now: '' But what if the students have a question which needs an ecxellent knowlegde to be responded?''
In my view it is no shame to for the teacher to aswer this question right the next lesseon after having studied about the specific topic. However it is more dramatic if the teacher can´t relate the quality and quantaty of the students participation. Because of the fact that this could reason that the student's participaton decrease more and more.
Moreover, it isn't necessary to have an high leveled knowledge, if the students don't understand the topic and can't ask questions which go more in detail. 
Therefore it is more important that the teacher has better qualities in teaching and relating than in his subject itself.
