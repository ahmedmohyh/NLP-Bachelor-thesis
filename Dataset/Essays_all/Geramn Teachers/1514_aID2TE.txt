First of all I think to be able to relate to the student should be a teacher's "basement" in every lesson. If he doesn't school wouldn't even make any sense, because the students wouldn't understand what's going on. Liking the teacher because he is able to relate to the children as human and as teacher would let the students have fun in lesson following they would maybe learn more because they want to impress their mentor. Although a sympathic person could be distracting to the imput they get, because some kids would rather spend attention to the funny jokes a teacher spreads than to the important thinks they really need to know. 
On the one hand a teacher who knows a lot could be quite good for the kids. Then they haven't any possibility to be distracted by something else than the knowledge. But ont the other hand a mentor who is not able to relate to the students and could talk on his own and is difficult to understand.
So finally I would refer to my first argument: A teacher's basement should be the ability to relate to the kids. And as long as he does not tell anything wrong and makes interesting lessons and etches the knowledge into the students mind he is the perfect teacher. It's unnecessary to teach any extra-knowledge as long as the students do not even listen because they're so bored. 
A teacher should be able to find the balance between being a sympathic person and giving the input. If he can't do that he is not the right person to work in this profession.
