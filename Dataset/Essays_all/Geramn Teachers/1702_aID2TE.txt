I agree with the statement: "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."
If the teacher´s ability to relate well with students isn´t important, the students will hate the subject and they have many problems with learning or they didn´t want to school because of the teacher. An argument for disagree the statement is that the students only go to school to learn. But they have so much subject to learn, if more teachers aren´t well with the students, they become problems. One student bigger than an other student. Teachers can motivate students so much but for that they must be well. Teachers can do much as doctors. Doctors make their illness gone and teachers too. If the students or one student maybe have fear about a test or something that doesn´t stay in school and they can´t talk about this with a friend or a family member they can talk with the teachers, but they only talk with them when they like and trust them. For that they must be well. Another dispointing argument is that the students can go to persons which has the job to help people. The teachers also can help them with finding a job for the future.

Finally it is very important, more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In my opinion the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more importante that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is right. They students must trust their teachers because it is easilier to learn and they go to school with more motivation.
