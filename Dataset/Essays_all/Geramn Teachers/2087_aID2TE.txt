What is more important for a teacher, relating well with students or an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? This is a question teachers and students ask himself every day. This question isn't as simple as it seems to answer. 
On the one hand if a teacher has a really good knowledge he can teach you basically everything you want to know and you are able to write a good exam or to graduate well. On the other hand it is really important to have a good teacher-student relation. You can only learn if you like the class and the teacher at least a little bit. 
But also there is the fact if the class has such a good relation to the teacher and he is always joking around or makes fun of himself the students can't concentrate on learning. Besides that the students are highly motivated for the class if they're learning in a good atmosphere. If everything is less stressful the students can learn more effective and the results are better.
On the one side the teacher are less stressful work by just teaching the things he should and not participating in the students life but on the other side if a teacher like his class and want to be like a friend for them he likes he job more. A person who likes what he is doing works more effective and better.

Finally in my opinion I can say for me it is more important to have a teacher who likes his job and is realting well to the students. I can defnietly learn better if my teacher isn't always totally serious. Of course I want to have a good exam in the end of the year but I have to be in school for 12 years and it is part of my life and I want it to be good, sometimes funny and getting out of it with a big knowledge.
