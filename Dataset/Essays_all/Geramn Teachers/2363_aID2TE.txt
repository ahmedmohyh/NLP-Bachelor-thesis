A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
This is the statement i will deal with for the next 27 minutes and 45 seconds.
We know what school is for. School is for education. But education for life and of course education for knowleadge for a specific field. This field of knowleadge gets more and more specific over the time we attend educational institutions. From kindergarden all the way to university and later in our job in an certain field of knowleadge.
But the knowleadge is not what makes us humans. What makes us humans, is how we treat each other and how we respect each other. So if the main purpose of school would be the conection between student and teacher, and the education of becoming an better human, than this world would be a better one. What we would miss in this world is knowledge in science and other fields. So I believe that there has to be a harmony between educating kids how to be a better human and getting a greater knowledge in an certaijn field they want to. So teachers really need to know their field well and be experts in it, but it is exactly as important as having a good realation to the students. Because without a good relationship between teacher and student, there would not be humans anymore. I agree.
