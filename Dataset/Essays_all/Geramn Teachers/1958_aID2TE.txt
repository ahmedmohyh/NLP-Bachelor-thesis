In the following text I will outline my opinion to the statement, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students would be more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, by naming arguments for and against the thesis.
On the one hand I think it is important for teachers to have a good relationship with their students to teach their subject in a certain way. In my opinion the knowledge would be transmitted better if the students had pleasure while learning. This is often the case when the connection between the teacher and the students is friendly and not too unpersonal. It lies in the human nature that we feel better and are more willing to learn when we are in good company and in a friendly atmosphere and this should be supported by the school and its teachers.
Nevertheless we should not forget that a school is a place to learn and work in the first place so that this should always be the highest goal for teachers as for students. Additionally it is the gained knowledge and the student's possibility to use it in the final exams that count the most. So I think that we should mostly set the focus on the subjects, the knowledge and the learning process.
To conclude I want to say that  I disagree with the statement but only with the theory that the relationship would be more important. The teacher-student-relation is indeed very important for the students to learn and understand the themes that lead to the A-levels, but the knowledge itself is much more important.
