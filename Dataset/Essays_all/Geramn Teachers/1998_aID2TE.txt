Many schools want to have teachers who have excellent knowledge at their subject but is this more important then the ability how the teachers relate with students? I think so not both of it 
  When a teacher is mean or can not relate with a student, the students are unmotivated and their do not like the lessons. It is very important that the teacher is friendly and motivated because a teacher have to focus on the students. The students are better in school when the teacher is nice and the lessons are funny. Furthermore its very important how the teacher relate with the students because many stundets do not like school, their want to do other things like play computer games or go shopping, something like that. So it is the execise of the teacher to get the stundet, to show them how well it is to go to school and that it is very important for the future because school is only one part of the life and after school you need many informations which you have learn at school.
  Nevertheless it is very important that the teacher have knowledge at their subject because the teacher can only create a lesson when their have informations about the topic of their subject. In this time many teachers have not all informations about the topic and if a stundet ask a question the teacher can not answer sometimes. In addition to that it is important that the teacher also talk about actual topics so the stundents are intrested and motivated for the lesson.
  I am a student and in my opinion both of it is important because every student like school more when the lessons are nice and the teacher can talk about the topics and have knowledge but is is also important that the teacher is friendly so the stundets are not afraid and like the teacher.
