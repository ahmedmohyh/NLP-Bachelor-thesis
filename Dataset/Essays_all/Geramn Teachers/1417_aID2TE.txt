In school it is important for the teacher and the students to be able to understand each other and for the teachers to be able to recognise the problems a student could be facing. Whereas the knowledge of the subject is a realtively easy thing to learn, the ability to make the students understand the things that the teacher learned is whole different challenge. A teacher has to understand problems, and for that he has to be able to relate to the student. One could explain it over and over again but if the student is stuck at a whole different level the student will never understand it. 
On the other hand excellent knowledge opens a lot of possibilities in terms of the way they teach their subject. If a student is stuck, the teacher could come up with other ways to explain the subject, because they know so much about it, they could have a diffenrent approach on the way they teach.
Either way the teacher has to know when and more importantly why a student is stuck. To help them understand better a really indepth knowledge is the important key, but it is useless if the teacher is not able to use it properly or even overuses it by flooding the student with information they can't process and by that creating an even problem at understanding.
In my opinion to be able to have both would be the ideal, but the ability to relate to the students is more important, because it helps those who are stuck more than excellent knowledge, although without great knowledge no teacher would be successfull.
