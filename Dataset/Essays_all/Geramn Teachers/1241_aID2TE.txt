A teacher´s ability to relate well with his students certainly is important but if he can only relate to them and don´t explain the subject because of the lack of his knowledge it doesn´t help the students. On the other hand if the teacher has the knowledge about the subject being taught and can´t relate to his students and therefore can´t explain it properly it also doesn´t help the students.
The teacher needs the ability to relate to his students so that he can explain the subject and understand the students difficulties. If for example a student has some difficulties with learning the teacher can help him understand the subject better if he can relate to him and see his problems. But he also needs the knowledge about the subject so that he can answer the questions of the student correctly and help him understand the topic. If he doesn´t have this knowledge he could explain something incorrectly to the student and if a student has an additional question he woldn´t be able to answer it.
I don´t agree with the statement because both aspects are equally important in a teacher. He needs the ability to relate to his students and the knowledge about the subject to understand his students and help them with the subject in the best way he can.
