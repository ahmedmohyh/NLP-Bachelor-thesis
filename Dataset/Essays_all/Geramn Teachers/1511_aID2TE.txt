Is it more important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students than exellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching? This question is a very important one, especially for students who went to school five days a week and are taught by teachers in many different sobjects.

Personally I thnk it is more important that a teacher has good relations to his or her students because if a student likes the teacher he/she will have more fun while studieing. This will lead to better grades of the students and finally to a better job. But it is important that a teacher has knowledge about the subject hes is teaching. When he teaches wrong facts to the students or can´t answer any questions students, will have many problems. At the beginning it´s just bad for the next classtest but later they have bad grades or didn´t pass throug their A-levels. An other problem could be that the stundents haven´t got any respect towards the teacher. This could happen when the teacher is your "friend". But a teacher is not just there to give the students the information they need for the future. He is there to encourage them, motivate them and want just the best for them. That´s what teaching really means.

To draw a conclusion I thnk both parts are important to teach students well. You must have the knowledge of the subject you teach to them. But it is at least as important as this that a student have fun while learning. So a thecher must encourage them to study and have good marks because this will help them very much to have a better future with a better Job.
