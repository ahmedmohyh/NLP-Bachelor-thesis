Many people claim that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I personally disagree with this statement.
When a teacher relates to the students too much the students won't learn anything. Learnig than becomes some sort of talking and joking with the teacher. The teacher than can't get his students to become diciplined and listen to him to learn about the subject. For example in nineth grade I had a ver kind math teacher. He was really the best person you could imagine but because he was so kind he didn't made us learn anything and I became very bad in math.
It is very important that students respect their teachers and when these relate to them too much no real base for resepect and learning can be build. 
More important than respect is the knowledge. A teacher needs to know what he teaches and know it so good that the students get the best education possible.
Too much knowledge only stand in the way of ecucation when the teachers social skills suffer from that. So a teacher has to be well educated but also needs to understand his students so he understands and knows how to react and explain when one of them doesn't understand something.
In conclusion I can say that a teacher has to be like my math teacher right now. He can understand and sometimes makes a joke but knows when he needs to be serious. We all respect him because if you don't respect him he won't respect you and you won't learn anything. Also he knows a lot of mathematics so he is very well educated but is able to relate to his students sowell that he can solve their problems individually.
A good teacher therefore is both, capable to understand his students and has excellent knowledge of his subject.
