I agree in some points with the statement, but also disagree strongly.
For the teacher the connection to his students is better. When he relates well with his students, he can teach them easier. The students wont listen to the teacher, if they dont relate well with him. On the daily base, the teacher wont be stressed out in his class and wont be mad that fast, when someone disturbs him. He trusts his students and the students trust him. The workflow in the class would be very easy. Even outside the lessons, the teacher would be a good friend of the students. They wont think, that he is the mad teacher, who shouts and be angry all the time. They would think, that the teacher is the person, who works with them daily and is very relaxed while they work together.
On the other hand, a teacher should know exactly what he is teaching and should be able to answer the questions right and direct. If this is not given, the students would not learn that much about the topics. They wouldnt be able to get educated well, wont have these chances in their jobs or even could not get their education at all. The exams are very similar to the exams of the other classes. If the teacher is not teaching that much, than the other teachers do, they would not prepare the students for their education exam. 
Fianlly you can say, that a better knowledge of the subject is more important for the students than the teachers ability to relate well with his students. Without the teachers knowledge, the students wont be prepared well enough to educate and be successful in their jobs. When a student would be asked, what is more important fot him, he probably would say, that the good relation to his teacher is more imporrtant, because he would not work that motivated, when the teacher is mean or very fast with the topics, so he can fit all the topics in the schedule.
The importance of a successful school education is way bigger than the good relation between students and teachers.
