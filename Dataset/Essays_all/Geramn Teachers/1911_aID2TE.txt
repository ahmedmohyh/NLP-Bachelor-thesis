I think both of these points are important for a teacher and a student. In my opining a teacher without the knowledge about the topic can not explaing the subject as well as a person who knows closly everthing. If questions are open and the teacher can not solve them i think i am not really informed about the topic. A simple example is math. You get an exercise where you could get the solution doing the technically math term which was beeing shown to you. But at some point you can not get forward so you need help. But the teacher can not give you any other way of solving the exercise like sideways. But on the other way round the teacher should relate well with students to explain those exercises well. The students should have some nice relations to the teacher in first way to have fun at education. Do not be scared of lessons where is a teacher who is not that nice. It also might be boring at this lesson to listen to them. Talking with them about the topic espacially about things that do not be told in lesson are indeed interesting for some students. To go after the lesson to the teacher and discuss something. These are the teacher students want. Summarized i would say both of these traits are very usefull for teaching. I definitly be the opining that none of these are more important than the other.
