I agree with the stateement, because it is much more important to be able to interact with the students than just have the knowledge to answer every question about his subject. If a teacher has an excellent knowledge, it is good, but if he isn´t able to relate with the students and he isn´t able to give the students the knowledge about his subject, all his knowledge doesn´t matter. A teacher who relates very well with the students is able to handle with them better and so it is a lot easier to learn something in his lessons and get some knowledge about the subject. And a teacher like that is also able in the most cases to handle with conflicts in the class and that makes working in school for the teacher and for the the students a lot more easier and the students also able to learn better and get better grades of this cause. Thats the reason, because the knowledge of the teacher doesn´t matter. The important thing about a teacher isn´t his knowledge, it is his ability to relate with students and that´s also the hardest thing about being a teacher.
