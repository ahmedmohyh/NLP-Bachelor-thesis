I agree with the statemen that a teacher's ability to relate well to students is more improtant than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught.
It should be very important for a teacher to build up a good relation to his students and create good working conditions because good conditions can change the motivation of a class very much. Motivated students are way more efficent than unnmotivated, the themetalks in the lesson are getting more productive and the students are having fun while going to school and don't have to be forced. Also students are getting bored very easily when a teacher is just standing in the front, telling some facts, noone understands, to the class as a mass of people and not toward every single individuum.
On the other side a teacher should know, what he is talking about and should not let the students have to the teach themself.
Another important point is the social aspect in class. If a teacher is talking with the students about theire problems and tries to help at critical situations in class it is very easy to build up a relation out of trust and respect for each other with has good effects on the communication and the relation between the class and the teacher.

In fact the 'perfect' teacher is a person which is related to the class as a community out of many individuums, he can all reach and talk about there problems with, but also has enough knowledge to tell the students what they have to know to get along in live.
In the end I agree on the statement, because a good relation to the class is more effective than an completely excellent knwoledge which can't reach the students.
