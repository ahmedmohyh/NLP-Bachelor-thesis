I will now discuss wether or not a teacher´s ability to relate well with the students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

A teacher that emphesises with his stundent can grow their interest in the subjekt that he is teaching.
The students would want to learn more because they think that the subjekt is interesting. A good example of this is my phisics teacher, because of whom i grew an interest in physics.

On the other side, if the teacher hasn't got very good knowledge, he could not help the students with their challenging questions that they might have if they are very into the subject. 

Never the less it is very important for people in gerneral, if they want to get smarter, that they want to learn. If the teacher is bad and you don't like him you automaticly pay less attention, learn less and because you don't understand the subject you get frustrated and block the knowledge the teacher is trying to give you. 
Therefore the teachers have to make the lerning process fun and interesting for their students, which could be done by emphesising with them.

In conclusion i think that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than ecellent knowledge of the subjekt being taught, because these teachers grow the interest in different subjects in students.
