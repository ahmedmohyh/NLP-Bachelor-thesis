Offcurse its important that the teacher knows a lot about the subject he teach and his knowledge also have to be better than someone else knowledge, because he have to know the answers if a student will ask some questions. But nobody is perfect, so he dont have to be exellent. Its allowed to dont know something or for example to look in books or the internet to answer the question. The importent thing is that the teacher can handle the students, and that the students understand everything about the topic he told. Its not good for all if the teacher teach comlicadet things with a complicadet speach and no one else will understand him only you are an expert in this subjekt.The best way to teach is to create the lessons informative, with easy understanding and interesting topics so every stundent is listening, understand everything and if he or she have questions maybe the teacher can answer them or if they were really complicadet he cant answer them. A good connection to the students is also good, because if nobody likes the teacher he wont have the complete concentration of the class and if the students like the teacher they raise up theire hands regulary, are concentrate to impress him and to get a good grade. Thats the best way to learn for a student, because they have to learn much in every subject and if then a teacher will come with complicadet languge and words nobody understand, theire head say something like : STOP. So the ability to relate well with the students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught, for the learning of the students.I agree with this statement.
