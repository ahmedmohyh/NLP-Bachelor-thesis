´A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught`, is an very interesting statement.

Today the use of technical devices has an important role in our current life, so the teachers have to go with this trend, to talk about things, that are interesting for students. That´s the reason, why I would agree with this statement.
With that I don´t mean, that they should talk about yesterday´s football results or some new information about the VIPs.
In my opinion, the ability to relate well with students is a very important thing, because it makes the lessons more interesting and it´s easier for the students, to listen to the teacher and understand the issue of the lessons. 
Besides the schools should work more with technical devices and the internet, because that´s the time, we are living in.
Definetly it´s important, that the teachers know, what they are talking about, but they should mix it with actual themes.
For example in my school we have logically different characters of theachers. On the one hand, they come in into the classroom, say hello, do their things and go. But on the other hand, we have teachers, who build up an personal relation to the class, for example making jokes ore talk about individually themes.
Studies show, that students learn better, and show more interesting in things, when they get a liitle bit entertained at school.

All in all, I would agree with the statement. Of course, it´s not possible, to say that in general, but I can say that that it has a big importance, the the teachers realte well with students
