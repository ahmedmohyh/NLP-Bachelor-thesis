When it comes to the question if teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught there are two sides. Everyone of us know on the one hand teachers which are good at communacation and on the other hand teachers being good at their specific subject which was studied before.
So in the following essay I want to discuss which is more important: Ability or knowledge?

First of all there are a lot of arguments for the statement. 
An example for the good relationship between teacher and students being very important when it comes to communicate is the daily school lesson. If you go to school and you are afraid of it because the teacher teaching the subject you are not good at gives you the feeling you make everything wrong, it comes to situations where you lie at your parents that you are ill and can not go to school. 
Another point for the ability to relate well with students is the trustment which results of the great communication. And we all know that we can better listen to people we trust.

But it contrast to that there is the knowledge of the subject must being excellent.
I want to give an example: If the teacher you like a lot because he/she is good at talking to you is not excellent in his/her own sucject your preperation for your A-levels is problematic and in my opinion this is the most important thing.
Furthermore if you have a question and the teacher can not give you an answer being very presisly this is a problem for the exams which you written by the students.

So all in one I could say that both points are important when it comes to prepare a great lesson. But when you look at you A-levels an excellent knowledge is much more important than the communication as well as the relationship between student and teacher.
