Every pupil knows that situation: the way the teacher is standing in front of the class and his or her way to teach is not understandable although the teacher knows his subject very well.
But what is more important being able to relate well with pupils or knowing the subject? 
Of course it would be perfect if the teacher would do both knowing the subject and knowing how to make pupils understand it. But who in this is perfect? No one is and therefore every teacher should try to reach a point where he or she is able to relate with his or her pupils in a way that they understand although the methods might not be great and the subject might not be fully understood. 
Every pupil is individual and has its own way to react to another person, for example to a teacher, and therefore it can not always be the case that pupils and teacher relate well. 
And also the way to learn is different for every person so that one pupil understands everything immediatly but everyone else does not. 
I think there should be a compromise for teachers between knowing oneselfs subject and relating with people.
