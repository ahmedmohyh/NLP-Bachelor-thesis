The teacher`s ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowlede of the subject being taught due to the fact that teachers have an educational funtion. For example a teacher has to be a tustfull person that the pupils talk about theitr problems at home or with their friends. 
In contrast to that the sense of school is to have a huge knowledge of many different subjects. It is of enormous importance that teachers can explain these topics in an esay way so that students understand them better. On the one hand school is important to have a huge ordinary konowledge on the other hand school aims the process of learning how to learn. 
For that it is of importance that the teacher relates well with the students who show more respect to the teacher when theiy have a trustfull relation. In Germany for example is a series which is called "DER LEHRER" (the teacher) which shows the importance of a good relation with the teacher who does not have the best knowledege of the subject. Although the educational function is imortant, it is more important that the pupils are prepared for their A-levels which they need for their future. 
I neither agree or disagree with the statement. In my opinion a teacher has an educational an d teaching function. Thay have to find a way to have a good relation to the students to have the respect of them and additionally the teachers should know how to teach a subject that the students have the chance to make a good A-level.
