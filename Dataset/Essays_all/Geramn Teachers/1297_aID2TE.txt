The statement have two sides. On the one side is the realtion between the teacher and the studenst, on the other side is to teach the students, without a realtion . 
In my opinion, the teacher have to find a ballance between the two sides. Studenst need a teacher, who is like a friend, who want to teach you. Then the studenst have a positive vibe against the teacher. The result could be a class with students, who are not learn. 
The other side is a bad teacher, who is dailiy angry and the only thing what he does is to teach. Thats not the wright way to have positve students.The only  thing you have are studnest, who fearing you. You could thing you want to make a hot choclate, the friendly teacher is the milk and the teacher, who want just teach is the kakao. Only milk is okay, but not tasty, only choclate isn´t good for you and so you take milk and choclate to have the perfect drink. So you need a ballance between both of them.
But like the hot choclate, you need a little bit more milk.. All in all, I wouldn´t agree with the statement.
It would be better for the students for a short time, but for the long term, you need a hot choclate.

friendly teacher : the students are happy and think, he is so cool, but the result of that are students, who are dancing on your nose. 
taugh teacher : the studens are unhappy and haven´t fun in the school.

Think at the hot choclate.
