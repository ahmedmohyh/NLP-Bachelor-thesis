The statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" shows very good how it is today. 

One argument that would agree with this statement is, that students, which have a teacher they like, because his relation is very good to them, is sometimes more intusiastic in learning. If you do not like your teacher it is sometimes very diffecult to learn only because you don ot like him or her. 

One argument agains would be that some stundents will not learn enough because the teacher is too friendly to them and the students do not need to learn to much. They maybe  think that even they are not learning so much they, they will get good marks because of the relation to theire teacher. 

As another point against this statement. The knowledge is ofcourse important aswell. Even the teacher´s ability to relate well with the student is importent, the knowledge aswell. If you get a teacher you like but he do not have the knowledge of his subject he has to teach lesson will be quiet boring after time. 

In my opinion both is very important. You need a teacher who has a big knowledge about his subject to learn "enough", but he should be friendly and should have a more then a less relation to them which is well. If  the students like the teacher they will learn more and so the classtests will be better and so the marks. 
Sometimes it depends on the subject, sometimes on the input and very often on the teachers. Even if the students do not like the subject and the input the right teacher can help. He maybeknows were your problems are and knows how to help you. And the  students are not afraid to ask him for help. 

As I said. In my opinion both is very important. A good knowledge and a good relation.
