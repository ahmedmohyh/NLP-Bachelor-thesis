In the following text I will answer the question if I agree or disagree with the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more impotant than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.".

First of all a teacher should have a healthy relationship with his or her students for a good atmosphere during the lessons. If there's a good atmosphere most students are more motivated to learn and also find it easier. 
Furthermore relating well with students is a huge point of ability to teach someone because understanding them can help to solve problems.

On the other hand it's also important to have excellent knowledge of the subject one teach. If they haven't it could be really difficult to answer questions and explain it in a way that the students can understand and remain it. For example: a math teacher writes down a term but can't explain how he figured it out or solved it. Nobody would understand it if it's the first time they've ever dealed with this theme.

In conclusion I think it's important for a teacher to have both abilitys: to relate well and to explain and know the subject well because if one of these two abilitys is missing it would be difficult for both sides, teacher and student, to have a good lesson or to learn things succesfully.
