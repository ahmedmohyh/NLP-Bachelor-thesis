This is a quite controversial statement but in regards to my personal experiences it is surprisingly true. Of course it is important for a teacher to know his subject well, but knowing it excellent not being able to express th knwoledge to other people isn't worth anything. The problem here is that you would need a good balance between these two points and in reality we can often see the exact difference. 
I think it is more important to relate well with the students because no one learns anything when the teacher is a smart ass without social skills. On the other hand there are those teachers that are basically bros with all the students but can't teach them anything on their subject because they aren't able to go deeper into the topic.
All in  all I would agree with the statement as long as the teacher has quite good knowledge on the subject.
