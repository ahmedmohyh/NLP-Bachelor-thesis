In the following essay I answer the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." in a argumentation.
 First of all I will say both is very important to be a good teacher, because it is necessary to relate with students well so you as a teacher can build a kind of connection to them. And when a teacher know you, they know your level and can build of it. It is not helpful when you have the knowledge and talk and talk about the subject and nobody of your students can understand you and know what you talking about. So it is a very important ability for a teacher that he can relate with students well and talk with them on the same level. But this is not the only aspect which makes a teacher a good one. A teacher should also know exactly about the subject he taught. It is his job to give his knowledge to his students so they are prepared for the life and have the chance to get a good job. The teacher is responsible for that his students graduate in this subject and so the teacher have to know excellent about his subject, because every student should have the same opportunities to have a chance of a good future.  
So all in all I think I can not disagree and agree with the statement that is more important to relate with the students as a teacher well than have the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In my opinion both are abilities which make a teacher a good teacher.
