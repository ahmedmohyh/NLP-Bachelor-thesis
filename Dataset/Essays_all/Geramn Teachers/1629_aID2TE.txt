While some may argue that the teacher's relations to the students improves their ability to learn, as they build up respect not only for the authority of the position of teacher, but also the person behind the job, this all goes to naught when the students do not actually learn much from the teacher they respect and would actually gladly listen to.
Another argument for the statement would be that the close relations between teacher and students would lead to a space in which everybody could learn according to their needs, as a student slower in learning could probably approach the teacher with a request for a slowed curriculum without fear of being reprimanded, but if knowledge that should be transmitted to students is missing on the teacher's side, there is no limit to the amount of time the slower student could spend on learning by himself something that should be transmitted and explained by the teacher.

I, on the other hand, think that education should come before relation in the case of students. Although a teacher with talent to motivate the class might be able to get them to learn faster, what will he teach with this efficiency when he is not well-learned in the subject he is teaching in? It might be great to have a teacher that experiments and jokes around with the class, but when an exam is due, not being wholly educated in the subject could be a stain on your academic reputation.
Even though bonding with the teacher might make you like his lessons, not having complete knowledge of the subject you should be educated in might come back to haunt you in higher education, as the exams there are standardized, which disallows teachers from excluding subtopics from them that they didn't teach because of missing knowledge.
A teacher who is well-educated and learned might not always relate well to students, but would possibly be able to give these students a better chance a their dream job by transmitting more information to them, which might help them later on in life. 


Overall, I think excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more im portant than an ability to relate to students.
