There are different types of teachers in every school. Some teachers are more able to relate well with the students, some teachers have an excellent knowledge. But what is more important?
Teachers with an excellent knowledge can prepare the students better for their A-levels, because they know more important facts than other teachers. But the knowledge is not the only imprtant thing. The students learn with more fun and understand more difficult topics in the lessons when the relation between the teacher and the students is good and relaxed, for exemple they have not got fear to ask questions and like to go to the subject, even they are not as good as others. When the teacher have a basic knowledge and can teach his or her subject very well, thus that the students become intersted in, this is more important than an excellent knowledge, because learning is more fun when you like the teacher and when he cares about his students, for exemple they can come to him when he or she has got problems. 
That is why i think a teacher`s ability to releate well with the students is more important than their knowledge.
