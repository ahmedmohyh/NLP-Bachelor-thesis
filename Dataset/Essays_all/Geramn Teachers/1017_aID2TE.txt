The statement A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is a state which is diffcult to agree or disagree, because of the following arguments.

A good relation to a student is very important, because the student shouldn´t think that the teacher gives him bad marks because he doesn´t like this student or is probably not well. The students have to think that the teachers want that the students have good marks. When the teacher is only talking borring and bad about everything and his realtion to the students is bad the students wouldn´t like this subject and their wont have fun at school and by learning. And in my mind its important that the children have fun by learning because they get better marks and are more interested in some subjects, so they can imagen what they want to study or what for a job they want to have later. So its important that the teacher is able to relate well to the students.
But I dont think that it is more important then the knowledge about the subject, because a teacher has to learn more about the subject he is interested in then learning how to relate to the students. If the teacher knows much about the relationship to students and not so much about his subject the students wouldn´t respect him and think bad about this teacher. For example, if an english teacher is talking more german then english in the lessons the students would think that this teacher can´t speak english enough, although the teacher want to use the german language only to relate well to the students. So the students wouldn´t listen to the teacher and wouldn´t respect him enough, even when he is probably well in this subject then the students think.

So i think that it isn´t more important for a teacher to have the ability to relate well to the students than excellent knowledge of the subject, but both is in the same way important. So the teacher has to know a bit of both knowleges.
