It is not easy to answer wether the teachers knowledge about the subject or his teaching skills are more important. At the one hand do you have a big problem if the teacher is not well informed about the subject he has to teach. The students wont learn anything when the teacher knows less than them. But I guess that on the other hand you won´t learn anything from someone with excellent knowledge about the subject, but who can not relate to the students at all, either. Anyway nowerdays you can be shure that every teacher has at least basic knowledge about the subject he has to teach. Some may know more than others, but knowing every detail does not help you when the students do not understand you. Or even when they don´t like you. The students will learn whith more entusiasm, when they like you and when they agree with your teaching methods. The students do not profit when the teacher knows everything about the subject. what they profit from are good teaching skills and this includes relating to the teacher and the teacher relating to the students.
In conclusion I would say that I agree with the statement. I learn more from a teacher who I can relate to, as long as he has basic knowledge about the subject. Mostly because I will imediatly learn with more entusiasm. I won´t learn anyrhing at all from someone who has excellent knowledge, as long as I can not relate to them.
