The statement `` A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.`` is a very important topic for our society today. The teacher´s need to know how they can make the students learning the stuff which is relevant in their subject but when they study they otfen only get thaught about their subject and not about how a teacher and his class can have a good philosophy.

First, it is important to say that even a teacher with a great ability to the students can´t make them learn stuff in the subject, because you need the knowledge of your subject for example if a class loves his teacher and he he knows his class, how he can bring them to learn and making a good ``leraning atmosphere``, the students won´t learn important stuff about the subject.
Then sometimes it could be a problem if  the teacher has a good reletaionship with his students because they might have no respect to a teacher who isn´t tmean sometimes. An example might be that the students wouldn´t listen to his teacher anymore and the class is loud.

On the other hand it is important to have a good realationship as a teacher with your class, because you know the class well then and the students might listen you more if you respect the students and treat them well for example in a class with a good climate, the students work better.

All in all i don´agree to the statement in all points, because a perfect teacher should have both: a good ability to relate with the students and a good knowledge of the subject. One thing wouldn´t work well without the otherone. So in my opinion it is important that the teacher´s will get taught while they are studying a subject, how they can get a good relationship with a class. An example might be that you as a teacher don´t only have contact to your students in school, you should also go on trips with your class where you can see how a student actually is.
