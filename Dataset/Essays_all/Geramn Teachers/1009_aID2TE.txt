What is more important? Having an excellent knowledge about something as a teacher or being able to understand and relate other opinions from students?

Teaching people know best about one subject because they think of facts which they have read or been tought earlier. That is why they have a fixed point of view. If a teacher decides to present a new subject to the class and maybe answers a question to begin, nobody would give the correct answer or the sentence, the teacher thought of. For example the phylosophy teacher asks if a boat would still be the same boat if everything was replaced. There are a lot of different opinions in class which are the best start for a discussion. 

In my opinion it is more important now to be able to understand others opinions even if the teacher doesn't agree with him or her. If somebody says that it would still be the same boat, he or she has to accept it. Knowing it better and telling the truth is first less important. Just let the students tell their opinions and after that a teacher kann give the correct answer.
