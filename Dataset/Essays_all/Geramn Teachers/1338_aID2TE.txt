Today we talked about a question, which is very important for a normally schoolday. The question is "Is the teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?" I answerd this question at followed.

I think it's important to have both aspects. If a teacher knows everything of the subject but can't explain that and don't have a connection to the children, they maybe have the wrong work. Every teacher needs a friendly atmosphere and a good way to show students the important facts of the subject. If a teacher is very unfriendly and do only his thing, the students don't like them and doesn't worked or learned so hard for the subject as for a subject with a very friendly and cooperative teacher. Students has more fun in a friendly and not so strong lesson. But a some points it is important so be streaght, to show the consecenses of the fellings and the (verhalten). A teacher need a good or very good knowledge of the subject, which being taught, because tghey must answerd all question, which the students have. Also they need some background information too. Students will have a answer at there questions, if they thing, the teacher has no knowledge, they can do jokes over this and began with mobbing. 

After this arguments i agree with the statement, because you must have a conection to the students and than you can worked with them. But if you have a excellent knowledge and a bad conection to the students, you can do your lessons alone, because only some students following your lessons. But this is not the ideal way. It is important to have both of them in the right moments, to show the students the knowledge of the subject in a positiv and funny way to know the stuff a few years later.
