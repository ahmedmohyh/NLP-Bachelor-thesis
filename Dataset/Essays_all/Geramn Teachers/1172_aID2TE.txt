I think a teacher need the knowledge, because when a teacher hasn`t the knowledge the students can`t learn anything. But it is important too that the teacher have a good ability to relate well with students. 
In my opinion the statement is right, because when a teacher hasen`t the ability to relate well it feel for the students boring and noboby is concentrate. And a teacher with this abilities can better share his knowlegde, so that the students know what he means. Then it is not so important to have the knowledge for a teacher, because so the student`s can learn with the teacher together, when he doesn`t know something in the lesson. Because I think this make the teacher like a stundent a then they have the same highness, so that the theacher is not over the student`s. And so the Ice break and the student`s have more fave, so is automaticly the "learning clima" better and this is important, because so the student`s and the teacher have it easier to learn or to share tis knowledge. Because when a teacher hasn`t the ability to relate well with sudents this is a harder work for both.
