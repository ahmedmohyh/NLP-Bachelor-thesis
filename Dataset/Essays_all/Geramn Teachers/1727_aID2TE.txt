The following essay concentrates on the question whether it is more important for teachers to relate well with their students or to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Fact is: a teacher without at least some knowledge about the subject he´s teaching shouldn´t be a teacher. But often teachers with a lot of knowledge struggle at the part of student-teacher communication. Teachers are supposed to teach students and to give their knowledge to the students which are often unmotivated and lazy. So how should a teacher without a good relationship to the students motivate them to learn and to show interest. The only answer is pressure and ZWANG? Very STRENG teachers often get their students to do their homework but those students don´t show a lot of interest.  So this kind of teaching isn´t fun for the teacher, neither the students. If a teacher communicates great with his class and relates well with his students there is much higher chance to achieve good grades - and that should be the goal for students and teachers. Studies also showed that the mental status of students influence their motivation to learn and to visit school. In my opinion the ability to relate well with the students is definitly more important than excellent knowledge because students LEISTUNGEN grow with  happiness and a good relationship to the teacher.
