In the following i will explain my opinion to this statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."
 We go to school because we are willing to get a great education. For that we have teachers that are supposed to have a knowledge about their subject so that they can teach us everything. If we have questions or don't understand everything they should be able to explain it briefly to us. So having an excellent knowledge is something teachers need to have.
But in my opinion it is much more than that. We go to school five times a week so we spent a lot of time with the teachers and that mostly for a few years. By that i want to say that if students relate well with the teachers it is easier for both to work together. But of course it is normal that sometimes you don't get along with eveyone but if a teacher doesn't like a student or the other way around they should still be friendly and respectful with each other. Students should be able to go out of school and say that they are happy to have the possibility to get such a great education. I mean not everywhere in this world there is the possibilty for children to go to school.
I have been going to school for almost 12 years so summarized i can say that with having a teacher that has a good relationship to the students it is easier for us to get along with the subjects being taught and for me it is important that i like goingt to school and having a great teacher that i like hepls me.
