The relationship between teacher and student can be very relaxed nowadays. But is a good ability to relate well with the students more important than a very good knowledge about the subject that is being thaught?
On one Hand a good relationship between both parties can make the lessons more interesting. They build a personal connection and trust each other, which could help teaching a subject more efficent and get to know the strenghts and weaknesses of the students. In addition to that its more easy for interverted people to get more active in the subjects, because they know their teacher and arent that scared anymore by getting their grades, as example.
On the other hand is the question what a personal relationship is worth if nobody learns someting. When the teacher doesnt know what hes talking about can no one of the students really learn anything new. As a result is a good graduation not possible and they maybe learn a lot slower. Moreover could some students dislike the teacher and personal insults are a possible ending for this situation. 
In a nutshell I think, that teachers should have a neutral position. They should know what they talk about, but also know the strengths and weaknesses of their students. That could help by solving problems easier. With that way, nobody gets really personal hurt, they can learn and dont have to be scared, because they have in mind that the teacher knows enough about them to give them fair grades.
