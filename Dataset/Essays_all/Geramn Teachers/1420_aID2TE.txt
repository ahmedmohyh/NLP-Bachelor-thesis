Often some children or teenager are depressed of teachers, who don't know how to handle them or giving them unfair grades. But they are also some stundents who think that it is useless to go to the school, because they think that they don't learn anything or they have to learn the stuff by themselves, because the teacher actually doesn't know his stuff. A statement to this theme was: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In the following text, I will share my opinion to this statement.

It is definitly a problem when a teacher doens't know his stuff, because the idea behind the school is to learn something and why you need a teacher which is funny and sympatic? Sure, the lessons are more relaxed and you can have fun in it, but in the end of the school you need to write many equal and important exams, but you can't write them when the teacher can't explain you the specific subjedct or theme, or you have to learn it by yourself, which makes the school lessons quite useless.
But if you have a teacher, who knows his stuff, you learn and understand it, and you can handle your exams quite easy. The problem is that he isn't sympatic and you don't like to go to his lessons, so you can get depressed too. But if you understand the subject in the school you don't need to learn it in your freetime so you can use this time to do funny and relaxed things.

I think a good teacher needs to have both utilities: He needs to have a good knowledge of the subject beeing taught for sure but he also need to know how to realte well with students. I think a good teacher has maybe 65 to 70 percent knowledge and 35 to 30 percent the oppurtunity to handle his stundents well and fair. So all in all i disagree with the statement and i think it is more important that the teacher knows his stuff.
