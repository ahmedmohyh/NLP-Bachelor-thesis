First of all it is more important that teachers are friendly to the students because when both sites are happy the learning works better. It is easier to learn for the students when the teacher is more relaxed because nobody likes a teacher who can`t love about some jokes. But when the teacher is too friendly to the students the school feeling misses and there is no real knowledge which is taught from the teachers. Maybe school or the classes have to find a way between relaxed feeling and an serious lesson. Two examples from my own German lessons at school were that I had two different german teachers the one was a young teacher. He made the lessons really relaxed and every student from our class liked him very much but there was not enough knowledge what he ist trying to taught us. The second teacher was an older teacher which was not so "cool" and nobody liked her very much. This teacher taught very much and we did things which weren`t really important for the classtests. Both teachers weren`t very helpful and the lessons weren`t the best to learn the important things for the classtest. I think when there is a teacher who made the lessons a little bit relaxed, the students are relaxed too and both sites are not stressed. So an relaxed feeling in the lessons can give an relaxed feeling in the classtest and maybe the results are better than the prepairing for the classtest with "Bad Teachers". Also the feeling of the teacher that everbody relates well with him and he relates well with everybody give him the feeling that everyone understand the topics.
