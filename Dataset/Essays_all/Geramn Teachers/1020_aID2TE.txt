Should a teacher raise all expactations to a standard that is not reachable for is student by convaing every last detail of their subject?
I think a teacher should reach out to his students and have a structured plan to bring accros as much as his students might take in, he should be able to see the limits of his pupils. 
If a teacher can't answer questions of his students it may take away the opportunity to learn something important for their lifes.
But for me it wouldn't be a problem if a teacher couldn't answer a certain question, in the time we live in now it would be far more interesting to try and find the answer on our own. It's no longer difficult to look up certain dates of wars or deaths in the history of our country or reasons for the characters oppinions or victories, so why shouldn't the class think of it maybe even discuss it with their own oppinions. Shy students might open up and talk about their oppinion when they feel strongly about a certain topic. 
Therefore it would give a teacher far more oppertunities to simply not have excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. Because now he can teach them how to talk freely or stand behind your own thoughts and how to bring it accros. This is far more important than a fact a student needs for one exam and will never need to recall.
So when a teacher doesn't have all the details to his subject would it effect the grades of his students?
When he can relate to his students, he'll propably know certain problems in their learning process, maybe even their lives. He can now bring them to their limit and really test how far they can go.
It would be far more usefull tah
