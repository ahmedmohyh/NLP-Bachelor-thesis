The statement "A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." have to be well discused.
The teacher ofcurse have to know what he is teaching very well. Otherwise he could not answere all the questions a student might have. Also if the teacher do not understand the subject being taught completely he could not relate on ideas or conclusions an intelligent student might have or he could not teach his subject in its full meaning. 

On the other hand he have to relate with the students to teach them. If he can not relate with them they might not respect him and do not even listen so they would learn nothing from the teachers lessons. It is also possible, if the teacher is excellent in the subject and he was never struggeling his self to learn the subject on his own, that he ca not understand why some students are struggeling with the subject. He could not help them to understand it better if he ca not get what they do not understand.
So by looking on these arguments I agree whit the statement because I think to teach students it is more important to find a way the students understand it well than havinbg a excellent knowledge of the subject. For the students it do not cares if the teacher got an excellent knowledge if he can not make this knowledge understandeble for the students because he can not relate with them.
