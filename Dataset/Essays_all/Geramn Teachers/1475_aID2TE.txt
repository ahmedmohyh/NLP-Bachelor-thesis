The question if a teacher should rather relate well with students or have excellent knowledge about the subject instead, has been asked for ages and still has no official answer.
While some say that a teacher should have very good knowledge about the topic they are teaching, others say that teachers should be able to communicate with their students instead.
Both sides have quite a lot of arguments and so there seems to be no way to answer the question in general.
But that's wrong. If students don't relate well with the teacher, the teacher won't be able to teach the subject to the students. On the other hand, a teacher should also know what they are teaching and not just relate well with the students.
But the teacher's ability to relate with the students is still more important. A teacher that is loved by their students will be able to motivate those students regardless how boring the subject that they are teaching is.
If a teacher is not able to motivate their students, the students won't learn a boring subject regardless the excellent knowledge of the teacher.
A teacher that knows their subject very good also seems to be a little annoying to many students.
It would be perfect if a teacher would be able to know the subject very good and also relate well with their students. The big problem is that most teachers aren't able to meet both of these qualities.
All in all the ability of a teacher to relate well with their students is definitely more important than having an excellent knowledge of the subject that is being taught because students will be more motivated to learn.
