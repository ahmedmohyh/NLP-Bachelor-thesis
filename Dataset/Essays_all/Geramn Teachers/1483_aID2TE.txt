In the following argumentative text, I will give reasons for and against the quote "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more importand than the knowledge of the subject being taught." and after it I will give an own opinion to this topic. 
On the one hand I absolutelly agree with the quote but the author doens't see the aspects of the good knowlegde of the teacher. Often teacher can't answer questions of students. This is very ennoying for them and lead often to a bad relate, because the stundents are thinking that the teacher isn't a good teacher and can't taught something. 
Another aspect is that the teacher with a very good knowledge of the subject can make a very interesting lesson. He brings up many aspects of the subject he teachs and he can, to connect on my first argument, answere the question in every region!
But a good nowledge about a subject doesn't mean the the teacher can teach it! Often it is too easy for the teacher and he forgets to say something that is not important for him but usuall it is the stuff for a stundet to understand it! Also the stundents don't try to ask the teacher to repeat it a second or a third time because they are not well related to him and they are scarred that they will get a bad mark, if they ask a "stupid" question. This would never happened, if the teacher had a well relation to the students. Than the students know they can ask every "stupid" question and are not afraid to it. Also is there a better comprehension of the stuff because the stundents have fun during the lesson and if there is fun they can learn much easier.
In my opinion I agree with the quote. I can learn better if I know that there is
