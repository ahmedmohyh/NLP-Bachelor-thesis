Is the teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught? That is an often discussed question, I will think about in this essay. In my opinion a teacher should know what he/she is teaching, because the students should have the chance to get as much information as possible about the topic. If the teacher isn't well informed about the things he/she is theaching, he/she can't help and explane enough if there are questions. So the students aren't enough prepared for exams and class test and this might have a negativ influence on their grades.
But on the other hand learning in class is much more eaysier with an friendly atmosphare. A teacher with the ability to relate well with students can create such an atmosphare, because the students aren't worried about asking something or telling the teacher about their problems. Besides learning is much more fun with a friendly teacher, who is open for students questions or have got new, creative ideas for make learnig eaysier. 
In this case I agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. Of course the teacher's knowledge is important, but I am the opinion, that students can learn enough with a not exellent knowledge. But I'm sure thex would make more efforts in the thaught subject with a friendly teacher
