On one hand I agree with the statement "A teachers's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." while on the other I disagree.

Starting with why it is more important to relate well than knowing everything, the most important aspect is that the students will probably like the teacher and therefore are more motivated to come to lessons and work. For example when a teacher doesn't give much homework because they (in this text also used as a single, gender neutral pronoun) say they know it is hard enough fing a healthy balance between school and leisure time or hobbies without extra work at home then the students will feel understood and work better in the lessons because they know they will not get any homework. Another aspect is that the students might think of the teachers as a kind of "friend" meaning that if they dislike something in the lesson or something is boring they can openly tell the teacher who could use these informations to improve the quality of their lessons.
Now onto why I disagree. I think a teacher should rather have excellent information because if they do not and for example a student has a complex question that the teacher cannot answer without looking it up first the students might think of them as an underqualified teacher and even make fun of them. They will get less motivated because maybe from now on they think that their teacher will not be able to explain things anyway leading to students not asking in the first place. They will get frustrated and will therefore not work and learn as well.

All in all I think teachers should find a way to relate to students while also having excellent knowledge. Of course it is obvious that teachers are only humans so it is understandable that sometimes they do not know an answer but it should not happen to often. But they should also not relate to the students too well because after all they are a teacher and not a fellow student.
