Teachers have a very important role in school. They have to do different works and there comes up a statement which I will answer with the following text. "A teacher's abilitiy to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

On the one hand, it is really important that the teacher's know their subjects very well, because they have to teach their students and they should transfer their knowledge to them. So they need to have a good knowledge of their subjects. So it can be a big advantage for the teachers if they know very much about their subjects and if they can explain it very well for all students.
But on the other hand, it is more important that teachers have a good relationship to their students and they have to know which the best way is to theach them. All students have different ways of learning and they have to find out which way the best is for the whole class. They need to have a really good understanding in teaching students and solve the problems of missunderstandings. It also gives a few students which have any problems at home or something else and this has consequences of their results in school. So the teacher has to talk with the student and he should have a kind of understanding why the student is good or bad in the subject. They also have to relate with the students which are problem-students, that means that they have to solve problems between them and not only to teach them in class. 

I agree with the statement that the teacher's abilitiy to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I think that both factors are really important if you want to be a teacher, but in my opinion it is a bit more important if you know how to relate with the students.
