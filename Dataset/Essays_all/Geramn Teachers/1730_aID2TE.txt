I agree with this statement but only partly. Because if a teacher is the most funny and most sympathic teacher in the world but can't teach me anything or even answer my questions about his subject not even his ability to relate will help me to learn about the subject and even to graduate. It has to be a combination of both. A combination of being able to relate well with us the student and to have an excellent knowlegde of the subject he taughts me.

In all of these years I have been going to school and with all those many different teachers I had, I can say my favourite teachers are those who are strict but nice and know what they talk about. In 5th grade I had this exact perfect combination of a teacher in math. He inspired us to learn math even if it is a subject that usally isn't everyones favourite but he catched all of us and was able to awake a certain interest and patience for math. He was a huge idol in all of our lifes 

On the other  hand I once had a teacher I really really liked but he just could exactly teach his subject and now everybody whom had him in class have huge problems in this subject and we will graduate in one year and we all have to teach it to ourselfs and that creates a lot of problemes

It is also proven that we learn the best when we are having fun or atleast get positive vibes. The teacher should create a positive learning atmosphere and give the stundent the feeling that it is okay to make mistakes because learning is a process and nobody is perfect. To a good relationship with students always follows respect on both side for each other and that reakly encourages you in your learning.
  

In summary I think it is more important for every teacher to be able to relate to his students easily but if he can't teach us good that is very negative for each student and in the end even for our graduation and our inspiration to this subject.
