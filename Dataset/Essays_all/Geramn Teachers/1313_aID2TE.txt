There are many influences on our grades we get at shool. One of them is the relation between a student and his teacher. Both are humans and relay on an emotinal relation. But should grades get more influenced by an emotional relation between a student and the teeacher then by the knowledge of a student?
Of course it is important to have a relation to your teacher, otherways he couldn´t grade you. But the grades you get are influenced by your oral grade and your writing grade. The wrinting grade can´t get muched influenced by a relation to your teacher. For example in Maths the answers you give are right or wrong. Yout mathteacher couldn´t change somthing, wether he likes yout or not. 
But if we take a look at the oral grade, we see, that often it´s not only hard working for good notes. Thats because of the relation between a teacher and his student. For example: If you have seven pints writtten in mathe, but you need ten points in your grade, but normally you arn´t as good in the oral grade to reach this ten point, the teacher could make use of his pedogagical independence. It means, that a theacher could change your grand however he want to. Of couse a must have a reason for that, for exaple good work at homeworks ore something like that, but these reasons could get easy imagined. So yes, the relation to your grade can get influenced by your ralaiton to your teacher. If you play in the same football team with him, your crade could get upcraded at one ore two points. But should This be allowed?
In my oppinion not. The shool is a place to learn things an your grade shows, how good you can learn thins or how much freetime you use for homework ore preparing lessons. The grades you get in shool will influence your wohle life after shool. Finally your grade shouldn´t get influenced by a ralation to a teacher, weather he likes you or not.
