Should a teacher have the ability to relate well with students or should he have excellent knowledge of his subject?That's a difficult question with an easy answer. He should have both.

A good teacher can talk with the students. He understands them and their problems and should be able to help them. Good knowledge ist important, but it's not the only hing a teacher should have. The teacher could know everything about his topic, when he can't explain it to his students, so that thy doesn't understand anything, he isn't a good teacher. On the other hand, a teacher who havend an excellent knowledge of his subject, isn't a good teacher too. Mabye he could explain the things he know, but thats not enought. The students couldn't learn everything they needed or wanted. In the worst case, the teacher tells something wrong or copies something from the internet, which isn't complete or well explained. Maybe it's wrong too.

Only because the teacher could relate with the students, he haven't the qualification to teach. A big knowledge of the studied topic helps to explain it to the studenst, because when you knows your topic well, you could explain it well. And if a teacher could explain well, the students will listen und try to be good in this subject. Then he can relate to them und both can learn from each other.

I know that there are some teachers, who have excellent knowledge, but they doesn't really try to explain the topic to their students. They coudn't relate to their students, so the students coudn't relate to the subject and have problems with it. Liking a subject has lot to do with the teacher. Even boring topics could be teached interessting, if you have a good teacher and other way round.And if you are interested in something, you learn better and understand it easier.

To sum up, a teacher shoudn't have one or the other ability and no ability is more important than the other. Only when a teacher has both, be could be a good teacher.
