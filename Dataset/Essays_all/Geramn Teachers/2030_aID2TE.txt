If the atmosphere in class isn`t good then the students won`t learn as much as they could learn if there would be a good atmosphere. A good relationship leads to productive communications and the students are also willing to learn more. 

But as a matter of fact the teacher`s knowledge is very important too. Sometimes a good relationship between teacher and student is just not possible because of multiple reasons. Then it is necessery that the teahcer has excellent knowledge to give the students the opportunity to still learn a lot.

It is probably better for the students to have a teacher with excellent knowledge because then they will also understand the important and different tasks. When the relationship and the atmosphere is great there could be the issue that they are not working hard enough and maybe talking about private things a bit too often.

So on my opinion knowledge is much more important than the chemistry between students and teachers because I can use the knowledge that I receive for the future of my life. This is not the case with a good relationship.
