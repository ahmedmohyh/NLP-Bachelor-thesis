In the following Essay i will dicuss if it is more important that a teacher can relate well with stundants or if perfect knowledge.

Normally every stundent expect that his teacher is able to speak perfect english. But is that really the most important thing? 
Of course it is necessary that a techer know much about his subject and he tellls his students what he know. But it is also important that a teacher is able to make his student clear what he wants and expect from them. Also to be a techer does not mean that you just need to be good in English it is more important to teach them. To teach is the main point of an teacher, he is job contains to raise the people up to make them fit for their life and not to give them all the input about the language.
The other Point is that the teacher has nearly excellent knowledege of the subject he taught. Because if he has not why is he even a teacher than then you could place anyone there who maybe can deal perfect with kids but is bad in using English or is just as good as the student. 
Another Point would be that with an teacher with excellent knowledge the lessons would not be as fun as with a teacher who can relate good with students. Maybe it could be a little bit depressing for Student because the Teacher expects so much of his students but they all will get bad marks because they got the input and did not know what to do with it.

For me as a student it is more important to have an teacher who can have the ability to relate to students because i need this extra help to understand all the stuff we have to know. Of  Course there are other student who does not have this problems and who just need input and can transform that in Knowledge emideatly but that does not happen that often. i think for student a mixed type of this teachers would be perfect because it includes that you get the knowledge you need for your life and the teacher can be sire that you really understanded that what they told you.
