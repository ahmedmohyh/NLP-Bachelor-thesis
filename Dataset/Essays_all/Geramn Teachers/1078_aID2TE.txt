In the following text I will deal with the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more importent than excellent konwledge of the subject being taught". 
This statement bring's me up to two different answers. On the one hand is the fact that students need to be teached with excellent knowledge to use this knowledge to find new ofter better sulucion. Is means for example that students which have been teached with the overall knowlodge for example in Physiks can use this knowlegde to find the anwsers for ever complexer systems/questions. On the other hand is the way students like to learn and that mean that teacher need to have the ability to creat a nice and comfitby clima in class. This does not mean that the teacher need to be friends with there students! But that includes for both sides to have respect for the other and keep in mind the mistake. Fathermore on the teacher sides this includes to work with mistake there students made. 
Finilly I need to say that his statement can't be answer with yes your right, no your wrong. So in my oppion the is a "golden middle way" that includes that teacher's need the skills to be a teacher like being frindly create respect but they also should have close to excellent konwlegde so they know a lot about there subject.
