First of all, I think that there are pro and cons concerning this question. on one hand, I think it is not good when the relation between the teacher and the students becomes too well, because it might turn into some friend relation. The teacher must stay an authority and it must be an equal relation to each of the students. But this is not even possible, because it is human to like one person more than another. In my opinion it is the job of the teacher to concentrate on teaching the students the knowledge without getting too personal. But otherwise it is helpful to have a good connection and relation to the students, because then the students are more willing to listen and learn. If they know that their teacher is friendly, supports them and understands their fears and thoughts then it may help to improve the skills of the students aswell. If they hate the teacher they would not be motivated to do something to improve their skills, because they want to show the teacher how bad he is at teaching his knowledge. At least, it is necessary that the relation between students and teacher stays at a certain level and does not get too deep or too much like friends. It is clear that it might help by teaching the knowledge, but finally we need to find something in between, so the chances for every student stay the same.
