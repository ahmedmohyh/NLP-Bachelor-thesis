 I am agree with that statement because we all know this situations in the school when the teacher can't  relate well with the class and everybody ist just bored of his or her lessons because they get nothing althought the teacher has a big knowledge and the quality of his lessons is high.It's only useful for students who can understand the things very fast and for the others who aren't maybe  good  in this Subject is it a big Problem because they cant' follow the lessons.So on my Opinion it's great when the teacher can relate very well with his students because if they like him and he makes his lesson intressting ,everybody enjoys his method of learning and also have fun on it.Also these students who has Problems with this subject get a better chance to become better and better because they know that they can always talk about their problems with a teacher who has got this abilty.So i think the teacher doesn't have to know everything exellent the teacher just have know how he or she has to work with class to get the best results for everybody and a good relationship makes it much easier to know what the students need .I would say it's one of the most important abilitys a teacher need .I also know it of my own experience when i had teachers who could relate great with my class everybody was just happy and nobody was scared of a classtest because we all had fun at learning and were perfectly prepared for it.I also can understand whith people who say that the exellent knowledge is more important but thats how i said only for few students in the class who are great in this subject and does't have any problems.But if the teacher has an very bad knowledge i his subject then there can be a Problem because he has  to prepare his students at the end of their schooltime for the graduation and the quality of his lessons isnt good enough then is it now important that the students have fun because they also have to be ready for the graduation.
