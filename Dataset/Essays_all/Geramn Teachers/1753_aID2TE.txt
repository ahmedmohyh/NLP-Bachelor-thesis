We often get angry, because our teachers give us unfair grades or they give to much homework. Also we get angry when a teacher, acspecially in maths doesnt know anything or cant even explain a subject. We get mad when the teacher cant really explain us the topics, but also when he cant handle a class on his own controll, So many students are in a disadvantage when they have such a teacher. I´d like to talk about what is more important, to have an absolute
omplete knowledge and a super education or just the ability to get allong with the class. 
My opinion is, that its very heard to learn by a teacher when he or she is really unfait to you and your class. it´s important that a teacher goes along with many students as possible. So he can motivate his students. 
But of course he has to think of fair grades too and also about the educational aspect. I think both of the aspects if its the ability to get allong with children or to reach the perket knowlede level are important. So a good mix of both would mix a perfekt tacher. 
But if i had to choose one of this aspects i would prefer a teacher who has a nice and lovly character and is super social and funny and great. I would prefer study in a class with this kind of teacher, because i am ready to learn more on my own if i have the guarantee, that my teacher will be such understandeful person: i THINK IT IS SO a big difference if you lern a subject that you like with a teacher you like, who doesnt stress you but you can enjoy your class. Or if you have an old, boring teacher, who always does to many things Wich your class and never finishes before.
I just think we have all different characters and so have teachers, and we all have to get allong with eah other. So its more imporatant to get a nice teacher, than a ambitious and driel teacher.
