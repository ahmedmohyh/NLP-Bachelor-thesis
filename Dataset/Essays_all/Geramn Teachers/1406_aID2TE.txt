In every school the teachers have to (lehren) the students. Some teachers are very friendly but they can't (beibringen) something, but the stundents like them. And some other teachers aren't friendly but they can (beibringen) something. Now there's a question. Is it more important to (beibringen/lehren) something or is it more importent to are friendly and have a good relation with the students.

Everyone is going or was going to school and you are going to school cause you want to lern something. The teachers are there to teach something but when it's more important to have a good relation with the students than to teach something the parents paid for nothing for school. 
For the stundents it's also not very good because they won't leran something but when they are in class they are happy when they don't make lessons. Their social compethenses are better when they have a good relation with their teacher and they want to go to school. They also have a person they can trust them and it's important to have somebode like that.

When you compare these two arguments it's more important that the children have somebody who have a good relationship with thembut it's also very important to study. When you won't study you can't have a good paid work. They have to think at their future.

My opinion is that the two arguments are both very important and you can't say that only the relationship with a teacher is more important or to study.
