Teachers have to give marks to their students. The marks should tell how good somebody is in this subject. Now there is a new thesis: A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I think that marks should be given for good knowledge and participation in class because that is what students are used to do and this method gives them feedback. A good relationship between teacher and student should not be important for marks because the social skills have nothing to do with the skills in a specific subject. There are always teachers who don´t like a student and this fact should not bring a bad mark although the student participates well. I think that the fact wether a teacher likes you or not, always influences your mark but I also think that this is unfair. A student can bring very good work and can have very good knowledge but can be at the same time unpolite or just unsympathic. With this thesis the student would get a bad mark even he is really good in this subject, just because of his behavior or even his aura. So the other way round students could get very good marks just for always saying "hello" to the teacher. If the relationship counts most and the knowledge very less, it would not be important to have all these different subjects, it would be enough to interact with different teachers.
I think that marks should be given for participation and knowlegde and not because a good or bad relationship, just like it is handled right now.
