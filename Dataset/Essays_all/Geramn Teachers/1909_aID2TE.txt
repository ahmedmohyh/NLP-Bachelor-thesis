Of course it is important for the teacher to have knowledge of the subject. Otherwise it cannot be taught. A twelve-year-old for example cannot teach about vectors in mathematics because he does not have the knowledge and probably does not even know what vectors are.
But if the teacher is bad at teaching and cannot reach his students, all this knowledge is useless. 
Furthermore, school is not only important for the knowledge the students receive but for the social skills theyx obtain. This is made clear by the fact that students remember only ten percent of the things they learnt in school after they graduated. 
In the work life it is also more important to work efficently and to be a socially acceptable person than to have a good degree and the best marks. For example if you have a normal office job or really any other job it is not crucial to know what geological structure Italy has.
Additionally, students are more motivated to do something for school and to do homework if they like the teacher because they probably want him or her to like them too.
To sum it up, I would say that a teacher needs both the ability to relate well with students but also needs to know his subject. But some teacher are more easy-going than others and that is good and cannot be changed. In the work life one needs to cope with strict and unlikeable people, too, so teachers of any kind are a good practice.
