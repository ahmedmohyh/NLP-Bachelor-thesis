I don´t agree with this statement. Yes, seriously it´s good to relate well with the teacher but an exellent knowledge of the subjekt is more important. To have a nice climatic workgroup in class is much easier to have fun in school. Seriously this is a big point to make a good work. But if it is too funny it could be the student forgett the real reason why they go to school. the have to learn. Allright, it´s easier to lern when you like what you do but lerning isn´t everytime funny and nice. So a good teacher have a good "realationship" with the students but never forgett whats the main point in school. Also if you have an nice time in school but you failed all of the exams it is not the best way. So if schooltime ends nobody asks you what kind of realationship do you had with your teacher. They are interested in your grates. So it´s more important to have an execellent knowledge of the subject. Nevertheless students relate well with the teacher have more fun to go to school  and when you finde something nice to do you are more interested in this. Disegreeing it´s more important to relate well with the teacher is more important I agree it ist important too. Everybody like the lessons with a friendly teacher and a good climatic workgroup. I think the teacher are thinking the same. when everybody feels nice in the group they learn better because of fun. An excellent knowlage comes with the interesting and you be interest in something if you have fun to leran the thematic. Cause the teacher have to shows the thematic it´s connected if you like or do not like them. but nevertheless at the end the resault of the knowledge of the subject is the importenest.
