On this world, there are lots of teachers and like not every person is perfect, not every teacher can be perfect. One teacher has more knowledge while the other one can relate with the students. But what is more important?

At first I want you to tell you a story about my history teacher, in the 7th grade. She had knowledge. But she couldn´t understand us and couldn´t find a good way of speaking with us. She was a kind of unauthorized person and so we started to do what we wanted to in her lessonns. In each of her lessons it was quiet loud in the classroom and we weren´t productive. And so we didn´t learn anything. 

Some similiar stuff was going also going on in the 8th-9th grade, with my physics teacher. So I thik this case happens quiet often. 

But now we have to aks us the question- happen the other situations more often? Well I haven´t got some studies but I´ve got my life and in comparison I havn´t met a teacher like that. I met a teacher who had not the best knowledge but also not the best relationship with us. 

But what if? If a techer hasn´t got knowledge what should the teacher do? Play the whole time with the children  or sing, or anything else? In each possible case the children wouldn´t learn anything, especially about the specific lesson. 

I think that both cases aren´t really good. But I think, that when the techer hasn´t got the knowledge about the specific lesson or theme the children don´t learn anything about it. But when the teacher has got knowledge but can´t relate with the students, it´s the choice of the students if they want to learn anything or not. So all in all the case of a teacher, who can´t relate with the students but has got knowledge is better for the students. But the best and reachful teacher, is a teacher, who hast got both qualities, who can realte well with the students and who has got an exellent knowledge.
