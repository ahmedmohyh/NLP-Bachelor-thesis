Esspecally in the last years the many times of change in our school-system and problems betwheen pupile and teacher have leed to the question, if beneath   teaching other qualifications, like the relating with the kids are the same, or may even more importend. In the following I will try to draw a conclusion about these theme.
After all the most importened thing in school is learning, teachers don't have to be liked, they have to spreed knowledge and may some children are not showing respect any more if the interacton with the teacher is too friend-like, so that would be followed by a worser learning level. 
On the other side it is clear to see that some teacher, esspacelly in the younger classes, where the kids are still more childish and sensetife do not seam to have any knowledge how to deal with them. This missing knowledge is the reason they misstreat children by shouting untill they cry, very hard extrawork , when the do things "wrong" they can't change, like there not so well handwriting or fullfilling other old teacher-cliches. And also in later clases the exchange betwheen some teachers and theyr pupile is not that well, so there are many teachers who get reactions wrong or don't see that half of the class has not understood what they just sayd.
Again here starts the next problem in these area, there are some teacher who know very well about there theme but seam completely unable to explain it in an easy way to children. At last there is a problem in these are from teacher-pupil interaction, which goes in the other direction: The loose of respect and some other society changes lead, most in the older clases, to the fact that the teacher is unable to deal with the missplaced behaviour of the teens,there rebelious and sometimes violent actions against him.
So in may opinion it is importened that, while the interaction should not get in any friend- or parent-like direction, esspecelly in the younger classes teacher learn better how to deal with kids, so that itwould be a good idea to give pedagogical lessons as a part of the teacher-study.
