Teachers need different abilitys to teach their students in various subjects.
These abilitys primarly should be the ability to give the students a good learning experience, aswell as a good knowledge of the subject being taught. In order to give a good learning experience it is hard to say, if the knowledge of the teacher or the interaction with the student is more important. If you compare these two points you can say that both have positive and negative aspects.
First off the knowledge of the subject is a key factor for the teaching experience, because a teacher with more knowledge will be able to explain the subject much better in comparison with a teacher with poor knowledge. However too much knowledge might be negative because the subject might become more difficult with more informations added by the teacher.
This problem can also be related to a failed communication between the teacher and his student.
If the Teacher does not have the ability to relate to his students, the exact consequence could be, that the teacher starts to teach the subject in a much to difficult way, which he does not realize and following the students just can not keep up with the informations given to them and they start to show negative results.
When a Teacher does have the ability to relate,first off he will know when a student gets problems with the subject and following he can help him.
Second off he might teach the subject in a easier way to make the learning process for the students easier.
In my opinion a teacher should have both qualities to give the students the best learning experience, because knowledge aswell as relatability are booth important for the lesson.
