On the one hand you have schools for pupils aged from 6 to 10 and on the other hand you have the middle and high school. You have to think of this statement for every single of those chapters in school. 
For the first school, pupils come in, i would totally say that it is more important for a teacher to relate well with his/ her children because in this time children are in the major part of their development. It is not that important to get an excellent knowledge of any subject, it is more important to learn social life standarts and how to take care of other people.
For middle and high school it is totally different. Pupils should have the knowledge of how our society works and should know how to deal with other people. Here it is important to get the excellent knowledge of subjects. A teacher should be able to prepare their student for a possible future. That this does not work with only a good knowledge is obvious. But it is now longer not too important to relate well with students if the main focus is on the future.
That is why i would agree on the statement for teachers of the firts school that pupils get through. But for middle and high school when the children are old enough to see that it is now important to get a good knowledge teachers should be able to have this excellent knowledge and a good relationship with all students because both is important.
