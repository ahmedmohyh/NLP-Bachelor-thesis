This essay I will start with examples which I have seen on the TV. My sister is now 10 years old and she looks quite often TV. As a little child she has often seen advertisment of Hasbro, chewingum marks and others. Now there are tablets and computers in the TV which are only for kids. 
Of course the opinion is relative to the person who is thinking about this but generally I think that it is very complicated to say something about this statement.

I think that it should be allowed to make advertisement to little children because a lot of people earn money with this and they probably have also some children which they have to feed.
On the other side I think that children aged from two to five generally don't have to looking at TV. They should better playing in the nature with friends. To look in screens is normal for the elder but for young children it is not so good for growing up with this kinds of technics but that is my opinion. It could be that I am a little bit too hard and it looks like I am a father but it is my opinion. At age two to five I haven't allready looking into things like TV and computers I looked at some pictures from books or I played with my playmates and I made things like this.

Because all the media have advertisment in their programm you have to decide of your own if you will looking that or not but the children could not decide if they will look at this. They are only looking at this and they believe in the advertisment because it is so cool and nice to be a princess or a cowboy like the kids in the advertisment.

At least I will say that all the people decide of their own what their kids could do and what they should no do. But I would say that my kids aged from two to five  should not looking TV anyway. Not because of the advertisment it is because of the creativity they could loose with the state picture of how the kids should play. In my opinion they have to invent their own games.
