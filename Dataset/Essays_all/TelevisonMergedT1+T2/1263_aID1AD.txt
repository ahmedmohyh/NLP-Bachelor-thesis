The question if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five ) should be allowed or not is often disscused. Many parents don't want the television advertising directed toward their children because they have fear that the advertising chance their children and that they want everything which appears in the advertising. It might be that they will called names in preschool because they don't have the newest things, which are on TV.  They also have fear that the advertising leads their children to watch television very often and that they won't meet with friends anymore or do their hobbys. Other people think that the advertising won't harm the kids and won't chance them because the parents have still the control about the kids. 
I think television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) isn't neccesary because they are very young and maybe the advertising will form them. I think it's also unessesary that children watch television and that people in such a young age want everything what they see in the advertising but I also think that it depends on the form of the advertising. A memory advertising, which they created with a friendly atmosphere for example is better than an advertising for a coputer game, where you have to kill people.
