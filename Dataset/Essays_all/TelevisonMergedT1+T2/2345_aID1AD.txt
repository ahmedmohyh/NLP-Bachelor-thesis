Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because they want the things shown in the advertisement. They will cry and shout intil they get the things. But when they get it, it will become boring after a short time and the family just lost so much money on some silly things.
But it also could be allowed.
The young children wouldn't even notice the advertisement sometimes. And they won't be shown that much on the TV.
Also will they forget what were in the advertisement. They are very young, so they should forget the things after a few minutes. Followed by that, children should not watch that much TV. They should play outside or play with teir family. They have better things to do than watching TV.
I don't see a good reason why it should not be allowed. 
The children are so young they will forget so much of the advertisements and they don't watch that much TV. They should play with their family or friends and not watch TV. When some families have problems with it, they just need to not allow the children to watch TV.
