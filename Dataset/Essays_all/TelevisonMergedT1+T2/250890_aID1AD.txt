I'm watching a nice show on TV and suddenly advertising. I don't like it but whatever. I just switch to another channel but again advertising. Everywhere those adverts. Since some years there are even adverts for young children. In these following lines I'll talk if those adverts toward young children should be allowed or not.

Some arguments, from the side that think why it shouldn't be allowed, are for the sakes of the parents. Young children can be very greedy when it comes to stuff they want. So if they see an advert and a toy, they then really want, in it they're going to ask the parents to buy it for them and if not they will cry until they get what they want. I often did that when I was young but there were no such adverts. But now we live in 2016 and everything is obtainable in the internet which means that it's a three step process to buy something and the young children of this generation know that.
 
If I'm honest, I don't think it shouldn't be allowed. What bad influence can it have for the young children? They don't even have to watch these adverts if they don't want to.

I don't really mind what kind of adverts they are. It just gets on my nerves when they interrupt a good series again and again. 

My personal opinion is that they should remove all adverts in general because nobody likes them.
