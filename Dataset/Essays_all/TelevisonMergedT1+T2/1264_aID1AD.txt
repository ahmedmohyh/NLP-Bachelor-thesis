At the newespaper you often read that young children often watch television as often as thei're parents do you agree or disagree with this statement? In many familys the kids often watch television so the parents can relaxe or do something that they want and did'nt play with the kids.

I think it should be allowed when they watch only an half an hour or something like that. But when they often watch television, they didn't play enough time outside or with friends. Sometime the television is something you can learn from. The parents should give them a timeline for example only one serie before they go to bed. The parents didn't watch telesivion so long too,because the kids think it's right what the parents do. I think when it's not be allowed the kids demonstrate with this and it's often hard to life when the kids are sad or something like that. The kids can often be angry when they watch to much television and watch the false series too. An other thing is that the kids very sad about it when the parents did'nt play with them and only watch television is bad for the parents too. It's okay when the whole family watch a movie at weekend night then they do something together and it's something that the whole family like. It's also okay to show the kids the news on television because to show whats happend in the world and that the kids learn something about the world. I think it's important to have time with kids and not with the television . At the end the parents say that is okay or not,but I think it's not bad when kids watch television but they need a timeline.
