I think too many laws about everthing isn't good. Because a law is only against the symptom. It doesn't matter what it is, i'am not a friend of laws. In fact i'am an anarchist. A world without laws and borders is my dream. I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not. But whith a law nothing is natural yet. It is only a preasure. So the princip is simple. If you and only you or your husband/wife think it isn't good for our children watching tv, you can forbid. And it is more senseful if you make a campaign against the children watching tv. You should give options to the children like playing in nature and playing sport. And it is also important how long the chlildren watching tv. Cause of watching tv isn't always bad. The children can also leaning a lot if they looking science magazines or the breaking news. Also and important point is that if it isn't allowed yet, most of the children would still watching tv. Cause of who will control, that they aren't watching tv? It isn't possible. So i think at finish it is also a question of the mass, like in thousand different other things in life.
