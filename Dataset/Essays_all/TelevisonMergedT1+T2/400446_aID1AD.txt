Kids shouldn't watch TV, because it makes them use their valuebal time they have as kids. It's important that they are allowed to be kids and not grow-up to quickly just because they are allowed to watch TV. When I was a kid we didn't have a TV and I'm happy that we didn't. Dini Mudda. SALEEEEE. I totally agree to this statement and I hope that most of the people do, because we want smart and cool kids, and not the unse who are pumped up with TV trash. I don't like people who watch too much TV, so as 23 hours a day, they are really dump because they miss the oppertunity to live and have a fun life with friends, parties and family, only because they watch too much TV. And everything is too much. TV is pretty much trash and it's no good that it got invented. I don't like TV. Only when I'm feeling trash it's ok to watch trash TV. Then the TV and I are both trash and I feel better because I have a trash friend. HOYA. Our society is made out of addicted people in any way. We are addicted to : cigs, coffee, TV, drugs (such as coke), we love to drink a good drink and live the high life. I don't like to watch TV or do any of the things above. Because I concore the addicted and try to be different. Kids shouldn't watch TV. It makes them dumb. CAN I GET A HOYYYYAAAAAAA. My  friends are cool, we're the cool kids. When I was younger I wanted to become cool, and here I am. Cool like ice and hard as a rock.  I hate television.
