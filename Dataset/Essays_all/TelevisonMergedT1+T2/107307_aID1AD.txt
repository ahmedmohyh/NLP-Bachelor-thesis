Children between two and five years don't really know, what they want. They see something and if they like it, they want it. But often, after a few days they forgot what they wanted and then they want something new. Because of their kindness, they can't assess, what they need. 
For the enterprises, which produce specifically for children, it's perfect, that the children don't know, what they really want. 
I agree with this statement, because chrildrens are the stakeholders with the lowest influene of their buying behavior. If they like the product, they want it. Often the parents of the first child, wants to make their children very happy, so they buy them everything they want. In this age it important to say, that the kids can't assess if the toy they see is really interessting. The toy loss on value with the time. This time is often a short period of time.
From the perspective of the enterprise, the children are the perfect target group. Especially, because the parents wants to give presents to their children, they are extremly attentively in case what their childrens want to play. The parents can't assess, if a toy is a good toy or a bad toy. It's difficult to recognize if their children could have fun with this toy. Often the advertising don't expect like the reality. It the advertising,the players walk to a farytale and experience a lot of things. This is the childrens imagination. But in reality it's just a boring game which you can play on the table. And with this phenomenon, childrens don't get, what they expected.
