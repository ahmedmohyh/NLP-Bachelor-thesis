The aim of this essay is to agree or disagreee with the statement if advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

I disagree with the statement because there is no shown dammage of advertising toward young children. It affects nor their brain nor their character in a bad way. 
Another reasons why I disagree is that young children should get accustomed to advertising in young age. They have to learn how to deal with tempting adverts. So it's actually good for their learning process.

I agree with the statement because young children are overwhelmed more easily and hesitate less to buy a product shown in a advert. Even worse if they don't have any money, they are tempted to steal the goods presented in TV. 
Adverts are often surreal videos about the affect a product can have. For example "Red Bull" shows that that the actor is able to fly after drinking a red bull. Such adverts could influence the behaviour of a young child. So if they believe in the advert of red bull, they might even jump off a cliff after drinking a red bull because they think they can fly.

I conclude that I agree with the statement based on the reason that advertising could really harm young children and has an influence on their behaviour. Therefore television advertising toward young children should be banned.
