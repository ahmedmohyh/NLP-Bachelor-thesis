In the following text I´ll collect some reasons against the statement, that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

I think that Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it´s the role of the parents to say what their children should watch and what they shouldn´t watch. If they don´t want their children to watch advertising in Television they have to safed their children against the advert. This is not a problem of a brand or the Television programm. The brands only want to sold out their products and for example advertising in Televison is a very good strategy of marketing to support their products and in this part of time it is a very normal thing. Also the children could be in contact with advertising in other parts of their life for example in a magazine or at a poster in a city when the brands want to show the toys that the children could get at christmas. There nobody can say that it isn´t allowed because the most of the brands does it. So my opinion is that I disagree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. When I was younger for example at the age of two or three I were not allowed to watch any Television and when I was four I were only allowed to watch a programm that didn´t show advertising (KiKa). 
All in all everybody has to say for their own if it is okay to show young children adverts in Television or not. If they didn´t want that then there children don´t has to watch advert in Television.
