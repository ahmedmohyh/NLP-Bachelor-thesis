On one hand it is right that television advertising directed towardyound young children should not be allowed. Beacuase the influence of the television is bigger than we think. The children do what they see on television. They can not think what is real and what is just fantasy. 
On the other hand I think it is not so bad. Because the brain does not grow very much anymore. So the influence of televisions can not be so bad. 
At all, I would say, that every parents should be decide by his own. Every person thinks different about television and children. So everybody should do what they want. But I think it is not good something to allowed. Because it is just an little thing - there are bigger problems in our world.
