Should it not be allowed to direct advertisement on television toward young children?
First of all the question occures, whether advertisement harms anybody. And as long as it is not offending or anything compareable the answer to that question is no. Because in the end, advertising is also just a way of saying what is on your mind out loud. So if it was not allowed, that would offend our freedom of speech.
Of course it is hard for a child to see the advertisement for all the great new toys, which their parents can not afford, on television, but would it change a lot if advertisement was not there?
Because in the end the children advertise toward eachother anyway. 
If for example one child has a great new toy. which it loves, it will show it to his or her friends and they would probably want to own it too. That is also nothing else than advertising.
But of course advertising in between children works differently that on television. It is more innocent and if there would be less advertising those children might be able to think free with less influence on their minds.
Summing up, it might be good for children nowadays to have a less influenced mind, but to forbid advertising toward children, would take away our freedom of speech.
