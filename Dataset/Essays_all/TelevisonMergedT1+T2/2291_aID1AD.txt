I wouldn´t say that advertising toward young children shouldn´t be allowed.
On the one hand it is true that young children aren´t that grown that they are easy to manipulate and advertisings are doing that.Also the  children will mostly say that they want this product and tell their parents to buy it.

These were all negative aspects,but on the other hand you can say that it doesn´t harm anyone, because the children aren´t allowed to buy something, so they are dependent on their parents to buy the products they want. In this case the parents are less dangered to manipulation by advertising than their children and so they should know which product could come quiet in handy and which not. In addition to that, the negative point of that children will tell their parents to buy the stuff, could also have a positive effect. Because of that the parents could know which  kind of toys they want the most e.g they like Lego more than Playmobil.


All in all i would say that it doesn´t harm the children or the parents in a very bad way, but it should be made clear regulation for advert-campaign by not telling lies to take away possibilities of manipulating the children in a bad way.
