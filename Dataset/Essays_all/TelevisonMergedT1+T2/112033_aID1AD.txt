Watching TV can be truely upsetting. Everyone can relate to the moment during a movie or a season of your favourite show when there is a interesting moment and out of no where the advertisement starts. We have gotten used to it but what if the advertisement ist directet to young children? Should such advertisement be banned? 

Advertisers are very free in their doings and controlling every step they are doing would not be benefitial because too much regulation and control is never good. The parents can always say whether or not the child shoud be watching TV and if a child sees a toy he wants the parents are free to decide whether to get them the toy. Today almost everyone has the possibility to just fast forward when there's advertisement or you can just change channels and not watch it. It is always up to the person to decide and a two to five year old will not be watching TV alone anyways

On the other hand children aged two to five should not be exposed to suggestiv advertisement. If even adults can be highly influenced by different advertisments what about brains that are not fully developed yet and with a high possibility do not even understand the construct behind advertisement. It can also lead to a even larger consumption community with children as young as three years old always wanting the newest toys they see in advertisements.

In my opinion it is the parent's task to decide whether they want to expose their children to direct advertisement. Because advertisers are only going to play ads as long as there are people watching it and as long as there is a demand for it.
