We all somehow now a few tricks of the marketing industry. Whether it's special music, which aim's for avoking a certain mood while listening or a very distinc color pallet to convey a certain message. The fact, that the marketing industry and exspecially the advertising industry is using special methods to achive their aim, is undeniable. And we can see how tempting it is to buy a thing when we see it in a Tv advert. So the question is, when it's already hard for grown men and woman to resist these temptations, should it be allowed that tv advertises can be shown, which are directed towards children, in the age from two to five. 
I think it silly to ban these kind of advertises. Most of the time these advertises are about toys or some special kind of food. As we know all things have aprice and kids around that age don't have money or atleast just a small amount of it. So the natural cause would be, that the kids won't be able to go in the mall and buy the stuff they saw on the tv. They would need to ask their parents for money and the parents could desitnguish between blind consumption or the necessety of things. 
Nevertheless it would be way harder for buisnesses and the industry to sell their products, because they can't put the on display anywhere. 
In my point of view kids around these age should not watch Tv at all, well they can watch some kids tv shows, but only in a certain amount. Products for thise age level does not need a special display in the tv because most of the time they are just toys or products the parents would buy for their kids. 
Instead of allowing these adverts, directed towards kids, the toy store or drugstores should step their game. For example they can redecorate they interior so it's more kids friendly. I can remeber how exciting it was for me, as a kid, to go to the toy store. Stores should focus on maintaining this special kind of feelind and anticipation, instead of focusing on tv adverts.
