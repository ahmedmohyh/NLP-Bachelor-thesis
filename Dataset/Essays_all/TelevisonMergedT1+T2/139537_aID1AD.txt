In the last few years television advertising has increased very fast. The advertising is often directet toward young children. But do the young children even understand the advertising or not? Can it cause harm or not?

Children like to watch television. They have their favorite channel and they watch television whenever they can. So the diffrent brands produce advertisments. These advertisements have a lot of colour so the children enjoy watching it. When they see something they like they tell their mother to buy it in order to have something more to play with. The channel makes a lot of money and the brands too. And the children are happy with their new toy.
On the other hand, someone has to pay the toy. And the young children have no relation to money. In the advertisments everything is fine and looks good but in reality the things are often disappointing. They coast a fortune but after a couple of months they break appart. Adults can differentiate between a good advertising and an advertising that wants you to buy cheap stuff. But the children are to young and they think everything is nice and cool and nobody wants to be a looser because he has less toys then the others.

I think that advertising should not be prohibited because even though the chldren want to buy something the parents have the last word. In the end they have to decide whether to buy something or not. In my opinion when adults buy everything their child wants it is their own fault. The adults should be able to say no even thogh the children begin to cry. If the parents are able to do that everyone will be fine.
