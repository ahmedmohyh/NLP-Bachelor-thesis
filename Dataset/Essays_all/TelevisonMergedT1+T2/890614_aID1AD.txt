In this young age it is really important for young children to use their imagination. They actually want to play all day long, and when they do not know anymore what to play, they get nervous. That's the point where they learn to invent own plays, by using their brain. Thinking about that television advertising may not be a good idea. Because when they get to see all the objects they could play with and see how they have to play with them, they loose the imagination of finding own plays and ways to invent new stories out of nothing. That would lead to  a certain nessecarity of the television and the advertising. They would want to have every single object that is shown there. As we know advertising is made out of many psychological theories, so they really know how to affect little children.
Let us think about the good sides. Parents are often very busy and stressed. But little children need their attention most of the time. Thinking of that fact, it is a good idea to get childrens attention by using a television. Now if parents would buy all the little plays their son or daughter may want, they can satisfie them without even using their proper time.
In my opinion little children are way to naiv, to decide what they want and what don't. I think in this age it is really important to let them use just their imagination. Because this is something they can never get back again, when they once lost it by the inventions of adults. So i think television advertising directed toward young cildren should not be allowed.
