Should television advertising directed toward young childer, aged two to five? Or should it be prohibited?

A reason why it is okay that childerns look advertising is, that they live in a world where the televison and the media has a very important part in our lives ( especially if you live in europa or USA)  and you everywhere see televisons. You have to be confronted with the tecnology and learn how the deal with it.
 
An other reason is that childs get influid really easy, the believe everything they see. So if the things that they got showed aren't good or the only want to manipulate and convice the childs of buying these things, it is a really bad infulence.

On one Hand the advertising can help to find out what you like or doesn't like. For example if they see a horse in the televsion it's possible that they start liking horses. Its away to find outwhat you like and what not. 

On the other hand in the advertising are many stereotypes. Like the girls like playing with barbies and boys lke playing with strong soldieres, castels etc..
Its in this moment were the childrens get introduced in the society.It's a bit like they couldn't choose what they like. They see young boys playing with a dragon, so they also want to play with a dragon. The same happens with the girls. But with barbies instead of dragons.

i personally think it okay that advertising is directed toward childerns, but in a controled way. There has to be  always someone who tells the childerns that what they see is not everything in live and that a boy also can play with barbies if he want to. There are very much more reasons and argument in favor and not in favor. But i think advertising should be prohibited if the goal of theclip is to manipulate and convice the childs, because that is really iresponsible. It's a way to abuse of the childs.
