In the following text I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

While many people say that companies have to direct advertising toward children, so the companies can make more money. On the other hand are many parents who are defenitly against this technique of advertising .

Many children are watching more and more TV and so they are perfect for advertisment in the TV. They see a new superhero action figure and please their parents to buy it. That's a good technique by the companies to make money. 
Another aspect could be that the children grow up with these advertising and learn how they have to handle them. 

But on the other hand there's the opinion to not allow companies to direct TV advertising toward young children because they're too young to know how to handle this. Children shouldn't watch their most loved TV series while they also watch many minutes long advertisments in the pauses. That's what many parents think and me too. The young children should go outside and play with their friends on the playground rather than watching TV the whole day.

I personaly think that it shouldn't be allowed to direct TV adverstiment toward young children because of the already mentioned aspects and because it can damage their way of thinking. In advertisments everything/everybody is so happy, colorful and lovely to each other like it's not "real life". It's another world which isn't good for the children because their not old enough to see what's real and what's unreal.
