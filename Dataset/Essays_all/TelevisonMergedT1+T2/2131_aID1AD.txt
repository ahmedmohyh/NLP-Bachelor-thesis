Television advertising has become quite normal to us since we watch it on every chanel but is it the good for our children? Children are easy to influence especially in a young age and the adds are trying to use this influence for their own good: Selling their things.

With advertisings children find out what all there is to get and it might be a help for the parent, knowing what the own childs wish is for Christmas, Eastern or the childs birthday. On the other hand at that age the parents probably know better what is good for their children and most of the things shown on TV aren't. 

A two year old most likely can't really judge if a game or any other advertised thing is clever to buy, so the child will get his/her parents to buy it and maybe in the end it will be laying in the corner of the room ot even the trash can. That would be thrown out money but maybe the child would also learn to see what is behind the great looking add, a good thing or something for the trash.

I agree with the statement that advertisment of this kind shouldn't be allowed because it is not for the good of the child but just for the money filled pockets of the industry. Also I think that parents are the ones who know best what is for their children (especially at the children's age of two to five)and not some stranger doing the advertising.
