In our modern society we often watch television. Especialy kids like watching it, instead of going outside and play with other children. They watch programms directed toward them for more fun in watching it. But because many kids now don't go out, should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?

First of all, we are a digitalized society. Computers, mobile phones and televisions are parts of that society. Young children should be introduced in using those technologies as early as possible, so when they get older they won't have any problems in using it. That's the reason why television advertising directed toward young children is a good idea. Such an advertising makes it funnier for children to learn something about digital thecnologies and often those programms also teach them in counting and social habits as sharing and the importance of friendships.
Second, parents have a short break while their children are watching those programms. 

On the other hand, television advertising directed toward children makes the kids stay at home and watch television. They are sitting in front of the display, often alone, and learn something about friendship, instead of going outside, and actually make friends. Not to talk about the importance of fresh air and moving, they don't have when they act like this.

All in all television advertising directed toward young children has it's importance, because it can teach the children in some stuff and parents have a short break when their children are watching tv. But there shouldn't be to many programms like this. So children also have time to go out and have fun.
