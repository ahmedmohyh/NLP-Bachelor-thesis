An argument for agreeing with the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." is, that advertising can realy affect a aduldt person and children even more. Children who watch TV and always see the advertisement for toys and other stuff they like will probably ask their parents to buy them these. Because of the bunch of advertisement, there are so many toys they want and maybe their parents can`t afford them all because they do not have enough money for it. These children will then probably be sad becaus others maybe got these toys and they didn`t.

An argument against the statement is, that we live in a world, where economics are part of our daily life and one usually works for more money. Companies that produce toys and other stuff for kids achieve this by doing television advertising to sell more of their products. It is the custumers choice wether they buy the product or not. It is also the companies right, to search new customers to earn more money and by doing so, create new working places.

I personally do not think, that one should forbid television advertising directed toward children. One should find a compromise in between both. The advertising shouldn`t be as long as it is nowadys, but it shouln`t be completely forbidden. Still, there are some customers, that find new products in TV advertising and are happy about having seen them to buy for their children. Also the companies that sell these products will be pleased to get new customers who buy their stuff. So with a compromise both parties will probably be happy and get what they want.
