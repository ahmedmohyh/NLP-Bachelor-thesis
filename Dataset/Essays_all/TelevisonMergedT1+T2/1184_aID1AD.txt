The question weather television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not ins't that easy to answer. 
On the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things. On the other hand ads can be an insparation for the kids independet from their parents. They maybe get introduces to some different things which show them the diversity of the world. 
An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it. They are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it. But here we are at the point where the parents take place. They are finally the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not. They have also the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money, the use, treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it so that they have the power/need to change their kids minds. 
All in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers. It can be seen as ,regarding to the moral, false or as, regarding to the industry, good. 
In my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it. The only problem which occures is that if the parents don't theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic.
