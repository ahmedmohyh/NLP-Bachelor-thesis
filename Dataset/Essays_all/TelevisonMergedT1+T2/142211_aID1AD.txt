Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children between two to five usually take after the exemple they see. So as soon as they would watch TV they would quickly get attached to the item they saw. As well it might be quite hard for parents to explain every time that it isn't possible for them to buy it at the moment even if the children saw it on TV. It is also unfair because children like colorful things wich move or when they get older they like to play video games. In the case of girls maybe play with dolls and advertising such things is so easy for a company. It is quite manipulativ because children don't get that they need to resist the urge of playing with the exact same game as they saw. For adults it is easier to know what we really need. But even for older people advertisement still works, wich is estonishing. 
So the idea of advertisement for young children is really intelligent because children won't understand that you need to spend money to buy the subject before you're even able to play with it. For parents it is hard and exhausting to change the childrens thoughts on every advertisement they see plus they can be quite persuassive. 
I think it should be prohibided because adversiment is already huge for our own generation and we react the same as small children but we are still able to control our feelings toward an item we like for children this might be much harder. The effect advertisment has on us is with young children multiplied, I expierenced that when I was younger the same way. If something had my favourite color I wished for it and the idea of having that item lasts mostly quite a while.
