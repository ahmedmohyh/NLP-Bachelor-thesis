Weather advertising toward children should be allowed is a controversial topic. The major argument of critics is that children are inexperianced and cannot interprete and understand the tricks used by advertising agencies. False advertising and imagry is commonly used in TV-ads but are expected by adult viewers. Young viewers on the other hand don't know what to expect. One argument for the use of targeted ads is that in the developed world children, through their parents, make up a huge part of the buying power of countless markets. Children are exposed to so many new things to interprete, what difference does it make if it's an ad. 

Parents of young children would probably argue that they don't want their kids exposed to media that they can't control. Targeted ads would allow marketing departments to tap into living rooms the world over and affect the behavour of children in an uncontrollable fashion. But children are already exposed to so much media that influences them hughmongusly. Some movies and TV-shows made for children are littered with product placemen, corrupting kids minds, impossible for them to interprete. Law makers would argue that parents let their kids watch all kinds of movies and shows, how would TV-ads make a difference. 
Another argument against ads for kids is that even when the ads are not hard to understand for children they still advertise negative things. Many children in the developed world suffer from obesity because they eat to much junk food. They see doritos on tv and just have to have them.

In my opinion, some regulation is definitely needed. Children cannot be exposed to physically damaging envirionments. Why should they be allowed to be harmed mentally. But a strict no-ads-for-children policy would be over the top. The regulation should limit and define what products can be advertised and in which fashion that happens.
