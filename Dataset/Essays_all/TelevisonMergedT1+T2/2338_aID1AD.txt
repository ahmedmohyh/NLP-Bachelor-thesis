I think that young children should not watch television too much and better not at all. They need to go outside to get friends, do some sport or just move while playing with friends. But if they watch television they are easily to convince by television advertising because they realy belive what it tells them. And of course it is not realy moralic to try to convince young children who are too young and naiv to realise that not everything you got told in television is true. This might be a problem for many parents. The kids want to have all these things and they have to buy them. And it is not easy for parents to convince their children that they do not need all these things. But if parents let their kids watch TV in this age they have to deal with it and also it is about to be a good parent to tell your kid that not everything in television is true. So I think it should be about the parents how they rule their kids and not about the law to make television advertising forbidden.
