Television advertising is certainly one of the most effective ways of advertising. But children don't know how to deal with them and they can't really estimate what the advertisement says. In this essay I will try to answer the question if it should be allowed to advertise towards young children.
Many young children wath television and if they watch  television they automaticaly watch television advertisememnts. Television advertisements are often presented like the product is the best thing that exists. If you don't know that tricky way of presentig a product, you think I must have that thing and if you have this attitude once you won't ever see the negative things of it again. You can't really teach a child that advertisements exagerate a lot when they present a product, they won't really believe you if they've once seen the advertisements. Young children also often can persuade their parents very well.
For the company this must be a good way of advertising products, because they can make a lot of money with it. If you watch it from the parents perspective it isn't very nice because you have to tell your kids again and again that they can't have that toy and the child thinks that the parents don't like him anymore.
I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways. If he does nevertheless it should be also a part of the teaching of the child to show him how to deal with advertisements. They should learn that advertisements don't really show the real things and they can't just have anything they want. I think this problem is also  because of our luxury standards. If we wouldn'thave televisions we wouldn't have this problem. All in all I think you can't just forbid it because fr the companies it's a way of making money.
