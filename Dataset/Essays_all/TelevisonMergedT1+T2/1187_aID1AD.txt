In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not. 
The first argument against ads for young children is, that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is, so they will want to have the advertised item. This will be expensive for the parents or the child and the parents are going to fight over it.
An argument for advertising directed towards young children is, that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas. 
But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.
But also an argument for these ads is, that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment. They will quicker learn new things.
The next argument against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the not-knowing of the children to make more money.
But the opposite of that argument is also an argument fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who then gain money. Gaining more money because of these ads is good for the companies and following from that also good for the economy of the country in which these ads are allowed in.
Another argument for these ads is, that if the children watch TV they are occupied because with different ads the TV program is different from day to day. So the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes.
The last argument against ads directed toward young children is  
In my opinion the advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money. I think it is wrong.
