I agree wih the statement.
Children at such a young age are very impressionable.
Everything they see will have a lasting impact on them and determine what kind of person they will become when they grow up.
So it is the special responsibility of every human to give a child useful and age apropriate information that will help its development.
It must be decided carefully what kind of material we want our children to look at and what will be advantageous to reaching important developmental milestones.
Giving this responsibility into the hands of corporations whose primary goal it is to make the most profit is very irresponsible.
Corporations dont care about the development of children.
For them a child is nothing more than a potential customer.
So how can we trust a Corporation to make content that is helpfull and not harmfull to the childs development?
An advertisement would not give the child new insights and information about the world but would force an idea made by a corporation onto them and could potentially distort the worldview of an impressionable child to.
