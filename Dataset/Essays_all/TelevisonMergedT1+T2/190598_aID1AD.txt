Many people have a TV at home and watch TV nearly every day. But is watching TV good? Experts doubt this and say, that especially television advertising towards young children in the age of two to five years old should be prohibited. 
Young children are influenced by what they see, when they are young, and act like that. It's not good  that those children watch TV that early. If those advertsments show some  bad habits, those children might learn those and do them later in the life. For example if violent videogames would be shown to small children, those children might have then, after some time, an agressive character. Or if for example unhealthy food and sweets, like cookies and candys, were shown to those children, they might be influenced by that and start eating unhealthy food way too early. 
But on the other hand, those chidren might find something nice on the TV and start doing it. For example a hobby like sports or something like that. If  good advertising is shown on TV, it won't be bad. It isn't, that there is only bad stuff on TV. There are many good things aswell. Children who watch TV will learn good new stuff and do it, so prohibiting the advertising is a bad idea.
In my opinion, it depends on the advertising. If there are nice and good things shown it is okay, but if there are bad things shown, for example violance or smoking, it's not good. Young children learn, what they see. The parents should be carefull of what they permit their children to see and what not to. If the advertising would be prohibited, many people would be mad and would be against it. Especially the television programmes, since they earn a lot of money through advertising. In my opinion prohibiting advertising on TV is a too immense step and makes no sense. I would rather just overwatch the advertising better and try not to show stuff, those children shouldn't see.
