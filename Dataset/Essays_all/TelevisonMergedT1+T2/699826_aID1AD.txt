Advertisments aimed towards children. Unmoralic or okay?

Some advertisments are particularly aimed towards children, this will influence them without them or the parents even noticing. Is this a problem or does it have  too little of an impact to care about it ?

If you look at the point of view of the parents, they will always buy the stuff their kid wants in terms of food or diapers or whatever. So they might pay more for something they could buy cheaper without any loss of quality.This may in some cases lead to the parents having financial issues and they do this only to make their child happy because they've been influenced by these advertisments.

When you look at the companies' point of view then you can recognise that this will make them earn more money which probably every company on earth wants to achieve. So of course if they are allowed to use these kinds of advertisments they for sure will use them as it has only positive effects for their company. Just think of it as if you were the guy in the company who is in charge of the advertising department. If you are honest with yourself you know that you would use this technique too to earn more money.

Finally, in the society's point of view, some will say that this isn't a big problem at all and can be ignored, some will say that it is unmoralic and that the companies definitely shouldn't do it and there will be people that don't care at all. So in the end it is difficult to get to one solution to this problem and say whether it is okay to use television advertising to have an impact on children, so that some particular companies can make more profit. 

Personally, I disagree with this statement, because I don't think that little children will be influenced in such a crucial way that this would lead to any bigger problems.Even though i'd also say that it is not right to make money by using innocent children.
