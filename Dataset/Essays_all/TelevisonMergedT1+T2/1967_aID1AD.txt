          Nearly ervery social group watvhes television but one loves it more than any other: Young children from the age two to five. This is why brands started to develop advertisments specificcly for these kids. In the following it's gonig to be discussed wether or not these advertisments should be allowed or not.

An argument for the advertisments is that the products are for children in that age only and seen by an adult they don't make any sense. For example if a parent sees a toy advertisment he doesn't think my son or daughter would love to play with this but that the advertisment is too loud or the product has too bright colours. Only when a member of the target group watches television and sees the advertisment the need for the product can really develop and the kid can ask and get on the nerves of hi/her parents in order to make them buy it .

You can tell a kid in the age between two and five nearly anything and they will believe it. That's is why these commercials are really dangerous. Children in this age are so influenteable that when for exapmle a little boy heres "This fire truck is the must have toy for a boy everything else is boring and he can't be a real manly firefighter!" He will live the next few years with the thought that he never really experienced real joy while playing and he never can be a grown man just because his parents wouldn't buy or just didn't have the money to buy this one toy.

In conclusion I can personally say that these advertisments for young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed because children in this age can't understand the reason behind them and are way too much influented by them.
