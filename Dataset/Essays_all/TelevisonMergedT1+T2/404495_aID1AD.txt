Especially very young children in the age of two or three years may don't understand what they see in TV in this is probably dangerous because it might be the case that these children missunderstand the advertising. So they might do dangerous or silly things they saw in TV. As young as you are as a little child, you aren't able to get the right meaning of irony or jokes in the TV.

Otherwise there are a lot of funny and entertaining advertisements in the TV to make the kids laughing and show them funny games to play or toys which promise a lot of fun for young children. These advertisements with a clear message without a potential to be missunderstood should be allowed because they're simply entertaining for the young kids.

I think it isn't the right way to forbid television advertising directed to young children by making laws. But in my opinion it is usefull and necessary to make laws about the topics which are allowed to be directed to young children and which not. Topics, which aren't dangerous or likely to be missunderstood by young children should be allowed, because they are entertaining and I see now reason to forbid them. But topics in a advertisement with a potential to be missunderstood should be forbidden. But I think, even if would may be important to make laws in the future, it isn't likely to became reality. In this time, the medias are allowed to say and produce what they want and they haven't many limits.
