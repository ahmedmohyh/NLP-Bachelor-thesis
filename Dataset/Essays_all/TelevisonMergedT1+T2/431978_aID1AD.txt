Enterprises do absolutly everything to sell more products. One way to do it, is by showing ads on TV. There are advertisments on adult channels but there are also ads on channels for young childrens. Should this be allowed? Is it okay to show television advertising directed toward young kids between the age of two and five?
I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show tv ads to young children. We all know how childrens behave when they really, really wan't something. The childrens don't understand how complex the world is and which evil tactics the enterprises use trying to influence them. 
The kid only wants to enjoy the shows he or she is watching and they don't understand that the ads between two episodes wants to make them buy something. They start to cry because they see this toy that they really want. And they cry for a long time. What should the father or the mother do? Of course they go to the shop and buy this toy. It's such a simple tactic yet quite efficient.
Mainly because the kid isn't aware of his behaivour, I think it shouldn't be allowed to show ads on television who are directed to young childrens between the age of two and five.
