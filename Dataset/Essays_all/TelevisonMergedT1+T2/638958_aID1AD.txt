Nowadays, young childrens are watching more Tv than childrens who were born ten or more years before. The fascinating technologie is really interesting for young childerns about this age. In this age the chilrderns are learning a lot and they take everything what they hear and see and with that informations they learn and grow up. So it is really important that they learn from real sources like the parents, not from the TV. There are a lot of advertising in the TV, that tell nothing important or sometimes they show up a wrong reality. The parents can't conrol what the childrens are watching and thats a big problem. It isn't good for them to just consum TV. It is better if they go outside and play games, so they can explore for them self the real world. I think in nowadays time it is important that you don't just sit in your room and watch TV. You have to get outside and see the real world. It is more common to just watch TV the hole intheier day. Exspecially for young childresn aged two to five. I understand if they are fascinated of the TV, but as parents you heve to defend your childrens from bad influence. And there are a lot of bad TV advertising. So I am fully against Television advertising toward young childrens, because there are bad influences in the TV, whitch can understand wrongly. And in this age they learn everything, what they been told, so they take it how it is and i think they can't decide if this in the TV is reality.
