On every televison channel there is an advertising break at least 5 times a day. Kids nowadays could easily get manipulated or influenced by these advertisings. Now should the advertising be banned? The first problem is, that the televison doesen't knows if the father or the mother of the kid are watching tv or if the kid is watching alone. How does the tv knows when he should ban the advertisement and when not? Because a whole advertising banning on every channel wouldn't work. The channels earn really much money with the advertisement and they wouldn't give up these earnings because of the bad influence for the childrens. But is there really a bad influence for the two to five year old childrens? Children in this age want to learn as much as they can. And a two year old could learn really much of the language of the country by watching all the advertisings. For example my last english teacher learned english by watching tv in england and now she speaks perfectly english. And this could happen with every child who went to another country really early in his live.
A bad thing is, that children in these years don't think comletely logic and their brain isn't fully complete. So they could believe in things which aren't real for example people flying around in the city like in the SRF advertising. I heard of a boy who always wanted to fly like superman because he had seen the superman movie and one day he dressed like him, jumped out of the window and died. In the worst case something like that could happen. 
My opinion is that they should continue with the advertising for every person because a child can learn from it, but the parents should always look at the child a little bit. And also thechild shouldn't grow up by watching tv because too much tv isn't healthy. For example I could watch until i was eleven or twelve one movie a week and after the movie a little bit tv.
