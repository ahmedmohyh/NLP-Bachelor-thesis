Television advertising directed toward young children influences them in their young years. If they see things in television they think:"Oh, that's cool!". 
And than they also want this super cool new toy from the ad. The children think they need these things to have fun with their friends and to be popular.
Because advertising want to show them that they absolutely need these things. 
Television advertising can also give them inspiration that they can build their own opinion of toys and other things.
But children shouldn't be influenced by television advertising. They should have their own opinion and they shall decide at their own what they like.
I think tv advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because the children don't have the possibility to be individual when they are influenced like this. It's important to show the children to be an individual person.
