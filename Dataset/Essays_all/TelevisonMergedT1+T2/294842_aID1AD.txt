Who doesn't know this? One is watching a fascinating, very exciting movie and suddenly in the most ineresting moment the film is stopped and an anoying classified ad pops up. This bothers each time every adult, because this ad tries to catch the attention, but actually only annoying them in that moment. Why should advertisement also be directed towards children?

On the one hand it is a disgrace to try to manipulate the children's behaviour, let alone children aged two to five! By directing an ad towards children, their behaviour is played with and one uses their naive mindset to sell products. Advertising companies aim to grab the child's attention so that their parents are ordered to buy this 'fascinating gadget'. Besides manipulating human beings in such a young age, it is also not allowed in law to tear them into the economic market because they are clearly under-aged.

On the other hand, directing classified ads towards young children can be a great marketing strategy for advertising companies. Children will then be egor to have this specific product and the parents will be forced to buy it. What is also to mention is that this includes children already in the manipulation of the modern new market nowadays. Children will then learn in a much younger age to co-operate with manipulation of the human brain.

In my opinion, advertisement towards children aged two to five shouldn't be allowed because it is morally not just to try to use the children's naive behaviour to sell as much products as possible. Children in such a age shouldn't be set the objective for the companies marketing strategy. Manipulation of children should strictly be prohibited.
