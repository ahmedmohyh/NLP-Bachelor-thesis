Yes, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden. Because the children betweent two and five are too young and advertising has a bad effect on them. I definitely agree with this statement. 
First of all I have to say that children in this age are influenced so easily. They believe every thing somebody tells them. That is the main problem in this topic. When children see something in the television advertising they believe it if it is true or not. That could have a negative effect because children think that this is the truth and they want everything they shown on TV. When I was young, my parents only allowed me to look films because they did not like TV very much. They said that the advertising is boring and I should not watch it. I think they said this because they thought that it could have a negative effect on me. 
An other point is that children can not make a difference between advertising and a serie or film. For them TV is TV and they do not even now what advertising is. So how can they understand the use of advertising. They only see it and think that this is the real life and that they want the same thing like the person in the scene. 
I think there are many adverts which want to direct to young children because they think that this children are easily influenced. It is easier to reach children than their parents or other adults. So they try to reach the adults with using their children. Many parents make everything for their child and like this it is easy to influence the parents with the young children.
