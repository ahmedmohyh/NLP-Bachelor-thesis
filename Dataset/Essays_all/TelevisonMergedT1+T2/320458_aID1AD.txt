In the following text I will write about the affect of television advertising toward young children at the ages between two and five and if adds for young children should be forbidden.
Advertices for children aren't good, because they can manipulate the children very easy. They show exactly what every child wants to see and they also show them an irrealistic world. The children can't understand it, that the world which they see isn't real and also that it wouldn't be that way if they get what the add want them to buy. Many years ago for exemple there was an advertising for a toy for girls ans it was connectet with Arielle. In the add you could see two girls who were swimming in a sea and they have seen many colourful fish. When I was younger I thougt I would also see this fish if I would have this toy and I asked my parants to buy it, but they said no and told me that even if I would have it I wouldn't see this fish. Then I didn't want it anymore.
But the children or their parants dont have to buy these things which are shown in the televison. The add is just there that people know that the product is there, but it doesn't say you have to buy it. It's your own decision. 
In my opinion television advertising for young children shouldn't be allowed because I think it isn't very good for children if they always see things on television which they don't have. They can become very sad because they think that everybody gets this thing and they are the only children who don't have it. I also believe that it can be very stressful for parents, especially parents with not that much money, when their child always want something which it has seen on television and the parents don't want to buy or can't afford it.
