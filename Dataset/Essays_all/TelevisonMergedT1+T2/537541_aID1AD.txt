Advertising is very controvertial topic for some people, espetially directly towards young children. In this essey I am going to write my thoughts about it and come to my own conclusion.

First what is advertising all about? Addvertisements are shown in the televivion to promote an article a company wants to sell. Companies tell you how good their product is but you never know if that's just a hoax or real because companies want to sell their goods and make profit to keep going. In my age - I'm 16 years old - I know that companies want you to sell their product so they pay to show it on television. But here is where many people start to get sceptical about it when young children are involved, children mostly  aged two to five. A fact about children is that they don't know as much as we do about the "world" and can be very naiv. Which means if there's someone in the add telling how good something is in particular products that parents don't want their parents to have due to their oppinion about the product knowing what actually is behind it. However children can't realize that and believe what they're told on television so they want to get the product and start crying to get their toy or whatever it might be. As well they will start to become a picture of the world that might be unreal just because they are told on television

But if we are ralistic then I think that it is pretty exsaturated that people want thet direct advertising to children is forbidden. if parents don't want their children to see those adds, don't even let them watch television and how do those people want to achieve to not let children watch televison. it's hard to only let adults see the adds, so my oppi nion is clearly that I think it's unrealistic to not let children watch them.
