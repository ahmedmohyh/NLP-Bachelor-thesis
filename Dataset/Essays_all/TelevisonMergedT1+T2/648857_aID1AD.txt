Everybody knows the situation: You're watching a movie but after twenty minutes some advertise interrups. Television adevertising is on every channel. Also the kids get in touch with the advertising. Should the television advertising become forbiden for young children?

On the plus side of the television advertising can kids learn how many products excist. They see that teddybears excist in many different forms and colours. If they wouldn't see the promotion, they would think that the teddybears of themselves are the only one in the world.
But if the children see all those playtools they want to buy quite everything. In the storage they are crying because of the "mean" mum who don't want to buy something.
An advantage is that the kids have to learn beause of the advertising what are important and what are usless informations. They learn very fast that they can't guess everything. Like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself. 
Enemies of the promotions says: "The advertise has to much influence to the kids". A child doesn't see just television advertising which is made for his age. It is very often confrontated with sloganes with bad influences. For example: If they see some promotion with pills to lose weight, they are asking the parents why some people take these pills. Like that they are confrontated with this beauty-force too early. 

In my opinion the kids souldn't see every advertise. But I think that's quite difficult to get trough. But if it would be possible in a way I would say it shouldn't be allowed. To sum up the television advertising has both; advantages and disadvantages. But I thnik it don't have to be so much promotion. Kids don't have to see everything in there young life.
