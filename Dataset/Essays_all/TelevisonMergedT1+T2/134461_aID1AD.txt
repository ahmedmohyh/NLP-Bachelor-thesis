How often have I seen a parent arguing with his or her child at the supermarket. 
"No, Lily, we will not get these chocolate cereals. Put them back, now!" 
"But muuuum, pleaaase!", ect. 
I can imagine how annoying these shopping trips with kids like that have to be for parents. And who's to blame? The advertisings on tv. Just recently I found myself discussing with my friends about ads in general and also ads concidering kids. It's brainwashing, is what one of my friends said. And I think that is, to some extend, quite true. Children are watching tv at a very young age these days and no doubt that they find tons of ads there. I get the feeling that it's getting crazier and crazier too! All the toys are getting bigger, better, more exciting and also more expensive. And when grandma ask Lily what she'd like for her birthday he will answer with something she discovered whilst watching tv.
On the other hand I think, that one could forbid all the ads if one wanted to be fair, or non at all. Because companies just want to make profits, don't they? They want to sell their products. So they have their ads streamed on tv. It's just how it works.
So in my opinion it's ok that television advertising directed to children is allowed.
