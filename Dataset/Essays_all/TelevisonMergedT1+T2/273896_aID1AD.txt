Television advertising is a good method to convince customers about certain products to buy them. Children do also watch television and there are advertisments directed towards them.

In my opinion, advertisements like that should be allowed, because advertisments are usually positive and do not scare children. The only problem would be if the advertisment scares the children. If it doesn't, I don't see any negative point about the advertisments. I have to admit that it is quite difficult to point out something positive, but especially in their younger years humans want to play something and with advertiments children might be able to discover something new (e.g. Playmobil, Lego). Furthermore, with new technologies like Swisscom TV it is possible to skip advertisments, so children usually won't watch advertisments. By the way, I would never ever make an advertisment for children aged two to five, because these children are normally not able to convince their parents to buy a product. I think, children who are so young are the wrong target group.

To sum it up, advertisments for young children should be allowed if they aren't scary, because that might have a negative effect on them. But otherwise I think it is absolutely fine to make advertisment for children aged two to five, because there is no other negative point in my opinion. Nevertheless, as mentioned, I would never make television advertising for this target group, because usually these children aren't able to convince their parents about a product.
