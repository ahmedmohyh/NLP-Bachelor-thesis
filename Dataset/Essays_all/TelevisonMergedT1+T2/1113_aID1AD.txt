I agree with the following statement, that television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed. In my oppininon television in gerneral is not good for kids betwen the age from two to five. Watching television in that young age could not be good for them. They can do better things in that age like playing games outside. On the other hand you can say that they have to decide for themeselve. but arent they too young for that? I havent watched TV in that young age and i think that it is not an disadvantage for me. I see more advanteges by not watching television. My parents took that decision for me and they knew what was good for me at that time. the most things you cann see on Tv at are things you can discover for your self. You could collect your own experiances. But you can not see that in general. If you take other familiys you would find other oppinions. Perherps some familys would think it´s good. They could argue with the creativly of the kids. TV could make theme more creatively. So they could have an bigger horizion. 
All in all it could have two sides of view. In my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising directed toward young children.
