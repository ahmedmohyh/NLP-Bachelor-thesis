If you wachted TV or go in the internet, you will usually find advertising really fast. Our modern technology industries get much money with advertising. So they bring advertising for every age out, especially for young children. But should this be allowed? Fact is that young children always want something, which is presented for them and don't even think about for example the quality or about the question: Did they really need it? For the insdusty is this a possitive fact. But for the children it isn't. Especially in the young age childs must learn that they can't have every thing they wanted. And advertising directed toward young children don't really help in that learning process. Another argument is that the children, if they get most of the toys or something like this, which is presented in the advertising, they will play with this and forgot to go outside, meeting friends or do hobbies. And this age is really important for the living-process. In this age children should learn to communicate with other children and learn to work or play as a team. All of that is very important ´for surviving in the modern society. So finally I think, that avertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, becaurse of the missed learning process in this age, if they don't go outside and don't learn how they should communicate with other people.
