Television advertising towards young children leads to pressure on the children`s parents because it gives children incentives to want a specific product which is maybe not financial possible to buy for the parents. On the other hand advertising can be pared with moral aspects to teach and to create a better understanding and look for the world even though the targeted group is very young, growing up with commercials can influence a child positively. It is often seen as unmoral to target such a young group because they don`t have an own opinion yet and they are not able to distinguish information correctly. Therefore you could change the developement of a child with advertising because the child does not know that it is just for commercial reasons. Although there are risks the toy industry is booming and creates a lot of jobs and strengthens the economic situation, especially in countrys like china where the production is less expensive. In my opinion commercials targeted at young children should be forbidden, when their goal is to manipulate the targeted group. It should be allowed to advertise in the toy business but not to set the goal to manipulate the children and create a need. For me, there should be more controling and testing on effects on children. This would help to rate and show the companys what risks there are and create an more sensitive understanding.
