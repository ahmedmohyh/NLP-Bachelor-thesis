In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices. In the following text I will write about the aspects, which speak for or against the advertisment, which is directed to young children.

The biggest argument against the advertisment is that, children are very easy to influece, because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write. Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.
On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products. But this aspect is just valuable, if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts. Maby the companies could make an advertisment, which gives the child useful information. The information could be about important topics in our contemporary society for example about the responsable thing eith the nature.

In conlusion I would say that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed, if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the aspect of influece a learning.
