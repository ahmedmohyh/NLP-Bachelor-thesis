I partly agree with this statement. First of all I think it is useless because none of the children is interested in advertising it is just annoying for them. Another reason why this is useless is that the person who buys the product are their parents or other familiy members. The only way the advertising is affecting the children is when the children like the colours or animals in the advertising spot and then they long for it. This could lead to a quite embarassing moment for the parents when they are at the supermarket and their child starts complaining or even  screaming until they get what they want. In the other way the advertising could affect the children in a positiv way. For example when the advertising shows a monkey eating a banana the children tend to eat more fruits or when they see how other children are having fun playing outside the childer might tend to go outside more often, which personally I think is really important nowadays. But I don't think that the producer of television advertising is interessted in how they can affect a children's health life. So generally it's maybe a bit hard to not allow those television advertising I just think they are useless.
