Personally I agree with this statement, because a lot of young children use a huge amount of electronical devices in young age. So they are not as communicative as the ones who grew up without any television or with not a huge usage of television. Furthermore it is not helpful for the young generation, because they only get a knowlegde about the digital world and not about the "real" world. So this could be a problem. In addition to that a lot of families use these electronical devices, because they want a break from their children and so this could be a useful gadget, but i doesn't become to habit. Otherwise if you travel in another country and spend their your vacation  and you use the restaurants in the hotel, there you can see a lot of families with young children who sit infront of a television. In this case it is not a common TV, but through the digital century, you can use other electronical devices like mobile phones, tablets or comnputer. These devices allow you to stream films or series, so these devices are the modern TV's. You easy can take them with you. Another aspect is that you also can watch films and series in the common Tv channel, but more and more people use stream websites like amazon prime, netflix, maxdome, sky on demand to watch their favourit films and series. Through this kind of development, which we can/ have during the last years, we have to do something against this trend. The children need a "real" childhood which is not based on electronical devices, they need a childhood which is based on "normal" things like meeting friends or to spend the whole day outside. We have to find a conclusion in this case, because I think the TV have a huge influence on the young children. Otherwise they are not able to seperat these things and what they see in the TV or what kind of things they see, are real.
