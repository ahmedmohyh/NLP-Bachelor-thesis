Televsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Nowadays televison advertising gets more and more in our daily life and it makes a great majorty of the hole advertising. But scientists are unsure about these sorts of advertising because it is communally knwon that childern can be easely affected and our daily childs watch more televsion then ever. So there is the question if telvesion advertising should be allowed. In my essay I will discuss exactly this statement.

For beginnig I think it is important to remark that childern will be our future, so we should protect them as far as we can. We should not only guard them when they are crossing a street, we should also try to protect them in the virtual world. And this world will become more important in future then it is even now. Bad influences to our childern like inmoraly advertising could have bad affectsto their character and so to their and our future too.  
In my opinion the advertising branche should be concentrated on the adultes because when an adult gets influcend be advertsising, which is actually the case, then a child who belives mostly everthing which is told to him, has no chance of an childhood anymore. 

To conculse I think it is important to remark onemore that our childern are our future and so we should protect them .
