In this times where we have many new electronic devises it is important to learn how to use them in a way that it does not damage our society. For exemple television advertising must not be allowed toward young children. In the folowing I will  explane why this is my point of vew.

I will start by looking at the positive thing of television advertising toward young children. First of all there are many children who want to see advertising at the television because they want to know which are the new toys they can whish theirselves for exemple for christmas. An other point to look at is that many television chanels only exist because they do advertising. Many marks pay a lot of many to appear for only few seconds in the television. If that would not bethe case many channels would not exist and I do not think that the children would be happy about that.

There are of corse also same negative points of televison advertising. Children in such young ages can be manipulatet very easily and many companies do that to make money. Many children can not decide what they need and what things they do not need and so they want to have everything. This is a bad thing because when they become older they can have same serious problems. An other key thing to think at is  that in these times the amount of advertising in television is really high and so it hapens that a there is more advertising than for example cartoons.

To come to a conclution I think that advertising toward young children should be banned because they are so young and they can be really easy influencend.
