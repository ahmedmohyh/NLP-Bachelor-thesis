Today most of the families own a television. Lot of people watch TV to relax after a long day of working. But just as adults, young children like watching TV too. Often there is lot of advertisements during the breaks of a movie or a serie. The advertisement producer use this to show children nice advertisings of various products. Therefore, should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. The first reason is that it doesn't make a difference if there aren't any television advertising directed toward young children anymore. The world of today is full of advertising pictures (plakats) and some websites have lot of advertisings.
In addition, in my opinion young children are often bored about advertisings. I know from my childhood that I was very bored about television advertising, even it was about chocolate or barbie dolls (which I really liked). So children don't even look precisely at the advertisement.
Also, young children learn how to react to advertisements. Advertisements are not just unuseful, they show us new things and learn us to be critic with everything in the world.

In conclusion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, beacause it doesn't really make a difference if it were not be allowed, in the world there are lot of advertisings and they aren't really interested in it.
But in fact it isn't that easy for a child to learn to be critic with the world, especially when nobody told him that he should be critic with it. So maybe, a bit more interesting question is how to learn children to be critic with advertisings.Maybe the school could teach i
