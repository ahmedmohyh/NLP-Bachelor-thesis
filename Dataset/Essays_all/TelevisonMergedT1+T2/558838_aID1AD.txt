One reason for that television advertising should not be allowed is, that the children learn diffrent words. When the young children watch TV, they make something what support the brain and they learn diffrent things about the world and what's  gat the moment.
But in contract, when the young children watch TV, they learn words like diffrent cars, Nivea or others... This words don't support the childrens communication, because in one way they learn words, which aren't necessary in this age and in an other way they learn an other language.  For example the swiss childrens are watching TV in an other language and so they don't learn swissgerman. And so, the children speak a language that isn't only one language, but a mix of maybe two ore tree. In case of this they say some words german and some words swiss german. In an other view, this young children should go outside in spite of watching television, because in the nature they learn more than in front of TV. A next point is that children from two to five don't understand what the peopel in de advertise say. Maybe the children learn words and things, which isn't useful or maybe things and words, that are not allowed in our "world". An next thing is that this children could make something with other childrens, witch has the same age like them and so also the same niveau. This would more support the growth of their life in case of watching movies and advertises. I think that television advertising should be allowed, because this young humans don't unterstand all this things and I think that in this time, in there they watch Tv, they could make better things, like going outside or make somethings whit other childrens.
