Children are easy to be influenced. They're obviously young and you can tell them anything you want and they'll believe you. When they're directed with television advertising of the latest games or whatever parents could get in trouble because their children always want to have the latest games. At this point the problem is that there are new games every week. Whenever you switch on a kids channel you'll see lots of advertising for new stuff every kid needs (they don't actually need it but the advertising makes them and even you feel like they need it...).

Children of this generation need the advertisement to be updated. What kind of chilld would you be if you hadn't heard anything about the latest toys or games? You have to now what's going on to be a part of. In todays' generation everyone wants to be a part of.  Children nowadays grow up with a television and are used to the advertising. Back when their parents were kids they mostly didn't have a television so maybe it's something new for them.

I think television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. When I was a kid the advertising influenced me much. I was allowed to watch kids channels in the evening after school. In kindergarten I wasn't that interested in watching television.
The advertising took place between the series I watched and sometimes was even longer than the clip itself. Sometimes the advertisement made me feel bad because I felt like an outsider. I've never had the latest toys. It made me think about what I'd be and what my friends would think about me if I hadn't got those latest toys.
