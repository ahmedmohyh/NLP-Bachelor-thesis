In this essay i am going to talk about my personal opinion on this statement. 

One of the reasons why young children shouldn't be allowed to watch TV is of course because they get distracted very easily. So if you let them watch TV whenever they want they will get to comfortable with it. Young children can get faszinated for anything and if they like something they want to watch it again and again.
But of course there is not only bad stuff on Tv! Children from age two to five are learing very fast and i think if they are able to learn with pictures and videos their learning will improve.

On one side i think watching Tv is a lot of fun and there is no reason to not allow young children watching TV.
On the other side i think especially for young children it is important that they're learning by doing. They should play with other children and explore their surrounding.
One of the most important factor in realtion with TV is that watching TV should be kind of a treat if the children ,for example, played outside the whole day. We are living in a time where young chlildren grow up with the internet and all the electronic toys. So to not allow watching TV at all wouldn't make any sense because they're going to watch TV anyway. For me personal it is very important to have a healthy balance between having fun while you're watching TV and watching TV because you're just bored. 
As I already mentioned children from age two to five are learing very easily and as a parent you lay their foundation for their future. You should make sure that they're watching the right things on the internet and on TV.

In conclusion I think that televison advertising directed toward young children isn't in general a bad thing but if you as a parent aren't under control it can turn into a very bad thing and can influence the future of your child.
