When I was a child we didn't have a television at home. So I was never confronted with television advertising. And I don't have the feeling that this was such a bad thing. My parents bought my toys, and I don't think I would have done the same good selection. We didn't have so many things at home,so there as also more time to play with my brothers, at home or in the nature. 

Young children are not experienced enough to see that they can't have anything. If they see advertising, they just think: "I need this". And they cry: "Momma, I want this!" For parents it's hard to stand the wishes of their children and so they end up buying a lot of things that are just in the wardrobe or "made in China"-plastic that is broken after a few weeks. So the children will look for new toys and find them - of course - in television advertisement.

In the society that we have, capitalism reigns. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It brought us far and I wan't like to miss our good economy. Free marketing is important for that, and wouldn't work without advertising. So it's hard to forbid some kind of advertisement, because than we are going in the direction of an economic system that is controlled by the state.

So don't allow is maybe not the best way to protect the younger generation. I think it's more important that parents teach their children how to deal with advertising. Learn them to say "No" and show them that not every toy is necessary to have a great childhood. It's enough to play outside in the nature with some friends or, for exemple, brothers. I am the living example for this.
