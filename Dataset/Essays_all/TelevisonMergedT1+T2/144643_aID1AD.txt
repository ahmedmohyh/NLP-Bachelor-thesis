Most children watch TV daily. The amounts of advertising, may it be toys,clothes,food and what not, that flashes by is unbelivable. Which leads to the question wether television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed.
The young children get introduced to greed as soon as they start watching television. The constant flow of products that you "must buy and cannot live without" does have a serious impact on young children, they will soon start beliving that in order to be happy they need a certain new toy. Its a phenomenon that even adults struggle with: the need to fill up certain gaps in their life with materialisitc purchases. This is not something that should be introduced at such an early age, since it results in a certain self-destructive behaviour. 

They are more likely to make bad decisions.The children are prone to spent their pocket money on these pointless purchases such as a speaking turtle. Children would spend all their pocket money on rdiculous toys if they just see it on TV over and over again, convinced that they need it.

On the contrary though one could argue that the telvision ads may teach children how to deal with money  and teaching them the value of things. making them realize that once 20bucks spent on a speaking turtle means that you may not be able to buy the princess necklace, or that with the same money you could have bought a bunch of candy. teaching them the most basic understandings of economics.

Of course the ads may lead kids to wanting something, but by all means this does not mean they ll get it. the parentsto do have a say in what their kid spend the money on. This means that they will learn how to deal with disappointment and ho to get over it.

In my opinion the telvision advertising does neither ruin the kids, nor help them incredibly. I dont think it has to be forbidden. If parents want to protect their kids from the kapitalist part of our society the may just switch of the TV.
