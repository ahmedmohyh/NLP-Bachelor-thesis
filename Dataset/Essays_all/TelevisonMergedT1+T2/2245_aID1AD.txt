Almost in every Television show are pauses with a lot of advertising so it is part of our daily life. In the following I want to discuss wether Telivision advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.

The first thing one can state is that young children at the age from two to five are much more easy to influence tha older children or also of course adults. So in addition to that the children want the things which are shown in the Telivision advertising. On the other hand one can also say that adults also can be influenced by Telivision advertising. For example at shopping channels. Furthermore older people can also be easily influenced. Like I already stated with the help of shopping channels, where they are animated to buy more things in order to buy it less expensive. Another point is that children can also be influenced with the help of the contentr and the action in special childrenseries. For example the children who wanted to cute his stmoach and to put a television only because it watched teh Teletabbies. Thid is teh case because like I already said children at an age from two to five are much easier to influence then older children for example at the aged of sixteen and also of course as adults.

So all in all I would say that television advertising directed toward young children from the age of two to five should not be allowed because they can be to easily be influenced with this advertising. But television advertising is not the only risk where young children can be influenced. Also the content of childrenseries can influence the children in a negativee way. On the other hand the risk to be influenced is also given for adults. For example through shopping shows.
