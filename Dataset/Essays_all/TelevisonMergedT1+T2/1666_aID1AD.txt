Advertisements in television or in the internet are oftener directed toward young children today.
The question is, should those advertisements be allowed or not and that is the topic i am going to discuss in this essay.
Well, one argument for this kind of advertising is, that people at every age are advertised so why not the younger ones either. Youths are advertised just as elders, so what is the problem with advertisement for even younger ones?
In the age from two to five you are very predictable and easy to influence with certain tricks and the advertising in television uses those tricks to kind of controll the young people who are watching it. When a child sees an advertisment like this, the desire of getting the product is imense, for example for a toy. When kids in this age want something like this it can get very complicated because it is easy to disappoint them. 

So my personal opinion on this controversial topic is that those kind of advertisements should be more or less forbidden. The most simple reason for this is that children in this age are so easy to influence and this can cause serious problems.
