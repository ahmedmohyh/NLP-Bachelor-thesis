In the following I want to explain why television advertising is not good for lillte children.


On the one Hand children in this age are in a really important developement. They look at their parents and copy their behavior. The advertising at the TV is often extremly overdone. But the children think that it is reality. But it isn't. They can't understand what is fiction and what is real. I think children in this age although need no TV for a good developement. Furthermore they need social contacts in kindergardens and the love of their parents. The parents have to give them a way to go. Then they get older they also could look TV. The advertisiung is also not good because the children want their parents to buy more toys. And they could be sad because they realise that they're poorer against the other kids.

On the other hand I can say, that the TV advertising is not important if they look TV ad. or not. They woun't understand anything. They don't know what the advertising want from them. The advertisising is also very good for the economy. They get more money. And the people getting more jobs.


All in all I think that young children shouldn't look more TV than 30 minutes per day. But the advertising is the same bad as the normal TV show. Children should play outside and go into the kindergarten. But advertising shouldn't be forbitten. It is important for our industrie and for our economy because the parents buy more toys for their children.
