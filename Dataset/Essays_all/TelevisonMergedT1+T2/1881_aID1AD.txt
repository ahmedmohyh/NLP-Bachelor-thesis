In my opinion it's impossible to save young children from advertising in general. If television advertising for young children should not be allowed they will see this advertising somewhere else. This days you see advertising everywhere you go. If you go in a supermarket with your children you will see advertising every step you go or if you go to the cinema before the film starts there will be advertising. It's not possible to ignore it because you see it everywhere and you also get influenced by it. And of course your children too. So I agree with the statement that advertising for children should not be allowed but I think it's impossible to do that. On the other hand I think that children have to learn that they can't get everything what they see in the advertising.With adults it works the same way. We see something in the advertising and we want to buy it. We get influenced by it because the advertising is made for catching us. It's the same with children they see advertising which is made for them with for example plays or computer games and of course they want their parents to buy it. But there is the point I mentioned they have to learn to get not influenced by the advertising that much and don't want to get everything they see. The adults had to learn or have to learn the same.
So in general I think advertising is not good for nobody because you get influenced by it, the children and also the adults, but it's impossiple to not allow it because advertising is everywhere you go and especially in the internet and at the television.
