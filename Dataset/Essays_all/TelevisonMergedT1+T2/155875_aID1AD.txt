Nowadays it's normal to have a TV, but should young children be allowed to watch TV?

Firstly, when the young children watch too much TV, they don't have time for other things like playing/going out and moving, learing how to speak for example or just reading a easy book. In the other hand, if they still have enough time to learn etc. then it won't cost too much time.
AFter that, they can also learn while watching TV for example, learn to speak or just learn things for the future life, like something in the history, although they're very young. In the other case, they can imitate the things they watched, for example a fight or something like that. 
Then it is quiet possible, that the children get addicted by the TV. So if they are addicted, they can be agressiv, if someone doesn't let him/her watch the TV.
Finally, The TV is also not good for the eyes. If they watch too much TV, it is possible that the child gets glasses, and this can have a result for the whole future life. 

My opinion is that children should be allowed to watch TV, but just in a right measure. If they watch too much, it should not be allowed. So if they watch sometimes, they can learn something, but if they watch too much they don't have time to do something diffrent, like moving around or learning. And they shouldn't imitate bad things, so the parents should tell them what is good and what is bad.
