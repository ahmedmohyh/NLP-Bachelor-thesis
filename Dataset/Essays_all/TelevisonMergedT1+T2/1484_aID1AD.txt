In a time, when every free space, every gap between streets and houses are full of advertisement, webadresses and qr-codes, we are told to scan to see the latest trends, we have to learn how to "defend" ourselves against the masses of ads: Internet, TV, analogue or digital. PopUp, Cookie, sheet of paper. Those classical TV spots seem so innocent and informing, just like a learning program to get ready for the rest of the ad-world. So should we present television advertising towards our young children or should it be prohibited?
Assuming, that watching tv-ads makes our children learn how to treat the aggresive product recommention, we have to accept that they evidently will be raised in such a capitalistical environment although they should actually focus on developing their own identity and learn how to socialize. Aren't we consumption-focused enough? Of course not according to the industries. 
Sure, we could say that so young children will never remember the adverts they saw when they were at the age of 3 or 4, but anyway, they are humans, who have already developed a consciousness of what happens around them which determines their way of thinking, independent from their memory. 
Additionally, that typical "ad-language" with its unnatural and super expressive sound can be understood by the grown up. Children in that case still seek for conversation to develop their language.
Although the consciousness of reality and virtuality mixes in the head of children when they are confronted with animations on digital devices, a law to prevent the children from being raised by the consumption industries is unnecessairy. In my opinion, TV-adverts can limit and determine the development potential of our children but the impact is not that heavy that parents should not be able to decide on their own on the raising and their childrens' future. It would rather be better to trust in prevention and telling parents about the risks and the consequences.
