It's a daily problem: Your five year old child is sitting in front of the TV watching his or her favorite TV-show and a small comercialbreak appears, but instead of advertising products for you, a working adult who's able to buy whatever you want, it shows coulorful bright plastic toys and a kind voice tells you a story or a joke or why this product is a must-have and seconds later your child demandes you to buy him or her one. Is this right? Is it right to use children to persuade adults for buying them the toys they saw on TV? I'd say clearly no, this ain't right. Children shouldn't be capitalized. In their age they don't even understand the value of money, they don't know what working and paying is. Therefor they don't undrstand what the effort behind a funny toy is. As an adult you should buy your kids a toy if you want to and not because your kid is demanding. They need too understand the worth of things otherwise they won't understand the valuable of work and money afterwords. Commercials especially for toddlers shouldn't be allowed at all, but you can't simply force them to disappear by law, there is and there will be commercial for young children but it's up to you if they will see them. You can decide to show him or her what you think is appropriate for it. Let him or her only see movies without commercial, by buying or borrow them. And if you decide to let them watch regular TV make sure that you won't buy them the thing they want just because it's a must-have for them and not so expensive compared to your paycheck. Teach them the value of things. And finally: Your children shouldn't even be watching TV all day at this age.
