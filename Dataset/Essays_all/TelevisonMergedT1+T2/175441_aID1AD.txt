We are humans who have the best oppertunities to become great. When you are one of the lucky persons who got the change to get born in Europe you have won. In a land where our wealth increased and most of us living a modern lifestyle. So why should we forbid our kids to watch television advertising? 

Well, our kids are getting lazier and are unable to learn important things. That's an alternative fact. Sure it's not their fault, why should it be. It isnt their fault that they are growing up by watching television instead of going outside and discover our enviroment. Our kids are destroing themselves because they dont even build a social life just because they have nothing else to do. They are to focused and they are so fascinated that they forget the real-life. 

However, why we should forbid our kids watching television. I mean they arent able to contact the companies who are advertising and most of the products they are offering aren't even usefull for kids. They dont need a dating side because they dont want to fall in love, they dont need a lawyer because they are not in trouble, they dont need a new car because the aren't able to drive yet. So most of our advertising is made by adults for adults. Additionally it is our fault that they are watching television. Because we are rolemodels for the kids. If we did other things than wasting our time in front of the television, our kids would look up to us. This leads us to a new way of life without the necessary usage of a television.  

In my oppinion it's not that bad that kids watch television advertising. The only thing is that they miss the oppertunity to get in touch with real-life. You wasting so much time by watching television. Sure the kids should grow up by themselves and maybe it isn't that bad to watch television. BUt I can't appreciate that the are missing so much just because they dont know something else than watching television.
