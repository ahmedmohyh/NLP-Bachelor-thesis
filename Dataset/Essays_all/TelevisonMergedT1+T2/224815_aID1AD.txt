All over the world will be discute about if television advertising shouldn't be allowed directed toward young children, in the age of two to five years. This wonder a lot of old people, that something like this can be asked. Because this theme just come to speak in the 21 th century.  Befor there aren't any television and children never see an advertising in the age of two to five. Many parents work a long time and there children are alone at home.  They have no controle about there children if they look television or not.  The parents can't influence the computere advertising, if there child is looking a film. Pherhaps you already know that in each film or serie come all 30 minutes an adverting where somthing will show on there best side, this we can't change. I strongly belive that the children in there young years don't have to see so much advertising, because the economic take this chance to make a lot of money. The children see for example a sweet teddy or an tractor for play and so they will to buy this things.  With television advertising they buy a lot of things they don't need. In my opinion the television advertising should not be allowed, also for childrens who are older than five years old. Than also children in this age don't realise that they wouldn't need this things they see in the advertising.
