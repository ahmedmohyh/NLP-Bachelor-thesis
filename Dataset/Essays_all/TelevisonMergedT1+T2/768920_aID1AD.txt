Children of the ages from two to five are often very naiv and mostly in the visit of their parents. If it's not the case, for example by watching television, the children can't decide by therselfes which of the given statements are necessary or true. This young people haven't the knowledge to form their own opinion concerning the content given in televion adverttising. It could also be possible that the adversiting companies try to influence the children in a certain direction to their own profit.

But on the other hand advertising could be a good way to teach even young people what's right and what's wrong for example concerning the natural environment or also humanity.


But adversiting itself for products like games isn't needed at that age. Most of the time young children wont understand the given message in televion. I think adversiting is mainly focussed on making money for the great buisnesses. The only one's who can say what the childrens require are their parents. They know them best. 
Young children in generel shouldn't spend their time in front of the televion. There is so much more to explore in the world than sitting in front of a screen and waiting for the next show. Parent should go outside, play with their children, teach them what matters in life or visit friends. All of those experiences will teach and influence a young child better than televion.
