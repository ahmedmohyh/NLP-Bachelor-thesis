I think, I agree with the statement, that television advertising should not be allowed by young children. At first I would say that children at the age of two to five are too young to know many things about the world. They live in a world full of many other children and they have no idea what is really going on. So I think they should do other things than beeing in a television advertising. They should go outside, play with friends and have fun. 
Everytime I look TV and I see young children are in a television advertising, I ask myself: If that is you, what would you do? I would say, I would never be in a television advertising when I were two to five years old. I think young children should be free and they have to enjoy life to the fullest. Because when you get older, you will go to school every following day, at the afternoon you have to learn and you have to do your homework. When you get older you have to work harder, you can't play with other children the whole day. And there are many other things that aren't really great when you get older. 
So when you're older and you would like to do other things than going to school or going to work, you can decide if you want to be in a television advertising. At the age of two to five you can't decide if you want to or not. I think at this age the parents decide what things the children are doing. Because of these examples I have written, I say that television advertising directed toward young childred at the age of two to five should not be allowed.
