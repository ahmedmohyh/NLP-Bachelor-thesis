The statemant above leads to controversial oppinions. So there can't be only one "right" oppinion. Is varies from person to person because not everyone looks at this the same. But I personally agree with this statement. I think nowadays advertisings influence us a lot, even though we think they don't. And young children are the ones that can be influenced easily. I think it's really cruel taking advantage of that and making television advertisings to, in a way, "poison" young children and make them believe they need something only because it is said in the television. Because in the end, children don't know what they really need and what is only a waste of money. But of course, not a lot of parents can refuse a wish of their children and so in the end the winner is again the "money industry" which manipulated young children with the help of this advertising in case to reach their own goal. 
It could also be the case that some parents just can't afford expensive new toys for their children. But young children of course don't understand why they didn't get what they wanted and that makes them sad and angry. And if other children get what they wanted and then play all together with it, it could be the the child whose parents couldn't afford a new toy gets left by alone and doesn't feel accepted. And all of this only because someone made them believe they need to have this certain toy for example.
So yes, I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because only the money industry takes advantage of it and the manipulated young children and their parents are the only ones who could suffer from that, even though they're not aware of it.
