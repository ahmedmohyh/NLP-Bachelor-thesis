Young children are exposed to influences by advertising (in the case that they already watch TV). Now of course, people have been discussing about this theme as humanity always likes to make a huge drama about things.

On one side we have of course how easily kids can be influenced to like something by showing them colourful pictures, happy melodies or jingles and by the tone the person who is talking for the advertisement. It even does not depend if it is a product for playing, eating and so on.
On the other side we can also say that it does not matter what the children think about a product, in the end it is still the parents' decision whether they will buy it or whether they will not.
And there are different kinds of parents: the ones who buy their children everything they want and those ones who still think about what would be the best for their children.
In a world of fast food and obesity, the latter is the better.
Enterprises like McDonald's, Burger King and Coca Cola are making more and more comercials, now do not say this does not influence your kid in any way because it clearly does.They do not see what could be the consequences, they do not even hear the tip (which, actually, is not radiated in every country) to eat or live healthily in the Fast Food comercials, that "only health is beautiful" in the perfume and make up advertisements.

My opinion is that in the end it is the parents' choice if they want to buy their kids the newest iPhone or whatever they just saw on TV.
But they should go more for education like reading books to them, listening Music with them and not letting them watch to much television; when I was a kid I was not allowed to watch TV, it was even until the age of about ten years that I had to ask whenever I wanted to turn on the television, so I was not exposed to as much comercials' influence as other kids have been.
