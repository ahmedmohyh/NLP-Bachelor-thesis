In this essay I'm going to explain, why television ads for children between the age of two to five should not be allowed to be directed. 
An argument, which is against my point of view, is the fact, that if children see some toy in the TV, that they want, parents get a thought for a  present for christmas or for their birthday. 
But this argument you can also see from a diferent point of view. Maybe the toy, they really want, which they would cry for, is too expensive for the parents. And maybe the children are very sad about not getting this toy, the parents get very sad about the fact, that they made their children sad because they are too poor to give their children the toys they want to have.
And maybe if the parents are very rich, they buy their children everything they see on television. But the problem with that is, that the children may get used to it and in their adult life they want to also everything they see on TV so they get bills and bills and bills they cannot pay, because they are not so rich as their parents. 
Another argument for not directing television adverts for young children is the fact, that maybe some parents don't let their kids see television, but if the parents see an ad for a big toy, they just buy it without asking their kid if they want it. And after that the kids just play 2 minutes with it and then they put it in corner and never give it look back. 
Watching all arguments, my result is that television adverts should not be directed for children between the age of two to five years old.
