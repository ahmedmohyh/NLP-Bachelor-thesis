Advertising

It is known that children like to watch cartoons or other tv-shows which mach their age. The producers of these tv-programms know that it's helping their company if they show a lot of advertising directed toward young children because they get money from the other companies for showing their products to children. The question is should that be allowed? Doesn't it count as manipulation?

Everyone knows the reaction of a little girl who sees a pretty doll on televison or a young boy who sees a nice electronic car. They run to their parents and ask them if they could buy it for them. Most of the parents aren't ready to do so and that's the point where the disappointment comes in. The children start to cry or get angry and that after every single advertisment. In other words it slowly ruins their character. 
Unfortunatelly an other reaction is jealousy. A child sees another child playing with the one toy it desperatelly wanted to have. The child which is jealous could start to think about stealing the toy what would be even worse. It leads to a bad life with no job, no money or even going to prison. 
On the other side it could make them more interested in working and earning their own money when they get older. Furthermore it makes them more and more independend and it helps them to get through their life on their own. 

In my opinion they shouldn't allow showing advertisments towards young children. The children shouldn't watch televison that much at all because it's better for their health when they play outside with their friends. They shouldn't care about what they have or they don't have. They should enjoy their life. I think it's okay if they get presents but they shouldn't be spoiled with gifts and toys because that would be bad for their character and they wouldn't come so far with this way of thinking.
