Why not? Companies need to sell their products somehow and who should they show their products to if not to the one who will eventually use them? A child who sees a advertisment for a toy does often want to have it. Of course they won't get every single toy the see on TV but on christmas or their birthday they will probably have many know what to wish for.

Also the fact that the child won't have all the shown toys will make it learn that in life you wont be able to have everything you want immediately or at all and they will appreciate the gifts given to them even more.

Depending on what the advertisement is for, it can give the children some inspiration of what to do. The generation of children is growing up with so many technological advices like cellphones, tablets, etc. that they don't know anything else than playing a game on their mothers phone. In advertisement children are often shown playing outdoor with each other which is in my opinion very important for their social development.
