Television advertising should not be allowed toward young children

Let`s begin with the pro arguments: First, the most important argument in my opion is, that these young children react very strong on advertisements, especially on TV. Young children watch TV very often. When they see something on TV, which is interesting for them, they tell their parents that they want to have something. This happens very often and can be stressful to the parents. The second most important argument in my opinion is, that children should watch somothing, which improves their knowledge about the world, e.g. a broadcast about animals or something in this direction. But children watch (mostly) channels for children at their age like Super RTL, nickeloden or KIKA and so on. Advertisements are especially made for these children, this is why they want to have something all the time. Children see these things in another point of view, as the adults do.

Contra-arguments: It is quite normal, that children watch TV. As a result, it is as well quite normal, that there are a lot of advertisements on these channels. You can find advertisements almost everywhere on TV. The people grow up with this fact. Every advertisement has its own target group, there are adults, children, workers, teenagers and so on. Advertisements aren`t as annoying for children as for adults. This is why children don`t care about advertisements. They often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are as well advertisements which support the education of the children.

My personal opinion: I think that advertisements should be banned from children`s channels. Better would be, if advertisements are banned from all channels .  This would be great :. The best argument for the new rule is, that they react differently on advertisements. Advertisements have a very big influence on the life of a child.D
