Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Todays world is overgrown by incessant advertising. Many ads are unfortunately directed at children that barely learned to talk, many people think this should be banned. In the United Kingdom fast food companies are not allowed to air their advertisements during children tv, this was done to lower child obesity rates, but many people argue that this is a step in the wrong direction. This law does not help the children but rather the parents that do not have control over their children, or are not strong enough, to say "no" to their kin. The same group of persons think that children should get used to advertising as soon as possible and learn to ignore, or judge it as this is very important later in their lives. On the other hand side young two to five year-olds are very easy to manipulate and should be safeguarded until they are ready to evaluate advertising. In my opinion are children exposed to adverisements all the time and should therefore be taught to ignore, or evaluate it, at young age, advertising should not be regulated by the sate but rather by the parents.
