Television advertising is a big problem in our society. Well not for the people who earn money with it but for the people who just want to watch a movie on a saturday evening. It`s really anoying advertisment is everywhere and there is even specific one for young children. Many parents are afraid of that and want the industry to stop making them.

I don`t really know why it`s thought that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Because for them it`s only a nice show which shows the newest toys or television shows. And it also could be a chance for parents to see what their children want for example at Christmas or Easter! 

Well I understand that parents could be afraid that their children crav for more and more. But that is the problem of their education and their oppinion of how they want to raise their kids.  
Parents can also be afraid that the television advertising tries to control the toughts of the children and make them believe in things they want them to. But in Europe that isn`t the case maybe in North Korea but not here. 

So finally I think that parents care to much about things that are harmless maybe they`re just afraid because they hadn`t that kind of advertising in their childhood. But in one thing we all agree television advertising is immens boring.
