First I think its not a good idea to set the children before the television whith so much false and ,,dangerous'' advertising. Because the child must have much contact to other children and even to the partens. Thats the first fact beacause I disagree this statement. Further in the television advertising there is so much humbug and that shouldn't see young children. For example from a movie where real persons were killed or something like this. Later the young child have much dreams of it or don't dare to be in a dark room when the child goes to bed. So now I think the television advertising should be more normally than now on much tv channels. When the child once look television then the parents should switch to a childchannel like ,,Super RTL'' or ,,KIKA''. Because there are childfriendly channels which the advertising is more friendly for the child. When it is such a channel I would maybe agree with this statement but its in general not good for such a young child to watch the hole day television. The child must have social contact to other childs or sure to his parents. But a further problem is when the parents also watch lots of television then the children look to his partens and do is like they do it. So in general I surely disagree with this statement because there are so much other actvities for such young children for example drawing or go in the forest. This way the childs could learn something about the nature or something for the future life. Thats more helpful for the life after.
