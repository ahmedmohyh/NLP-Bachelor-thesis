We see advertisements for children on television everytime we watch TV. Playmobile, lego, barbie and so on you name it. They are colourful and always come with a happy tune. But are parents pressured to buy the products appearing in these advertisements? Do children actually need toys to be happy? And should these advertisements be banned?

Advertisements directly addressing children may make them feel like they need the advertised products to be happy. Every parent of course wants his child to be happy so when a child sees something on TV and wants that because the advertisement makes it feel like it needs it the parent may feel forced to buy the product. It could also be that parents just buy their children all the toys they want because of the advertisements but actually do not give them what they would really need which would be love and attention. Because this is what they need most they do not actually need the toys displayed in the advertisments. You could make a toy out of everything. There are however good toys like puzzles or informative games also other games which are just for fun but it should be the parents' and the child's decision alone which toy to buy uninfluenced by the TV. 

In the end I think toys are secondary in a good relationship between parents and child and advertisements may make them appear like they are most improtant for a child to be happy. What really matters is that parents give their child all the attention and love they can give and not just buy him or her material things which they think a good parent would do.
