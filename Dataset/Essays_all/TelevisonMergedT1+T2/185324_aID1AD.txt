Should it be allowed to have ads, which are directed towars young (aged two up to five years old) children?

As you watch TV (Television) u probably have seen many commercials. They used to be directed towards older people, like teenager or adultes. But they are getting directed more and more towards young children. Is this okey? Should there even be ads for this kind of viewers? I'm trying to find answers to those questions.

- With the help of those ads, parents or realtives have it quite easy to find gifts and presents.
Let's say your cousine has birthday in 2 days and you dont know what to get her. In an instances, she sees an ad for a new barbie, which she likes/wants. Without breaking your head and even so not finding something good, you know what to get her.

-Those ads are also helpful for the parents. Because of those ads, parents are up to date with the toys, which are popular. 
Imagine your daughter wants a scooter and you decide that you'll get her one. But which model? You dont want to end up with an old, unpopular one, which she won't like at all. 

- But its quite known that ads show toys etc. differently. Better! 
They often show things in commercials, which arent there in the real toy. For example: In the commercial you'll see a Lego-castle with moving princesses. Sure they are writing down that they cant move, but those young childrens probably won't see that and are impressed with the moving toys. They dicide, that they want it and as they get it, they are disappointed!

- Children don't know the value of money.
They will see these toys and want 'em. They don't know that their parents may not have enoght money for it. Because of that they get sad. 

I think ads for young children aint bad. But, lets be honest here, they are often done out of a false idea. They dont want to show the kids the toys, no, they want to sell it to the kids. They often use effects to make the toys better than they really are, with the idea in their mind to directly sell it to the kids. They often don't care whether the kid will be disappointed or not! They just want to get money out of 'em. To sum it up. I think commercials are good because they show kids and their parents, whats great at the moment. Because of that i think commercials directed to young childrens should be allowed. Not the ads should be prohibit, no, they effects they use to make the toys "cooler" as they are should be prohibited.
