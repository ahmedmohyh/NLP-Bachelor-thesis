Television advertising is a often discused thing. Most of the people are against it and get angry when their favourite series is paused because of an adevertisment brake. But television advertising gets far more controversial when a company is directing their advertisment towards young children. So should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?¨


The main point people bring up against such advertising is that the children in this age aren't able to handle with advertisments. Children in young age can be manipulated easily and believe in what the adverts suggest even if it is not the truth. Children are not able to understand in their age that the world is dominated by the financial aspect and companies highest interest is to make as much money as possible.

On the other side people are giving the parents the responsibility to educate their children in such things. Parents have to explain their children that the sense of adverts is to bring up an "I want this" feeling and not to inform the consuments about the positive and negative aspects of their product. Furthermore at the end the parents are responsible for what they buy for their children.


In my opinion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age. But on the other hand I think that it is very important that parents teach their children how advertising works and how it affects the peoples minds. Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.
