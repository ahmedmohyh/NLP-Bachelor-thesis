There are many children who often watch TV shows in the evening or especially younger children who even watch during the day. Their parents might be working and do not have time for them or they just want to enjoy their liberate time after a workday. But is television really a supportive way to entertain the children? Especially nowadays when there are so many advertising traps? It is worth to discuss this habit of the children because it might has negative influences. But now, what are the most important aspects about television advertisings and why should/shouldn't they be allowed?
First of all, advertising is a huge business, and if i wasn't allowed there were many people who didn't have any jobs. Additionally, it is always a fiancial support for the TV channel and they can use this money to produce important shows. And last but not least are the TV adds also very inspirational for young children for playing and they get great ideas there.
But there are also many negative points, for example the need to buy these things which are in TV even if they are not needed in their househols. Secondly, it can increase the aggression of these kids, especially for little boys, when they see plastic weapons and similar stuff. So they start to think that war is something they should apchiate.
And as a last negative point, we could mention, that all these things just support the production of plastic garbage, and thats bad for our climate.
In conclusion, I can say that the negative points are more important than the negatives but evidentially, I can also understand the reasons why the industry is supporting these adds. I think it would be very difficult to ban them from the televison business.
