The statement ´Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed` is an interesting one. 
I`m not realy sure if I understand it right so in the following text I writte about some other version of this statement.
You can find some arguments which agrees with statement, but also some they don´t agree with it. 
Nowertimes children all ages use more televison and other electronic stuffs. They use theire time not like the generation befor with playing outside and meet frinds or playing with their toys at home. You can see that the modern generation and specially yound childern lose their creativ ideas. The televison could be one factor for this losing. Of cours the televison has some good points like showing kids new things and some thing like that.
You can see that young children are happy when they allowed to see something an televison, but this happienis can also be a kind of something you must do because this is what you learned and something you´ve done your whole life.
It´s importent for young children to learnd from the real life, because most of the time they can not decide if that what they see in televison is real or something that only exist in a fantasy world. 
So I think that televioson in general should not be allowed for young children or only in some short times, because it could make stupid and gives them a wrong picture from the world. I also think that it gives some activitis which make more fun than sitting in room and look to an elecrtonical box. When the children are in the age like six years, they can chose by themself, what they would do and what could be good for them, so they can look something at the televison or something like that.
