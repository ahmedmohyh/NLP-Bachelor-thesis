The children should learn to play on it's own. It could happen that they're going to be addicted to the television or other electronic things. Some of them wouldn't be able to get rid of the addiciton. Children might want to have the thing that is showed in the advertisment and when the don't get it, they're angry on the parents. The Advertisment shows the kids what they could have and they only want more. They should be happy with the things they have. When a other kid has something of an advertisment and the other kid don't they may get bullied. Watching television, especially advertisments, could be bad for the eyes.

The Advertisments could be good for the childre's creativity. There fantasy would be better and bring the kids to new ideas. They might recognize the advertisment or the sound of them, which helps the brain to remember things better. 

I think that the children don't need to watch television advertisments because they won't be able to buy it. When they're going to be addicted to something in this low age, they might be faster addicted to something else. But I think that the television advertising don't have to be forbidden. The parents should know if they want that their child watches the advertisments or not. If they say it's ok than they should look that the time of watching television is limited.
