Watching television is a common thing to do to in your spare time nowadays through all the generations. Parents of young children often use it to enetratin their children to have a little time to themselves. But televison contains a big part of advertisments between the different programs. Are these ad´s really good, especially those that are created for young children? Is it good that they are legal?

Obviously, young children are very responding to advertisments that are created for their age and therefor the selling concerns earn a certain amount of money just because children can´t stop asking their parents for the toy they desire to have. 
Ad´s can also be very helpful when it comes to ideas about what to buy for the child as a present.

But are advertisments really good for a child´s developement? The children learn that they can get everything they want and they find role models in the actors of advertisments. Now it depends on the content of said ad wether the child is develloping in a positive or in a negativ way. To clarify things it must be said that advertisments created for young children are often constructed very easy and are questionable from the sight of an adult (or a teenager or anybody who left the stage of development where everything that the older kids do is fantastic and can´t be anything but absolutly cool). 

In my opinion you shouldn´t forbid ad´s for children completly because they are too important "selling machines" in the economics, but what is definetly possible is to make laws around them, so that somehwow the too extreme forms of advertising towards children with questionable content would be avoided.
