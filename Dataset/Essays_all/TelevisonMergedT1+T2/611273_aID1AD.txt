In the following essay, I will talk about my opinion to TV advertisements, which are directed toward young children. There are many different types of advertisements. Some are pretty funny and some are just stupid and I'd wish they are taken offline immediately. Because I don't like my time being wasted of stupid ads, which tell me lies about prices or facts. And that's exactly the point. There are too many lies and wrong facts shown in TV, the Internet or just on a screen in public. The older we get, the better we can make differences about true or false information. But children cannot do this and due to their thurst of knowledge, they believe pretty much everything, eventhough the information is completely wrong. They get a wrong information and believe in this facts they are told. There should clearly be set a difference between ads for children, which contain maybe a game or an idea for their christmas wish and ads for older people, which know what's wrong or what's true. But not ads from greenpeace or wwf, in what awful conditions our planet is. Cause they are mostly showing only the bad (or good) sides and chilren get a completely wrong opinion of it. When they get such informations, they should be teached about the whole subject and not only one part of it. 
Anyway, in my opinion adverstisements are a waste of money and recources, the companys got. For example the Coca Cola Advertisement. There was made a study where people were shown a Coca Cola Advertisement in the cinema and they were asked which drink they had bougt in the break. The advertisement didn't change their opinion at all.The companies would better spend some more of their in exploring new technologies, to reduce the carbon footprint of everybody in here. Especially our children, which don't need those advertisement, will be thankful to us having at least tried to save their future.
