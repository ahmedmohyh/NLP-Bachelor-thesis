It is not god for these children to watch television for a long time because there brains cold not process the informaion from the eyes as fast older people. It is not good too because the children maybe copy the behavior of the characters from the the movies or films, but it can improve the speech from these children because they can listen hour for hour to people but they can't see the face from the person who is speaking because the sound is not the origional. This is not good for the speech of the children because they lern things by seeing for example walking but if they see a character jumping from a wall they could try it because the saw it. Advertising in this way is good for companies because these children want to get toys and if the see these they are very sure that they want this special thing but it is very bad for parrents because they have to buy this things else the children maybe cry. The children get a influence by there environment more than older people because they learn to understand how there environment works and what the have to do and what they should not do for exmple walk lonely outside. I thing it is not good to make advertising only for these yooung children because the language is realy bad and the maybe want to get these toys, that they saw. 
Because of this reasons I think it should be not allowed for children to watch a long time a day television because it is not good for there brain but I think  a short time maybe half a hour a day is ok for them because they have to use these screen there hole life. So I agree to the statement because of the reasons above.
