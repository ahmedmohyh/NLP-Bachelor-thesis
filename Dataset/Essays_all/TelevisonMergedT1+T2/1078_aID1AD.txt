In the follwing text I deal with the topic of Adds for young children(aged two to five) and at the end I will give my own opion.
I'd like to start with the argument that he young kids are getting perpeard if they watch adverter in that young age. Becouse in that time children doen't watch allone TV they often have they farther or mother next to them. So that they can controlle how long they kids are watching Tv. I'd like to add to this po A new point I want to manshen is the fact of the industie behind this Add. That mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this Add's . And that mean that the channel have more money to produce a better Tv shows. That would also help the children that they dont need to watch bad Tv. On he other side is the argument that it isn't good for yound kids to watch more the 30 min a week Tv. But this Add maked for the would inspirat them to watch more. That would be healy! Also they aren't the one how goes in the supermarked and bought the Thinks promoted in this adds. For example the two years old kids see a Add for Ice cream in the Tv them this Kid would a ask this parend that is that ? - Becouse they dont know that  is in the Add. And if they knnow that it is they would just ask can you bought me that or this ? So the parent need to dicisde.
All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.
