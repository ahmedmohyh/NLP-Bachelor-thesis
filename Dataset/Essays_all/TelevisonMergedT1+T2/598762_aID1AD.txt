Television advertising is something we live with in our every day life. It has become something normal, that we mostly don't see as an issue. But when it comes to children, more specific young children aged two to five, television advertising may be a problem. 
Nowadays most of the younger children in our society are growing up with televisions surrounding and entertaining them. They are being influenced by certain television shows but also of what comes inbetween them. Since children are still growing up, they have to learn a lot, wich means things, for example television advertising, tend to have a much bigger impact on them, then they have on grown ups. That can be a really big issue for parents who can not control what their children see on the television. This means that they can not control what their children are being influenced by. On the other hand there are a lot of other things that influence children. If a child is not homeschooled, he or she has to go to school. In school children are surrounded by others, who influence them. Those children have a much bigger impact on others, than television advertising does. But children are not only influenced by other children. In fact we live in a society where we are being influenced every day. By other people, by what happends around the globe, by basically everything. So telvision advertising does not really have that big of an impcat, right?
In my opinion, it is still an issue we can't ignore just because of the fact that there are greater issues. I do not think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it is really not necesarry. Not only that, I think it would really help the children, if they got confronted with television advertsising later in their lifes.
