Television advertising towards children is a complex topic. Some people think it should not be allowed for children aged two to five. In the following I will name some arguments, why it should be still allowed and some why forbidden.

On one hand it ist very important for the marketing to manipulate young children. It is the easiest way to sell a produkt. It is less complicatet to make a child to want a product than a parent, but the child can manipulate his/her parents to buy the product.

On the other hand it is unfair to manipulate young children to buy products they do not need. In the advertisement the product looks so amazing and it seems you need it to have fun. That is all, what the children see. They are not old enough to decide is it unsefull or not. So they want this toy, for example, and they go to their parents. So what parent would say "NO you can not have it!" to his own child?
Also advertising in television never shows the reality. So in television advertises you lie to the watchers, because of that you lie to young children. Children which are too young to understand, that it is not the reality! That you will not have friends or fun just by having that product.

In conclusion I would say that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed. It is just a easy way to manipulate parents to buy something for their children by using the children, which cannot decide how usefull the product is.
