I will analys the following statement : Television advertising directed toward young cildren ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed.

So I would start with an positiv argument for  the statement that not all advertising in television are comfortable for the age of young children, maybe they see something which scared them very much or something like this.
An argument against the statement is that childrens see all the beautiful toys in television an parents see what there child like and what the child wish there self  for birrthday or christmas and the parents can buy it (when the toy is allowed for the age of the child).
But then there is another good point for the statement that this toys the children seen in the television and wish them self for birthday then it can get cery uncontrolled, because the child don't see only one toy but so many toys and they want at the end every toy from the television which is not the key.

At the end I will say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, I agree half to the statement, because on the one side I will say that it is good then kids see what is goinig on with new toys and to be up to date in the age of four or five. But under this age I thing that the chidren don't really know what this is and what is good, also are toys not everything for these young children.So it have positiv and neagtiv arguments. But at the end I asked my self, should it be allowed for children in the age from zero to three to watch televison ? This is another question which is very criticaly to look at this.
