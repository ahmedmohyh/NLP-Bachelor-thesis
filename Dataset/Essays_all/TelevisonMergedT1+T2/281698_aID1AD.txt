The advertisement is an important factor for every company around the planet. It has the power to influence the shopping behavior of people. There are advertisements just directed toward children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult. The question, if these commercials should be allowed, stays unanswered. 
First of all it is important that we visualize the impact on a child such a advertisement could produce. Small children are believing everything and tend to be mad if they don't get what they want. This fact makes such a advetisement a problem for the whole family of the child. It could lead to arguments between family members especially when the commercial is directed to the child but advertised a product for the parents for example a car with good seats for the children.
Secondly, is the personality of a child easily changed by subconcious messages which lead to problems with te education thought by the parents. An advertisement convincing a child subconciously to buy something or ask a parent to buy something could end with an agressive young child having problems with its all day behaiviour.
Another reason not to publish such advertisements is an economical one. Companys with products which have nothing to do with children get a huge disadvantage by such advertisements because they have to make commercials directed to adults, who are more difficult to influence.
To sum up, today there are 2468 advertisements directed just to children. It is time to act and minimize these commercials for the well being of our children. It should only be allowed to make such commercials about products which are only beneficial for young children, like lego and that kind of stuff. Let our children have a uninfluenced childhood because they are going to see enough advertisements when they are fully grown.
