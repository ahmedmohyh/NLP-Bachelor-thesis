Is it okay to let young children watching televsion? This is a question on which many of the young mothers and fathers want to receive an answer. The television is a new invention and the children nowadays are the first generation who grows up with this invention. But it is very undangerous for young children? Naturally is easier for the parents if there children are quite and glad if they are watching TV. But there are other meanings. Watching too much TV can be dangerous because the children don't have enough mouvement and they learn so much if they are playing with other children in the house or in the garden. They have to have own ideas and have to respect other people. If the children are watching TV the whole day, they don't have these abilities because they can determine themselves which programme they want to watch. But there are also a lot of other abilities like motorical abilities or working with the hands, which children learn if they are playing. But there are also people who say that it is more secure to watch TV than to play in the garden. I think, yes, sure it is more secure it is more healthy to play in the garden. Probably you hit your knee, but you are better protected against infections. And if I watch the aspect about learning vital abilities it is much more helpful to play with other children than to watch TV. But in the end it should not be forbidden to watch TV but it should be very rare like once a week or something like that. I think this is the best method to educate children. Instead of giving them a TV parents should play with the children, for example a memory or read a book or paint something.
