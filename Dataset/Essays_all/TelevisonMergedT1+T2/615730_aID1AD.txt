Television advertising is one of the most important advertising methods, because most people watch television. Even if they know what the aim of advertisement is, they are influenced by it and buy often things they saw in television advertising. But children shouldn't be influenced. 

Young children shouldn't watch television at all. They could be confused by the fact that the audio doesn't fit to what they see. The audio is always slightly delayed. Advertisement directed towards the children doesn't help, it makes them even more addicted to the screen. Maybe they don't understand what advertisement is, but they see things they would like to have. They would watch the television more often because they enjoy seeing puppies or something else.

Children can't buy things they see in the advertisement. The parents will decide, if they buy for example a puppy or not. The children would of course try to convince their parents, but the adults don't buy everything their children want. It would be more useful to direct television advertisement towards the parents. If they think it would be great for the children to have something, they will buy it.

I think, that young children shouldn't watch television. But this is the responsibility of the parents. If they don't allow watching television, it isn't necessary to forbid television advertising directed towards children, because they won't see it either way. Also, directing advertisement towards children aged two to five isn't useful, because the children have no money. So my opinion is, that the parents shouldn't let their children watch television.
