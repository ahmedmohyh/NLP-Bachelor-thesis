Nowadays pretty much everyone owns a television. This also includes hoseholds with children of course. But is it a good idea to allow little children around the age of two to five free access to the television? 

Little infants are way more naive than teenagers or adults and also easier to manipulate. So everything presented on television could influence them hence they have not learned yet not to believe in everything that is told on TV. Especially advertisement directed toward youg children has a big influence on them and leave them wanting uneccessairy products, mostly toys, which are not a good quality and probably over prized. Eventhough the advertisment is not affecting the children mentally, it could stress out the parents, who are experiencing a midlife crisis anyways. So it is understandable out of their perspective why those adds should get banned on TV. 
However, I do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed since it does not badly affect anyone. Whereas, it would not be really beneficial for those companies which are responisble for these adds for children. The product would be less popular and less people would consider buying it. 

In conclusion, to answer the question, no I do not agree that television advertising directed toward children should get banned. However what should get banned are silly shows like Teletubbys or Spongebob which are making our children go braindead.
