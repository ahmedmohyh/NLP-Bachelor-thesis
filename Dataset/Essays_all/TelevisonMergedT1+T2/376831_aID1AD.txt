First of all I`m not sure, if children, aged two to five, are even interested in television commercials. I think they just want to watch their children-TV-series and nothing else.
For the case that the kids would pay attention to the advertisings,they could get manipulated very easy, because young humans always belive everything without doubting it. If there is a Superman commercial which tells yout that this plastic Superman has superpowers, the children will believe it, because they don`t know how to separate reality from fantasy or imaginations. After the little kids have watched like five different commercials, they want to have all of the toys and stuff that they just saw on the screen. In this case, parents would be pressured by their respective children to buy all those things immediately. So the parents are know struggling with themselves, wheter they should buy all the toys for their kids and make them happy, even when they know that they don`t have enough money or that their children will lose their interest in this toys after maybe just one month of playing with them or don`t buy all this stuff and make their kids crying for days and being called rude parents in the entire neighbourhood.
Because of the fact that the parents of young children would have such a dilemma at home, I think for myself, that television advertising should be forbidden through out daytime broadcasting. In my opinion, the television channels could be allowed to present children advertising during primetime broadcasting, because at this time, there are just older people watching like adults and teenagers. If they would see a good children commercial, they could find an idea for a birthday- or a christmaspresent for their little children whitout being pressured from all possible sides.
