Television advertising directed toward young children

As we all know children start watching televiosn at a very young age, becasue of that there are also a ton of advertising directed toward young children, for exapmle for a brand new toy, or a new flavour of their favorite sweets. Now the question is, if those advertisings directed toward yooung children should not be allowed.
At my point of view there is only one argument that is against this statement. With those advertisings the children get to know all the new stuff, that is new  on the market, they get an idea of what they could wish themselves for christmas and the advertising companys can make a lot of money with that, because who can't resist the big, shiny eyes of a cute little child . I know this isn't a good arguement but right now a better one doesn't come to my mind, because I totally agree with this statement. That those adervtising should not be allowed is from my opinion a really good idea, because as Î already said at the beginnig, children start watching televison at a very young age and they shouldn't get overwhelmed with all those new toys etc. that they are suppost to need. Advertising in general makes you feel, that something is missing in your life and, that you can't live without this new anti aging creme presented by a women with a perfect matt, younglooking skin. Children shouldn't feel that way at this very young age. It's definetly not healthy to always want and mostly also get everything, children should learn, that you can't always get what you want in life. And these
So for the future I hope that those advertisings directed toward young children are not allowed.
