Children aged two to five mostly watch television with supervision of their parents. They probably won't get what's in the advertisment because their parents will have the last word. Throgh that they'll learn to be sceptical and not to buy everythig that's on TV. Also commercials can teach them about how the world works and what's outside of their hometown/city. On the other hand, children are the easiest to manipulate through advertising. Parents that aren't in control of their children might give in and just buy them everything. So this subject also depends a lot on the parents and how they act in certain situations. Also watching to much TV in general isn't the best thing for a young child. It can be very overwhelming, damage their eyes and they might even neglect their social contacts. I personally think, it's not very damaging for children to watch commercials. It's a very important step in our modern time to not be influenced by the huge media world. Instead the children should learn a good method of handeling such things as advertisments. And in this case "practice" is very important. In fact I think it's more damaging if they don't get in touch with any commercials. This could become a much bigger problem in the future when they watch a commercial as an adult and simply can't resist because they never learned how to handle it.
