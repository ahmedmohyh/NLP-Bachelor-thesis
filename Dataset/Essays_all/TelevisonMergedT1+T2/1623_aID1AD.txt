I think you can see the "Television-No" for young children aged from two to five in the first way or in the second way.
And it also depends on the question "what?", because if the young children watch a film about animals or a film like "Frozen", I didn't see any bad points on it, but if the children watch a horrorfilm or something like that, it isn't good.
There is just one other point we must checked if the statement should worked and that is who checked this. I mean when there is a statement like that who says that the parents do that and their children are not allowed to watch television or something like that.
