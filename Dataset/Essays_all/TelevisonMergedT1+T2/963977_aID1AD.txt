Nowadays, no matter what you are watching, the television advertising interrups the movie or whatever you watch at the most interesting moment. The following ten minutes there appears some advertisements for every age also for children. But what is the reason of that? Should not children be children and enjoy their life?

On one hand, children aged from two to five mostly watch television because their parents are occpued and need some silence. It makes no difference which channel you are watching, advertisements are everywhere also some which are directed toward young children. I can totally understand the commercial industry that they advertise their products and try to sell them. Especially little children normally want to have everything they see and of course the television advertising is much more decorated with some technical skills that it looks more extraordinary and makes the child wishing it. 

On the other hand,advertising with games for exemple while the children are watching television has some negativ aspects. Firstly, in the mind of the children there appears the wish for that thing they just have seen. They want to have the seen product immediately. Often if a child want to have something it  asks their mother but if she says no, the terror starts. It screams in hope to get the toy but mostly the mother is stronger and lets the child crying until it calms down again.

In my point of view, children aged two to five should not sit in front of the television. They should rather go out, play around, let their energy out and maybe make some new friends. If many children would do that we would not have to ask the question if television advertising directed toward young children is allowed. My personal opinion is, that children should enjoy their movie they are watching without interruptions, because if they are interrupted all the time, they are not able to get the chance to understand the content of that what they are watching.
