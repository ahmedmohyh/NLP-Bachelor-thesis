In the 21th century, many children are growing up with technology. They use different devices even they are very young. The television belongs to the favourite used divice of children. They are able to watch funny stories about animals which can talk or other fairytales. But in between the TV programme there is a lot of advertising too. Huge companies know exactly that children will see their advert for toys or other things like circuses. Children which see the advertisment are putting pressure on their parents, because they mean that in this world today we have to buy many things or undertake something every weekend. 
Unconcioulsy little kids compare each others belongings and are wanting even more and more. They wouldn't be so in love with material things, when they wouldn't see them all the time. Advertising on children is a mistake, because it's the first step into Capitalism. They want more toys and more adventures. Children will automatically think that they need all these things which are shown to them, but that's not reality. Things aren't happiness and that is proved. For example when children get what they want then they will at first be playing with thst toy all the time. But after a while it gets boring and they are searching for somethimg new. So children won't be impressed by little things and are expecting way too much.
To say it a nutshell, for sure companies want to sell their products, but the price they pay for losing humanity is even worse and not worth it.
