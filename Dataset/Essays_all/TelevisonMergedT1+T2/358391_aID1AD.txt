Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed. There are many arguments that it shouldn`t be allowed. It isn`t good for the children to watch much television in this age because they are to young and it`s bad for their development. Before children have to go to school they shouldn`t watch television because it is prooved, that children who watched a lot of television aren`t as good in school as the other children. If it is bad to watch television in this age it is bad to make television advertising for them. Also children in this age are easy to manipulate and if the advertising tells something is good they will believe it and so they want to have it.  If they want something they will find a way to make their parents buy this things. People who are older realise that in the advertising the product seems to be much better than it really is. In this young age they can`t see this. 

There are also the proposers of television advertising. They think it should be allowed because the company can sell a lot more than they would do without television adertising. So it is good for the economy. They also think why should it not be allowed? If they wouldn`t make the advertising there would also be other advertising young children could see. 

I think it isn`t the best thing in the world and maybe it would be good if it were forbidden. But I also think it will be difficult to make a law which says television advertising should not be allowed. I think it should be forbidden but I don`t think that it will be forbidden. We have a lot of other problems which we have to solve and this isn`t that important.
