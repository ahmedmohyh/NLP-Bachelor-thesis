Advertising is a big theme today, we have it wherever you look and hear. It is a good way to spread the ideas and products all over the world, and there it is, a problem, because there are so many electronical devices, it's naturally the best way to do it.
Today everybody is watching tv, surfing in the internet and playing games on computer or something like that.
There are many studies today about children and the consume of electronic device time, it's not good for young children to have electronic device time.
My own oppinion to this statement, i think it is not good for children to have any time at tv or electronic devises until five or six years. 20 years ago no child had the possibility to watch tv and the advirtising in there. so i think it should not be disallowed, it is the decision of the parents if they will allow their children to watch tv and the advertising between.
The companys which are producing this adverts, are a little bit stupid is my oopinion, because they know it is not good for children to watch tv in this age.
To producing this adverts should be forbidden, but only on the television, when you advertise in another way it is allowed, because you will not surprised during a film or something.
The adverts for so young childrens are not that good, because the parents have to buy these things. The child will cry untill it will get it.
so there are many points against television advertising directed towards young children, but for the company it is a really good way to earn much money. When children see something they think it's a good, cool thing it is very difficult to not give them that, because they will talk only about it all the time.
I agree this statement but i understand also the companys, they have a easy way to earn much money.
