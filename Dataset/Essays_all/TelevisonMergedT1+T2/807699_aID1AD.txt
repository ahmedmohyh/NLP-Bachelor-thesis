There are two side to see it. On the side that agrees with the statement, one of the arguments are that young children are also persons and the companies that want to advertise their products on the television are allowed to do it. They say that there are some products that are specific for children and this is the easiest and the most efficient way to advertise them. An example for this are toys and sweet food. They are supposed to enjoy the children. 
An second argument is that it's good for the economics. They make a lot of money because parents doesn't want to rejects the wishes of their children and they're nearly forced to bey them.
What is more is that this children will grow up and from the age of ten they will watch television on their own. So they will be confronted to advertisment at a later age.
There is also the contrary side to all this arguments. They say that the children in this age don't realise that the advertisment in the television could be bad for them. Children are innocent and aren't able to form their own opininon on this type of advertisment. An other point is that children often sit near the television and they didn't decided this. Their parents put them there to have them near to them selves to look after them. Or sometimes parents just want the children to calm down and to stop crying or whatever. The children are entertained and don't annoy the parents any more.
My own opinion is the last one. I think that there is enough advertisment in the world that it hasn't to be also in the television when young children are watching the TV programation for children. It's not fair. I think children have to have a good childhood and enjoy what the already have. They don't need to buy more toys and the sweet food is bad for their health.
