Young children are much more easy to influence then older peolpe. So when there are televison advertising directed to young children there is a big chance that they just belive what they say in the television even if it is not true at all. 
Also when a young child sees something that it likes it is very hard for the young child to realise that it is not importent to have all these things.
An other point is that younge children normaly do not have any money so it does not make any sence to make televison advertising directed toward young children. It only makes a child wants something that they can not have and then it breaks a young childs heart. 

When there is television advertising directed toward young children they learn how to deal with it early. So the soon know that not every thing in a television advertising is absolutly true. 

I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because a young child is so easy to manipulate and most of the people who make the advertising know that and it is just not right to ausnützen this.
