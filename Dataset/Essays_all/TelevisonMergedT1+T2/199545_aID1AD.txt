Nowadays watching TV is a common thing. Advertisements effect all of us. Sometimes we don't even realise what effect advertisements have on our actions and mind. For example: we tend to buy products we know and having seen them in an advertisement once, we automatically think we know it.
Most adults are aware of the effects advertising has on us. But it comes to a problem when advertisement is shown to young children. They get effected by advertisements extremely indirectly as they do not know the intentions of it and sometimes don't even understand the content, which sometimes isn't appropriate for children at this age.
On the one hand I agree that televison advertising to young children should not be allowed, on the other hand I think that there's no way to set a law for this. The government can't control if there is any young child watching TV at a specific time and therewith can't control if any child is watching the advertisement it isn't supposed to watch.
In our society we would have to stop all kinds of television advertising to make sure young children don't get affected. So I think it's up to the parents to make sure their children only get to watch what is appropriate for them instead of not allowing television advertising.
