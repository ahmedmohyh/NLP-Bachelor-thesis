Nowadays, observing young children watching television is nothing astonishing anymore. There are a lot of kids who are not older than five years old, spending several hours a day and doing noting but staring into television, although there would be such a enormous amount of energy in those low-aged children. This is very sad and must be changed. Television advertising directed to young chidren should be forbidden.

First of all, it is clear that the development of a child is the most important thing. This development is influenced by different parts. One of those parts is the movement. Sports and movement are enourmously important, because they have positive effects on body and health of a human, especially of a child because, as explained, they are in the state of developing.

In the ideal case, children play or move outside, because like this they learn to know their environment and the nature. In their following lives they are ready and able to use, protect and respect.

Another point is the social one. Playing is not just playing, it is more dealing with other social individums. When children play with each other, they have to respect their partner(s) and learn a lot of skills by doing that. The earlier they learn to share things, for example, the better they are able to do in their following lives.

To sum up, chilren are made for moving in the free nature, to play with other children and to learn how to act in their following lives. Watcing television does the opposite with these children. It iaolates them. A lot of very important experiences get lost.
