Jung children and television 

Every Person now, that children love television. They look with realy big eyes, if you say they are alowed to look. but a lot of doc`s andacademics are agenst television. they have good reasons for this.

children under three see the pictures, are faszinated but they don´t know what happend. they can not realise and don´t understand.
