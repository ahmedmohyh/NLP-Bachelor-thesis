Essay "Advertising"

Consumers become younger and younger. There's no child that goes with his family into the shopping mall and only want some chocolat. The want the "longest Praline in the world" or  the chocolat with the goo milk inside. Should we protect our children against the kind of manipulation? In the following essay I'll discuss if it would be good or not when "Television advertising directed toward young children shuld not be allowed".

First of all, you have to think about for who the ad really is. For the young children, speaking only  a few words, or for there parents, to know what kind of toys the sholud buy for there child? And if the parents can't withstand this advertisement, it's another proplem, but the kids themself have no money, no chance to get into the mall without there parents, so it should be the task for the parents, to teach there children, what to buy and how to manage money.
Never the less the ads has a bit of influence to the children, and the may want things, the parents can't buy them. This could end in a bad situation for the parents and the child too.

All in all, I think ads are an important part of our lifes because they manipulate us in different ways and it' s the parents exercise to show the children, that not all of the advertisement are good for the consumer, so the younger they learn that, the better is it for them and of course better than see the first ad with 10 years and want to buy this without any kind of Mäßigung.
