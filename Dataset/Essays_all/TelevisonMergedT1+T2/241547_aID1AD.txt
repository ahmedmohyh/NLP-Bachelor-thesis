Should it not be allowed to direct television advitising towards small children?
Some people think it has bad influence on  children when they see television advertising. Some people think that it can have a bad effect on young children. I totally agree that television can have an  effect on the way people think  especially on the way younger ones think. But at the same time I don't think it should be forbidden to direct advertising towards children. The children today need to learn how to live with social media and the advertising on it, also on  TV. It is part of life nowadays and by forbidding advertising directed towards children, one takes away time when they, the children could actually learn how to not believe everything they see. If television advirtising is forbidden the problem won't be fixed. The problem is that so many people fall for everything they see, hear or read and the solution to that problem is learning them how to check facts and be critical. This can be achieved if one starts talking about it to younger children. 
Then of course one can't just place their children in front of the TV and leave, but this should not be done anyway. One has to prepare the younger children for the future and part of their future is fake news and advirtising so they need to learn how to react to that at a young age.
That is the reason I am against  not alowing television advertising directed towards young children.
