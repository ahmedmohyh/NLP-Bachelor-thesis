I agree to this statement, because I think that young children in this age shouldn't watch so much television, especially advertisements, anyway. In some programs there are many advertisements, which aren't good for kids in this age e.g. about alcohol and cigarettes. Kids can't understand them and maybe get directed in the wrong direction, because they can't understand what is right and what is wrong in this age. Some parents think it is good, when there childs see advertisements about toys, so they can choose what they want to have as their next present for some event or what movie to watch next. Nevertheless I think it is better to go to a toy shop with his kid or just let the child imagine a toy, what you can maybe buy somethere. Otherwise they get addicted to the television and may forget about their friends on the playground. In our century almost the whole population is addicted to smartphones and television. But we can't stop this, if we sat our young children in front of a telvision to have relax time from them annoying us. In this way we support this huge problem. 
Another problem is, that the kids fastly fall in love with all the toys and movies they might see in the advertisings, but many  parents can't afford everything or even one thing of them. So the childs get sad very quickly. Even worse is it, when the toy isn't so cool like it was described in the advertising, because it is often so, that things in television are described as the most perfect and best thing, that you really need and they leave out all the bad informations about it.
So to come to a conclusion I would say, that children with young age shouldn't watch television advertisings, because their dreams and thougts could get destroyed and they would get confused about all the other stuff, which is advertised between the kids stuff.
