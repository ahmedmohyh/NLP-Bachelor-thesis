Today there are more young children aged two to five who watch television than there had been in the past. There are a lot of discussions if children in this age should even be able to watch television in this age, but that's not the point. I want to show the pros and cons about television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five and if it should be allowed.

I haven't seen much television advertisings especially made for children yet, but the ones I saw weren't on programmes for children, but on those for the parents. When it's like that, I think that advertising for very young children should be allowed, because when they're on programmes for adults, the parents normally are watching television and they can judge, if their children should now see this or not when they are watching television together.

On the other hand we see television advertisings which are shown to children on programmes made for children and there the children normally watch without their parents. In this case it depends on what kind of advertising it is. When it's advertising for a toy or a new serie on the programm, then I think it's not that bad, because the children can learn to know knew things and they aren't influenced that much. It becomes more dangerous, when there are product placements shown on television. There are some big industries, for example Mc Donalds, which want to influence the people by a very young age to buy their products when they are older.

To sum up, in my opinion television advertising for young children should be allowed, but song
