Television advertising directed towards young children is a topic I am sure about that there are a lot of different opinions. But should it really be banned?

What could be possibly a good argument for television advertises for young children? Children will see the commercial and probably think "Hey that toy looks like a lot of fun, I want it!". So they will ask their parents to buy it for them. Television advertises for children are mostly about new innovative toys. Getting new toys will have the child to think about how to interact with it. Which will boost is creativity. And for today it is important that children learn how to be creativ because once being and adult with no creativity, you will be having a hard time. Also denying the wish from the child will show that the child can not always have what he wants. This will teach him a good lesson.

But television advertising directet towards young children is not always that good. Let me explain why.

First of all children from age two to five are not really good at making decisions. They lack the knowledge and experience. When they see an advertise for toys or other attractions they will mostly want to have or experience it, because in the advertise it always looks like much fun. And children especially want to have fun all the time. The children will constantly ask their parents if they could buy it for them. When they say no, it will lead to the child being angry and sad. Becuase some children are pretty stubborn at that age, they will make the parent buy it for them. That attitude could possibly lead to the child staying stubborn for a longt time, maybe even until his adolescence. The child will think that if he gets what he wants by staying stubborn, he will choose to keep that attitude. Such small things can change a lot on the outcome of a child.
