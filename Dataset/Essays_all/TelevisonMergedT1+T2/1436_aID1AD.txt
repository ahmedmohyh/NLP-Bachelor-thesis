I do agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. The reason why I think that it should not be allowed is that advertising in general manipulate people. And the younger a person is, the more can it get manipulated, because the older a person is the more lifeexperians it gets. For example: If I would told a child that 1+1=3 it would belive me, because the child was not able to collect some own experiance. So if a child with an age from under five is whatching an advertising it will get strongly manipulated. So if the television advertising is showing for example a toy than the child will think that it have play with that which is from there on really stressful for the parents, because they maybe think that the toy is too expensiv for them or just not good for the child, so they would not buy it. But this means that the child will cry the whole time whitch is not great for the child and for the parents neather. So after my oppinion it would be the best thing if such kinds of advertising would be not allowed so the parents have not to spent their money for some nonsence just because the television advertising is manipulating the children.
But I can understand why it could get difficult to ban those advertisings because where is the border from an advertising which is for children with an age of six and one with an age of five? But all in all I am against television advertisings which are directed toward young children.
