When ever a form of media gets invented, people will try to use it to their advantage and try to monetise them via advertising and television is no exeption. Television advertising used to be incredibly effective, since watching the TV was the main source of entertainmentf for the whole family. Nowadays however, most millenials don't really watch cabled television anymore. Instead, they use programms like Netfilx or Hulu for shows, and webistes like MSM for news. So the TV-advertisers has to find other demographics to appeal to. One of those groupes are small children. From 9am to 15 pm, there is a surprisingly large amount of advertisments directet towards toddlers aged two to five. This calls forth the question: Is this good for the child's development? Many people say that manipulating children at such a young age is not acceptable from a moralic perspective. Children are extreamly guilable and belives most of the things you tell them. Not only that, children aged two to five are increadibly fast at learning new things. If you teach them a new word, they will use it, and if you show them tons and tons of advertisements, they will learn to, nay, be forced to love those products. Thats why advetisements directet directly at them have a much stronger effect than advertisements directet at older people.However, if you manipulate the children too much, you will erase their individuality. Is creating a future where all people want the same things because they saw the same advertisements when they were children that attracive? Apperantly, for the advertising companies, it is, since having most people think alike will increase their income. Me personaly, I think that having a diverse and colourful next generation is important and nessecairy for the continuation and evolution of the human as a species, which is why I'm adamantly against Television advertising directed towards young children.
