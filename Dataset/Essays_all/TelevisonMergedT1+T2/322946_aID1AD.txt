We live in a world where technology and commercial is totally common and normal. I think it is really important for children to already learn as a young child how to think about television advertising. We see and hear commercials all the time, either in radio, televison or in newspapers. Parents should bring up their children in our world we live now and commercial is a part of it. 
Children should also learn to say no to something and should learn to be critical against foreign things. They have to learn that they can`t buy everything and that not everything that seems nice is really nice. When the parents give them everything they want, they will really have big problems when they get older because they will never be able to afford everyting. But when they already have to ask themselves in young age if it is really necessary to buy something, later they won`t have any problems. 
I know that it isn`t healthy at all when young children watch television the whole day. If they do other things, for example sports, they don`t even see these commercials that often. Maybe that`s why people who often watch TV often get manipulated by advertising. But for young children it wouldn`t even be a big problem if they don`t watch TV all day. 
When the children get older the commercials try to manipulate them anyways. So why should it be a problem to already see those commercials when they are younger? The sooner you get accostumed to something the sonner you learn how to deal with it and that`s why I do not agree with this statement.
