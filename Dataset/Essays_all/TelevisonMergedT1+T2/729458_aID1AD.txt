Advertising in tv. Why should be it not allowed? I clearly disagree with not allowing ads in childrens-tv.  I mean the parents can allow their childrent to watch tv or not. If they have a problem with advertisments, which appear in shows, they can just forbid their Children to watch, or switch of the television in pauses and turn it on again when  the show continues. I think children their selves (here between 2 and 5) don't have opinions about ads in tv. They just watch them.
And another point is, that advertisments dont just appear in tv. As an example, the childrens-journals and placates. And in the questionaire, it's written, for children between two and five. Are children in the age of two years even able to know, what happens in advertisments?
For me, parents who allow their two year-olds to watch tv often and wich are complaining abot advertisments in tv, aren't really intelligent anyway.
Another reason is, that there is tv for adults too and there advertisments are much more often. And I don't think, that children are much more reachable for ads.
A simple example: there are ads in tv for chickenwings in a warehouse, there's a big possibillity that they say, that it's time to visit the warehouse anyway and there they buy the chickenwings. Children between two and five, hopefully don't havereally much money anyway,so they can't just go for a shoppingtour and buy thethings they see in tv. So I think it would be really silly to forbid ads in childrens-tv and even though its not really cool to get interrupted by it all the time.
