Television advertising directed towards young children could have some advantages but also disadvantages. At the age from two to five, children have to learn new things and start being prepared for their following life, like school. On the one hand television can help to lern new words or something about life. On the other hand the childrem can also learn these things from the real world. In this period of their lifes they experience a lot of things in the nature, with their partents or children who are their age. Go to different places and see new things in the world can help to grow up in a better way. If the weather for example isn't good and the children haven't got the chance to go outside and make experiences there, they can also do something else than watch the television. Their parents can read out books for them, the children can play with different types of things like little cars or dolls. To play with the parents, other family members or kids their age is important for the future. Children will learn to interact with other people, share things with them and how good it feels to have people around you and not being alone. In my opinion television advertising directed toward yound children should be allowed, because in general it isn't completely bad for them. But i think parents should create better days for their children and do things like i talked about before. If they sometimes let their children watch the television, thats totally okay, but it should not be the whole day. Sometimes the parents have to focus on other things like clean the house or do something for work, in my opinion it's okay if the children watch tv. Of course it's better if they will play with some real things but sometimes they don't even want than. To conclude i would say that the Television for young children isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either.
