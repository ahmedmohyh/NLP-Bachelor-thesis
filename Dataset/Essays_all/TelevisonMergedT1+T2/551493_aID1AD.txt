Television advertising is a mighty  of companies. They use it to gain the attention from customers and to raise needs in them the didn't knew they had before. Pretty much every company uses them. 

Young Children can be manipulatet really good and I think this statement is grounded in this fact. But I would say that young children can be manipulatet really good but that older people can be manipulatet really good als well but they don't want to see it. 
For example:
A young boy sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees. He goes to his parents and sais them that he wants to have this.
A mature man sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees. He doesn't go to his parent but he keeps this thing in mind and later when he walks through the store he tends to buy it.

A young child doesent has the money to buy stuff. So it can only go to his parents and ask them for what it wants.
In my opinion parents have the responsibility to look for their child and to decide wether something is good for it or not. So it lays in their responsibility to be able to say no.

I would say it should be allowed like every edvertise for other ages is allowed. If it would be banned, then all the others should be banned as well.
