Many children often look television in young age in their freetime just for fun. In the following I want to discuss wether this is good or not in this young age. 
First I want to say that it doesn't make sense when you just let your child sit on the sofa and watch televison while their mother clean the house for example. Television isn't good for the education and the most kids, who watch often television in their freetime, aren't so educated. 
On the one hand it's really bad for the education and then later the school life, but on the other hand I understand that watching television is better for children instead of reading a book. 
Children often are boring in their freetime and mostly they are too lazy to read a book, that's why they just sit themself on the sofa and watch television, because it's so much easier. 
Furthermore television doesn't help in school, because the most children series doesn't make sense and they are just there, so that the children aren't boring and they have funny things to look in the television. If the children would read a book or making something productive, they prepare for school and already know how to write a good text in german lessons for example. Moreover they know more words and how to combine them in their texts, so that the text get a good structure and is good to read for the teacher. 
I come to the end that it isn't good for children in young age to watch television. 
My own opinion is the same as the conclusion. Children should better reead a book or if they are too young, their parents should read out a book for them instead of watching television. Furthermore the connection between parents and their child also get better if they do something together like reading a book. In addition their child is also more educated when they're reading a book.
