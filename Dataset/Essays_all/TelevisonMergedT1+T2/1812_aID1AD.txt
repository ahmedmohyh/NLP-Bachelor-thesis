In the the following I will state my opinion to wether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.


Of course, children, especially of that age, are easy to manipulate and I definetely see the danger in ads for children, but I think it doesn't really matter, when the children are actually manipulated to the point, that they would buy a product advertised to them, because in the end of the day the parents are the ones, who have to buy something for their children and have to decide what their children are going to get. 

Apart from that it is important to say, that children are influenced from everything around them, not just TV-ads. Friends, family, kindergarden and also the series they watch in TV. When you say, you don't want your child to be influenced by ads, you have to keep it locked in a flat room with no windows.

Also, when this kind of advertisement would be allowed, parents would or at least should be aware of that fact. So they can decide to not let their child watch TV, when they don't want it to watch those ads. 


So all in all I think nobody could complain about ads for children in a world, that is full of ads and different influences and when you are aware of such things as a parent you can prevent your child from getting in contact with something like that. Also no child would walk in a store and buy something irrationally, simply because they have no money to do so.
