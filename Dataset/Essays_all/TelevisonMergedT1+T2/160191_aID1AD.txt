In the last years, the television has become an ubiquitous part of our home. After a challenging day of work, you like to go home, sit on the couch and watch some TV. Some people prefer watching sitcoms or series and other people are more into blockbuster or action movies. What nearly every TV programm has in common is that there are those annoying and long advertisements during a pause or between a change of the programm. There are all kind of advertisements on TV nowadays from which companies benefit. But what about advertising directed toward young children? Should they be allowed or not?

On one hand, the advertising is important for many entreprises who make their money from young children products. Nestle, one of the biggest grocery producer in the world, produces all sorts of groceries for young children. On the other hand, there are more ways of advertising successfully. One can advertise in news papers, screens in public and so on. Secondly


So I think it should be allowed because there is no need to be against a television advertising directed toward young children.
