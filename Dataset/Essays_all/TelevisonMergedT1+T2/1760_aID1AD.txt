Television advertising is pretty controversal, especially for young children.
While watching TV, the majority of young children is influenced by the music they hear or the colours they see. 
They often like colourful and noisy things which make them laugh or dance or sing. Most of the television advertising is just like that today and I think that these children are really into this kind of advertising. When they see a cool toy advertising with a nice song you keep in your mind they admire to have it and start to annoy their family because they want it as a gift for christmas or their birthday. Otherwise television advertising is good to help the kids making decisions about their wishes for christmas, eastern, etc. There are TV channels only for young children which don't show any advertising and I think that this is very good. There are only the TV shows and no advertising for adults which could be bad for the education of them. Many terrible things happen daily and young children should not get the brutal impressions of terror and pain because that could be bad for their view on people in their later lives. You can also make advertising for useless or bad things and use nice characters or colours for it. As long as it makes them happy, the young children don't care aboout the content of it. For example there is much advertising for sweets which re not good for young children's but they want to eat them because of the interesting TV spot.
That's the reason why I agree with the statement that television advertising for young children should not be allowed. They start wanting to have the newest stuff and they only get influenced by colours and sounds because they aren't able to think about the content yet.
