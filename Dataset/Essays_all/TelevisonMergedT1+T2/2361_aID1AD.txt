The queastion today is wheather it should be allowed that television advertising is directed toward young children or not. In the following the question will be answered, first I will lay all the information down and in the end I will explain my own opinion. 

On the one hand it would be possible to create the advertising in a nice and friendly way, so that the children woundn't see the advertising for adult, like half naked woman. On the ather hand kids would be more manipulated by the advertisement than they would be atherwise. 
It would make it more easy for the comanys to sell their stuff, but the parents wouldn't have the same amount of sayings in what kind of products their child should use than befor. 
Another aspect for the allowense is, that chidren see advertisment every day, so it wouldn't make any diference, but directed directly against it,  is the argument that children already see to much advertising every where they go, there is no need to make it worse by producing advertising especally for them. 

To sum up, the positive side about advertisement just for kinds are that the shops have a better groung to sell their products and the negative side is, that the children will have to grow up around it and get manipuled it want they need and what not.
In my opinion advertising directed toward children should not be allowed. It is an anessesary manipulation and it forces the parents to buy their children stuff they wouldn't have atherwise. Sometimes they dont't have anough money to by all the things the kids want, so the child would be devestated, what could have benn prevented. The wills of big concernse shouldn't be more worth than the savety of our children.
