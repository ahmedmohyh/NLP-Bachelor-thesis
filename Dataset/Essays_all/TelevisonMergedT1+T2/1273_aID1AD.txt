In my opinion there are different reasons to say that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not be allowed.
On argument is, that the children in that age won´t buy things without their parents knowledge. The parents know better than the children what is right and what is wrong and won´t buy the things from the advertising if they are not worth it. 
Another argument that television advertising should be allowed is, that children in that age don´t watch much advertising. They feel bored very fast and will switch the programm when there is advertising. So there is no reason why it should be forbidden, because they don´t get to watch the advertising.

On the other hand, there are also many reasons why it should not be allowed.
Children in the age of two to five don´t have an own opinion. They are influenced very fast by media, people or Television advertising. Children can not understand that an object of the advertising is not that good in real life how it is descriped in the advertising. They don´t know that the advertising shows an idealised picture of the product and want to have it, although it is not that good in the reality.
As well children haven´t got so much money. They only have their pocket money and the money that them was given. But children don´t own their own money, because they don´t work. So it is not fair to let them buy the things of the advertising, because the children should not spend all of their money. Children should rest money for the future. The kids will be disappointed if they buy an object and it isn´t so how it is descriped and they will regret that they bought it. 

All in one you can say that there are more reasons why television adverting should not be allowed. The children are to small to understand the sence of television advertising.
