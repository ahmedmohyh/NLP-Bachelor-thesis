Often on children channels they publish advertisements for toys or games, which seems logical. So I think every person remember such a situation in his childhood, where you see something shown in the TV you want to have.

On one hand I see the positive aspect for the company who sells these toys for children, because after the children saw these toys, or even worse they saw other children in the advertisement playing with these toys, they want to have it emmediately. So they put it on their list of wishes for christmas and the parents will buy it. And thats the way the companies make their profit.

But on the other hand exactely this example shows us that children get spoiled more and more, because these advertisement put them something in their head they want to have and they will get it. So the advertisements on TV support this scenario. Another negative point is that cildren in this age arent able to analys or even think about the consequences. For example the price or how usefull it is. They just want to have it. 

So in conclusion in my opinion its to early for kids aged two to five to handle a situion like that in the right way. It would be more intelligent to show them more of their series they want to see. But unfortenately nowadays it the other way round. They show even more and more advertisments than the real program of the channel. So I think you shouldent stop every advertiment but minimize it.
