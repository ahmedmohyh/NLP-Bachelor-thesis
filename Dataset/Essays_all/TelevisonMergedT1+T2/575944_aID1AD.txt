Should it be allowed to advertise television directed toward young childrens?

Today many children watch TV at home instead of playing outside. Peolpe often critices this evolution because they thinks electronic devices are not good for the young children. So they think about making television advertising prohibited. 

One advantage when TV advertising directed toward young children isn't allowed is that they would play outside because there only mord series etc on televison. Next, when the children watch TV every time, they can lose friend or the don't know how the "real" world works.  

On the other hand it's better when they have their own TV programms because if they haven't their own programms they watch tv programmes for adults instead of going outside or playing with other kids. In addition, there's not a problem when parents look and control how long their watching TV. Young childrens should also know how a TV works. The earlier they learn how electronic devices works, the easier is it to learn and to work when they are adults. They should learn from the beginning how long it's good watching tv and when its enough.

To sum up, there are also advantages and disadvantages. But I think televisions advertising should be allowed because children should have their own TV programmes. If they haven't got own TV series, they watch series for adults instead of making other things. So it's better when they watch their own programmes which are done for childrens. But the parents of the children must be careful about how long the children watch TV because they shouldn't watch TV the whole day. They should go outside and play with other kids. But a prohibition is not the right way to bring children away from the TV screen.
