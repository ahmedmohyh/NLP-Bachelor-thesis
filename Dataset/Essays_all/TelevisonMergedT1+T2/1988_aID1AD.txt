An often discussed topic is if televison advertising directed to young children schould be not allowed.
An argument for a destriction would be that the young children did not now that the advertisement is made to convience the people to buy something. And an outher point is that cildren did not know the weath of the money and that there is not limetless money to buy everything.
But on the outher hand side the idustie earns a lot of money when they use advertises espacelly for children and so they mabey speend there more money for new jobs and so everyone profits of this situation.
A point against a distriction might be that the childern did not even know the sence of advertising when the time of the districtin of advertising ends and in the end there are the same problems like we had before.
And in the end it is the problem of the parents when they did not inform there children or been strict it is not the problem of the idustrie.
So all in all I thing that it sould be allowwed to creat advertises especelly for young children but the childen should be more informed about advertises because only this halps againat the problems that comes with it.
