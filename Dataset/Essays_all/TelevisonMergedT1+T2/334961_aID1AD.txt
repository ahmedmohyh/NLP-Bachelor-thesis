In this essay I will be talking about the statement that children under five years old shouldn't be allowed to be targeted in TV ads.

The big companies make way to much money selling all there toys and garbage to little children. Especially in places like the US and other first world countries it is a big driving force of the economy. These companies rely on rich famalies with extremely bratty children to make money. By targeting these children in terrebly obnoxious commercials they're securing their customers. Because parents of bratty little children have no choice but to buy whatever toy or product their child just saw on TV or their in for a huge brain exploding tantrum. 
The toy branch has become a large player in the economy in recent years. The CEO's and chairmen of these big companies may be selfish and stingy, who take way to much profit money for themselves but nevertheless they create new jobs with the expansion of their buisinesses.
On the other side to the economical questions to this statement are the moral questions.
Is it ok to brainwash the joungest part of the population of a whole society with annoying TV ads?
Of course if one sais it like that the answer is no. Who thinks it's ok to brainwash their child....
But these commercials can limit a kids perspective on things. With these ads a little kid is bound to grow up in a very capitalistic surrounding without any other point of view. 

That being said it isn't moraly justified to manipulate little children in such a way that may verywell have a big influence on their later life
