It is well known that a lot of brands would do everything to get more clients and obviously to earn more money. A lot of companies spend tons of money for a good advertition campagne. But is it okay to direct television advertising towards young children?
First, television advertising directed toward young children can be very useful for brands because children don`t think as much as adults do when they see an advertisement. Children just think that for example the toy they see in the advertisement is funny to play with so they want to have it and they probably tell their parents the next time they see the toy in a store or when their birthday is coming up and they`re asked for their wishes. This can really help companies to earn money and there are companies which only run thanks to this.
On the other hand, television advertising for young children can be dangerous and confusing for them. Sometimes in television advertisments, things are happening which can`t possibly happen in real life. Younger children may not understand that and for example suddenly get scared of their toys coming to life. Even worse, they may try to copy certain actions which they see in an advertisment on television. This can lead to very dangerous situations like children trying to climb out of the window or stand on a high wall.
After my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden. I think they are too young to understand certain things and can easily misunderstand what they see. As a better option, I would advice the companies to make good advertisments directed to parents because then they know that they get something good for their children.
