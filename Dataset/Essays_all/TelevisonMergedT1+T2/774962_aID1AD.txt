"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed." Young children don't think like adolescents or teenagers. They aren't suppose to watch television in general. It doesn't make a lot of sense because they are not able to understand what's going on on TV. It shouldn't be allowed to do advertising directed toward young children because TV shouldn't have an influence in their life. Kids should be playing outside and having fun with other children. It is important that they don't get to see too much of the social media and Television "world" so that they can exlore the real world by themselves.

On the other hand they can profit from advertising in a way so that they see what is happening on TV and what is popular at the moment. They would have their own advertising made only for children in their age. Of course it would be fun and pretty intersting for them to see what is going on.

In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed because children in that age are supposed to enjoy their lives in another way than watching TV. I'm pretty sure that they will have enough time to watch a lot of different advertisings when they are older.
