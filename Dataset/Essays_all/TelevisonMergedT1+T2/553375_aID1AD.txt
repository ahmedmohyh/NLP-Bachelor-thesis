There are many pro-arguments for this statement but also a lot of contra-arguments, so its necessary to look at them. Without a doubt, its not good when people watch TV too often, so that they are every minute in front of the screen. Its necessary to controll the amount of time you spend to watch Television. Children aged two to five cant really regulate the time so that they could spend a lot of time in just staring into the screen to watch cartoons. They could become a very bad Televison habit, so when they are older they cant get away of watching TV. The worst case scenario is that the human dont even leave the living room and dont really care about the own health. In the other point of view, its important to watch Television to learn about the technology. We are in the 21. century, so technology is a huge part of our life. a TV is nowadays a basic thing in a house or an apartment. We have to deal with these things because its ussual today. The earlier we learn about these things the better we can handle these kinds of stuff when we are older. There are many kids series whre you can interact with the cartoon caracter, to learn the numbers for example. They can learn a whole bunch of stuff while watching a listening to these programms. In my opinion it Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because I think its important to get in contact with the technology in the earlier years. Like I said, there are many good learning series for kids. But the time should be regulated, so the children dont watch TV too much. I think about a half a hour a day shold be ok.
