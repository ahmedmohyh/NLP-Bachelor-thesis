Today many young children watch television one hour every day. The companys make advertisments since the television came up to the marked to catch more people who buy this things. The companies have seen that children have a big influence in their parents and if the child hava a desire the parents would maby give in. So they began to advetise toward young children. In the TV the children can see a toy that they want to have. With some tricks, the producers of these advertisments can manipulate the clip on TV with some special effects. The children can't make a difference between TV and reality. If they had seen a firestation made with LEGO which looks like the reality, they want to play with this and the parents may give in. In my opinion the children were manipulated only to make profits in the toy industrie. So the advertising should not be allowed or shouldn't have some special effects in it. But I think it's hard forbide the advertisment for children in the reality because there must be a voting about this subject and the companies would influence this votings. They want to earn more money. Maybe it would be better if the parents would talk to their children an show them the specialeffects. So the children could understand how it works in reality. And maybe the parents schouldn't give in so easily. 
But i think that we have other more importaint problems in the world to diskuss and maybe to change than the advertising toward children.
