The statement if Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, is a difficult question because there are some different opinions. 
So it is bad that the young children learn to watch Tv for a long time on a day and maybe they can not be so concentrate in the future. Also they should have friends to play with outside and do not sit in the house and watch Tv for the whole day. In the age between two and five they learn a lot and they should not learn it from the Televison because they have to learn it from their parents or there friends or somebody else and not from the TV. Also it is really realistic that the young children be addicted to watch TV and when they learn it in this age maybe they do nothing else when they are in the age to go to school, so they do not learn for the school or do their homework because they come home and start whatching TV and that is not good for their future. 

But today there are a lot Tv shows that shows something where the children can learn for their future but some TV shows are not good for the children and should only entertain and not tell something for their future. 

So I thing it is not the right way that children should watch TV in the age between two and five the whole day but when they do not do that I thing that is okay. But it is important that children learn to communicate with other people and not sitting home for the whole day. And what the children learn in this time they do their whole life when they do not learn it in another way.
