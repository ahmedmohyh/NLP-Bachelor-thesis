The statement should be more specific about what they want to show in the advertisement. Somehow it can be that parents think that the content is not really appropriate,which makes this statement true. For example the parents don't want that their child gets in touch with something electronic but the kid sees the advertisement and wants it. 
An other argument is that children between two to five want everything they see. So if they see a television advertising, no matter what, they want it immediately and without excuse.For example, it can be hard for the parents if they're in a financial crisis and can't really satisfy the cravings of their child. 
Or when the parents want their child to understand that he/she can't have everything, the advertisement could get a problem. For the parents it's also hard to say no, which makes this whole situation even more complicated.
But when Christmas arrives or the child has it's birthday it can be a advantage because with the advertisement the parents know exactly what they're child wants to have as a present. With that it's much easier for the parents to decide what they finally want to buy. With that the child chooses i'ts own present and at the end no one complains.
At the end everyone has it's own opinion and one could discuss about that but i think it would be better that there's no television advertising directed toward young children because it is better for the children to not know everything about what's available in the stores as well as for the parent'shappines
