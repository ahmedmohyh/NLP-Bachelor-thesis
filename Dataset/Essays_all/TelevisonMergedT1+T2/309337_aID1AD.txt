We're confronted everyday and everywhere with ads. The goal of this ads is to influence us to buy the product. But where isn't it good anymore to influence people?

First, children aged two to five shouldn't watch TV. They are too young to sit in front of a television and too young to understand what they see. When they see an ad with Barbie for example they want a Barbie because they are fascinated from this toy and want it. These ads shouldn't exist because they influence young children who normally want everything what makes sound, moves or is sparkling.
Another reason why televison advertising for young children should not be allowed is because they can't handle all those different ads with thousands of toys. These children can't buy the toys by themself because they don't earn money. It isn't effective to make ads for young children because the parents control what toys they have.

To summarize, ads should only exist to adults because they earn there one money and are able to control how they spend there money. Otherwise the parents have to buy toys for the children because they want it so bad.
All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.
