Nowdays television advertising is very popular and common. The main question about it is if it should be not allowed toward young children. This statement will be discusse in the following arguments.

Firstly, television advertising is dangerous for little children. The are getting a wrong image for example the see a toy which looks very awesome and high quality but in real it is like plastic.

Moreover, childrens want more toy and have more whises for birthday. When they see something very cool in television the want that and they ask their parents allnthe time to get it, so the parents get annoyed and they might want to see the child happy so the buy them the stoff.

A positive aspect is that the economies increase. With television advertising they make a lot of money because the children see what it is to have thistoy and it shows them the fun and plessure and they want the parents to buy these things.

Secondly, they do not waste so much paper. The economies do not use any paper to make television advertising, so it is better for the environment. They do not waste as much as they would do with flyers.

In conclusion, I disagree with the following statement because of the fact that advertising increases our economie.
