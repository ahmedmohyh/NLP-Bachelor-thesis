When I was a kid I loved to watch TV, it was not so important, what i watched, but more that I could watch. And in my experience, I was not the only Children of my generation which have the same story to tell. So, for a Child it is great to watch TV but is it good for them or should it not be allowed.

First I have to say, there are more than one point which I think are important for this topic. One is the sort of programm a Child watch in this age. In the young age of two, the educational progress of a Child is much better than now, because of this fact everything that the Child sees, will have a more or less importance for the Child. So if the Parents would show them a savage shooter, this would be a catastrophe for the young person. But some shows for Childs can be good for the experience.

Furthermore there are some aspects of quantity. To much Tv is not really good and healthy, for every age, especially for childs. So this is the responsibility of the parents and there are sadly some parents which let her childrens sit behind the TV for hours. there are naturally more than one cause for such sceneries like not time or much work or simlpy desinteressting.

Nevertheless it would be difficult to make a law which not allowed Tv advertising sing for young children. Even tough it would be possible to make this rule, it is hard to control such a law. So in my opinion it is not the responsibility of Tv canals to prevent advertising but the parents should look for her Childrens. On the one hand the canals should show less advertising on the other hand is is the renponsibility of the parents.
