I agree completly with that.
In my opinion, children aged two to five shouldn't even watch television. They should play outside and get dirty and wet or I don't know what. But it is a fact, that many children today just watch television and get dumber and dumber in front of the tv. In this age, the brain learns extremly fast and copy everything that it sees. So children in this age are extremely invluable with advertising.
Many advertising managers know that and send specific advertising on networks for children. For example: A producer for toys send a advertising for his new toy on such a channel. A child sees that and bother his parents so long, until he or she has this toy. This is how advertising for children works.
But back to the main point. Children in this age, as said, copy everything what they see and they also didin't have such a strong will like an adult. So they cannot resist against these advertisings. These were all my negatives opinions. 
So now we switch to the positive. I can only figure out one positive argument for that statement and that is the following: Advertising can also be positive for children for example a "smoking is bad" or a "pay attention in the traffic" advertising can be positive for a child. But these advertisings have to be producted by the country, where the child lives and not from a private company who wants to generate success with that advertising. 
So my final conclusion is, that advertising for children is bad. An except is when the advertising is teaching something to the children, what they can use in there everyday life.
To end this essay I want to say: It is also a duty from the parents to look after what their child is watching or what he or she is doing. And parents should also not allowed their child to watch tv more than 2 hours per week. It's better for them to play outside and to connect with the real world.
