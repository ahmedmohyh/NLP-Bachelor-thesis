Should young children aged two to five be exposed to television advertising or not? 
While some think it should not be allowed, I believe that living in a free and economic based country has its cost: Children are confronted with commercial designed in paticularly for them.
I belong to the generation which has seen TV commercials between the kids programm on the TV how it's still nowadays. And I wouldn't think it damaged me in a certain way nor made me want to buy a lot of things for my own pleasure. Yes some time you'd wish you had that "water canon 5000", but you'd already forgot about it before sleeping. In the end it depends on how you were educated by your parents and how you find happiness in things you already have. 
In addition our country is based on free thougts and economic liberty. This leads us to the point where it's difficult to tell, how much of something is still good. Making people buy more things is healthy for the economics and if the economics of a country is well-off so is the population. Today's system is based on the need to buy more and more. If not sustained with buying products, it collapses. So if children see an TV advertising and pressure their parents to buy something, they are supporting this system and helping the economics grow.
Considering both points mentioned above I also want to leave you with a thought. Someone can only learn how to react to attractive and manipulative advertising, when he or she is confronted with it. 
I hope I have given some food for thought and I'd like to leave with the last thought about this topic. See ya later alligator.
