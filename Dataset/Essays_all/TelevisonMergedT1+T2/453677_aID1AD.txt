Nowadays there are many different kinds of  television advertising. They can be very special with many computer effects or just one sentence and every important point is already said. Advertising are mostly directed to adults but there are also advertising which are directed to younger people between the age of two and five. Should it be banned to produce advertising directed toward this young children? 

Since there is being produced a big amount of diffrent toys for children the toys also have to be made public and charming to the potencial buyer. This potencial buyer are parents. But as they are toys for children the advertising are of course directed to children because they have to feel attracted by the toys and not the parents. 

Watching television is nowadays a very big part of a childrens life. Consequently they see a lot of advertising which are showing toys or food or something else what is made for children. In addition it is known that children always want the newest gadgets. However, the children may like or may dislike the product shown in the advertising. But If they like it they are going to ask their parents to buy it for them. So this might could lead to arguing between child and mother or father. 

In conclusion, i have to disagree with this statement. The advertising kind of have to be directed to the children itself. If the advertising are directed to the parents the children would not be that much attracted by the gadgets and maybe they would not even want to possess it.
