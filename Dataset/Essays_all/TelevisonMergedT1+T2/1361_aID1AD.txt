In the foolowing text I will discuss the Statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. 
Children are more likely to be influenced by advertising than adults. And they get to see a lot advertising. It seems like 50 percent of the time there is advertising on telvision. 
Kids that grow up with so much advertising will also show the results when they are adults. So early influenced Children will probably grow up to be very hard conumers. Good for the economy but bad for them. Of course I wont have to be this way, but it is an often used argument on this theme.
Also there is a difference between a kid seeing the newest game on tv to an adult seeing the newest beauty product or something. Kids often want it imidietly. Because it is faster, prettyer or if it only has a new featur, even thou they have something just like this at home. I guess when parents let their children watch tv they know how much advertising their kids will get to see. So you could say it is their decission. But to distract your children completly from watching tv is nowerdays not that easy. 
So if children would get to see less of this advertising, I hope they would not be influenced this much anymore. I dont think advertising toward young children should be completely forbidden. But I think there should be a mark of how much advertising is allowed on television channels directed toward children.
