"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allwowed".
Can you follow this statement ?
In the following text this will be explaned. 
The good things of television is that it could transfare things to children for example they better lern how to speak or learnig motorical things. Also they are seeing new things and lern out of them. They lern how to get along with people or lern to see things in an other way they have sawn them. The parents are happy to have more time to do things without a kid. But television don't have only good things.
Maybe the two to five aged children are sitting to near to the sreen and get problems witch their eyes later on. Children can't know that they have to sit far away and a TV is magic for children so they are going to near. When children have a own tv in theit room and know already how to use it they may get not enough sleep because the screen let the brain thinking that it is day time and they have to stay up and not to go to sleep. After that the kids hadn't enough sleep and can't concentrate. The biggest negative point is, that the children getting influensed from the televiosion and lern things wrong and everyone know things that you have learned wrong are very difficult to lern right afterwards. The children couldn't understand erverthing and interpretate things wrong because they are made for older people and lern wong out of it.
In the end I would say that children should be allowed to watch television but only one hour a day and at a normal day time. This time is a "golden hour" for parents where they can relax or do something without their kid. Also they shouldn't watch erverythink because of brutal things and things that they are understanding wrong. 
If I should answer the statement with yes or no I would say yes.
