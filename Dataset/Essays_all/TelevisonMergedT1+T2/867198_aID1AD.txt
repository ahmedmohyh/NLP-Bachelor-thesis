I disagree to that, beacause if television advertising are forbidden for children, it wouldn't be good for some businesses. 
Businsesses need the television advertising to improve the children to buy the toys. It's not only good for the business also for the parents from the children, because sometimes they have ideas for the children wich toy they should/could buy for christmas.
When the television advertising would be forbidden, many children wouldn't have toys anymore.
One only positive thing about forbid television advertising would be that children would go out ofter. And also they would invent more games that they could play. But thats the only positive thing about that. The rest wouldn't be very good. Inspecial for the business who produce toys. If you imagen when the business had no television advertising, then they can't sell the toys anymore and that would mean that they would have no money. The children also had no fun anymore in their lifes because they can't play with their toys, because they don't have any toys. If you have no business who produces the toys, you can't buy them. Not every child likes to play outside with other childrens. So they have their toys that they play with and when there is no toy means that they can't play with anyone. So this means that they're lonely. 
Television advertising isn't that bad for the children. It's only bad for the parents money, because they have to buy the toys. But the parents loves to see their children laughing and having fun with their new toys. And also when children have their toys they don't annoy the parents, if they're bored.
