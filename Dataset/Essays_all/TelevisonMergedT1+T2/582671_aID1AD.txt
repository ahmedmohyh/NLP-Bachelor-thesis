Advertising on television; Is it really bad for young children?


At first. Does a two year old child need to watch already television shows? Should it not enjoy life out side the house on the fresh air? As older they get, they will watch television shows and advertising. But does advertising works at a such young age? Yes, unfortunately it does. The little children see something awesome they want. But they do not have the money to buy it. So they annoying their parents as long as they buy their child the thing it wants. Television advertising should be forbidden for such young age. It affects the children a lot. When we are young, the world around us has a big influence on us. So maybe when the children are grown up, they still get, what they want. And that is really annoying for the people around that person.

For every minus there is a plus. Sooner or later the children will see advertising in the television. It is better they see it, when they are young. They learn, that we can not have everything we want, and that is a very important aspect in life. The children have stuff to talk about. They can exchange what they saw, and who thinks what is cool. It also helps them to form their identity. They will recognize, what they like, and what not. And when they get something, that is not as it was in the advertising, they learn, that not everthing is like what it seems to be.

All in all, television advertising for young children should not be allowed. The products which are presentet are only half as good as they were presented. A lot of the advertising is made, correctet or idealized by computer. In my opinion, the children shouldn't watch television that long, that they could be advertising in it. They should watch their show and after that they should do something else. Things that have to be advertised are useless, that is an old sentens, and sadly, it is true.
