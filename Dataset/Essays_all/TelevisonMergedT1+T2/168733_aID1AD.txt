Televisions are an amazing thing for young children. They entertain them with colourful, creative pictures and adventurous stories, no matter when, no matter how. A child could spend all day long in front of the TV, staring on the screen. Even when a advertising break interrupts the serie or the movie the children won't take their eyes away from this big black box. So, is television advertising just a genius idea from the capitalistic industries and can it hardly influence the children's grow up? Should advertising not be allowed on the kid's channels?
In my opinion advertising shouldn't be hidden for young children's eyes - it should be forbidden in general. Advertising is like creating illusions of things you have to have for beeing succesfull or cool or whatever. And it works. Especially with young children. They see something fabulous on TV and the months after they won't stop stressing their parents until they get it. And they will get it. 
If you are a father or a mother and you're against TV advertising directed toward young children you just shouldn't allow them to look TV. Seriously, is it better for your kid to stare hours and hours on the screen watching stupid series than watching advertising spots? Make them go outside, discover the world and feel free. Children don't realy need TV's, neither they need advertising. If you get them anything they need - and I speak of love, freedom and peace - they will never be catched of this illusions created by capitalism. 
There's just one way to fight advertising directed toward young children: fight capitalism.
