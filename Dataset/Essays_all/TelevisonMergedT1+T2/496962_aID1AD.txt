Most of the television advertising, which is made for children, has a funny story. The producers want to make their product more interesting for children.  Most of this products are sweets and have a lot of sugar. When the kids see this product in a store they really want it, because in television it seems very tasty. Furthermore parents have problems to tell their kids that they cannot have every funny thing in the store. In television advertising is also a lot of junk. In addiction the children can see the same advertising hundred times a day, when they watch television for a long time. So the advertising can get boring.

On  the other hand kids can see different products. They can think about the different toys and can decide which one they want. So they can tell the parents what theywan for birthday and christmas. Moreover they learn that they cannot have everything and that they have to chose one of the toys. Obvisously it is difficult for kids ignoring every funny advertising and just choosing one thing.

According to me television advertising for children should be alowed. Often it is very funny and the producers spend a lot of time and money for it. The children can see new products. There are also a lot of products that are used outside. So children can see that playing outside in the nature could be nice. Evidently, this is better than hardly watching television the whole day.  When parents do not want that the children want to have everything in the store because of the advertising, they do not let them watch television.
