Should televison advertising directed toward young children not be allowed? This is a question, which is asked for a cupple of years. Now i will give a few arguments for and against televison advertising.

Every advertising can change our life. If they say that beef is bad you can agree and you will try to stop eating beef. In a young age we are really easy to be influenced by advertising or somthing like that. Especially in toy advertising in tv many childreen will say that they want this toy, because the kids, which are playing with this toy, looks very happy and looks that they have a lot of fun. This is an strategy of the big toyfirms. It´s really good for the firms, because they get profit of the young kids, who wants this toy. On the ofter hand it´s relly bad for the parents, because young childreen allways want everything and if the advertising looks really good with a lot of colours, happy kids and maybe toys which are living in the advertising want that. This costs a lot of money for the parents and if the parents say: " No, you won´t get this toy. " the childreen will be very sad. The advertising have to influence the people, who watch it, so for young people it´s extra coloured in pink, green, red... so the firms will get the attention of the young kids. But if the advertising is forbidden the firms have to close and stop producing their products. The most of the firms in the world life from their advertising. Without this advertising, a lot of people won´t know that maybe Hot´Wheels exists. 

I think that the advertising shouldn´t be forbidden, because the most firms lives from the advertising and only with an advertising the firm will get the attention of the kids. So why should it be not allowed ? There is no illegal strategy,
