Advertising in the television is a huge business meanwhile. Today there are so many commercial breaks during a movie or whatever is on TV. This can be very disturbing for the viewers, because of the interruptions. The business though, is getting more power after all. Imagine the broadcaster and companies are even trying to make money with advertisement for young children. Now the question really is, should it be allowed?

Firstly, commercials for young children can be an advantage for adults. They can be very helpful in order to inform parents about new products for young children, such as play toys or diapers. However, children might not really profit out of that. Especially when the grow older and they see such commercials in the television, it is to assume that they want to spend more time on the Tv. The reason for that is that children probably will ask the parents more frequently to go on Tv. Moreover, children also might get euphoric about a special product, which they really want. This may also be very disturbing for parents, because children are trying to persuade the parents to get the product from the company. Thus, this is not a controversial topic were the opionons can be totally splitted.

In order to all those facts I would like to admit, that in my opinion commercials for children are definitely exaggerated. For me this is an absolute reason that advertising has been growing for the past decade and I really do not think that companies need to do that. Children in that range of age are very young. Usually, they are not capable of judging a situation like adults are and this makes it easier for companies to convince children of their products. I think this is very unfair, even rude. It is like making someone weaker and smaller the decision for you. Plus, that the children are always seem cute and that is why an adult is more likely to say yes to the product even if they do not want it and this is rude.
