During your favourite TV show you see a lot of Television advertising. This has a big influence to our consumer behavior. Moreover to children Television advertising has a big influence. Therefore Television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed. 

Television advertising should not be allowed toward children. Children who are aged two to five cannot make a different between something good or something that they do not need. Furthermore you can influence children very well. And that is the point which the Television advertising - maker are using. They are showing advert exactly at the time children are watching Television. I know this at my own experience. Everytime I saw this advert with the pink little unicorn I ran to my parents and ask them if they buy this for me. I wanted this unicorn so much but at this time I got it I played two times with it. Therefore I wanted to say that children in the age of two to five cannot judgde if they need something or not. People who do this advert do not allowed to produce advert directed toward young children. In this case I think Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
But on the other hand advert has a positive influence towards the economy. People will buy more because they know more things to buy. Therefore children are the perfect victims. In this case I think Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed

To sum up I think Television advertising is important for the economy. Nevertheless I think children does not be using as victims for this. You can take a big influence to children. My opinion is that Television advertsising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
