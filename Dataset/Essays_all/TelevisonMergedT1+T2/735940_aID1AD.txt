Young children, aged two to five, are extremely susceptible to manipulation by anything they see, hear, or otherwise perceive. This makes them ideal targets for advertisement experts, because they can easily implant the desire for a product (mostly toys of some sort) in the minds of the young children, who will then most probably go on to nag about this to their parents, eventually annoying them enough to make them pay the toy or whatever the advertisement was for for them. 

On the one hand, this is obviously using a weakness in another human being, which is at least morally undesireble and at most illegal in some regions. Because the chilren are scientifically proven to be so easily manipulated, the advertisement designers specifically target them, not respecting their inability to make proper assessments of any content they see. For example, a four year old child will not be able to tell that a new sort of drink is harmful to them, for example because of high sugar content, and they will only see the "cool" advertisement, maybe with some cute animals or another smartly assembled theme that makes the children admire the product.

On the other hand, incorporating a ban on advertisements on television could not only be perceived as a challenge to freedom of expression, it also plays another important role in economical development. Getting to know the feeling of "desire", wanting to buy something, prepares the children for what they are going to experience in their later lives and is the first step to a new generation of consumers that keep the economy flourishing.

In conclusion, acknowledging the fact that children need to be prepared to be parts of the consuming economy, the abovementioned reasons and concerns about the childrens' mental and physical sanity, strongly hint at the need for stricter regulations or even a ban for advertising directed towards young children.
