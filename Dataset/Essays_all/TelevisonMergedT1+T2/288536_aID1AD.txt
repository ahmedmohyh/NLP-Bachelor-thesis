Advertising is really popular in our civilisation but is it useful to make television advertising directed toward young children? In our life we get confronted with a lot of advertising in all regions of our life. So much that we sometimes don't know what we should belive or which product we should buy. With a lot of things it is useful to start with when children are still young because they learn faster and can learn better than older people but advertising isn't learning so maybe it is to early to confront children with tis topic. Maybe they get confused because of that. And young children don't buy their stuff on their own, so they tell teir parents what they want but the parents are the ones who finally buy it. If children get a big choice they can quickly get confused of it and don't now what they really like. Children don't need thousands of toys and stuff but they need some less that they really like and don't want to give away. To have the most and best things is not everything in the life of a child. Another point is that children get inflooded of their friends, if one of them gets for example a new t-shirt the others alo want one. That is a reason why they sometimes bull each other. I think with advertising this topic won't get better. Also for parents I think it is a disadvantage if their child watches TV and always sees things he or she really wants. Another negative aspect is that children in general shouldn't sit too long in front of the TV and so it is contraproductive to make advertising, what means that they just sit even longer in front of the TV.
In my opinion it is useless and not really positive to make advertising towards young children even if it is for great things.
