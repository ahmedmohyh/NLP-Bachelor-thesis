If we look at it from a companies point of view: They want to sell a product for children aged between two and five of course they want their product to be known, so they do advertising. If the advertising is especially directed toward the children it may have a bigger selling effect because if you explain it in an easy way: child sees it, child likes it, child wants it. Children are easy to manipulate because they are still kind of naive.

Where as if you create an advertising of a product for children but the advertising is directed toward their parents it's much more difficult to convince the parents to buy this product for their children. Because the parents are adults and they often have to see a reason behind the things they buy. So the advertising would have to include way more information and sense.

If we look at it from a parents ponit of view: Maybe they don't want their children to see those advertising because afterwards they would have to hear all day long that their child talking about it.
The parents would maybe like to have the advertising directed toward them because like that they get the information they want and they can afterwards tell their child about it.

But if we now think of the point that it should not be allowed which means that it is forbidden to even create an advertising directed toward children, I would say that's to intense because the child won't take any harm of the advertising. So I think it should be allowed because if a child watches TV, advertising is a huge part of it and maybe the advertising which is especially created for them is the only interesting thing.
