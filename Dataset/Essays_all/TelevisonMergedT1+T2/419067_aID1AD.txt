Television advertising isn't dangerous for the childrens. It can't hurt them and it doesn't destroy their minds. But the question, if it's good when childrens watch advertising is realy important.

Today, most of the families got a television at home and most of the childrens whatch a lot of television. That's already the first problem of todays erea. Instead of plaiing in the garden with their friensds, the childrens are sitting alone in front of the TV. Because of that, there are always more advertising who are directed toward this childrens. Childrens in this age aren't able to understand exactly what the advertising says and that can be a little bit dangerous. If childrens see the adertising for example of a toy, most of the time the want it just because the child in the advertising got it to.

But the childrens in thes ages can't buy something on their own so the parents have to accept it. With this, the parents can control the child and the advertising aren't dangerous anymore.
I don't think that these advertising shouldn't be allowed. I think the only bad thing at telivision advertisings who are directed toward these young childrens is, that they only see the things they don't have and they always wan't more. Maybe the childrens don't notice the cool ting or the toys they already have.
