Many young children are watching TV every day. Now some critics have raised that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. 

An argument for television advertising directed toward young children is that it is not different from an advertisement in a magazine or on a paper. Children get informed about new things which they can play with and with the advertisement they get an idea of what wishes they have for their birthday or for Christmas.
An argument against television advertising for young children is that the concerns use their fantasy and the influence they have on their parents to sell their toys. It is much easier to make a child want to buy something than to influence an adult and the concerns know this, too.
Another argument against is that the concerns use unrealistic figures for their advertising their toys, for example dragons or unicorns. Young children can not know that these figures do not exist because thy are just too young and do not have any life experience. The television advertising could give them a wrong knowledge about the world because they start to believe in dragons, unicorns, witches and many unrealistic figures more.

All in all you can say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist.
