Nowadays many parents allow their children to watch TV. But by watching TV the children might get very lazy and stop communicating with children in their age. They won't  like to go play outside with their friends anymore. What I've experienced is, that when children start watching TV they focus really hard on what happens, and if you try to talk to them they don't even hear you.That's why I think they can really get addicted to it. In those young years it's also possible that because of the TV their eyes can get damaged. 
On the oder side it can also be a good thing. If they watch for example TV in english, even if they don't speak english, they once will start to understand it and can learn english in young years. That might help them a lot when they start to learn english in school. It can also be a good thing for the parents to make themselves calm down. There are a lot of parents which are very stressed because of their children and can't even take a little rest. With letting them watch TV they are able to rest for a little time and start doing things for themselves or housework they weren't able to do during the day.

I think it's important that the parents control the time while their children are watching TV and let them watch it just for example an hour. For me the parents should learn to say no to their children. If the children have to switch the TV off they will probably beg them to let them watch for a longer time, then the parents need to be strict. In my opinion it's also important that they won't allow them to watch TV everyday. 
So that the children like to go outside and learn to communicate with other people, for me it's also important that the parents go out with them. They should spend more time with their children so that they don't have to let them watch TV just because they don't know anything other to do.
