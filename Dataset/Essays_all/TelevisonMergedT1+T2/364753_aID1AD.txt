The advertisings have been increasing over time, not only that they nowadays they are really specific for each mankind. When we talk about TV commercials, their way haven't change much for ages. However one can say that they have also increased. Often there is a 15 minutes commerical break between the TV programms. The commericals target the certain viewer. The question here is, if it's moraly supportable to have advertisments for children between the age of two to five. 

Children around the age of two to five are the most influentable. In their early childhood they are learing to talk, walk and also learing about their surrounding. They don't even know, what is good or bad for that. The law even declaires, that a child only knows to judge situations around the age of eight. That means that the toddlers can't jugde whether a product is good or bad for them. Considering all of these factors, there shouldn't be any advertisments on the childrens channel. But the sad truth is, those childeren are the main target of the big companies. A companies main goal is to have loyal longlasting cunsumers. They simply don't care if the children can decide whether something is good for them or not. The companies know that the children tell their parents about that new toy and they somehow persude their parents to buy it. The families, who can affort them, spoil their children with all these goods.

Concluding, I think the children's channel shouldn't have any commericals, because they aim to manipulate the children. With those advertisment the children face our cosum oriented society and I think they shouldn't have to cope with that. An average child between the age of two and five loses their ability to judge situations, when they are confronted with commericals on a daily basis. Adding to that, not only TV advertising should be banned
