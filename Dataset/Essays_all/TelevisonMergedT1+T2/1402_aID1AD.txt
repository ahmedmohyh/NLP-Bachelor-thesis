It has been often a topic of arguement and it shouldn´t get forgoten. What I´m talking about is the television advertising directed toward young children. Should it be forbidden? Or does it be still allowedd to be shown? Of course there are many different opinions for this topic and I´m going to present some.

In one hand you can definitely say that children of the age of two to five aren´t able to just turn of the TV when any kind of advertising is on it clearly. Also they can not understand wheater they´re getting manipulated by getting shown some toys or any other things kids would like to have. The aspect of the manipulation is clearly one of the strongest argument for the position against this kind of advertising because it isn´t fair to manipulate a kid as a adult person and it doesn´t fit to a morally correct behavior. Also children get more easily influented than adults and this without even noticing it. 
In the other hand you have several aspects for this kind of advertising: For example not only children watch this kind of advertising and with them the parents could get inspirated to buy their children something they really want to have concerning christmas or their birthday maybe. Also it´s more likely that adults watch that kind of advertising because many parents don´t allow their children to watch TV for long, that often and without them being their to check what they´re watching.

To conclude it is important that some kind of advertising is shown in TV because not only adults like to get inspirated by the TV. Also children should have the right to watch TV and get inspirated. But at the same time it should be thought a lot about the advertising directed towards children so that they get inspirated but not manipulated, like some advertisings do manipulate.
