Television is nowadays, like any other social media program, a huge part of our society. There are many shows, films and of course: advertises. We get influenced by them every time we watch TV. And not only we do get influenced, the young children do so too. But is it really right to allow this influence? Should television advertising directed to young children not be allowed?
I personally think, that it should be allowed. Children get influenced in so many ways. Not only by their parents or their teachers, they get influenced by everything they see, might it be a television advertise, an advertise in a magazine or just a simple story they got told. And nobody can stop this, so for me it would not make any sense to not allow TV advertising toward young children. Because of this big influence, especially their parents, adults who can not be manipulated that easy, can raise their children in the way they want, so they can tell the child their opinions to advertises or just not allow the child to watch the advertises or TV in general. Even tough I do not think, children of that age should often be watching television, I think it is a personal decision and up to the childrens parents to do, what they think is the best their kids.
Another reason for me is that people in our society have the right to say, think and publish what they want. I truely believe in this right and because of that I do not see the point in forbidding those avertises.
