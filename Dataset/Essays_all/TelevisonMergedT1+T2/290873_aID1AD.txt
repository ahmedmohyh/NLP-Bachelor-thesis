If you do television advertising d toward young children, they know what televisons are. But children aged two to five schuold go out to play or should play with their parents or brother and sisters.
But if young children know how to watch tv and they know what TV is exactlly, they always want to watch TV instead of playing with others. I think it would be very special if somebody adverts children something.  I think this isn't a very good idea because if children see a publicity which isn't for children in the age of two to five, then they asked what it was and sometimes it isn't the best that they know that. It's really bad beacuse little children  mostly don't understand what the publicity want to say to them. Television advertising can manipulat or distroyed little children.

For the costumer sometimes it's really good to speak to lillte children because they say to their parents that it is a good thing which they schould buy immediatly. Some parents would do that because they want to do everything for their children. Little children want everything when it's now oder wehn it's something specail. 

I think it isn't a good idea because i think it's manipulation. Children should not watch tv often. When a children is watching tv they want to watch the serie oder the film and not the publicity. Sometimes the publicity isn't for little children and then they are very confused about that what they saw. 
I agree with the statment, it shouldn't be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children
