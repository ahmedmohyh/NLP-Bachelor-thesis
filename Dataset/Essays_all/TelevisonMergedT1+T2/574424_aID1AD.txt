Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Televison advertising is a topic over the hole world and so a country, which is on the other side of the world can be in the  television advertising in a coutry, which is thousands of miles away from it. Many people hate television advertising of different reasonds but should it not be allowed to young children?

Many online shopping websites have been in TV advertising and so if they show it to young children, they hope that they would call the parents to show them that they want the toy. So is is good for the shop. Young children would be directed to watch every advertising of them to remember the parents that they want that. So there are also some children songs advertisings, which makes the young children happy and also the parents.
Also there are many movie advertising on the TV and they show them a lot of on a children channel, where there is also for Teenager some series. So if there is a advertising, which has been for Teenager the young children would also see it and this is not very good in some times.

Televison advertising could be a advertising to everything, so i think it depends on the advertising, if it schould be allowed to children or not. So my opinion is if it is a advertising of a friendly children movie or a playsstore the young children could watch it, but when the advertising is about a teenager action movie with war and blood the advertising should not be allowed to young children.
