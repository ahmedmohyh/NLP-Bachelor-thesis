In this text I am going to give my opinion about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (agend two to five)  should not be allowed.". 
First off we need to clear, that children in the age of 2-5 do not or are not allowed to watch television in many homes. In the most families the parent allow them to watch channels that do not advertise and that are specially made for children. That means the switch from one cartoon to another is without advertisments. 
The second thing is, that children are not able to be manipulated from advertisment. If they want toys, they say it not matter where. In the store or if they watch.  television. 
It is usally for children that if the see something they want in the television, they forget it as soon as the advertisement is over. So parents do not have to fear that they will not stop wanting that. 

The third thing is that children in the age of two do not understand the adverts. Adverts that are synchronised are to difficult for children.
 
Thats why I think that there is no need to stop advertising for children because first, most of the children do not even see the adverts and second, they do not get effected by them.
