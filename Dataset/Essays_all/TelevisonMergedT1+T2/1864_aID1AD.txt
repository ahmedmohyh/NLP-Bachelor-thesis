In the following essay I will give you arguments for and against television advertising. It is an controversial theme because it directed toward young children between two and five. 
In the german tv for example are a lot of advertisings for alcohol, cigarettes or even sex websites. And the time when the advertisings are in the tv aren´t at night. The whole long day you can see things like that.                   
These aren´t the right pictures for a young child. As well there are trailer for films or series who are dangerous and children aren´t old enough for films of this types. For example the children see blood and can´t handle with these pictures. They are afraid of this and maybe can´t sleep anymore. 
But it is difficult because young children nearly only watch tv shows for children and there aren´t any advertisings who aren´t for their age. As well it´s possible that they don´t understand the advertisings for alcohol and things like that. So it isn´t a problem that young children watch television advertisings. 
I think the most important point is that young children only watch tv shows for kids so they don´t see any kind of television advertisings who aren´t for their age. So it isn´t necessary not to allow it.
