There are often discussions about the topic television and young children, if they should watch television or not.
I think that it depends on a few things. When you let a two years old child watch TV the whole day, it isn´t good for his or her development, because the child is just inside and it doesn´t meet any other childs. Then the child just learns from the TV series, but not from social contacts. In my opinion as a parent you should set clear rules, when, how long and what your child is allowed to watch TV. Because if not, the child maybe watches some TV shows that aren´t good for his or her age. Also it is important to control a bit how long it watches TV and that it sometimes goes outside to learn also things from the nature and the people around the child. On the other hand it isn´t good to control your child or doesn´t let it watch Tv at all, because then it just learns from the family or friends, which isn´t bad but it should also learn things from television. 
Essaying I would say that you should let them watch TV but with some rules.
