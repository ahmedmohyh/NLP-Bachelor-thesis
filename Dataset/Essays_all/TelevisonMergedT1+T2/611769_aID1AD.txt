I think it depends on the specific situation. It plays a rule what the children are looking at the television. If they are looking ah childrenseries for their ages than it should be allowed to look television, but not to often. 
Every day looking television is to much for their ages but one or time times in the week should be allowed. Because I think it is possible to learn of looking televison, their are many series or movies which have something usefull to leran also for young kids. It should be find a combination between looking television and doing more other things in the free time. Reading or at this age looking books is more important or better than looking the whole time television. But a little bit looking would be possible.

It is okey to looking a little bit television,because for one reason the children have for a little time something to do, the parents can do in the same time other things, they mustn't look really hard of the children. And the children can also learn intressting things and they can see new things, which they wouldn't see without looking television.

It should be something special for the young kids, the parents shouldn't allowed their kids to looking often television. The children should have the feeling that looking television is special and not something you can do every time. 

SO in the end the perfect solution should be that the children are allowed to looking television but only movies or films which are for their ages and they can look only not often television.
