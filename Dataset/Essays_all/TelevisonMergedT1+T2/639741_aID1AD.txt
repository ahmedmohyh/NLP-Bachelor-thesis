To young to be advertised?

Nowadays children, especially young children, are allowed to watch TV longer than the children fourty years ago. That's probably because of the evolution of technology and that every household has one or more TV. Not only the tecnology has evolved but also the whole economy and marketing. So it happens that the stores who sell products for young children make adverts for those. And in which way? With Television.

First off, the children shouldn't be allowed to watch TV that often, it's not good for their health and also not good for their relationships. They rather should go play outside with other children. When they watch TV, they are in another reality, in that age they don't know what's real or not. They get influenced by the adverts and get a fake impression of the world. For exemple if a child sees an advert of a toy animal. If in the advert the toy can fly, the child most likely thinks it will do it in reality. Or they tell the kid that they need this toy and the child believes it because it's naive. It's almost like brainwashing. Otherwise even if they watch TV and see the adverts for a produkt, they can't go by it by themselves. They aren't even allowed, by law, to make a contract like buying stuff. They have to ask their parents. And if they won't by it then the adverts are useless. Another point is, that the child would want the toy and cry to get it. If it doesn't stop and the parents finally get it, this could lead to a spoiled kid. And that is psychologicly not good.

All points considered, the television advertising towards young children is unnecessary, it would be better for the companys to direct the ads towards the parents. The children are to young to know what's good for them. They also shouldn't be influenced in a bad way by television. They are just to young.
