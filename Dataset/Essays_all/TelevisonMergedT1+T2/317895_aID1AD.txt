Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Don`t we all hate it when we`re watching our favourite programm on TV and all of a sudden the show gets interrupted by a loud noise and some strange guys talking about the newest razor as if it was something very very VERY important? I do. and also think we all agree that some channels have way to many of these annoying advertising breaks. I know by now that you shouldn`t believe half of the things they tell you when they try to sell their stuff, but what about little chilren? should they be confronted with all these scenes of children of their age playing with the newest toys?

I remember seeing those girls on TV, wanting to have as much fun as they seemed to have and then begging my parents to get me those same dolls. At that time I didn`t think for one moment that it might be wrong to show me all those advertisments because I kind of liked seeing them (don`t ask me why but I did).
Now I think it could be kind of mean to manipulatelittle kids into thinking they need another barbie doll or the newest playmobil-set, when they probably have more than enough barbies and playmobil ships laying around in their rooms without ever being used. I think we shouldn`t be told to buy more and more stuff from the day we`re born, I would rather see children going out and crafting their own ships and cashiers (which is what i loved to play) and using their imagination because they will never be as satisfied with a piece of wood for a computer as they are at that age. 

So no, advertisement towards small children sho
