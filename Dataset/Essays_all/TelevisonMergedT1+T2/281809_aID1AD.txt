In this essay the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" will be discussed.

Nowadays more kids watch television than ever, therefore it makes sence to direct the advertising towards them. They want to get the things the advertisement is showing and the market would increase, because a lot of parents spoil their children. This would speak for allowing the advertisements. 

But on the other hand there are much more older children, teenagers and adults watching television than kids between two and five wich means that the advertisement should rather be directed towards them. Advertisement for young children is very boring for older people. The number of people watching television could decrease which would be more of a loss than an increase. 

Also often the things that are advertised towards young children are useless and more of a waste of material and energy than a contribution towards the better living of people. It takes time to develope the advertisements and the advertised things and often little kids can not understand what the advertisements are saying. Television advertising towards young children should therefore be forbidden. 

Another argument for this is, that little kids should not be watching television. They should experience the nature and the live outside the house. They should craft and draw and increase their ability to make fine, little things. In the future that will help them more than sitting in front of the TV all the time. 

I think television advertising should be forbidden, because of the arguments listed above. I think the advertising company would not benefit from the young children as much as they would by investing the time, money and energy in advertisements for older people.
