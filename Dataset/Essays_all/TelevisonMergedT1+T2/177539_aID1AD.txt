When you turn on your television nowadays you more often are confronted with ads that advertise especially toys for children even under the age of six. Are those ads really necessary and are little children already allowed to watch so much TV that there should be ads for them. I think that it is not important to show ads on the television for children under the age of six.

Firts of all I think that those ads should not be allowed because it would only encourage young children to watch more TV. Children at the age of two aren't even able to understand what the television wants to tell them.

Secondly because it is a waste of time for little children to watch more TV I think it is not necessary to show ads on television that espeecially are for pre school children.

On the other hand when parents of young children at any time can't spend time with their kids the parents just put them in front of the TV so that they are entertaint. And so that the parents are left in peace and can do what they have to do and if those children are watching a channel in which they show ads directed toward children with their age they are more likely to like what they are watching. Also to put a child in front of the TV is another way to learn the language and for the parents to teach them the language without talking to them.

In conclusion my opinioin is that advertising directed toward young children shouln't be allowed because children under the age of six shouldn't anyway be watching TV so often that there should be ads specialised for them.
