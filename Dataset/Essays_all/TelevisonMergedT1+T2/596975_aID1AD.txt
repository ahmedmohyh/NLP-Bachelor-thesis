Television advertising

Advertising is seen everywhere on the streets, on plackates, it is heared in the radio or read in a magazine or newspaper, finally is is also seen in the televison or in the cinema. 

Companies are showing their mostly new product to get some more popularity and get more people to buy it. New trailers of a film which is coming soon in the cinema are often shown in advertising breaks of films which are on the tele. This is clever in reason of many people see this advert and the scale of people going to see it will be higher. 
Therefore will the company and the producer of the film earn more money and on top of that become more popular. 
Young childeren like to watch television and therefore are children films often more fully booked. By advertising a trailer in break time of a film more children get to see it and are therefore more likely to go to the cinema.

What happend to childeren if the shown trailer isn't age right or in the shown adverise are scenes shown which should not be watched of a young child. Childeren can develope a fear of scary trailers. In reason of that they think of it the whole day and cannot even go to bed because of their nightmears. As well as it is boring for childerne to watch in between their childeren programm advertise for grown up people.

In conclusion a companie is advertising to get more popular and is shown their new product. If a trailer is for young childeren in aged two to five a cinema trip can be  glad idea for the whole family. If, though, a trailer is shown which isn't for that specificly age the children can develope a fear and kind of a trazma because of their naivity.
Finally I have to mantion I think advertising hase their pro in topics of show people new products they can make use. Otherwise I have to say that childeren directed the advertising has to have a limite especially on childeren canals on televisions.
