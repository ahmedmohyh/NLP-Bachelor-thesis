(Just to clear up how I understood the statement: It's about children watching the commercials and not commercials about things for children.)

Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

No television advertising for young children

Why would a toddler be intrested in televison advertising? And why would it even matter to them?
To start off, I disagree with the statement. Why? - well first of all I don't think children aged from two to five watch television. And if that isn't true then they do certanly not watch the advertising parts. I litterlay can't see a single reason why a company or a firm would do a commercial for children that age, because I don't think it would matter to the children. So basicly only the parents of these young children would see it, and if the advert was designed for children it isn't going to intrest the parents either. But on the other hand if I'm understanding the statement wrong I am extremly sorry for the person who has to understand what I'm saying.
Summing up I can only disagree with the statement. If I think about my own childhood, of course I can't remember back to when I was two, but even when I was five I for sure never watched TV , the only thing was DVD's and things like that, where their wouldn't be any television advertising included. And even if I'm remembering that wrong again, that proves even more that it didn't influence me as a child so there isn't anything wrong with television advertising directed toward young children.
