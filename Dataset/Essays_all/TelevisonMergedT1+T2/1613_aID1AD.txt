A normal saturday evening. A family is watching a film on TV. The film is often interrupted by advertising. There is advertising for almost all you can buy. The children are interested in short advertising films about toys. They would love to get the pink barbie or the toy cars to christmas.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?

First of all, young children are influenced by advertising more than older ones. They can not realize that the promises made in TV does not become true. So if the barbies speak or the cars drive of her own. Maybe there are disappointed in the presents they wanted to get but now they are boring.
I guess there is no advertising directed to children that influences their live in an bad way.
So why should it be forbidden? I think young children watche TV chanels like KiKa and I did not remember they show advertising. 
Of course parents have to control what their children are watching. But I think the advertising that is directed toward young children is not a risk for them.
