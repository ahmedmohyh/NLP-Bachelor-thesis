Television for young children

In this essay I will explain some reasons why young children should not be allowed to watch television an at the end my personally opinion to this important subject.


Nowadays a lot of children, aged two to five, often watch a film with their family in their young life and waste a lot of time with movies or series. They can also go out and play with their friends or do something else but not watching television. It is not good for the brain generally. The concentration will not be there in the school too. This can lead that young children can not get good marks, so their future will be in danger. A very worse time is coming to them! Antother reason is that this kids do not have the motivation to do their homeworks, make new friendships or even help their mother to do the household chores. 

However, I find that children should not be allowed to watch television in their young life. Although I have also wasted a lot of time when I was young. My parents did not take care of me and thought that the television was good for children. They let me always to do my own thing what was definitely a fault! I learned for my life that the television is abad idea for young children and I would never to the same thing to my kids in future. I want that my kids should have good marks and study for themselves, and not ruin their life with television.
