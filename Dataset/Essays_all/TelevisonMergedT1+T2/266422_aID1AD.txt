I dare say that it nowadays it is quite normal to watch TV. It indeed is a source of entertainment, but the frequent advertisement can be extremely annoying. But event worse: It has been claimed that viewers can be unconsciously influencned by this and that it can be harmful for children. Thus, discussions are led to find out whether children should be allowed to watch television or not. 

Recent studies have revealed that people who watch advertisements tend to buy the products which they have seen before rather than other products. By streaming the advertisement on television over and over again, viewers might build up an unattended relationship with the product, even though they would not have done this if they didn't watch these advertisements. Especially younger children are not able to resist that temptation. 
On the other hand, people still should receive information about newer products. It is the parents who are responsible for their children, and they should not give them everything that they want, or that they have seen on TV. 

Also, it is claimed that children are more risked to become addicted than grown ups. As they watch more TV, they will therefore be more confronted with advertisement that is directed towards them. On the other hand, children sometimes adore to watch the advertisements, as they also want to know what's on the market. So actually they do want to watch the advertisement, they aren't forced to watch it. 

My concluding view is that children indeed can be influenced quicker than older peopole. Therefore, advertisment directed towards them should be regulated, without being totally forbidden. Even more important is that the parents are aware of that their kids can be influenced. They should not allow their children to watch TV literally all the time, they are responsible to dose the duration healthily.
