Who doesn't know the moment, when you turn your TV on in the early morning to watch something. I always notice, that there aro so many different channels with TV series for little kids. Sometimes I ask myself, why should young children already be allowed to watch TV in such an early age? 

I think Television advertising toward young children is something good. There are so many things that they can learn just from seeing it visual on the TV. But of course, there is no garanty that these kids can learn from it, because they are just to young to understand some things happening there in these series. It is possible that all they see are some pretty coloured characters that are doing something, without getting the message they want to give these children. Still I think kids may improve some cognitions like being helpfull to other people or how to face different problems in some situations with watching television. 
We all know that young kids are difficult to handle when they wake up in the morning. They cry a lot and are in a bad mood. Therefore it is a good thing that it has specific TV shows for kids in the morning. It is a great benefit fot mothers. While the kid is calming down with funny stories for children in the Television, the mother can do other work and finish things, like household chores. It can save so much time for her.  

Of coruse TV can be harmfull for kids, not only for its health, but also for its social life. It is possible that instead of going outside in the nature to play games and be with other children, all they want to do is to watch their favourite TV shows. Still I think that these series are something good, because I experienced it myself with my little sister. She learned so many things from it. These TV shows are directed towards young children, so you can be shure that everything that is going on there, is made for their age.
