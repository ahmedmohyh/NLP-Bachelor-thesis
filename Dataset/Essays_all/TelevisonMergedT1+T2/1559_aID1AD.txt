In my opinion the advertising toward young children from the age two to five should not be allowed.
The children in this age dont understand any of this commercials  and are not able to examine them in a proper way.
If the advertising is about a game or something to play with, the kids will only want this things and will maybe start to cry (age two) because they dont know how to tell their parents what they want.
For children in the age of five it is not that difficult, they already can explain their thoughts to their parents and can tell them that they want to have a new toy.
Another reason is that children in the age of two are not able to analyse visual things because they are not smart enough.
Because I dont see any positive points of advertising toward young children anymore I am going to list some more negative points.
Children will start to compare with their friends what they have and what they dont have, so a competition between the children starts and they are going to start to stress their parents till they get what they want. Another point is that children dont know whent it is enough so they will want more and more toys because the commercial is build up like that so the parents buy more and more to satisfy theri children
In the end I am still following the statement.
I hope you understand my point of view.
