Electronic rules the world. More and More people are connected to electronic stuff such as the mobile phone and television and can't live without it anymore. By now children, aged two to five, are on the television every day a couple of hours. But should we really allow television advertising toward young children, aged two to five? 


There are a couple of reasons why this shouldn't be allowed. For example it is proofed that through too much television people can get dumber, because they forget to do important things like reading or learning and thi is a problem. 
The most Important argument is, tht these yong children don't need this yet. childhood is a time where you go out with friend and have fun and play ball or something else. Not about staying at home all day long watching television. Childhood is an awesome time so don't take this away from your kids!

On the other side television can improof your brain in a good way. Through television kids have more ideas how to do something and it can also improve their knowledge, depending on what they are watching. Galileo for example always shows very good stuff and you can really learn from this.


My personal opinion it's, that kids that age should be allowed to watch television but not more than half n hour per day. Maybe one hour on the weekend. I think it is important that those kids need to learn first how to grow up without this stuff. Electronic stuff will come into their lifes early enough so let them enjoy their chilhood without electronic stuff such as television.
