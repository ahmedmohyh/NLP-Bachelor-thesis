Children that are two to five years old, often decide things they want by looking. Many companies that sell products for young children, advertise their products on many media platforms. But the most popular platform is the television. Many children are allowed to watch an episode of children program for example Teletubbies or Dora the explorer. Inbetween the program the television company often show advertisements for games or other things that young children like.
 
If these companies would not advertise their products, the market for toys would breakdown. Let me illustrate this point. A young boy saw a LEGO product in an advertisement. Now this young boy wants this Lego toy because the advertisements attracted him. What the boy then does, is to ask the parents if he could have this toy. As many parents only wnat the best for their children, they buy everything the child wants. This means that they spend a lot of money. As a result of this the parents support the economy in the country they live in.

A second point is that young children get used to the money system that exists in the whole world. It starts to realise that you need to have money to buy things. This means that the child learns how to use money.

All in all I disagree with the statement that was mentioned above because with advertisements children and their parents support the local economy. The children also learn how to use money which is very helpful once they are older.
