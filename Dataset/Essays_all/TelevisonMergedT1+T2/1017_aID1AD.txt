In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.

In my mind it is not a question of the age of the children, because i think that television is not good for anybody, but I think everybody has to chose for his self, because it is his or her life and not the life of the anyone else. So I think, that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a Television.
The children hast  to learn about the politics and know what is beeing in the world, but kids under five years would not be interested of the politics and the other things to learn in the Television, so the films and series for kids have to be kontrolled by the parents. So they can not whatch films and series, which are not allowed for them. 
The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.
It is a part of the the youth of many kids, they not have to have a Television to have a good youth, because if the parents spend time for their children, they can also have fun without an own tv. So if the parents dont want to allow a TV for the childs, they have to soend time for them.
But if the parents can say stop if the child whatched to much TV or watch movies and serier, which are not allowed to whatch for a child in  his age, then I think the Child should be allowed to have or watch TV. 

To sum up, I am against this toward, because not every parents have time to spend time for his or her children and the Tv is a good alternative to entertain the children. So every parents had to chose for his own child and also for themself.
