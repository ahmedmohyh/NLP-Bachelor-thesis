Television is good for learning things. You can learn many things from the television but it matter whitch tv programm you are looking at it. There are some tv programms which are good for learning things like galileo. But there are also other series like Köln 50667 which aren't that good for the kids because they have many problems in this series. When they look series like this after they think this is normal what they are doing in this series.     I think that young children shouldn't look television. They should learn things from looking at the real life and outdoor in the nature. It's important to be in the nature with children because the sun and the air of the nature is very good for their health. In young age you learn many things from looking at something. I think it's better that the children learn from their own mother or father and not from the television because the parents of the kids can controll the things that they are making and in the television they can't. 

So today it's easyier to show the children tv programms then going out in the nature with them. When you want to go out with the children it needs more time and today some parents haven't enough time for that. So they show them the tv programm and haven't to be next to their kids and looking for them.
