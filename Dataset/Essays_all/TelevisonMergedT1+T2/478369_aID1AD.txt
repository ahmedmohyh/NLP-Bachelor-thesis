Should televison advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?

The statement is not easy to comment because there are many reasons for and against television advertising. In the moment I can't say if I'm agree or disagree with the statement. In my childhood I hadn't watch television for a long time in the day. My siblings and I played together in the garden. We played with things in the natur.

At first I will give you some reasons for television advertising directed toward young children. With television advertising children learn the new things in the world. They see what it gives for new plays and they can make some specific wishes for birthday or christmas. The parents can use this wishes as a little present if the children were nice and help in the household. 
But they are also some reasons against television advertising. Children had a bad environement and to many wishes. They will have everything new and it is very hard to say "No!" to lovely big eyes from your kid. Children need to play in the natur with some things from the natur. It is important that children learn to play alone without the new plays. 

I think young children aged two or five should not be directed by television advertising. It isn't good for them. They need to life without television and other electronic machines. Advertising is all over the world and they don't need some more advertising in the television.
