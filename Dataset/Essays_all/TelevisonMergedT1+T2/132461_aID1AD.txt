English essay

I think for that statement is the question: "Is it dangerous for childern to watch TV?" very importent. Im not quite sure about the answer, but i heard, that it was never prouved that watching TV is dangerous for anyone. So thats an argument against the statement. But I think for children at that age it is importent to go outside and play some games and talk to other kids. In this age kids learn so many things form the olther people, e.g. speaking. So the contact to the nature and other humans is very importent and I think when children are used to watch TV the hole day, they lose that contact. So that's an argument for the statement. When we're talking about learn how to speak, it's also important to say that sometimes the parents can't speake the languge they speak in that country where they are living. So the TV can be very helpful to learn things. And sometimes the TV has like TV-showes for children to leran specific things.
So thats a good thing about watching TV in that age. 
So my opinion is that it's ok to watch Television. I Think it should'nt be not allowed, because I think each parent should can think about that "problem" on their own. And as long as kids won't be addicted to the TV is it totaly ok to watch their shows.
