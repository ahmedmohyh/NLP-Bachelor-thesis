When it comes to raising kids, the opinions drift apart. In this time watching television is on the daily schedule of almost every little child. 
Advertising directed to kids leads them to beg for it. It makes them wanting all those shiny and funny things from the advertisment. The people who pay for it are of course not the kids but the parents. That intention itself makes the company that sends out the promotion very unsympathic. 
So in the family that kind of advertisment causes riots from the kids.
If we have a look at this from the side of the company, then the whole thing looks very different and clever. I mean who wouldn't buy a toy for its kid if they can affort it easily and make their kid so much happier with it? Another question would be if exactly this behaviour leads our culture in a society of consume and non stop needs of material things. Because they may cause happiness for a really short moment, but lasting happiness is a state of mind.
In conclusion I think that advertising directed toward kids is an effective strategie for the company, but from a social point of view very unhealthy for our future society and the consume behaviour of the kids.
