Television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Nearly every family posseds a television and in most cases it`s a everyday use to watch television.Young and Old, all of them like to spent their time with watching films and series. But shuld young children should be comfrontated with this virtual world?

Thirst it must been said that the Tv has becomes an important role in our life. In the job, at school at home we can`t think about a life without a television. So why shouldn`t learn little childs to handel with this gadget in her early years? Then they haven`t to learn it when they`re older and they`re prepared.

Secondly, Television can be a kind of education. When childs watchts some interresting documentarys or learn to count that way, I thin Television makes a great job.

Also an important argument when the parents want to do something in the houshold like cooking, cleanig, etc. they can`t play with their kids. In that moment the kids get on the  parents nevers because they will cry and scream beauce of boringness. The it is an easy option to switch the Tv on, so the child has something to do and the parents can do their work.

On the other hand we have the danger of the Television. There`s a lot of rubish whitch young childs can watch there like dangerous horror films, pornografie or so on. In the worst case childs become psychical problem from this and can`t sleep at night.

Another argument is that the TV coveres the real world. For childs it is better to invent the word not on Tv. They should go outside and play there with other kids to become friends. Also they have to play in the wood or in the mud to come in contact with the natur.

My conclusion is that childs should be confrontated with the Television but controlled. It should be an mixture
