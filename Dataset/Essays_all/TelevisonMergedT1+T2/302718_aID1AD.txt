Should television adverstising directed toward young children be allowed? Our generation will be confronted with questions like these more and more with the technical improvement we succes nowadays. Nearly everybody's got a television at home and use it regularly. So questions about the themes and adverts which are shown in the TV have to be critically analysed. Could it be dangerous for children if they get influenced by advertises? Or are there other reasons beside the developement of the child why this could be dangerous or just inacceptable? 

At first, it is hard to define which adverts are directed to children an which not. How do you really want to define this? 

A child in the age of two to five is in his full developement. At this time it is able to learn much and consume informations on mass without the ability to question everything. Big concerns can use this weakness by manipulating children with specific techniques. 

On the other hand it would be great for the economy. Making children run to their parents and screaming with the wish of getting this unbelievable great softdrink from the advertise will certainly get some parents weak. 

Using childrens dumbness to make as much money as you can is inhuman, isn't it? Television advertising directed to children should be strictly forbidden, but how do you want do define which adverts are directed to children an which aren't?
