In my opinion the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is right. There are many different arguements supporting but also some against my opinion. 
One could say, it is nice for the children to have adverts made for them. But considering that advertising is very influencial it does not seem to be a positive aspect for it is known, that young children can be influenced very easily for they do not have developed an own opinion yet. 
On the one hand young children would get bored if there was not advertising fitting their age. On the other hand parents will think, they can leave their child in front of the tv even better, because it will be busy watching tv and would not annoy during the advertising break either. 
But still it seems wrong to me to make parents let their child watch televison without feeling bad about it. Because children that young should not weatch tv. Which other people think as well. That is why there are only few children watching tv. And because of that it is not nessicary to make special adverts directed to them.
Furthermore it does not really make sense because children can not buy anything on their own and advertising directed toward children will not make their parents want to buy the product. 

To make my point clear: I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. First because mostly older people watch tv so there is no need to make adverts for young children and second because it would only make parents think it is okay to let their baby watch tv, when there is even advertising for them.
