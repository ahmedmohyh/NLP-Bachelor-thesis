In the past years, Tv advertising has become more and more specific. The companies gained a feeling of how to get us to by and use their products. And most of the times, the statemetns in the commercials aren't completely true. The companies are moving a little bit sneaky, because sometimes they write critical informations extremly tiny at the bottom of the screen and it's easy to get fooled. So should there be a policy that blocks them form directing der advertisement toward young children ?

Children at the age of five arn't able to buy things without the promission of their parents, so if they get affected by a advetisement, their parents are the ones that decide what happens. So it doesn't matter if there are ads of kids. 
On the other hand. A lot of children learn to "control" there parents. So if they don't get a toy they, start to get angry or cry. Now it is up to the parent, if they either by the toy or solve the problem in an other way.

All companies now that children are out of money, so they are sure that the kids convince their parents to buy stuff. An there is a developement happening. Many children don't use their imagination that often. Thy only use toys premade for them. I used to make my own toys with my brothers and sisters. 
If you take a second look you notice, that companies are crual and want children to manipulate their parents. And in a way they start to make the children depend on them. Because when the kids are growns ups, they learned to always buy new stuff and they will maybe keep that behaviour for a long period of time. 

In my opinion, it's a good idea to make a policy against ads for kids. I think that companies will only loose a small amount of costumers, because the adults buy all the products and not the children. But that policy isn't that important, because it's the parents job to look after their kids.
