Television advertising is very known to young children because they often enjoy watching it regularly. On TV shows especially made for children, there are lots of ads which show new toys that seem often very appealing to them.

I remember that back in my childhood days, i would love to watch tv and seeing these adverts made me want to have that new toy immediatly. I would run to my mother and ask her to buy it for me without giving much thought about it since i am just a child who wants everything nice it sees. Because of this many children fight with their parents because they do not get what they want. This leads to both parties geting angry and sad. Moments like these, when a child does not get the toy it wants and in the  worst case get his or her heart broken over this, are very critic situations for a family. Additionally, parents can`t always afford the expensive toys their children want and start to feel bad about themselves because they cannot fullfill their childrens wishes. Furthermore, children are so quick to decide what they want and what they do not want which leads to them often wanting unnessecary toys.

Because of all these arguments listed above, I come to the conclusion that advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. They do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily.
