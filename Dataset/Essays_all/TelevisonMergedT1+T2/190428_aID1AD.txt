People have to earn money and how should people get to know something without advertisements? Not, so they're necessary. Young children can't defend theirself from getting affected and they can get influenced by television advertising and not everything is good for them. If people take the service of letting their children watch TV and not have to pay attention to them they have to pay the price for it with children asking to get the stuff from the advertisements. Young children shouldn't get intouch with comertionals that early because they can't understand that this is manipulative. It's a good selling stragety because parents will buy the articls for the children so the keep quite and stop asking for it. 
I don't agree with this statement because if people take the luxury of letting their children watch a lot television awith this young age the parents have to give something back and in this case its the advertisements. Because I don't think they have very big longlasting consequenses, so it's not realy unheathy for them. I think it's mostly just annoying for their parents but on my point of view it's most od the time their own fault.
