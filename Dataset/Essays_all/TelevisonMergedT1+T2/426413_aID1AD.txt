To the question about telivison advertising for little children, I thinkt there are two sides. But for me there are more arguments against, than for it. 
On one hand children in this age don't know anything about money and how to earn it. So they could spend a fortun in toys and stuff whitout knowing its value, or how much money they wasted. But on the other side the children could see their dream toy. They could save their money till they get this toy. That could be the positive side. But there is the point, that children are very easy manipulated. It doesn't take very much to make a kid think "that toy is the best thing, that will ever happen to me" so they need to buy it. As a fact; televison advertising is more evective on every human, incloudet adults, becouse it doesn't only affects on the sense of seeing. Even greater is the affect on young childeren. Televioson advertising is dangerous, thats also the reason why ads of zigarrets is forbidden. A new argumen against it is, that if children want something, they get it. They cry until her mom buys her everithing. They just look cute and they now all the triks to get their wish come true.
All together: I think that shouldn't be allowed, becouse this type of advertising can make you buy nearly anything. I mean how haven't spend to much money on much to expensive pokemon cards, or other overselled toys, which were never be used anyway.
