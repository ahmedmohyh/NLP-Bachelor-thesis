It is friday night. You want to watch your favourite movie on TV. While your watching there are the normal pause with advertisement. You will not pay attention to it. But a child aged two to five will pay attention and maybe want it. Should because of that television advertising directed to toward young children not be allowed?

Firstly, you can influence children very simply. If they watch an advertisement and they like it, they want to have it. And afterwards they will beg their parents to buy it. Maybe they will go on their own an will buy it. Young children are creative and they will find a way to get it. Even if they have to buy it on the blackmarket. Secondly you can brainwash the children for your own reason so they support you and you will rise and be the emperor of the hole world.

On the other hand you should not allow your child to watch TV. They should stay outside and play with other children. It is important for their social life. If they are allowed to watch TV, the parents have to be aware of that the child want something and they must be able to say "no". This is an important process in the life that you learn you can not have everything you want. An other reason is that the broadcaster need the money from advertisement. There are only a few which get paid from the governement like SRF. You can not only have advertisment in the evening. Only you would like to have two hours ads in a 90 minute movie.

Because of the reasons I told I think advertisement directed towards children schould be allowed. It is in the hand of the parents that their child learn their life lessons early.
