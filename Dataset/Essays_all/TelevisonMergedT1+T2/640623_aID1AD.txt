Nowerdays many people spend hours in front of their television. We might not even realise how many commercials we see in a day. But what about young children aged between two to five? What do they take out of those advertisements? In this essay I will inform you about the adventages and disadvantages of advertising directed toward young children.

At first I think that the parents have to decide how much time their cildren are allowed to spend in front of the television. If they do not want them to watch advertisements all the time, they should not allow them to watch TV. But that might sound easier than it is.

On the one hand it is a good way for young children to see what is possible nowerdays. They will get confronted with high technical things they did not know they would exist. 

On the other hand they should learn and see that by discovering it in real life. And who says they have to know that high technical computer games like this exist? They will have enough time to learn about computers and high technic when they are older.

Beside that, children aged between two to five do not know that there are more important things in life. TV the games look like they are so important in life but they can not make differences. They do not know that most of the commercials are so unnecessairly and sometimes stupid. 

In my opinion children this young should not be distracted by unessential things like that. They are not capable to differentiate the importance of things in life because they do not have the exprience they need.
