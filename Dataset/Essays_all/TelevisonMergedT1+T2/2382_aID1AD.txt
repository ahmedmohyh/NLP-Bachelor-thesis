The discussion about television advertisment directed towards two to five year old children was already held multiple times, but it's still a hot topic.

One the on hand is the fact that – especially young – childern are easier to manipulate than adults. If children get in touch with advertisment in young years their personality development will be strongly influenced by the values shown in the television advertisments. The problem here is that those values are selected to sell as much as possible, not to secure a well personality development in most people's eyes.
One the other hand there is the right for every one to advertise his products. If this right is not granted for sellers of e.g. kids toys it will put them into a disadvantage. And young children are not the only group wich is easy to manipulate.

The question if such advertisment should be forbidden is worth asking, but if such a restriction is made other questions have to be ask as well.
