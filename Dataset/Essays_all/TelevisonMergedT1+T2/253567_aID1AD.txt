In my opinion, there shouldn`t be any restrictions in this regard. Parents should decide themselves what they expose their children to. Besides, which child at the age of two is gonna be influenced by a commercial? It doesn`t even understand it. Therefore, the person that is being targeted is the parent. So i don`t see the difference between this and advertising directed towards adults. The child isn`t going to be the person that buys the product anyway. 

Furthermore, young children are as easily manipulated as teenagers. It would be consistent to ban adverts in general. Let people think what they want to think. Don`t over-commercialize every piece of media that gets in your hands. Television was only the beginning. 

To summarize my points, i think that there is no difference between adverts directed to young children and ones who are directed towards older people. Allow nothing or allow everything.
