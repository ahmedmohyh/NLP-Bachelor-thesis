A controversal topic nowadays is television advertising. Some people think, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed. In the following I will comment on that topic. 
Firstly you can say, that these advertisments, towards young chilren, offer the producer a bigger frame of costumers. Often advertisments are directed towards adults or teens, so that they buy certain products, but also if an advertisment does not catch an adults or teens attention, a young child can influence their parents to be interested in that special product, so that they look at it again.
Furthermore especially young children are easy to influence and so they believe everything said in the advertisment. They do not have as many life experience as their older siblings or parents and so they believe especially people, who seem trustful, alot and when it is a good advertisment they can get influenced by it very much.
Young children at the age from two to five should not be allowed to watch television or television advertesments. In the age of two to five they should play outside with friends. They should not sit inside and watch television alot, perhaps in the evenings, the children program, but there are no advertisments in these special shows for young children.Television advertisement can influence their personalities in wanting everything. Young children, who watch much television or television advertisments can get badly influenced by these, because they often tell you, that you should definitly buy the product and so their character can get influenced in wanting everything.
To sum it all up, I would say, that these television advertisments towards young children should not be allowed, in the reason, that it could influience their life in a bad way, and noone wants that for their child.
