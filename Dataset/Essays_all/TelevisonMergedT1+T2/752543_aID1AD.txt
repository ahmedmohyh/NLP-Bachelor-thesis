I think, that it should not  be allowed. So I'm with the statement. Today the people are using social media very often. This includes for example: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube. On every media advertising is normal. So we are all confrontated with it. You even can't walk through a railway station without seeing some advertising. We even don't notice them anymore.
When I am watching TV, I don't want to watch the advertising all the time. With my TV programm, i can skip the advertising because it is so enoying. Well, a five years old child do not manage to skip the advertising. So they are confrontated with it every 15 minutes and those advertising are like 10 minutes long. I also think that the series the children of today are watching is not as very informational, funny and interessting as the series I have watched when I was a child. I also think the advertisings are coming more in the TV today than when I was a child. When I was a child I only watched TV once a week. I Think that the children of today are watching TV to often. I am shocked, when I see how much of them have a smartphone. I even became a smartphone when I was 12.
Because of all this things  I have the oppinion that television advertising should not be allowed to young children.
