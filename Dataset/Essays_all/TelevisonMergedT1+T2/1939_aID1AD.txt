"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." 
This is a very contoversal statement, which was already uttered by many politicians. 
In the followings lines you would find an opinion on this statement.
Firstly you must say that every person, no matter who or which age is confronted with advertising in everyday life.
Either the advertising in newspapers or the advertising on the street, you are not able to stop the contact with any kind of advertising. It´s a very difficult issue. For example why should be advertsing for people at the age of six  allowed? It´s proofed that children of that age are able to keep the external information they get from parents or somebody else in  mind. 
In my opinion it´s a fact that advertisings have the task to influence the public opinion for higher sells in the economy, so why should that not be allowed because the kids get informed by their friends about new toys or something like that as well. For me it´s difficult to set a frame of the age for allowed advertising.
To come to a conclusion I would disagree with this statement because you can not hide advertising. 
If parents are against this they should be able to forbid to much television in general. 

Thank you for reading my essay about this exiting statement.
