Television advertising directed toward  young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

I will try to find my opinion to this difficult and hard statement in our modern world.

 When I was younger at the age two to five I watched not so much televison or just a short time. my parents said that the telvison is bad for my brain so I paint many pictures and played the whole time with my toys. My best friend watched the whole day televison becouse his parents had no time for him so they allowed him that. I was always jeallous but I think I had more fun then him. It is always so that you want something what you can`t get.
today I think it` s more difficult to don`t allowed the children that they can`t watch televison becouse our world is really modern and in every house are many electronic. For example my family have got 4 mobile phones; 4 computer; 2 tablets and 3 tv`s. This is a example for our modern world you can`t say to a child who grow up with so much electronic that he can`t watch television. When I was younger and my parents went out they always took the tv stick (Fernbedienung) with them so I can`t watch tv. And if I watched tv  my parents I always take care that I watch just the films for my age.

So my opinion is to this statement that children who are in the age of two to five can watch tv but they can just watch for a short time and the parents have to take care of them that they can`t watch any film above there age.
