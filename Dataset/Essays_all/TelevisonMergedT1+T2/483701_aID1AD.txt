To start things of I think these adverts shouldn't be allowed. Children at this age are easily influenced and it can make raising a child even harder if it is constantly exposed to "all the cool new stuff that you definitely need".  Imagine if a family wants to raise their child without the use of modern technology or keeping it to a minimum. Now they're watching a childrens movie that's beeing aired on television. If there suddenly pops up an advertisemet which talks about a superb new laptop for children, the kid would, naturally, want it. And now try to explain to your child that these things are completely annoying, useless and a waste of money. I don't think that it would help. 

On the other hand, it can help if you want these kind of products for your kid. Picking out a gift for a small child can be extremly hard to do. It would be that much easier if you knew what the kid wants because it saw it in an advert and told you that it wants it.

All in all I suppose it's really about the amount of advert and what is advertised. You could probably accept it if a new flavour of ice cream is advertised or the brand new Hello Kitty school bag is presented. But as I've said, all the computers, smartphones and tablets for children are just awful and can destroy a kid's early life. So based on all I've said now, there would have to be a ban on a specific kind of advert. The problem is that the modern day capitalism wouldn't allow to give an unfair disadvantage to a part of the market.
