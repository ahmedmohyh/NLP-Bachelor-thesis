Essay-Should television advertising directed toward young children no longer be allowed?

Firtst of all lets discus what are television advertises directed toward young children? Mostly the thing trying to be sold with these advertises are toys. But the vaiarity of toys is huge. These days there are plenty of electric devises for kids, like Nintendos or cumputer games. But there are also outdoor toys for exemple a bike. If a kid sits in front of a TV to see a Nintendo it really would like to have, for playing inside, well this is questionable. But if a kid, maybe a kid that berly leaves his room to go play outside, sees a bike it wants to have and as a result it goes playing outside, thats a good thing. But on the oder hand, not every family is so wealthy that thay can easily and every moment afford a bike. And if this is a big dream of a kid, to have  bike, not getting it, can be really stressful. 
But as a kid does not have any money for itself the danger that it would go and just buy all the things that looked so great in that advertise and as a result be broke is not existend. This danger  is greater in the adult world, as also adults are not always suchan adult as thay should be. But tis text is not about this problem so lets focus back on the children and discus this problem from another piont of view. What would it mean to a company when its avertising section is shut down? Television advertises are most important advertises of a company thats because so many people at once can be directed. Thats why I think a company in our time can not survive without television advertising eventhough all its competitiv compenys have the same problem. And thats why I think the benefits for a child without television advertises is to small to out weigh the disadvantige
