It is difficult to answer these question. Because these advertisings are used to buy the product. For example the television advertising of "Kinderschokolade", which is a german chocolate, is also directed by young children. That has a advantage for the producer from these product, because the other children see these child in the television and than they also want to have one. So the parents have to buy some. Or another example. In Germany is a television advertising from "Hipp", which is a company who produce foot for babies. So the mothers who had born a child see these advertising and when the babies in the television look good and healthy they think it is also good for their own children. But on the other side you have to know, that the parents go with their children to a casting, because maybe they want to get famous or they need the money or what else. So the children itselfs can not decide if they want to do these television advertising or not. So they are too young to decide for themselfes. Also the young children maybe can not speak so good or walk or something like that but they have to do what the producers say. That means the children maybe not know what they have to do. So I agree with the statement that television advertising which are directed by young people should not be allowed. I think the children do not know what they are doing there. I think it should be allowed in an age where the children can decide for themselfes, if they want to be an actor of it or not. But it should be not allowed only to make money for the parents or to get them famous.
