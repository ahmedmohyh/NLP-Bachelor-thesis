Television advertising is a thing many of us hate. Nowadays advertising is to be found everywhere, no matter if you are in a Cinema or if you read the daily newspaper. television advertising is a very extrem topic. Because of the time most of us spend in front of a television every day and the amound of people possesing televisions, television advertising is a very attractiv way to prmote products. Therefore a lot of companies invest in television advertising, promoting their new or old product directed towards their aimed consumers.

Since young children (between 2-5) are not old enough to understand the sense of advertisment, many believe this should be illegal. Allthough there is deffinitely a point to it, this shouldn't affect children in a negative way because thats where the parents have their part to play. It is the parents duty to tell a child what it can or should whatch and whats not sensible and therefore don't allow them to whatch certain thing. Another point of the opposition to this topic is that the advertising doesn't mean children are forced to buy these things and can therefore siply not be restricted.

My personal vew is also against
