In this essay we will research the statement "Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". It gives different reasons for and conter this statement. 
One of the main question is not, why shouldn't be allowed to show advertising, it is why are such young childern (aged two to five) allowed to sit in front of the televison? In this age they should play with other childern their age in the garden and to have fun in the reality, not on the televison.
But when we know that it gives young childern which sit often in front of the television, then we should also speak about the sense and influence from the television advertising. What think the childern about advertising? Do they understand the advertising? Are they really notice the advertising? The parents should ask all these question themeselve. 
I think it gives childern which watch televison only that they have something to do, not really for fun or maybe because the parents don't want to paly the whole time with their childern. And then I think the childern don't notice or understand the advertising really. They only want to look after picuters, listen to animals who speak and to music which sounds.
I think childern don't become influenced by televison advertising. In my opinion I'm not whole agree with the statement because I think that childern in this young age shouldn' be in front of the televison and I also think that such young childern don't notice the advertising. I think for older childern (aged six to twelve) the televison advertising should not be allowed, because they always want to have the toys which come in the advertising, but younger childern didn't notice this and because of that it dosen't matter if the advertising is allowed or not.
