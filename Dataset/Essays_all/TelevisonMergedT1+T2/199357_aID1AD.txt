Advertisement is something what everyone sees on a daily basis. Practically every product from skin cream to cars is advertised in some way or another. Companies need it in order to gain money. A popular way of advertising is to do it on television since many people watch tv. But like that many young children are prone to advertising so this creates a discussion. Should advertisement directed toward young chilren be allowed?

It should be allowed because the companies which is specialised in the production of child products have to advertise their products and direct them to their group of costumers. Yes, obviously the children won't buy anything but their parents will. It can be that children will take interst in their offers. And if they want it why shouldn't they have it?

Secondly, even if they aren't interested in their products it still won't harm them to develop some interest in the specific things. If they don't do it when they're between two and five years old they'll just do it later.

But on the other hand the natural development of the child is stopped and it's alread prone to the "real" world of marketing before it could develop a child's view of world. With time it will obviously change, but a nautral change is of upmost importance or else they'll become confused.

Not forget they develop the idea of marketing and exploiation of people for the accumalation of wealth for themselves. They will develop unhealthy ways of thinking and won't try to share their stuff with others, but try to sell it.

All in all there are arguments for and against television advertisment directed towards young children.
