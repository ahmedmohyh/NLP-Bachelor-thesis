It is usual today that many companies try to place their advertisement in the TV. Exspecially in shows for children, there are many advertisement spots in the break. But should the advertisement directed toward young children should be allowed?

First of all you have to think about the fact that we are dealing with children: there are some things which are different about advertisement for kids or for adults. You can influence kids more than adults with tv spots. If they see a toy in an advertisement break they` ll want to buy it. 

On the other hand, it´s the right of a company to have advertisement for children in tv shows. There isn´t any law which says that advertisement for children isn´t allowed. If you are a toy company and you want to sell a product, it will be the easiest way to make a advertisement spot in a TV show. 

People who are pro advertisement come with the argument that if children watch adverdisement in the TV and they see a product which they are really liking, they will have to ask their parents first before they can buy the product.

But the con advertisement for children people doubt this argument because they say, if children see something inj TV they really want they will steal some money (or take their own) and buy this product anyway without any permisson of their parents.

All in all the parents play an important roll: they have to overwatch what their children watch in the tv (and in the TV breaks) and they have to control that the children won´t buy anything without their permisson. And if some parents are against TV advertisement, they order their children to switch off the TV in the break.
