In the following I will explain my opinion to the statement, that young children in the age of two to five should not direct toward television advertising.

I think on the one hand it's absolutely ok for young children to be in television advertisments if it's ok for the parents and if the children have fun through it. 
On the other hand it can be a problem if the child is afraid or has no fun. In this case I think it's better to do this not.
The child should also do just easy things in the advertisement if it wants to do it, like just laughing or playing. Directing belongs not to this things, so I am against that. Complicated things can be not good for the child. When the child is too young, it has in the most cases no opinion about what it wants or what it doesn't want, so the parents should decide what's the best for their child. 
A situation, where I would say that it's absolutely not ok to let a child be in advertisements is when the parents do it just for the money. They let the child work for their own money and that's false. They should do it when it makes fun for the child and the money can be wasted in a teddy bear or something like this for the child.
Furthermore it's not good to do it with a very joung child. When this child is older, it's maybe embarassing for it to be as a baby in advertisement. 
A point whrere every parent should be careful is what kind of advertisement it is. They should informate themself about the organisation, what they do and if they are good and famous or not really good. The money which they would earn is also importent and can say a lot about the advertisement.

To conclude, I would say it's always the situation which is important to decide if an advertisement is the right thing for the child or not. 
The child should do it just when it really wants it and when it's old enough and physically good enough to play in it. The child should also do just easy things and no directing.
