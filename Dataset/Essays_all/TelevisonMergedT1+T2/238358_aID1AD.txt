The advertising in media, for example television, does appear every now and then watching tv. Nearly every child does watch tv, by the age of two to five years. It is obvious that they will collide with the advertising. 

At a young age, children do imitate and do things they get caught. Advertising is trying to convince the watcher. Young children have no experience to differ, what is good and whats not. So, they get taught about something, and grab this knowledge in a time where getting an opinion and make yourself an image of this world, is pretty necessary. Not ot forget advertisment is manipulating, not a positive word. 
But otherwise, advertising wants you to buy something, like products or services and kids from two to five years, probably wont have the financial force to execute these purchases. In that way advertising maybe ould not affect the situation negative in this way. And also a positive effect is, that the child does get an idea of the technical and engineering situation of the moment. How do products look like? What are you able to do with them? For example, how does the new iPhone look, what can you do with it? Well, thats not central in this case, because it is not directed towards young children, but it goes in this way. Children then also learn to differ what would I buy and what is not necessary.

Concluding, I do not agree. Advertising is everywhere, where you can probably look. Seriously, what can you do about it? I think that the negative effect is not that important and society should just ignore this issue, because it is not worth to think about it. When your children are not supposed to see advertising, then give them something else to do!
