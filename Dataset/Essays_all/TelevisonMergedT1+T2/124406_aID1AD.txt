Is your child attracted by advertising in the television? This is a problem many familys have nowadays and this question is disgusted a lot lately. People are arguing if it should be allowed to make avertising for children aged two to five. 

From a economic point of view this sector of advertisement will open new doors. It is a good sector to invest in because it's new and not complitly  used up. New companys can be founed and new innovative ideas can be made.
Furthermore it is also not a bad this for the children because the can develope pretty early a sense of what they really want and what they don't want. Like this strong personalities will be built. 

On the other hand the parents are definitly in a bad postition. They never can fullfill the amound of wishes their children will have because of the appearece of this advertising sector. Children want more and more and won't be satisfied if they get it. This could be caused by the overfloting of the advertising marked by new products the have to have as two year old, according to the advertisement.
Additionaly, the children are practiclly born into a world of consumption and this will take their innocence and childhood away. They are overstrained by the amound of this they don't actually need.

As a conclusion I suppose that advertising for such young children will make a huge change in society. Ifen if it is good for the economie of many companys, I'm convinced it has just bad impacts on the children itself. Their childhood won't be the same if they have to deal with this world of consumption so early in their lives. If this stays allowed there are just disatvantages for the children and for their parents too. They should be allowed to stay children for a little longer than just for two years.
