Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden? This is a very difficult question regarding the fact, that a lot of parents don't want their children to be manipulated by advertisements, but most child directed programms on TV rely on income made through adverts. So does the restriction of adverts also mean a decline in good TV programms for children?
Advertisement directed toward young children is a highly controversial thing because children can be easily manipulated so they want a certain product and try to persuade their parents into buying it. Is it okay to use the easily influenced will of a child for such materialistic purpose? A lot of people think not, certainly a lot of parents who fear their children could become more materialistic themselves by whatching the little films where buying a certain product seems to lead to great fun and the end of all boredom. 
But, would TV programms still be able to make high quality emissions without the additional income made by product promotion? Could they even survive? Probably not, so they would rely on state subventions, similar to TV programms like SRF and it is very questionable if the state would be willing to pay for an additional channel. 
I conclude: The path between less advertisements and high quality emissions is quite narrow and it won't be possible to forbade all advertising on childrens TV altogether. So maybe one should try to put only unproblematic advertisements on child programms (if such a thing exists).
