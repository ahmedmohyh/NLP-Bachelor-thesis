In this essay, we speak about the question: "Should television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed?" With children, they mean the kids aged two to five. 

Children aged two to five are very manipulative. If they see something, they will test it out by themselv or if soemone have something that they want, they don`t stop speak about it. For the business guys is this a chek-pot. If they can manipulate the kids with Television advertising is this awesome for them. That is one piont that says that it should be allowed

The first point was from the view from a businessguy. But we also have to respet the view from the parents. Imagin you have a four year old kid and it sees one of those television advertisings for example from a toy. Your kid does not stop cry until it has this toy. This can be very annoying and disturbing. So from the view from the parents, television advertising should not be allowed.

They point, that kids are very manipulative is also negative. Imagin your three year old daughter sees a television advertising in which soemone get killed. Now your daughter starts tinking, that killing is ok because of this television advertising. Or another example. Your daughter sees in one of thouse television advertisings how people rob banks or things like this and she starts thinking that commiting a crime is ok. 

My conclusion is that it should be allowed but only as long as it don`t manipulate the kids in a bad way, as I sayd above. I also tink it`s the problem from the parents. If they think it`s ok to let her four year old daughter watch tv, it should be clear for them that there are television advertising.
