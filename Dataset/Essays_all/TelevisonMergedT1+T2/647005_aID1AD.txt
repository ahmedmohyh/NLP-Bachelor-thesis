Many people agree that television advertising directed toward childern aged two to five should not be allowed. But why do they thinke so? There are many reasons why it should be prohibited but how else should the new toy be advertised?

The companies know that the parents or grandparents buy the toys for the children, but the children should like the toy or else it is a waste of money. Children are going to say their parents what they like and because of that is makes sense to advertise toward young children. 

On the other hand children at the age of two to five like everrything they see and want to have it. The parents like to see their child happy but what if they can not afford the new toy their child wants? They're disapointed that they can not give the child the things that it wants. The child is also going to be sad because if all his freinds has the toy he wants to but he can't have it he feels like he's not loved from the parents. An other point is that the young children don't even understand what the advertise means. They just find it very fascinating and want to be like the children they see in television. For them it is like the perfect life they want to have. They don't understand that it is just played to look like the perfect world. Even though the child gets the toy it doesn't has a perfect life as the child in the television who has a lot of fun with his new toy.

In my opinion the television advertising towadrs children should be allowed but maybe not for children at age two or three.They are to young to understand what it really means and they just want to have it all. As soon as the child gets older it should be allowed to advertise towards them but they have to understand that they can not have everything they see on television.
