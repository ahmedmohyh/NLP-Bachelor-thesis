Advertising is a difficult topic , because sometimes it is helpful and othertimes not. But advertising for children from two to five is really bad. Every little child wants to have what it sees in ads. The Problem is, that  the parents have to pay for it and out of this they will become poor and this why they maybe kill themeselves. So the child has no parents anymore. Annother possibility is, that the child only focus on ads , even if it is already an adult. If the parents don´t let their children watching TV the whole day the risk of influecing ads is not so high, but children like to watch TV extremly long, so they have to find a compromiss. 

Summarizing I would say, that I think ,that the risk of a death of anyone is too high. So I agree with the statement.
