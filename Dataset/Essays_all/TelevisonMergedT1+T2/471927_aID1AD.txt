I think children may watch the tv but of corse just at a strict time. My cousines for example (3 and 5 years old) watch every evening the "sandman" and then they have to go to sleep. They're happy with that and my aunt can do the kitchen in this time. But I also know another exaple the brother of my friend (5 years old) may watch the tv when he has done his homeworks. He sit infront of the tv and watch untill the dinner is ready, sometimes that are 3 houres or more and that is to much for a child. You have to be strict with your children and show them how to acept your rules.
In my opinion a child have to play outside - in the garden or in a park - that dosen't matter but it's not good for the kids when they just sit in the house or in the appartment they must have fresh air and sunlight. But in my opinion it's to much to forbidden the tv.
So I disagree because when children may watch at a strict time that's good, like this they learn how to acept rules.
