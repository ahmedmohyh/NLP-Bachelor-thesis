first of all i think the television isn't a bad thing. children can learn a lot of it. for example they can learn a forainge language with help of the television. but i agree that young children sholdn't watching advertising. for children there are so much stupid and dangerous advertisings in the television. after my opinion children have to play most of the time outside and spend a lot of time with friends. so they can learn how to make contact and how they can be integret in a groupe. so in any case, i think childern shouldn't wachting long time television. advertising for thinks like security, banken and versicherungen isn't a big problem for childern. but advertising for phantasy or sience fiction films are many times very curious. young children don't understand it and it makes they afraid.  also advertisig for things you can eat, especially the advertising which is made for children is in my opinion a problem. because the children wanna have those snikers and so they will get fat. in the whole i think the advertising isn't the main problem. there are sort of advertisings which can be a problem for children. the main point is that children should lear how to handle with the television. when they don't sit the whole day in front of the television and when children play outside with friends, the television is a good thing.
