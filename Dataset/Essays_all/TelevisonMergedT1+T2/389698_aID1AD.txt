Watching your favorite tvshow as a kid, who doesn't remember that ? But with watching your favorite show also comes those advertisingbreaks in between and that's what I'm going to be discussing today. Furthemore the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".

Let's first discuss reasons why I agree: One reason why I agree with this statement is, that children in that agegroup are very impressionable and are influenced by the things and people around them,television marketing is one of them. I used to always want the newest barbie displayed on tv and used to beg my mom to buy it.

Another reason why I agree's that it prolongs the time of a movie or a tv show, so the child spends more time overall in front of the tv, which could be used more produvtively by playing, hanging out with other kids or doing sports.

Another reason why I agree's because this supports consumerism and the need in children wanting new toys or snacks for example.

A reason why I disagree's because people are usually always surrounded by advertisments wether it be on the street, on youtube or at the cinema and at one point or another you have to learn to handel that and not always be seduced by advertising. For example pretty much every website has some ads on it nowadays.

A reason to disagree's that tvshows need to make money somehow and the way most of them make money is through advertising. Whithout it you wouldn't have as many free tvchannels.

In conclusion I think that television advertising for children in that agegroup shouldn't be allowed, because I think that's best for the children as well as their parents and their wallets as shown by the points above.
