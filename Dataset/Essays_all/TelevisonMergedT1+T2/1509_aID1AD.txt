Advertisement is all around us. We see it on TV, in the newspapers and around us in the city. Especially younger children fall for these advertisements easily. So should advertising for young children be allowed ?

Firstly, especially young children are easily manipulated which is greatly taken advantage of by the industry. Children rarely think about something they see in an advertisement on TV and just see the new toy they must have.
This problem, on the other hand, would appear at an older age if advertisemnt were banned since children are not used to them and would just fall for the advertisemt then which would just delay the problem and not solve it.
Secondly, there is advertisement for goods that are not supposed to be seen by childreen but you can still find them on TV  which is not intended but it is hard to controll so a ban would help. 
Advertisements are for all people and so they should be allowed. It is very hard to advertise in public if this is not allowed for children which would cost a lot of money.
There are products for children that are useful and banning advertisements for them would just be unfair since the ban to totally fail doing what it is supposed ti do. There are some products that are not useful and should be banned but this should not be done with a general ban.

To conclude, there are advertisements that should be banned but firstly it is very hardly achievable if at all and
