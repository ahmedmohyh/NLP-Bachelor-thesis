Advertising 

The new medias has changed a lot. So also the advertising methods of the companys but is this okay that we do not have the controle over this think and we can not decide if we want to see this stuff or not?

The compays use the televison to make their new products famous. Also a lot of small children see these thinks but this ist not acceptable. The parents can not control what their children see in televison. There is some advertising you do not want that your kinds see this. But you can not all the time look what your children are doing.they become a ba influence from the televison.

the kids also do dot know what they see and they do not know what they want. But if the kids  see everyday a new toy and the want to play with this the parents have to drive every day to the toysRus this is realy anoing and not useful. The stess wich the parents than have. Nobody want this. 

But we also have to say, that advertising is a part of our community and is a fixpoint in our lives. It is difficult to not allow it. And it`s  a part of being a Mother or a Father to look what the kids see and what they do not see. 

But what makes a smal kid in front of a televison? Is it realy necessary that the children have to took into this stupid thing. The advertising comanys have to use they halthy smartnes and the know what they can show the kids and what not.
