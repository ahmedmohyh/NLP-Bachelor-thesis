I don't agree with this statement. Television advertisments, that are directed towards children can be allowed. An argument against the advertising for small chlidren is, that children are easy to manipulise. But that isn't a problem, because parents are here care for their child. If a child sees a commercial for a toy he wants he will ask his parents to buy that toy for him. Which isn't a bad thing, because there is nothing wrong with, liking something and wanting it. But it becomes a problem when it repeats itself and at that point the parents should come into role. The child doesn't have any money, so he has to ask his mother or father for money and even if the kid sees hundreds of commercials for stuff he wants, he can ask his parents as much as he wishes but they will never buy it for him. 
Even if television advertising directed toward young children will be banished, it would not change a thing. I never saw or heard of a kid, that came to me and said that saw a commercial of a toy and now ownes the toy. Kids want toys that their friends have or that their brothers have and not what they see on television. A spoiled child is spoiled, because of his parents and not bacause of commercials. 
And anyway children should not watch so much television. It's not the commercials that are bad for the children it's the television shows that ruin them. The commercials make them want stuff, but the shows change the way they think.
