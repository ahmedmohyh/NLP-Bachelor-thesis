Television advertising is ubiquitous, whether for the newest cleaning supplies or cheap technical devices. Young kids have to experience these harmful influences aswell.

Toddlers' brains aren't yet developed to think critically. Influencing kids to buy or wish for the toy  is harmful for this development. Advertisements give a wrong impression to kids, which can't distinguish reality and  hoax due to the lack of experience. This is needed to even be able to think critically.

Companies use this lack of experience of kids to generate more sells. Toddlers are being tricked and used for the company's advantage. Companies that use this tactic are generally also those who don't value quality as high. This leads the kids to want bad quality products to be bought for them. For example, I was tricked into wanting things I now regret having bought.

The harmful effects result in a misinterpretation of advertisement later in life. When a toddler always sees wrong things on TV, this will transform not only in believing advertisements but also in believing wrong statement about reality". Advertisement towards kids should therefore be banned to be aired on television.
