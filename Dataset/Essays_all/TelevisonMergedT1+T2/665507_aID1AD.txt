In todays life even young children get in contact with new technologies like computers, smartphones and also television. These young people are easily influenced by the media and also by advertisements because they do not know it better yet. To form future consumers and costumers companies try to influence these people already at a very young age.

Television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because these young people might experience a negative influence of which they are not yet aware of. This could result in an different uprising compared with those who did not watch television at a young age. In advertisings are always flashing and bright colours, women and other tools which help to get the consumer interested. Young childrend should not see such things like half nacked women or other offenive things. Even if the advertisements are directed toward young children such elements are part of the advertisements. The children should keep their innocent minds.
 
One the other hand television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it helps the economie to grow in the future. The economie is not only important for the industries and companies, it is also important for a country. The government is also interested in a growing economie which results in a wealthy nation. In the end it is all a desicion of the parents which allow their children to watch TV. If the parents would not allow them to watch TV there would not be such problems.

In my opinion the companies should not make use of those innocent children even though it is a good tactic for winning new future cosumers. Most of the advertisement are too offensive and often not meant for those young minds. Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
