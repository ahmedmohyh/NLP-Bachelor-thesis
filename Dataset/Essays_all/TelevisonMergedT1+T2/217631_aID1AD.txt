To start, I think that children aged two shouldn't even be allowed to watch television so much that they could be influenced by the advertisment. But in general I think it's the parents task to be aware of the danger which comes from ads in television. So they should decide whether their child is allowed to watch television. I think it is impossible to ban ads from TV because the chanels earn so much money from them. Of course there is the danger that young children can be easely influenced from TV advertisement and could have a wrong opinion of something. But in the world there are many other things that could have a bad influence on a child. So now, my opinion ist that the parents have to deal the same with TV advertisements than with other threats for their child. They must prevent their child from being influenced. They can tell their child what's wrong or just invented in the advertisements or they can watch less TV (rather unpopular).

An other argument for not baning TV ads is that there are a number of kids-chanels where there are less or none advertisement. On the other hand one can say that every kid is different so every kid may be influenced more easely or less easely. Maybe there should be a minimum age for watching TV at all.

In general I think it's important that the parents look carefully what their children are watching and that they teach them how to handel the advertisement.
