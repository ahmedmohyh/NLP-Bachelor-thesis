I can't say if i'm agree or disagree with this statement, because there are reasons why it is good for little children to watch television but there are also reasons why it isn't good.

First I would say that it istn't bad to watch TV, but only if you don't watch to much. I think also that litte children could learn something important or perhaps they could learn new words. And of course if you are have boring, you could watch television so that you haven't boring any more.

But as I told at the beginning there are also reasons why it is better that children plays with his toys instead of watching television.
The first reason is that little children should communicate a lot with children with the same age. And if the watch TV it isn't possible to talk to other children.
A second reason is also that the screan is not good for the eyes, so it could be possiple that they have to waer glasses later.
For little children it's also important to go a lot outside and play in the frish ear and not to stay inside and don't move.
Because sport is also very important and if they always sit in front of the television and don't move it's not healthy.

So I would say that if the children (aged two to five) don't look to much television it should be allowed!
