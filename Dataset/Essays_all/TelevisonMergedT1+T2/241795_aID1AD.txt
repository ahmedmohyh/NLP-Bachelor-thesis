There is no possibility to flee them - the advertisings in the TV. For almost every product,for hotels or even animals commercials exist with only one aim - to increase the requests for it. But should it be really allowed in all areas?

First of all, I think we have to look at this theme with a split view. Advertisings are nothing more than clever business models, which try to influence the a large number of community members. As followed, it is not surprising, that the commercials are even created for minors and young children. Children are those persons in a family, who probably have the greatest influence. What they want, theire parents try to get. Furthermore, the parents should decide on theire own wether it is okay, that theire 4 aged children look television or go out into the nature.

Althoug advertisings in TV, even for young children, are very important for the companies, we should also take the other site into consideration. Children are not only the persons who influence the most, they are also the most influencable members in a familiy. With advertisings in the television, they always get an idea, with what they could enlarge for example theire collection of toys. Unhappy and sad faces, if theire parents could not afford everything, and a consumation community even in the first years of a childrens  life is the conclusion. 

All in all, television advertisings for minors and young children should not be prohibited, but restricted in a certain mass. Because a consumation community with 4 aged children, is absolute nonsense.
