In this text we speak about the two sights if it should be allowed to advirtise directed toward young children on television or not. 

On one hand it should not be allowed to advertise toward young children because they are too young to really understand what it is if they see something on television. When they see another child enjoying something they want to have it too. It is also not good when they see all they could have and do not have. Then they already start in young age to be material directed.

On the other hand it does not matter if you advertise to young children or not they anyway do not really understand anyhing. Also if the parent do not want that their child see advertisement then they just can not allow them to watch televison and  maybe just put a movie on or record the sope their child want to watch and then skip the advertisment. It also has to be sayed that if a child sees something on television and then want to have it it is simmilar as if he see something on hes friends house and then want to have it too. Another point is that it does not matter in which age they are they anyway see advertisement towards their age when the grow up, so why not already in young age.

In my opinion it shout be allowed to make televison advertising toward young children. They are so many ways to go around advertisment that if you do not want that your child watching advertisment you can stop it from doing it.
