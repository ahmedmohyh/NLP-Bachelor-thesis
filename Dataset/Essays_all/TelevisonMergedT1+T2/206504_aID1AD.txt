Nowadays millions of children are watching television every day. As consequence, the advertisement is sometimes directed toward children of every age. But should that be allowed? I do not think so.

Firstly, children aged two to five can easily be manipulated by television advertising. When they watch advertisements in which other kids are playing with exciting toys and having fun, they wish to posses these toys too. But in reality children are not in need of them and they get furious when their parents do not allow the buy. 

Furthermore, little children do not understand what television advertising want to say them. So, it is not necessary to advertise products only for young children. It is absolutley useless. The most part of young children have not money to buy stuff for themeselves. Their parents decide what they are in need of and the television advertising shows mostly needless products.

It would be much more effective to direct advertisements to children which have already reached the age of eight. In this age children are ripe to make the difference between manipulation and needful things. 

In conclusion, I do not understand why it is necessary to direct television adverstising toward young children. The advertisments should include older children, teenagers and adults but definetly not younger people than six. Instead of watching TV young children should play together with their parents.
