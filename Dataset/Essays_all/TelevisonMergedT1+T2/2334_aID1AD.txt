I think, that television adverts aren't good in general. If you just want to watch TV adverts are just a bother. You want to watch your favourite series or a good film, but at the most exiting scene they throw lots of adverts at you. When you're old enough you can just ignore them, but a child at the age between two and five mostly can't. So for their sake, adverts should be banned. But it's not that easy. You can't just ban adverts from TV. Most free TV programms earn their munney throug these adverts. So in order to keep broadcasting our favourite shows thei need these adverts.
So in conclusion, I think that adverts are a bother and not particular good, but the TV programms depend on them so you can't remove them from TV.
