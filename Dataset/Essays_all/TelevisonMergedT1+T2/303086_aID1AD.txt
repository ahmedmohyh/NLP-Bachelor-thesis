Many people nowadays think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. Some of them think that it is just sensless and others see it as a real problem. So let's just look at the pros and cons of this subject and come to a conclusion.

Waht is definetly a negative point about advertising to kids is that they want everything that they see and stop being happy with the things they already have. Because kids are so naiv they belive everything said in the advertisement. They are to young to understad that the companies want to manipulate your brain in a way that you buy their product. When parents let their kids watch television they want the kids to look a serie for kids or animated movies. But with the advertisment the kids are not willing to watch televieson anymore but they want that thing that they just saw in the advertisement and start bothering their parents. So i definetly understand the parents who wants to ban any kind of advertisement toward their young children.

On the other hand it is a good way for companies selling toys and things for kids to sell their products. Like every other company they have the right to advertise their product. Often the publicities are directed to the parents so they know what to gift to their kids. Maybe the parents are thinking about what to buy for their kids. In that case that kind of advertisement is a good thing. 

In the end I think we should let the companies make publicity but we should definetly reduce it. Because the amount of advertisement on television is enormous. I think it would also be a good thing to make the publicity directed to young children easier and simpler so we do not manipulate the childe
