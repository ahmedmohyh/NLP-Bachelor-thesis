In a time periode of consuming and buying, is advertising in television and other medias a vital thing. The more people you can reach with your advertising about your product, the bigger is the amount of money you earn. Now the question is,if television advertising should not be allowed to young children in age between two to five?

At first, this kind of prohibition would be a nice protection for the innocent little childrens. But in the opposite a big part of costumer would missing there. Kids, especially in age two to five, make a huge part of the potential consumers. Another aspect is that the children can grow up without any bad influence. The Television is like a big irritation machine. Too much information for this little brains. It is like a kind of manipulation, the big companys give the direction how the kids should play and life. 

But finally everyone should make his own thouts about this statement. In my opinion this idea were a good thing for protection the new genereation but all in all a big fail for our economy.
