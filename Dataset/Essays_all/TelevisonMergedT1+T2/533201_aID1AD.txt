Advertising towards small children: A blessing or an immoralic way of influencing innocent people?

On one side, on the side of the commercial industry, advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) is a blessing. It's so easy to influence small children and for them it's very easy to influence their parents. This gets clear with the following example. The producers of an advertising will show a product in an mostly unrealisitc way so that the children get seduced to wanting this product. The children will talk to their parents and their parents will buy the product for them because the children are so fascinated of it so that they won't stop asking for it. This example shows that commercial enterprises and product manufacturers can make a lot of money with advertising towards small children. 
On the other side it's a immoralic business. Small children aged two to five aren't able to think about a product properly. They just want it if they like it or if their friends like it. They know nothing about the circumstances in which the products get produced. The manufacturies that are mostly in China employ a lot of people in bad working conditions. On top of that, commercial towards small children just increases the amount of resources that we use because there's a bigger group of people that gets affected by advertising.

I think that this way of advertising is a sort of immoralic business since small children are innocent and just don't know enough about the backgrounds of the products that they want. But otherwise it's also the parents that produce these advertisings and parents need money for their children. And in the end it's in the hands of the parents if their children can consume advertising or not.
