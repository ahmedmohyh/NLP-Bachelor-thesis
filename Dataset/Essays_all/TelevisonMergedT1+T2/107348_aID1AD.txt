In hour time are the technical abilitys in a very high level. Whil our parents and we ourselfs are grown up without a mobile phone the children which become teenager now know since they were 4 how to handel with cellphones and  all the other technical staff. They watching TV at least every second day. But is it good for them that they are all the time confronted with the advertisment on screen?

The children in the age of two are to young to watch TV. They can't realise and canalise what they see. All this advertisement they watching is influencing them without notification. If they see a brandnew teddybear in the television, they want to have it. If the parents now buying them this teddybear the children are thinking that the can have everything they want. The next time they are seeing something new in the television the partens may don't buy the thing for them and the boy or the gir lwill be sad. They were thinking: "If I want something in the world, even if it is impossible, my parents will buy it. 

An other argumet could be that the children cann become hoocked on watching TV and as an effect they will also watching the whole time advertisment. In our western world we are so previliged. We are having everything and if we want something we can have it. But not the whole worl is such priviliged as we are. There are so many wars at the time, so many children who are starving because they can't effort they money they need to buy food. 
But our children don't see this if the are watching just advertisment. The think everything is given and the world is pink.

So in my oppinion it is not a good idea to let our children watching the whole time TV because as effect they're also watching advert.
