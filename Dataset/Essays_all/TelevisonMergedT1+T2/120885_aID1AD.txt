Television
Watching tv is so in commen like healthy food. In nearly every home is minimum one televison and the people use it three hours by day. Not only the adults also the little ones. There are a lot of different series for our youngest family members. Between the shows there are a lot of commercial. But what do they do to theme?

Haters will say: They destroyed the intelligence and the fantasy from the children. They havent to think anymore and just sit there, don't move. So they will loos also ther fitness or worse they never form it. So this chirdren will get fat and lasy. In addition they will have more problems to find friends because they never lernd to form social contacts. An other suite is the anger they have inside. But what's about the adverising? Do they also foster all this things or is it not so worse? "Even worser!", say the specialist. The commercial let the children no chance to make a one think, because they say them what they have to think.

"Not at all!", contret Mr. Kouwn. The television and the addet advertising haven't a connect with the fatness or anything alse. The worse thing you can say to it is, that it is a freetime taker, thats all. With the advertising tthey just want to show there now products, no less no more. And they aren't just fore the kids also ther perents watch this canels.

On my opinion the people now days watch to much television. They shoud go aut and do sport. There also to much advertising. They shoudent be so lot.
