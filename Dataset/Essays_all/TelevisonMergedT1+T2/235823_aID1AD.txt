We all know advertising in television. The good ones as good as the bad ones. But we all know what theywant us to do: They animate us to buy their things. The most of us know this by their own experience and maybe also because our parents warned us. More or less at the age of 12 or earlier we start to make differences between what do I really need and what they want us to need. But as child we cant make a difference. Mostly our parents say to us that these advertisments are dangerous. So obviously as young children we cant take decisions especially then when they are influenced by advertisments.
Because of this and the following reasons I agree with the statement. 
Also because for adults advertising is not usualy a good thig. Clear it shows us things to buy that maybe make our lifes easier. But we should not forget why there are so manyadvertisements. Obviously they want to make money with them. And if people want to make money and they see an opportunity for it they are ready to make many things to get it. For example they also dont refuse to make advertisments for young children although they know that its kind of unfair against the child as said before. So I think that its not worth it to support such things that poison our children.
And last but not least there already exist such laws which say that its not allowed to make advertising for alcoholic beverages, because of all the alcoholics. They argue that an alcoholic cant really controll his addiction. So its like with little kids who also cant really controll what they want. 
Kids get too easy influenced by advertising and they can hardly do anything against it.
