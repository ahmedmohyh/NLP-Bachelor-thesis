Somebody says that television advertising which is directed toward young children between two and five years old should not be allowed. But it is really so bad?

A toys advertising is possible. They can show their parents want they for christmas or for their birthday. The young children will also learn something from the advertising like how to use the toys. A advertising is also good between a cartoon for a break.

But the Televison advertising isn't a good thing for young children. Children shouldn't watch television with this age.They can be addicted to TV later and will not play anymore with the dolls and toys. They also will not concentrate what is going on when their only staring in the television.
The problem is also that televisions damage the eyes from the children, because they are still very young and their eyes are still growing up. The children should not be victims for the advertising market. The children are to young to know that the elder poeple use their low knowledge for their success. 
They also use advertising like this to influence the children to make their parents buy these products.

I agree with this following statement. Because I see that the young children are vicitims from elder people who want only power over the children. Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later. Maybe the advertising is furious and scary. I also think that a young child doesn't need a advertising for chose his toys or dolls.
