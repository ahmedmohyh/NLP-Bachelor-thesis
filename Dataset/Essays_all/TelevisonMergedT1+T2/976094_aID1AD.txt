There ara some reasons why you would show or not show the television programm to achild aged two to five. One of those pro arguments is that it is very easy to entertain a child with the television because there is something going on all the time and entertaining such a little child can sometimes be very exhausting and parents dont have infinit power to do that, the TV is also good at keeping a kid calm, wich is very exhausting too, so it doesent cry and shout all the time.
the same thing if the parents are working and have a babysitter for theire child. but there are some intelligent programms too wich tell good maners or how to deal with complicate situations in live. A contra argument is that if children, especially as young as those we're talking about, don't get enough time and love from theire parents it can effect theire "evolution". Also if children don't go out to play with other kids they don't learn how to deal with other humans or kid of theire age somethig else is that if they don't move enough it may decrese theire motoric skills so that tey are worse in sports than other children. An other one is that if they always get entertained by a TV they don't learn how to entertain themselves an may get less creative. 
I think it shouldn't be forbiden, it's the responsebility of the parents but they should know how to use television if there is a young child.
