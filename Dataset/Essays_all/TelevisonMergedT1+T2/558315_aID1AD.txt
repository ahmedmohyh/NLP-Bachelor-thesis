Television advertising directed toward young children is a controvers topic. As it is proved, that young children are more capable of learning new stuff quickly, they take every new information or advert like if they were a sponge. Because of this ability, it is very easy for television advertisers to convince young children towards getting their new toy or something else. Furthermore, a lot of parents don't have the control on the time their child is sitting in front of the television as letting them watch TV is an easy way of keeping their child quiet. And children just stay watching TV if they don't get interrupted. Thanks to this, it is very easy to influence the children threw an advertisemt.
But how should young children be informed on new toys, films or new outdoor activities? Television advertisements have become very popular in recent years due to the long time of people spend watching television and the abilities of the television beeing pictures with sound. If young children won't be informed by new stuff over the television, threw where then? They mostly don't own a smartphone and are able to check on new releases immediately. Television advertisements for young children is in that sense a superb way of them getting new informations.
In my opinion it depends on what is advertised for. If it is just a new toy, a outdoor activity or even a new way of expanding their horizon advertised for I believe it can be a outstanding way of advertising. But as soon as the advertisement is manipulating the child in the slightest, as maybe an advertisement towards a political party or, as I like to call it, "adult stuff", television advertisements aren't helpful for young children and should be forbidden.
As I mentioned in the beginning, television advertising toward young people is a controvers topic and even I don't have a clear opionen as "yes" or "no".
