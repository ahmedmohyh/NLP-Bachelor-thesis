The questioon, if advertising for young children should be allowed is a highly debated topic. In the following text I will comment on that topic.

At first we have to mention the bad impact, that if the children see so many things they want to own, they can`t create their own lives, because everything is already made up by the advertisers. 
But seriously, why would children not be allowed to watch advertisement? I think that the impact of advertisements are not that huge as some people believe. It`s the parents job to not buy their kids everything they want and think of this: If the children wouldn`t watch those ads, everything would be dictated by their parents and I bet, that the same criticz would stand up against the parents and want the kids to be influenced by ads. 
Furthermore I beg you to not come up with the arguement: "If those children watch adverts, they get stupid.". I believe, that if you don`t want your children to get stupid by watching ads on television, just don`t let them watch TV at all. And in todays world all these kids own IPads and so on, where they watch ads for grown ups. And that is, what should be stopped.

All in all I don`t really care about this topic, so please take my text toooo serious.
