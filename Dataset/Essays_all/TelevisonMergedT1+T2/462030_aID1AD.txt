In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. I think it is not fair to manipulate such young children for the enrichment of the advertisors. Because when these children learn so early how many things they could have, they are not going to be happy when they are older. They are going to want everything they see because they never learned to be happy with what they have. So we see that the adverising has negative affections of their further life, which is not fair.
On the other hand, for the advertisors it is a good thing to direct their advertising towards young children. When they see something they like in television, they are going to ask their parents for buying what they saw. And children this age usually keep asking until they get what they want. So it is a good strategy to use children for advertising. They do not think of money, they just want what they like.
So we see this statement is not just right or wrong. There are always two sides. But personally I am against directing television advertising towards young children. The behalf of the children is more important than the money the advertisors earn. So I agree with this statement.
