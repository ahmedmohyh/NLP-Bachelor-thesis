I think this is a good idea. Because if young children watch TV too often they will become stupid and lazy. In this age you have as parents the task, that you could build up a relationship with your children. 
Watching TV will not help you with that. For young children it is much more important to do something. Namely sports ore somthing in which you learn to kow other childrens. This is the case because the modern people have to learn social interaction as early as possible.
Regarding the the TV too often takes away your sense of the reality! If your kids do that you should do something against it, because they will never learn something about real life if thea are watching TV all the time, finding themselves in a virtual world.
TV is teaching your children bad things! Theres not only the bad vocabulary, no its also the actions. If the children see in the TV how they make dangerous things and it didn't harm them, then they may try to do the same things and this could be really dangerous.
But don't worry about the danger of watching TV, there is a good method to bring the children not to do that: You have to tell them, that they will become squared eyes! They will believe that and they will not watchig TV anymore.
Till now it shoud be clear that watching TV is a bad idea for young children. But how it is for older?
