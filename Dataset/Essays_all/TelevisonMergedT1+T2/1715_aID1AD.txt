Television advertising directed toward children is a widely discussed theme. In Germany Telivision advertising is forbidden on the childrens Tv channel.
I would agree to the given statement because it is not good to influence children at the Television, because they can not decide wether they need what they see or just want to have it because the advertisment is colurful and says they should buy it. In other countries like the US the children are the main customers for big companies an they make many advertisments just for them. The children are not able to buy the things but there parents can buy it for them espacialy if the child really wants something. Also it could bring Parents to the desicion that children in young age also need poketmoney. So if young children get money and spend it on things they don't need, they can not learn how to deal with money and they can not learnd what it mean to earn money, because they would just get it from there parents since they are young.
The only people for whom it would be a good thing are companies because they can earn a lot of money and that could also be good for the enviroment of the countrie. 
I can not imagen of any other good reasons for Telivision advertising directed toward children, that is why I would totaly agree to the given statement and I would want other countries to do it like Germany and also make a law what says that telivision advertising directed toward young children is not allowed.
