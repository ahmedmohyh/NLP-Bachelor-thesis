The question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not is actually discussed very much. It is a question which have many different opinions. 

Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children is the key to a good childhood. And they say it is good that they can watch television and so the parents have more freetime. For parents it is very hard to have a child which is aged between two to five. So to let them watch television is a good option to have a bit of freetime.

But the other side says that to let a child aged two to five watch advertising television is not good for the child. Then in this time the mother is not there and the child do not get love. Also many people say that for the education and for the developpment of the child it is very bad to watch television when you habe a age like this. So they can become bad at school or bad in their job later.

All in all we see that there are many supporters that kids aged two to five can watch advertising television. Because then the parents can get a bit of freetime. But there are also many proposers which say that it is not good for the developpment of the child. Now the question is if there will be soon a law for this case?
