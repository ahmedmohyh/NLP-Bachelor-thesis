I agree with this statement with diverent reasons. The children in this age are not enough old to decide if the advertising is good for them or if the producer of the advertising only wants to make profit. They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much. If the children see such a advertising they would also ask their grandparents to buy them products, which they saw in the Television. I think with the technology we have today, children are more and more able to watch television and often they do it without their parents. In cause of that they have no one who takes care about them and who looks that they do not often look such television advertising. I think normaly the children do not even realice how many toys actualy exist and so they dont want to have it. But the nature of childhood is, if we want ore not, that they always want to have what they see. In television advertising the toys look sometimes much more realistic, than they actualy are. The children are going to think that they have only stupid toys and there would be many better ones. In cause of that the children give everyhing to become new toys and as far as they have new ones, they want to get an other one, cause there are again new advertising with bether toys. On this way the childre are going to get trained to buy everything what they see in a television advertising. If they grow up they will not come away from this. They always want to have the best and the newest things. From time to time the humanity is going to get more and more influenced. It starts, as we see in this example, in joung years.
