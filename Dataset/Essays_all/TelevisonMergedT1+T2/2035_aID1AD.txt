In the following text i will write an essey about the influence of advertising television to young children.
At this time, the beginning of the 21st century, a lot of people, especially young people and children, are watching TV and get automaticly much information about whats modern at the moment,what seems to be nice to own etc. ...
Depending on what program you use the most, you get best advertisment fitting your interests.
Young children are usually whatching programs fitting their age so they might get shown creative activities, modern toys and because of that they can get impressions of how to be creative. Furthermore they are learning to become carefully and learn about the possible risks if they are discussing this with their parents.
The problem which could come up is that children at this age are believing many things they hear and see and dont know about these risks what would become a problem if they dont talk about it with their parents e.g. 
Today its easy to get acces to the intenet and their were already problems internationally known of children buying things or games on the intenet, not knowing they cost money.

In my opinion it shouldnt be allowed influencing children on porpuse with advertisment beacause of the reason i talked about above and the fact that children shouldnt spend that much time infront of the TV, sometimes just waiting a long time for their TV show, bacause advertisment is on screen.
