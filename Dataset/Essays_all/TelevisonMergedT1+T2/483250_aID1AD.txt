Many people watch television. Also young children. When we watch TV, you can be sure, that there are advertising. Now, the question is: Is it possible to let watch our children the television advertising? In this essay, I'm going to explain a few arguments according to the statement.
First of all, for the advertisers, children are the best victims. That means, when a child sees in the television a new toy, and the child wants it, they go to the mother or father and they buy the new toy. Children can be influenced very well.
For the first contra-argument, I put the argument from above in a negative form: Children can be influenced very well. When they see something in the television, they want it. For the parents, it's not easy. But children don't see only advertising for children: There are many advertisings, that, in my point of view, are critical for children. For example advertising for cigarrets or alcohol, or maybe advertising with sex. The children are too young to be confrontate with such things.
In my opinion, the advertising shouldn't be that much. It isn't a crime to show advertising for children. But I think, the people should be aware of dangerous things like alcohol. In generally: Children shouldn't watch so much TV. It isn't healthy. The whole system of media is like a brainwash, and children are victims, so we should save them.
