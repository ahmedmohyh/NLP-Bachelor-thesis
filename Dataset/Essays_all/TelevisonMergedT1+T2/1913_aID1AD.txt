We all see it on television every single day: advertising. Often directed at young children or teenagers. But should advertising towards children between the age of two to five be allowed or should it be banned from TV?
First of all of course it is great that children can see products they might like on TV. It is easier for them to find new toys which could help them develope special skills or just provide fun. For examples they see some kind of kids music instrument on TV. This instrument might awaken their love for music and it will have a good impact on the rest of their life and childhood.
However it is way easier to influence children than to influence their parents. After all this advertisments are a way for mostly big companys to sell their products. It is often found that children get excited just because the advertising for a toy or for sweets is good. It is also clear that most of the time the children don't pay for the advertised things they see on television. So there should not be advertising towards young children because they can not buy the product anyways. These advertisings are just an easier way to get the parents to buy something for their small child. The better it is advertised the more the child talks to their parents about it, so that they maybe buy the product. 
Knowing that it is also a lot easier to sell products with a low quality. Since the children do  not care or know about quality you could basically sell them anything with a good advertising strategy. For example a toy they only have for two days which than breaks into two.
To conclude I have to say yes i agree that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed because it is just an easy way for companys to sell a product.
