I agree with the statement that television adverstising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
To understand why it should not be allowed, it is important to know what adverstiser are. These are attempts to influence a child's mind, in order to make its parents to buy the advertisied product.

First, young children are not aware of the reason behind advertising like explained in the beginning because it is a complexe thing children dont zhhink about. They are not aware that they are influenced, whereas older people can be aware of being influenced by advertising.

Second, young children do not even know that they are influenced by advertising. Their state of mind is not that developed to realize such an influence. This kind of influence is called brainwashing, which should definitely not be allowed, especially because these children are in a rapid and dynamic character development which affects their further lifes. 

The parents cannot fully protect their children from being brainwashed, only if the parents abolish the TV from home. So the state should take action in this and prohibit adverstising directing young children becuase these little human beings are truly innoncent and should be first edcuated about influences when they are old enough so they know
