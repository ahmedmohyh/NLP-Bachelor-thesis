In today's society, advertising in television and the internet (or media in general) is one of the most important things to do for big companies and also for the economy. Advertising in general has huge influences in society, especially on younger people. While young people in schools mostly experience adversting through the internet and smartphones, children from the age of two to five do through television. Parents do now fear that the influence of advertisements will have consequenses and want the government to ban advertisments towards younger children.

An argument for the ban of this adevertising is that the influence on children will be a lot lower. The point is that through advertising, societies idea of the perfect human is being pictured. For example, when little girls see barbies or any of these, skinny, blonde, white dolls with perfect clothes and flawless makeup on TV, they don't just want to buy the doll, they also want to be like the doll, it's kind of their idol. It makes them think that everyone expects them to look exactly like this, which puts a lot of pressure on them, at such a young age. This kind of advertisment is wrong to show to younger people because they can't think as far as adults and don't know that being perfect doesn't make sense.

Otherwise, companies can't not advertise for some products, because it is for both, adults and children. Sweets and Soda or food in general would be a good example. the government can't ban companies from advertising chocolate because adults like it, as well as children. 

To conclude, television advertising can't be banned because companies obviously need to make money somehow. An idea for a solution would be to simply show less and chosen advertisment. The wrong kind of advertising won't have any influence on children anymore and companies will still make money off of them or their parents. Also parents should have an eye on which programmes their children watch and when they watch TV.
