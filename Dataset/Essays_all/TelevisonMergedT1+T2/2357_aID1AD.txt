Is it a good idea to advertising direct toward young children ?This is the question i will manage with in the following text.
one argument against this topic is that the children gets antother point of view of one topic so it could be harder to understand them.It´s hard for them when they only see and hear them  beacause the teacher could explain it better.
Otherwise the students could learn it better when they see it and doesn´t hear it from the teacher.When you have a bad relationship with the teacher it could be better for some students when they donßt have to talk them much with this teacher.
another argument that it isn´t a good idea is that the relationship between the student and the teacher couldn´t get better so you can´t speek to them when you have a problem or something else.
On the other hand when the teacher television advertising directed towards to young children they learn the right things beacause the teacher search for them to show the right ones to teach them the students.

in my opinion it isn´t a good idea and it should not be allowed because for it would be harder to understand the main topic.i think you hear lots of things and don´t know one of them are imortant and not.I also think it´s more stressful to learn it on this way.i agree with this following statement.
