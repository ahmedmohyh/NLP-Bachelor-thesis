Television advertising directed toward young children - should that be allowed?
First of all there should be a way young children get to know about some specific toys or something to develop own decisions of what they like or do not like. This will be important for their later life.
But the media today influence children a way too much. Children always want to have the new cool things they saw in the TV because for them everything seems like a must-have. The producers of the advertising uses colorful and loud gadgets in their videos to support this thought of the children. So they make their profit based on the aspect that children can be influenced easily. 
On the one side it is just a product like a toy for example, and why should the producers of it should not be allowed to make advertising for their product? Of course they want to earn some money as well and they do not lie to the kids or promise them something absolut wrong, mostly they make children happy with their product but to reach this they need to make some advertising for their tool.
On the other hand a tool can make a child sad as easy as happy. When a child sees a tool and wants to have it so badly and even all his/her friends have this tool but the parents are just not able to buy it, the child will be very sad and might not feel integrated to his group of age anymore. 
Summarized, I think televison advertising for young children is acceptable in a certain way. It should not be too much and should not be based on influence the children to buy it, just a simply introduction of a product. In my opinion they are in a age they can start to develop a feeling for decisions in a slowly way, but in the todays media  exists to much supply for them, so that they are not able to have a wise decision.
