Television advertisisng directed toward young children

Most television advertisements are directed toward adults, so they will go to the store and buy these things. Although we do somethimes tend to get inflouenced by these advertisments, most of the time we just ignore them and hope they are over soon. However can young children do the same?

Having your children see television advertisments could save some time, because they have already seen what there is to buy and would not still have to look at everything in the store. At the same time, it might make the children more annoying, since they might not be able to ignore the advertisments and get inflouenced by them and want to have the things they advertise more than if they would only see the packaging in the store. It also helps not having to explain to the children what a certain thing does, because they have already seen the advertisement and know what the toy, or whatever was advertised can do.

Personally I believe that television advertising should be allowed, since it is another way the children learn, that they cannot have everything they want. Plus they learn to ignore the unuseful things in life like for example advertising.
