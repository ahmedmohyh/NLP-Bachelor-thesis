One site I agree with this statement but at the otherside I think we can't forbit children watching televison.

I have grown up in the year 1999. And my little brother in the year 2004. There are only five years between us,but so many things are completely diffrent. For example the consum of social media. 
So many children, don't go out for playing football or to meet other children. I see less children outside than ever before. And if my little brother asked his friends,if they wanted to come outside for playing football, they didn't wanted to come because they prefered to stay at home to play their video games. They wanted to stay at home,to watch the television, or wantend to play with their new I Phone. They had their own friends in their computerworld.  And I think this is so sad. When I was in that age, I played football or volleyball with all my friends outside. And my parents forbidden me watching the TV the whole afternoon. 
My opinion is, that it is totally okay, if children aged two to five watch television, but their parents should set limits, because small children can't say what's good for them. But their parents know it. And they should only permit their children, to watch movies or series, that aren't scary or something like that. 
I know that so many partents don't see what kind of movies their children watch. And that's terrible. 

But I kow there is nothing that we can do, the world is dominated by the new technology, and this technology is getting better and better. The new genaration needs a  Sream everywhere. It doesn't matter if this is an I Phone where they can watch TV or if this isa Television.
