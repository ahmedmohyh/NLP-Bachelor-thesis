The average person is confronted with advertisement of many kinds on a daily basis. Oftentimes we do not even take notice of the advertisement itself and the message it enforces on us, yet we are all subconciously influenced by it in our choices. The average adult person in most cases posesses the ability to distinguish between genuine information and advertising slogans. Therefore most people tolerate the poster in the bus station or the spots on televison between programmes. However, if advertisement is specifically directed toward very young children controversy is much higher. And there are quite a lot of people who even think that such a thing should be forbidden.

One of the main reasons why advertising aimed at children is viewed so negatively is that it can be harmful to their development. Advertisement in many cases teaches children certain values. As they have not fixed their own vlues  and are not yet able to distinguish the message of the advertisement from their own opinion, it can influence their behavoiur and how they percieve the world. Because for example TV spots are aimed at selling those children their product rather than educating them, these values are oftentimes not the best ones. 

A huge problem is also, that such advertisements are often either directed toward boys or girls, creating the problem that sexism is directly learnt bythe young audience. Boys are taught early on that cars are super fun and that they should go on adventures outside while girls are taught to love dolls and puppets and oftentimes also very unhealthy body immages are imposed on them.

In defence of advertisement for children one must say that in a free market economy, everyone should have the possibility to invest his or her mney as he or she pleases. Many companies direct their product directly toward a very young audiene and would lose a lot of revenue.
