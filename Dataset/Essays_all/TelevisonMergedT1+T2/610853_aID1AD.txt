In today's society advertising is a big part of television. These advertisment target different types of people and interests. And as it comes some also target young children between two and five years old. Obviously this brings several problems with it and the question is, if advertisment directed toward young children should be permitted or not. 
First of all advertisment is a way to earn money by making people buy the things which are showed in this advertisment. A big amount of companies use this tool what results in a big competition. Because of this competition each company tries to specializes themselves for one type of costumer. Taking that to consideration it is only logical that some are targeting young kids to prevent having a big competition what maximises their income. 
However, making advertisment meant for young children brings a probelm with it. These children are victims of the tactics of several companies. They know that children are an easy and vulnerable target because they are not advanced in their evolvement yet. Children are not able to evaluate situations like we adults do. Despite this knowledge the advertiser is ruthlessly using those children. Therefore, young childrens from age two to five are a victim of advertisement and should be protected. 
In order to sell a product many companies are using advertisment to make it look better. Over time the competition between those companies gets bigger and new targets have to be found - the kids. In their early stage of growth they are a good target and easily influenced. They are, in fact, victims. In order to preotect them advertising directed toward young children should be banned. Let the innocent young humans be safe and free from things which they are not able to handle.
