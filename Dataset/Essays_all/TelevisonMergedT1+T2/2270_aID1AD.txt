It has been always very controversy if direct television advertising direct toward children should be allowed. In the following essay I will have a look on the different perspectives.

First of all young children are not the only one who can be manipulated by advertisment. So the same issue appears with very old people. Nevertheless I think children should not be confronted with television ads because they you can not really say what effect this has on their development. The age from 2 to 5 is extremly important for their further life, so it would not be good, if they would be harmed by advertisment. But also I do not think it is really up to the Tv-Channels or advertisers todo not advertise for children. It is more up to the parents of the children to make sure their children do not watch TV-Channels with this advertisment. So the parents have the responsibility to care of their child. Also I do not really see the sense behind advertising to young children, because they are not the generation who buy a lot of things. On the other hand you can not estimate the power of advertising on the life of the children. So it is often a competition between companies to try who is the first to make the customer realize the product. Because of this they begin with the youngest customers possible. And this is alright because it is their right according to law.  

All in all I think in commercials advertising to young people is no no-go, but the companies should not be over do it due to not enough research on the effects to the development of children. But in my opinion children from 2-5 should not watch TV at all, especially not shows with included TV-spots.
