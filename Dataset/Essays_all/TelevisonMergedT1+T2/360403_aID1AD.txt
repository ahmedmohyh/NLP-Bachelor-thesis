Advertising in general can sometimes be something really powerful. Our world is full of it, especially in the television. Different companies try to sell teir stuff to a various amaount of people. For example an advertisment for toys is directed to a specific group of people: the children,who are going to play with the toys. But is it alright to show the advertisment to these young people? 

Children change their opinions every day. They are trying and seeing new things every day. They evolve. For this reason, they need an idol. Someone who shows them the world in a right way. They should learn from their own experiences. Not only the parents, friends or other relatives may be a huge influence,television advertising is as well. But is this advertising influence a good thing? It's not, because often you get a wrong picture of ethic values. For example there are rarly children in a televison advertising with black complexion, and if there is one it's mostly in the backgroud and not the main actor.
Secondly, the children are going to think, that they need to buy the toys andare going to ask their parents if they are going to buy it for them. So basically a company who directs the television advertising toward the children, are only using them to make profit. 

On the other hand children get the option to see what they could buy next or what they could want for christmas. Also they can get inspired. Me for example didn't always buy the toys I wanted, sometimes I made them by my own.

In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. The influence that it takes, is just to big. Children have other options to get to know the world and see what's out there.
