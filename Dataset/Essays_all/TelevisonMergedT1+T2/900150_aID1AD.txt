A lot of adverstising are directed to younger people mostly because of how easy it is to influence them. These adverstisings often lead to them wanting to buy a new toy or something comparable.The issue for me is clearly that children aged two to five are able to understand the advertising but haven't had enough education, preparation or just simply aren't old enough to understand the mechanism of these typ of advertising. A child aged two to five isn't very critical about the information he gets. In their young life they've just had little expierence with people other than their mother and family and some other same old friends. They just take everything sirious and belive evereything they are told because till that moment they haven't had any reason not to. Now these big enterprises come and try to make the biggest profit out of it by making them believe their toy is vital for being happy. I think it goes that far that you can't even talk of free will. It's like a brainwash they get and they are helpless. In comparison, someone older has seen thousand of advertisings and has been educated. They know behind these advertisings aren't good willing persons that just want to help them be happy, it's somoeone trying to make money.
Another problem is that these advertisings are directed to the children but in the end the one who pays for the product are their parents. So by directing to the children they're simply trying to avoid the parents and their more critical view. The enterprises manipulate children's undevelopped  mind to make profit from the parents. 
But I still don't fully agree with the statement at the top. These companies still have to have a way to show their products. The perfect solution would be more realistic advertisings.
