Today i would like to discuss the statement which says, that television advertising directed toward young children, who are aged two to five, should not be allowed.

Firstly the children could be manipulated easily. Children like this age don't have any life experiences so they don't know if they need theses thing or not.
Also they don't have any idea about money. They don't earn any money so they have to borrow it from their parents. If the parents don't want to buy the products which are supported in the advertisement, children could cry or damage something at home which cause familiary problems.

My first point for allowing advertisment toward young children is that it doesn't matter if they watch it. The parents still have something like the last word. Children need to ask their parents to buy the products for them so the advertisment towards them is close to useless, because the parents will think about that.
Secondly they often don't understand the advertisement. If there is a advertisement about something like a little bear, children of age two wouldn't understand any word.

In the end i would say that it doesn't matter if young children advertisement is allowed or not, because in age like two they won't understand them and in age five they need to ask their parents. If i need to be for one side i would support the statement that it shouldn't be allowed, because children in age five could cause some problems when they start to cry, when the parents says no.
