Imagine you were younger, remember your childhood when you were in the age between two and five. You probably watched tv and the advertisements very often. But should the advertising directed to young children be forbidden?

     The advertisemnt is very important to show the children which sweets or games are modern and where you can get them. Due to that  fact it is much easier to find a new present for their birthday or for other children. For example if the children watch a "HARIBO" advertisment on TV, they are interested in the new product and the parents going to buy it.

       Another positive aspect of the adverstising is that the kids think more about the different products which they could buy. After they watch some different ads they easily know which products they like the most and which ones not. The advertisemnt could help the children to built their own opinion about the products and compare it to other ones.  

    On the one hand the tv advertising helps the children to find new products and they can play with them together with friends, on the other hand the young children are influenced by the advertising in a negative way.    
        
For exemple they watch a commercial about a new "Barbie" and they just think about that "Barbie" and not about other products. The influence of the advertising is very onesided and the young children do not know much about other products, they are fixed on one product.
  The next negative point is that a young child thinks that he/she has to have the product and if the childe does not get the product, it could be less "cool".
 
                  In my opinion the advertising directed to young children should not be allowed due to the fact that it influences their opinion in a negative way. They are just fixed on one product and cannot think about ohter possibilities of the product. The advertising manipulates the children and they are victimes of the big companies which make a lot of money with the
