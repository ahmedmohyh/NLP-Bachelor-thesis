The question i am thinking about today is: Should advertising television directed toward young children (aged two to five) not be allowed? It is a good question in the modern technology time. I agree with this statement because I think, you can do a lot of better things than sitting in front of the tv to pass your childhood.

The main contra argument is, if young childrens be allowed to look television in their childhood, they can learn a lot of different new things for examples in  documentations. This could save the parents a lot of explainig and they would be able to do more other things while their kids are watching tv.

An other argument is, that if the little children are looking tv all day long, they won`t disturb their parents. So the parents haven`t that much stress and maybe would be a little bit calmer.

On the other hand, why should these little kids sitting on the couch watching tv the whole day? They could do so many better things. For example going outside and play with their siblings or neighbours, because a lot of the tv shows involve stupid or not necessairy things wich kids shouldn`t know.

An other advantage is, they learn so many different things about how beautiful life is.For this you don`t need a tv. Without one they are at the fresh air or doing something where they are moving and don`t sitting stare at the same point for hours.  

In conclusion, it would be the stupiest thing you could do as a parent, if you let your child passing his childhood in front of a tv. At some points it would get really boring and the kids don`t learn how to interract whit other humans and maybe later if their are older they are not good with social relations.
