''Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed``. Thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young children.I dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them.

 Every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child. Not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged two to five understand the things they see.Many parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kids.For me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem.

For me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic. Maybe because i am not a parent yet so its hard for me to find more arguments for and against the statement manchend at the begiining.
