Children are very often agree with the statements from the parents. They think all the things that they hear is all right and correct. We can connect this with the advertising. Sometimes a television advertisment is colourful, with music and some other brilliant aspects which the children loves. So they want to do the same things like the other children in the television. But they don't know what advertising mean. So the children have another perspective of the television, his advertisings and here meanings. Sometimes the parents need the children for living the dream that they couldn't. Many children are to young for decide alone But often the Childrens lean a lot from advertisings. Maybe they learn new words in different languages or they learn how to do something. 

In my opinion, the television advertising directed toward young children shoud be allowed. But it have to be a good combitation of learning what the advertising mean
