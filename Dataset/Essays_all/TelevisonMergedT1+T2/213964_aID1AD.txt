If a small child watches televison often, it gets to know advertisement, some of it is directed to them. Advertisement especially for young children is often discussed controversy. What are the main pros and cons?

Children need and want other things than adults. So it is legitime to advertise for products for kids as for example plays. Moreover, children might feel an unfairness if there's no advertisement directed toward their age. However, they can't cope with such thing as advertisement. On contrary to adults, children can't select between good and bad influences and they aren't as critish as older people may be. So if they see a product in an advertisement they believe that it's great, as the advertisement want them to think. The people who produce these spots know this exactely and abuse the children in this sense.

In general, children shouldn't be watching television too often because they only become dumb with what they see. Advertisement adds a quite big impact to this.

To sum up, I think that advertisement directed toward young children only has a bad influence on them. Advertisement is never good, but for young children it is even worse.
