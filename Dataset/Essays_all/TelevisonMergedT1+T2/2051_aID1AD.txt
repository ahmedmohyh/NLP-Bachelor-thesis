First of all the television is one of the tegnology thigs that children want to jouse. but if this is good or bad, that ist the questen we are tacking today. television gets more poplar and everyone whants to have it. ore ather thigs like handys and computer to do the same things ore ather stuff. kids films and other games are the moste uesed  think and the children get in a conversation withe the television. the eys geting bad and they need glasses. but the comunication gets better and better and worlds from the undersee and the univorse what perents only can show with books. living animels and flying fishes are interisting then just imagen it. the imadgening of children can help them later.   

i think that children from aged two to five should not be allowed to sit in frond of the television, for more then two houers a day. it is not goot to sit the moste of there live at the television and did not see the word. the bauteful of the naitger and there freedom in the world. the aktivitis and all they can do exept of sitting in frond of the television and just starring at the screen.
