Television is a daily theme. doesn't matter for who. Kids, teenager, adults everyone is confronted with that theme. But now we talk about how the advertisments are directed towards kids. Is that a good thing or not? Should it be allowed or not? Those are all questions we have to think about at latest when we are grown up and have kids. Would you like it if the TV advertisements are directed towards your kids?

There are always positive things about it and negative ones. Advertisements are a great way for kids to see something and learn about something. because while they're watching TV they also watch the avertisements in an intrested way. It's a good chance to let the kids see something they have to learn about anyways. But if the Advertisements are also the reason why kids know what they could have and if it's directed towards them they feel like they really have to have it and start wining about it infront of the parents.
Kids at the age of two mostly don't really get what they're watching and don't get really influenced by the comercials so if it's directed towards them they don't really notice that so it really doesn't matter. The way the advertisements are done matters though becaus eif there is some violence it can affect the kids and they just do what tehy see in the TV (advertisements). 

So I think it really matters what commerical it is, that is directed towards the kids and also how they're made because I think all kind of commercials, Series or DVD's don't just affect the kids also the parents and their parenting. If it's an advertisement about school or stuff for school or somethinglike that I think it's a good way to get the kids intressted to it and they'll look forward going to school.
