A lot of children are watching TV daily. This has something to do with the programms and everything children are advertised in the TV. If the children are watching TV so often they will get bad eyes and even they will not go outside. This is really bad for the health of the children. But if you can put the children in front of the TV at times you need to do something like preparing meals or journeys it is nice that children stay in front of the TV. Watching TV so often is still bad so young children need to do something else.
If the children is shown something on TV they often want to get it so parents are nerved by children who just want to get the toyce or whatever. By advertising the children the TV producents just need to work with nice colours, pirates or unicorns and then they catch the children. There are as well parents who are not that rich that they can buy everything the children want to have. But on the otherhand the children are shown thinks which they maybe want to get for birthday or christmas. If they have no idea what they want to get they get inspiried so they can make wishes out of it.
Finally you can  say advertising toward children is not good because they just want to get exactly those things and the parents are under pressure when they sometimes or often can not buy the child what he or she likes to have. It is horrible if building groups starts in the age of two. In the kindergarden they can start building groups of cool and borring people easier. Just because it is easy to impress little children you should not do this everywhere and non stop. Advertising should be stop by the TV industry or it should be forbidden by the TV channels so they do not show the advertisising.
