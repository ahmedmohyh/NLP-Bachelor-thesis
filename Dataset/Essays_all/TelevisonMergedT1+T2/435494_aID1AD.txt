The young children should go out and play with other children. They should discover the world and not wasting their time at home staring at the television. Because if they don't learn to go out that will never change. Human beings aren't made to stay only at home and that's the biggest danger for the young children. 

And also the UV-rays can be dangerous for these. We all know that the technology isn't very healthy for us. That's a reason why we should short the using of technology.

Of course there is also a good thing of looking television, especially for kids. So they can learn something new. Young children (aged two to five) are in the phase where they first must learn the language. So television is a good thing to learn a lot of new words. 

So I'm not definitively agree with this statement. It should not be disallowed but the parents should take care of the young children that they don't stare the hole day at the television.
