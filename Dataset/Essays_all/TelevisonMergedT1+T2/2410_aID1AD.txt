Television advertising toward young children is an often discussed topic these days.In the following text i am goingt to state my opinion if television advertising toward young children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
First of all it has become a normal thing that most of the children are allowed to wacht TV. A few years ago like back when i was a kid we only had one Tv in our house so i couldnt watch Tv whenever i wantedt to. 
When i see little children nowdays they watch TV like everyday.That means companies know it is a good idea to put advertising in between Tv-shows to reach many viewers.
They see so much advertising or hear it from friends so in my opinion it is okay to show some of it on TV.
But there should also be a limit. 
In general i think children with the age of two to five should not sit in front of a TV that often. They are so young and parents should definitly control theitr children TV consume. 
Children are easily to influcene so TV companies know how to produce smart advertising. They mostly believe everything they see or hear. I think if we all look back the world when we where young looked pretty different in our eyes.
So in conclusion television advertising for young children should have a limit because children are easy to influence with that the advertising can change their behavior and mind.
