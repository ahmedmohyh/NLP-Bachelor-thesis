The topic " television advertising directed toward young children" is a good example to show how people addicted to television. Young children grown up with it and do not understand that their are addicted to it. It is possible when their older that all activities are watching TV or playing games and chilling at home because they don´t know what means playing outside with friends or going to swim. They are addicted to the little piece of glass which isn´t their fault because their parent aren´t better then them. Also when the children looking TV with their parent they also look series they don´t make for their age like " How I met youre mother" or "The big bang theorie". Their dream about something like that and can not sleep anymore. On TV it´s given series like " Spongebob Squarepants" or "Timmy Turner" which got an negative effect on them. 
I think younger children should be addicted to play outside or playing with things for their age like Playmobile or Cars.
