It is a controversial topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. 

Of course, the industry wants to make as much money with their products as possible but should they use children too reach their goal? 
On the one hand it is important for buisness to use advertises to make their products popular and they have to be directed to the group the product is about but on the other hand even if a child likes a product from an advertisement it has not the money to buy it. 
Furthermore are children from two to five very easy to influence and it is unfair to use this. 
In addition to this, children are not able to decide what is good for them and what not. If there is for example a television advertisement about sweets which could damage the teeth of children no child would care about it if they look yummy and buy them anyway.

In conclusion I think that it should not be allowed to use television advertising directed toward young children because they can be influenced to easy what is against the moral.
