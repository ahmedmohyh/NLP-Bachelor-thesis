In the last five years more children in the age of two to five started watching televion for more than three hours a day. The reason for that is that the television advertise directly toward young children.
On one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people. Many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn for example languages like english or french. As a consequence of this children already learn even in a young age how to speak an other language, so they will may be better when they will come to school and started learning this language there.
On the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day, they have no time to do other things, like going outsite and playing with friends. But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.
So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up. But if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts, so it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people.
