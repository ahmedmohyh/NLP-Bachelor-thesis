Television adertising is a normal thing in our society. But should it be towards young children? The opinions are different if it should be allowed or not.
Why should you have advertising for anyone else than for these kids? And why exactly during this age? If the product is for this age you have to advertise it in this group of children. They have to see it and not the children in other ages because they maybe can't relay to that anymore. 
Critics say that the parents should see the advertise because they are the ones who have to by the stuff. So there isn't the need for the adcvertising because the kids are to young to by susch things. If the children see the product, for example a teddybear, they always go to their parents and ask for it. Maybe it could stress them and it is nerving. Lastly, the kids during this age should not sit in front of the TV that much. It is not good for them. They should go out and see the world.
I think, as a mother of a child i would be against television advertsising but as a person who tries to sell things for the children in this age I can understand, that it is important and it should be allowed.
