I think wherter television advertising directed toward young children is allowed or not doesn't matter.
Children at this age don't watch that much television, or at least they shoulden't. Also, they may be easily influenced, but even if they do watch it, they don't have their own money yet. Their parents are the ones to decide what they get and what not. Of course there are parents whom will give their child everything they want, but even then it's still the desicion of an adult.
When I was a child I saw a toy in television, it was a plush dog which could walk. Looking back it was really stupid, but for a child of course it looked like it was almost like having a real dog. So I beged my parents to get me one, but as an adult they knew it was stupid and that I would only play with it a week at most, so they didn't get me one.
All in all this means the advertising is still directed toward adults. It's just a diffrent kind of advertising. It's trough their own children. This may have an effect on how many toys, or whatever it is they sell, they sell, but it has no effect on the children. They will forget about it soon enough.
Of course you could say, they grow up to a world where you can buy everything you want and as much as you want, but even if it weren't allowed, there is still a lot of other advertising. If it is directed towards them or not doesn't matter here. In my opinion they simply shoulden't watch that much television, then we wouldn't have to worry about it this much.
