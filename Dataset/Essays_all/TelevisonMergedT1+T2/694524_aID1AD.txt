Advertising in general influence people. If you reached yet the adulty age (eighteen years) you should be able to value the things you've seen in television. In the early childhood this might be difficult. Also because you dont't have yet the same knowledge than persons (for example parents) with higher ages.
 
Children aged two to five in general aren't able to see positive or negative aspects of the things they've been seen in television. Children are influenced by this television advertisings and they really want to follow them up, although they can't value if it's good or bad for them. Or when they see something attractive for them, they really want to have these staffs. This things might be a big problem for the parents. 
On the other hand you could see a positive point in the fact, that children have to learn to deal with this theme. Earlier or later they have to separate good and bad by their own oppinion. The parents have to inform children and sumit them on some rules. So they take a very importent position in thei children's life. With that there is the possibility to learn to cope with all that in a positive way. Like always there are positive examples but also negative ones.
 
In my oppinion this is very difficult to cope with because I asked my self how they would be able to different this young children to the other ones. Furthermore I think that the parents should be responsable enough to look after their children. Evenmore because they were capable to create this children.
