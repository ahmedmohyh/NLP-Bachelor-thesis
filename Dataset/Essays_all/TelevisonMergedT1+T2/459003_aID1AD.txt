In the last years the amount of people who watch regularly some pogramms on the televison has increased. Nearly every household has one at home and no matter which age, there is a good programme for everyone. We are all used to the adverts in the breaks. But should it be allowed to direct them to young children aged two to five?
The biggest effect of those adverts for children will be on the parents. Imagine during christmas time, when they see their funny toys they would like to have everyday in the television. If they don't get it on Christmas Eve they'll be very disappointed. For the parents it's difficult to enhance the children to play with their old toys because they can see everyday the new toys. 
On the other hand it is defenitely an advantage for the shops who sell the toys from the adverts. They'll be able to sell much more of them to the customers. They can increase their gain. With television advertising they can talk to much more people than just with some adverts in the streets.  
There might be another advantage for very strict parents. They can show there children that they can't get everything they want. But children who are only aged two to five might not understand this.
The question we have to ask us now is, if it's okey when we allow this just for some economic reasons. In my opinion it's much more important to protect the children from all those technological stuff so that they can grow up in a safe environment. When they get older they will make anyway enough experiences with all those advertisments. And in the other hand I'm sure that if this would be allowed there are going to be a lot more spoilt kids. In the end I think that there are more disadvantages than advantages, therefore I think it shouldn't be allowed to direct television advertising to young children.
