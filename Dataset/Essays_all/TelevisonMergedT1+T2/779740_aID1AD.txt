Television advertising

This following statement is difficult to answer. Television in general is not every time to support. As specialy not for young children who are two or five years old. Young children in this age should do intelligent things like play with others. They should not watch television all the time. 

So It`s not right that television is directed toward young children. Because they are affected of what they get to see in television. They mostly don`t really realise what they are watching and are fascinated of everything.
A child with two years can`t decide anything alone. It needs some help with decisions. So parents can control what they are watching on the television.

My personal opinion is that I don`t agree the statement `Television advertising dircted toward young people`. Children should watch less TV, so they get less influeced by it. It`s not right that adult people are leading the children to watch television. Parents should play more with they`re children and don`t set them in front of a television.
