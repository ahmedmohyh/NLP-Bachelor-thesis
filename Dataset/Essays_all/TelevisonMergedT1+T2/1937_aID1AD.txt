Television advertising is and are programs and shows for little kids which are ment to teach the kids specific topics.

Television advertising is for families where the parents don`t are willing or are not abel to spend time with their kids and practise with them. So these programs help the kids to learn, to speak and so on. However kids must learn from their parents or other humans, if a normal education is wanted. The TV or a computer are not as good as humans for kids. Furthermore such programs are far from perfect and often show a different point of view on the world than in real life. A good example would be a viedeo where animals are explained on soft figures. These figures all have the same tall and sometimes a different color than the real animals. Furthermore the kids then develop a relationship to such programs, videos or the computer and not to the humans. This could result in real social problems when the kid grows up.The kids also learn to speak when they watch, hear and somehow feel their parents or other humans speak. This is just given with television advertising.

To sum it up, i definietly think that television advertising is not good for the kids and should not be allowed. If the parents have probolems with time for their kids they should look for help in institutions and should not use the TV or the computer for their kids.
