Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

In our time, the media, including television, radio and social networks, make a great impact on our lives. If we have a question and can not seem to find any answer, we look for it in the internet. We believe most of the things, we are shown from the media. But to be fair, I do not think that some advertisings should be forbidden because of the age, that advertising is directed toward.

Television advertising is for companies to be more popular, because most of the time, many people are watching it. If they are more popular, more people are convinced, that that product is right for them and there is a higher chance that they are going to buy it. Therefore, the companies can make more money with advertising. All this does not make sense to children at the age of two to five. I do not think that they are watching a lot of television and even if they did, they would not realise what they are actually watching. 

Adults, on the other hand, are watching those advertisings and are old enough to decide, if the product shown is useful for them or their children or not. This results in companies trying to achieve the ability to convince parents and not children. If they are trying to convince children, they want to manipulate them so that they will convince their parents themselves but at that young age, it does not seem very efficient to me.

To conclude, I do not think that television advertising toward such young children makes sense but in my opinion, if they want to do this, they can. It should not be disallowed because I do not think that it has a bad impact on those children or their parents.
