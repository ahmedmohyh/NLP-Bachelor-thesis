Many young children watch TV on a daily basis. Mostly they do not only watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising. 
Of course,advertising is not bad in general but it could lead to arguments within the family. For example because the children want their parents to buy a new toy that they saw in the TV. The parents could easily get annoyed if their kid always asks for new thiongs to try. And as all of us know, advertising often does not promote the truth. That is another negative aspect because we, the consumers tend to believe anything that is told on TV and we spend a lot of money because we want our kids to be happy and we want them to have a childhood that is worth to be remembered.
Also many advertisements are not useful and distract children from learning things that are important. They may try what is shown and get hurt.

On the other hand it does not really matter if they watch it. They easily get used to it and get inspirde to try new things at a young age and that is not bad at all. 
They do not even pay attention to what is shown and often get distracted. 
And I think that the parents should be able to control what their children are watching, they should dicide what is good for their kid and what is not.

To sum it up, I am of the opinion that it does not matter if a child watches televisdion advertising or not.
