This is a good statement in my eyes. On the one hand it has many parents how just put their children in front of the television because they say a television advertising and found this good. Probably they find that at the age between two and five the children learn quick and should learn many things. A television is good, because the children then are quiet or they haven't so much time to look every single moment to the kids so it is a good opportunity to "put" the kids away. In the advertising sais that the children learn and they think, this is a good way.
On the other hand this is not good. Children is this ages have to experiment on their own in the nature. This people find that television advertising should be not allowed. In the advertising mostly cames that this is good for the child and it looks so good. Advertising are short and you don't see the result. The companis, wich make advertising just make this without thinking how this children grows with this influence. That the children doesn't can touch the things on the screen they don't realise. In this part of the age this is one of the most importantes things ever.
I think that it can be allowed but it is not good for the children and the parents. When you have a child in this ages it is funny to go outside and play with your children. See how it grows and see how the real world looks like. In this ages it is important that they experiment, make mistakes and be happy. Tlevision advertising are allowed but not so good.
