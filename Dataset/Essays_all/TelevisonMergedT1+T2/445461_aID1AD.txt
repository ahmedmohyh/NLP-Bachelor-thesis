First things first the television is a normal thing today and it belongs to the childhood. So it isn't an good idea to take this away. It's just good if the children learn how to deal with things like this. We live in a world where the people have to accept the developement of new things and this will also be an important thing for the future. 

Television advertising should not be allowed because the skills of young children could become worse. Television makes children unconcentrated and nervous. So in school the children can't make good marks and their future is in danger.

But television advertising isn't that bad if you have some laws. Over a short part of time it haven't any bad consequences. It helps the children to develope their minds and creativity. They get new ideas and learn how to put them into reality.

Another point is that the health could become bad. The eyes are an important area. So in the worst case the parents of the children have to buy some glasses or the children have to go to the doctor. This have also quite big consequences for the future of the children.

So as a conclusion I would say that television advertising toward young children isn't that bad. But we have to take care of our children because everthing have consequences for their future. So it's our task to make laws and to control the consumation of television. Of course it's important that we have a look on what our children are watching and in which amount.
