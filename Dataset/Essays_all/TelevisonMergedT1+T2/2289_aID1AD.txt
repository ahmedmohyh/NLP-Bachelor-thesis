I think that children from two to five could be too much influenced by this advertising. They are too young to realize advertisements as advertisements. They are often trapped by the slogans or the things named by the concerns in the advertisement. 

But there are also much influenced by there parents. They could pay more attetion on what the children is watching and could maybe explain them the reasons of advertisements and why they are made this way. So the advertisements could be explained or by the parents to make it more easy for the children. It also would help to just talk about the things they just saw in TV.

I think that this kind of advertisemnet should be forbidden, because young children have no real mind and are influenced by too much thinks they still don´t know good enough or they don´t learn how to do with advertisemnets. The parents also should pay more attention on what the children are watching on TV or just start to explain, how advertisment is working to give them the chance to realize what they are watching. But I would be very hard to stop concerns produce this kind of advertisemnt, because the would lose huge amounts of money. So maybe the best steps are to make the advertisments more understandable for young children and to slowly start to stop producing them.
