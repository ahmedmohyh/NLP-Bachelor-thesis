One reason for not allowing advertising directed to small children is that children shouldn't be influenced by advertising already in such a young age. When they grow up, they will understand what advertising is about. But a two-years old can't even understand the meaning of a televison advertising and they don't realize that in advertising are made promisses that aren't true. At that age they can't decide what they need or what they don't need.
One more reason against allowing advertising for young children is that a child doesn't understand how much a toy from an advertising costs, but although they will want to have it. So the parents are under a big pressure and they almost have to buy the toys from the advertising. That means that advertising for young children doesn't only disturb children but also their parents.
One reason for allowing advertising for small children is that the adults also have advertising for them, so why shouldn't children? The adults and the children should be treatened the same way.
The next reason for allowing advertising for young children is that if there was no advertising for the children, they would have to watch the advertising for adults. But children maybe don't understand what the advertising is about and they could be shocked by the content. So it is better to let the children watch advertising directed to children than to let them watch advertising for adults.
My opinion on this topic is that advertising directed to children shouldn't be allowed, because I think children shouldn't get influenced by advertising. The industry shouldn't say the children which toys are cool or popular, the children should have the right to don't be influenced by the main stream.
