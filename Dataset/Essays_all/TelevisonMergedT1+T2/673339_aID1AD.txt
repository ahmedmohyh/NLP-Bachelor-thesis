I do think that these young children can be baited way too easy. But I dont think its a bad thing to have advertises towards them. When I was young and would watch television I wouldn't notice that there is much advertising. I just wanted to watch my favorite show and nothing else. If the pause during two episodes would be too long because there was too much advertising I got annoyed.

Some products are designed for young children, so why shouldn't you be able to advertise towards them?
When a mother sees an advertisement for the newest and best toy, she wouldn't just immediately think of buying it. 
But when her son watches the same advertisement, he would stop begging her to buy it until he will get it.

Children shouldn't be exposed to advertising that early. Later in their life they will be facing an uncountable amount of advertisements. At a young age their opinion can be chaned very easily, it need time to grow up an build an own opinion wich really represents what you are thinking.
 
I think people would like to have advertising towards young children banned because they think that these young children will get baited way too easy and kinda fall for the advertisement. You should also consider the situation I mentioned above, the mother doesn't want to buy a new toy for her children, so she doesn't want her child to be exposed to those advertisements. In my opinion it shouldn't be banned. Advertising will become more important in the next ten years, so children will have to face it even if they wouldn't like to. It is much easier to learn things when one is young and what we learn then is waht we will keep in our mind, so if a child is exposed to advertising very soon it will be able to easily handle with it later on in their life.
