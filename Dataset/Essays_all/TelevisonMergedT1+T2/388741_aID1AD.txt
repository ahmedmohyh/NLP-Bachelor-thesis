Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe.

This is a very important question. I think there are many diffrent arguments with pro and contra opinions and it could be a very intresting disscusion between some parents and teenager. 

First of all i think the children are so young and movements are very important for their body. They need to go out and play with some other children. They need the fresh air and they have to have fun. But the parents have an important rule. They decide when they go out and play some football, they decide when they stay at home and watch some television...

But actually to watch some television isn't so bad. You can learn some great things. For example there is a show in which a little girl explanes some things in english or sometimes they show how to life. In the television they are always friendly, happy, helpfully and they have fun. So the little children can learn something but they have to know: It's not real. 

The fazit is, the children have to move but it's also good to watch some television.(But not to often) Maybe you can allowed the children to watch some tv when they've done somthing really good...
