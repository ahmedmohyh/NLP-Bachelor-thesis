"Mommy I want to go to McDonalds", said the three year old girl to her mother. Many people are familiar with this situation. The girl saw Ronald McDonald on tv and now she wants to go to McDonald. But should such advertisment for young children be allowed?

One advantage of this advertisment is that the children are informed about their environment at a young age. They might know where the closest pharmacy is at and where they have to go in an emergency. But on the negative side the children get manipulated by the companies. They see an advertisment about some toy and emediatley want this toy. Their needs after material satisfaction gets bigger and bigger. Furthermore it is difficult for the parents when their children have many material wishes and they can't fullfill them. An other disadvantage is that the children want more electrical things through this advertisment and might forget to go and play outside. It's important for a child to meet friends and play with them some games like hide and seek. In fact the kids should explore the nature instead of the television. On the plus side the kids could develope their caracter earlier. For example they see some dolls in an ad and don't want them. But then they see some teddybears and want one for christmas. So the parents know what their child prefers and now they can get the perfect gift. But this would make the happiness of a child dependent of their material gifts. It shouldn't be a childs focus if they got this shoes or those shoes.

I think it's a bad idea to manipulate children at a young age to get more profit as a company. In conclusion advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden. They should rather play outside with some friends and explore the world.
