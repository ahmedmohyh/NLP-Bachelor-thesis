Essay

In this essay I write about television advertising directed toward young children. I will explain some pros and cons to the statement, which was given us above.

In my opinion there is nothing wrong when young children watch television. I think when they want to watch their serie in the evening to slow down it is a good oppertunity to show them how to come along with the new medias. Nowadays watching television is maybe the most normal thing. It is copmarable with other things which where unacceptable for children a few years ago but now have got a normal thing.
But I am glad, that I could not watch TV al the time when I was young. Because I think children learn more in the real world and it is important for children to play a lot an have friends with whom they can have adventures. Also watching television in asbolutely not necessairy. Especially not for children aged two to five. They have to learn that the life is not about TV stars and shows but more about friends and living its own life. If they are to often confronted with such things they can get aggressive and unsociable. 
So my own children will have a fix, short time when they are allowed to watch what is good for them.

In conclusion watching television has both pros and cons. In my opinion it is more about the question how long and what they are allowed to watch.
