Advertising

A lot of liitle children grow up with a televison and with televsion you also have advertisement. Some Advertisement is good some is bad. Some People like avdvertisment some not.It all depends on the person himself and so you can choose if you want advertisement for your child or not. And now the question comes up : Is advertising for young children good or not?

You have Advertisement all over the world. For Food, for clothes, for parfumes etc., so it's impossible that you can grow up without advertisement. Young Children are addicted to advertisement cause if they see something they like in tv, they want to have it. And you know how little child are, they won't stop crying and be bad with you aslong they got it. And so companies can manipulate parents with their own childs. 

On the side of the companies it's a good tool to sell their products, because adults won't buy ( normaly) stuff they don't need. And with their childs they have a weak point. It's sounds really bad but that's the reality. And with that weak point, companies can sell a lot more products. 

On the other side parents want to buy something for their child and with avdvertisement they see what their childs could like. But you have so much advertisement for anything that you have problems to check out if this product is even good.

On my opinion i would let the companies made some advertisement for young childs just for some companies. Like Toys a Rus or Franz Carl Weber or some Free time parks like europa park.But for all other companies it shouldn't be aloud. Cause these companies won't sell good products for childs, they want to sell cheap products for adults and they use the weak point child.
