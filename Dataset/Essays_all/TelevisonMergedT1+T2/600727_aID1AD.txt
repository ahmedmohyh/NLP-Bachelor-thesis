Every evening thousands of children from all over watch television. There are special children programs but even on them there is advertising. But why children have to watch this? Shoud it even be forbidden to do advertising directed towards young chidren? In the following text I'll show some pros and cons an my opinion. 
One reason why chidren shouldn't have to watch it is that they even don't have money to buy something. The advertisment on the Television is just for adults. And it is planed that the children ask their parents to buy something they've seen in the advertisment. For instance if a little girls sees an pink, fluffy unicorn in an advertisment she cries as long as the parents buy it for her. It is influence and not fair. Children shoud enjoy their lives as long as they can. Nobody like to watch advertisment and everybody is angry when it comes during a film. From year to year there is more and more. When it goes on like this we won't watch something else on TV. And then even our children should have the choise watch something else. 
On the other side later they are anyway confronted with this world. It would be nice to stop the advertisment on television but it is unthinkable. We live in a word full of advertisment and marketing. Adults and adolecent have to watch it too. It doesn't hurt a for example four year old boy to see it on the TV. Yes, it's influence and perhaps boring but not dangerous. And their parents are also old enough to say no, if they don't want to buy anything. If the parents don't want their children to watch it they can forbid them to watch all kind of television. 
In conclusion advertisment directed towards young children doen't make any sense. In my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless.
