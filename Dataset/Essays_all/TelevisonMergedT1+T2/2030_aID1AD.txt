Should television advertising directed to young children not be allowed? 
Kids are wonderful. Especially when they are at the age from two to five they see and learn new things all day and it is a blessing to be able to watch that.
And parents are playing a big role in this learning process. 

Now imagine the kids are watching TV and they are trying to understand all these advertisements. They would asked questions like "what is he doing there?" or "why is he doing this or that?" or "what does this or that mean?" which is normal for kids.
But wouldn`t it be beautiful to see the children noticing and learning all these things by themself? Because in the television not everything is good. There are also strange and sometimes also bad things in advertisements which I don`t want my kid to learn from the TV.

I mean don`t get me wrong advertisements are not usually bad  they are actually pretty good often in times. People are always searching for new ideas of getting the attention of the whole world which is pretty impressive on my opinion. I just think that there are better ways for young children to understand life and get used to everything. It is just way better to play in the garden and enjoy the nature for example.
