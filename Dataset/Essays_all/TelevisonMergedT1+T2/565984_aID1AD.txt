There are many advertising for toys or other things directed toward young children. And in many cases the children want to have the advertised stuff. That's because children are easier to affect and manipulate. But should it be allowed?
The good thing is that children can have very fun with toys and if the companies advertise their things in television they can see it. Another reason is that most of the children who are between two to five stay home all day so they can see the advertisment many times per day. So perhaps a child who is bored wants to watch television and if he sees a toy and his parents buy it to him he is no longer bored and plays with the toy instead of watching TV. So in this case it would be good to advertise toys.
But on the other side for parents who are really poor this isn't a good thing. Children want everything and if they don't get it they'll be mad. And if the parents can't afford it this could really create problems un the family when the young child is crying everytime. Another contra argument is that children's mind isn't clear as an adults yet. So they want really everything they see in TV even the unnecessary stuff.
In my opinion it should not be allowed because children are so easy to manipulate with tthe advertisment and for poor parents it could really cause problems. And the advertisment industry knows how to manipulate people and they will do it without any problem.
