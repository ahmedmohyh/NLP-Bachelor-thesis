What makes a successful business? Is it the number of products sold? Or the revenue? This is a well argued question all over the world. What all economists agree on, is the fact that a successful business can just be created by a well planed marketing concept. The main focus of such a concept lies on the different ways of advertising. Pobably the most successful way of advertising a product these days is the media. Is there a better way to bring your advertisement to potential costumers than by streaming it right into their living room? Television advertising has become much more popular over the last few years, but shall such ads be directed to young children between two to five years?
For sure, there may be some success with that. Young children are really easy to manipulate and as soon as they see something they want, they will probably argue with their parents about it until they give in. The businessman is happy, the child as well, so it is a happy ending, right? Wrong...
By directing their advertisements direct to young children,the businessman has to face severe moral and ethnical issues. They bet their money on the assumption, that kids these days hang out in front of the television all day long and that they do not have enough respect from their parents to accept the so called NO-decision. Businesses should not be promoting such family sircumstances and behaviour by making their company rely on them.
So even though a company could probably increase their revenue by directing television advertisements to young children, they should for moral as well as for ethnical reasons not do so.
