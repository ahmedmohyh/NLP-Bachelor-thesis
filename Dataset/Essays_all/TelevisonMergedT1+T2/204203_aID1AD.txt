Sometimes when I sit infront of the TV at home there are these ads, which are obviously made for children.

To this, there are many positive, but as well neative points to this. At first, what is the point of an ad? It is to sell something. But to sell something to a child is not really fair, because a child of the mentioned age (two to five) is not really able to make decisions in wether he would spend an amount of money for something or not. The professionals behind these ads have to know this, so they are using kids in an unfair way to make money an adult wouldn't spend.

Despite of this, there are few positive things about it as well, for example the kids would see some things their parents wouldn't show or even buy them. The kids are a little bit more independent from their parents, they can choose the toys they like themselves and not the ones their parents like them to play with. But there is the next negative point: Kids change their minds very fast, so if they had money, they would buy just everything they like, what is quite much. So obviously as a parent, you can't just buy anything your child would like to have, which would make your child unhappy, what would make you angry and so on. And a next reason for not being necessary is that when you take your child to a shopping mall, they can see all those things as well, and then choose a few. And the  parents would still know what their child likes. 
In my very own oppinion, these ads are quite unnecessary and using the kids ability to not consider seriously wether something is usefull and a funny toy or just stupid. And they are trying to set the kids up against their parents if the kid would like to have something, but the parents wouldn't let them. Maybe the advertising people just didn't consider, but it could easily happen.
