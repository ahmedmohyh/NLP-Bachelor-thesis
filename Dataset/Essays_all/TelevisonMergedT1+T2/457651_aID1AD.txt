In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children can be manipulated so that the children want something that isn't necessary. But on the other hand a child at the age of two doesn't understand what is going on that much and the advertises are usually going to be about a toy for children.

Children want allways something they like. On television they see many different things. And if they like something and see it in a shop for example they throw a tantrum because of how much they want it. And if advertisements are directed toward children the parents have to deal more with the problem that their child wants something so badly but they don't want to buy it.

A child that watches TV doesn't understand what he sees. He just can deside if he likes what he's watching or if not.For example if a three year old boy watches TV, it wants to see its favorite show and not some advertisement about some special dolls. So it wont even look at the advertise.

The company's have to think about how to advertise their product towards young children. They know that children don't care about school stuff or a new chair. But they know that children always want new toys. So towards young children they have to advertise mostly toys. 

There are some negative sides and some positive sides to the advertisement toward young children. In my opinion television advertising directed towards can be allowed because I don't think that the advertises are going to be bad for the children. The only problem is to resist the needs of the children.
