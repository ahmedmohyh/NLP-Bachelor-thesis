Imagine you are sitting in front of your TV with your children. The movie is so ripping and you can't wait until the end. But then, suddenly the TV-advertising is coming. You know that your children have to go to bed in the next 15 minutes, but the movie is going a little longer. So what should you do? Bring them to bed and having a big argument with them or let them watching until the end? If there wouldn't have been the TV-advertising, they had been on the right time in bed. So should we forbid advertising directed toward young children in the age of 2-5?

First, like I've told before, when there is an interruption between a movie, the child has more time for staying up. Every person hates when you can't watch your movie until the end. Especially when you are a child. Parents today allow children to watch the movie to the end. So when there is more interruption between, the child can stay longer up. So it is a benefit for him, but not for the parents

In the TV-advertising there are often a lot of things for playing presented. When a child sees that, it automaticly wants to have it. E.g when it sees the brand new playstation. That's the biggest dream of a child. So he can play it wiht all of his friends. But who will pay it? Right, the parents. And if they won't pay, the child gets very said. 

.TV-Advertising is one of the important things for a TV channel to earn money. Who has ever thought about the producer? They also have a job and the aim is to earn money of that and also give the people something to relax (watching TV). 

When I was a child, I also hated the TV-advertising. But I learned to live with it. At some point in your life you have to accept that. And today there are lots of other possibilities where you can record a movie and then watch it at any time you want. So I don't see any reason of give a forbition of TV-advertising for childrens.
