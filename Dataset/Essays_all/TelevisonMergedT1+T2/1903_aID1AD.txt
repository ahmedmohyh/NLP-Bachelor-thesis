My Essay will tell you about my opinion abot ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shold be allowed.''.
I think this topic is very difficult, because it always depends on the TV-show or film they watch and the time children are spending on watching TV.
On the one handit can never be good for the future, when a child siting in front of the television, all day long. If they are siting there the whole day it will be very bad for them, because they have to learn e.g. social interaction. In the age of two to five children have to lern speaking, drawing and many other things. 
It is also a poor statement for those parents, who are leaving them allone in front of the TV. Children in this age have to speak with there parents for learning to speck correctly. 
In my opinion reading books (by them-self or outreading by their parents) could be much better for children, because they can create a story on there one head.
On the other hand e.g. some Walt Disney movies can be very important for children,while watching them they are learning some important ethical ''rules''. This ethical rules are very important for children to know for there whole life. If parents are not abled to tell theire children this rules by life, they have to learn it in another way. 
All in all my opinion is children watching television can be okay, if they aren't sitting there all day long. Maybe a half to one hour and a half hour will be okay, but this depends on the child. If the TV is always there instead of the parents, the child couldn't become a social person. I think for the children outreading a book by the parents, the grandmother or anyone else will be very much better. Even if they can not read by there own, the children will imagine the story in there head and will paint pictures on there own, this is very good for there creativity. And if we never learn to be creative, what is the difference between us and our pets at home, or any other animal?
