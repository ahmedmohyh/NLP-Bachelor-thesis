The statement I write about in this text is: "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". And I fully agree with that statement because these advertisements are often shown on TV-channels that are for kids and a lot of kids are watching these channels. Of course it makes sense for the companies to show their advertisements on one of these channels because they can direct it to the right buyer-group. But that's the problem, are children really a serious buyer-group, who can go to the store, make decisions what they really need? No, they mostly can't. In fact they wan't every single product shown in the advertising. So they will run to there parents ask them to get it and if they won't get it, they will be sad and also angry at there parents. But on the other hand they should learn, that they can't have everything in life and that the job of advertising is to get you to want to buy this particular product. They should learn that advertising isn't always the truth and can be misleading. That's the positive point about the advertising that is directed direct to them, because they can learn that early in life and will not be confronted with that, when they will be older and the advertising will be directed again direct to them, but not to a kid but to an adult.
So I think it shouldn't be allowed to advertise directly to children but the impact of the children depends on them and there parents. h
