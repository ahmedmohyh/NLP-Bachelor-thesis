I agree that young children should not be allowed to watch too much TV because of the television advertising. 

The TV is probably the most common media around the world and every modern household has one or more. It´s really fun to watch movies, shows and so on with the whole family but also alone. It´s entertaining and a part of the todays society. When I think about my childhood, I remember all these kids shows which I watched with my parents with all these characters and their names which I remember till today. The TV is a popular media for every age and there should be an oppertunity for every kid to experience it.
The real problem about TV are the ads, or television advertising, which are annoying for all of us. When we watch a movie, there are always breaks about five till ten minutes where they show us the most popular products and so on. But it´s not only annoying, it also influences us because music, background colour and much more create a new picture of the product in our head. We start to really want to have these products and kids shouldn´t be influenced like that at such a young age.
I guess that TV shows and movies are always connected with ads and it´s not possible to have the whole "TV experience" without the annoying ads. I think kids still should have the chance to watch the kids shows and talk with their friends about it but only for a specific amount of time so they don´t get to influenced by the advertising. There should be a TV channel only for kids without ads so the parents can relax and don´t have to worry.
Still the kids shouldn´t watch too much TV because sometimes it´s much more fun to play outside with their friends. 

Because of these reasons I agree that yound children should not be allowed to watch too much TV because of the television advertising but they should have the oppertunity to experience this kind of media.
