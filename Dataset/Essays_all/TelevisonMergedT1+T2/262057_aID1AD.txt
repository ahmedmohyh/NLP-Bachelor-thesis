Advertising for children aged two to five

First of all I do not believe that advertisings for children are really useful for both sides for the children and the companies. I think that television advertisings are not good for the development of the children because the influence of the advertisings affects the thinking of the child permanently. These advertisings could affect the thinking of a baby for a lifetime. On the other side I do not believe that children aged two to five will get much out of these advertisings. Children aged two to five should not watch television the hole day anyway, they should go outside and explore their enviroment. On the other hand I do not believe that this advertisings are worth the money because children between two and five do not watch that much television and they can not go and buy these products from the advertising so their parents will make the choice to buy it or not. So the advertising for toys or something else should be adressed to the parents.

In the end I think the parents are responsible for their child and they should know whats the best for their child so they could decide how often their child watch television. So the parents could decide how often the child is confronted with advertisings for children. So my opinion is that the advertising for children between two and five should not be forbidden because it would be a unnessecary law beecause in the end the parents can decide if it is good or not for their child. So the parents are responsible for the mental health of the child.
