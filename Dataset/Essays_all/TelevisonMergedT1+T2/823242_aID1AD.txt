I think that advertisements in general are nothing that should be prohibited in general. Every company should be allowed to make advertisements, wherever they want to. It may be true that children at that age are very easy to trick into thinking they want something even though they don't have an use for it. One could say, that it's unfair in general to 'use' someone for your own interest, especially children who aren't as suspicious as grown men and women and still believe (almost) everything they hear. Especially on tv which most small children have access to. 
On the other side, who should the company address its advertisemments to, if not to the group of people the product is destined for? Who would make an advertisement about princess dolls addressing a 50 year old man? And, since the statement talks about television advertising specifically, one could argue that it is the parents' duty to watch over their children and decide whether they are allowed or forbidden to watch tv by themselves. In the end, the parents should teach their children from early on, that they can't have everything they want to. The parents are at all times the ones to decide for their children.
Personally I think that it is totally okay to put advertisements for children on tv. Parents know that they are responsible for their own children and should have to put up with the difficulties that being a parent brings with itself. Mostly I think that one can never direct their responsibilities to anyone else. So the ones to blame aren't the advertising companies but the parents that can't raise their children properly.
