Although advertising in general is a rather controversial topic, the discussions usually escalate when it comes to specific fields of advertisement, one of these arguable fields being the advertisement toward children. 

Seeing the actual purpose behind advertising is leading people to believe they need these products, it comes as no surprise that advertisements are very manipulative, especially on young, naïve children. Then again, given we are talking about children, the decision on whether or not to buy the product the toddlers perhaps starts quarrelling for lies with their parents. 
What is more is that children will not necessarily notice the actual purpose behind avertising but will rather be fascinated by the variety of colours and shapes generally used in advertisements for children. This can even evoke positive emotions and spur the childrens' fantasy instead of causing them to want the toy.

Before this topic can be discussed at length, though, there is yet another question which demands a satisfying answer: Why would children aged two to five even be subject to television advertising? 
Children in that age are supposed to be playing outdoors or learning to walk before having to deal with the manipulative effects of television advertising. That being said, I do personally not oppose to advertisements, be that to children or to adults alike. In today's world, being able to resist the seductive effects of advertisements becomes increasingly important. Since we know children learn easier than adults, the sooner they get into contact with ads and the sooner they learn to resist them and make choices for themselves without being influenced, the better.
