Nowadays our TV is plenty of advertising and not only to adults or teenager also to little childrens in the age of two to five. In the following essay I want to raise the question if TV advertising dirceted toward young children should be allowed.

First of all, children did not understand or remember what they are waching. Because their brain is not that structured. I mean we do not remember us on a happening when we were two years. The things are not safed by the brain. 
Although you can not remember the brain safes it. But a little child do not understand that somethings are manipulation and not true. For exemple, if something was said by their mother they will not tell them that is false.

It is our new society, we have to accept that and it is better when you get use to it in a young age. It is simmilar to money if you guard your child from all the money they can not handle it when they are adult but when you give them pocket money and learn them how to handle it they will get use to it. 
But you do not learn them how to handle with money in the age of two years. It is differently to early.

Adversiting or general wachting TV is good for the structure of the brain. It is an enritchment because they get an inspiring for ideas. Well maybe this is true but if you let them play by theirselfes it would be a lot better for their brain. 

To summarize, childrens can not participate if it is true or not. It is not a good idea to interduce the handle but it is silly in the age of two year
