I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

Young children aren't interested in advertising. They don't care about things like that, they are happy with what they have and that they could play with it. Advertising would only change their interests into bad and made them unhappier. Mabey they are confused because they couldn't understand the advertise.
When the advertise makes the children confused, it isn't good for the company either. They try to sell their products, but when children couldn't understand their advertise, they will not play with things like this.
But when the advertisment is easy to understand and the children like it, it is kind of good for the company. Young children only see thinks and thing "I want to have this!" Now, they try to make their parents buy this. For some products, they may win and the company becomes more money. But that's the only reason I see, to show young children adverstising on television.
Advertising could influence young children very easy. That is good for the companys and the industrie, nor for the children and the parents. And there is also the moral question, if you can use children for industrial movements.
I thing, that isn't okay. For the children it's better to have their childtime free from television, mobile phones, social media and marketing strategies. But in this time, it's kind of unrealistic to live without television and so one. So it should ce clear, that the children are safe to. I don't want my child to be influenced by things for adults, like avertising and stuff. Early and long enough, they must life with that.
Can't they live their first years free from klischees, predjudees and stereotyes?
Can't they get older without influence by marketing strategiers?

I hope, that my child can.
