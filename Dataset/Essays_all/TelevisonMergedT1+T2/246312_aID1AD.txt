Advertisement is omnipresent in the world of today. There is advertisement for every age group and every category of life. But is it appropriat to make advertisements directed towards young children? 
Young children are much easier to influence than adults. Advertising is often presented in a way to make the product look good no matter what, even if the product isn't as told in the advertisement. If you put an advertisement for something on tv and kids see it , tey'll believe anything it says. So if it distorts the reality or only tells the half truth the children would believe it and it could have very bad consequences.
There is a lot of different advertising for children on television at the moment. Normally this advertising is about toys. Making an advertisement for toys and putting it on tv isn't really problematic. It may be annoying for the parents as they'd then have to deal with theyr kids wanting even more toys then they want anyway. But there is no harm done to the kid. 
On the other hand there aren't only toy advertisements for kids. There are also companies that produce sweets advertising their products espescially for kids. Sweets are very problematic as kids can't understand that they are bad for our health. If they see sweet treats in an advertisement they are going to want to eat one. Ofter parents don't like to argue with their kids so they just give it to them or the children get it themselves. Advertising sweets very often could lead to a more obese youth.
