A few years back the world was different and technology wasn't such a big part of our lives as it is now. We used to talk to each other face to face, go for a walk and meet new people out there but as technology improves every day it's not rare to see how these habits changed. We text, watch videos and like everone elses's photos. Nowadays young children also have easily access to technology. They love to watch television and at this point it is important that you know the advantages and disadvantages of this way of interaction.

Parents that are very busy and can't afford to pay someone who can take care of their children often decide to allow their kids to watch television. This is good for parents because they have time for themselves and can relax a little bit and the children are more than happy if they can watch their favourite cartoons. Television advertising help the kids to learn new things and improve their speaking skills because they're listening to new words. 

Everything sounds good until now but let's not forget that it is not healthy for young children to stay the whole day at home and watch cartoons instead of being active and playing outside in the nature with other children like it used to be . Television advertising towards them might confuse them because they are too young to understand everything and it happens very often that television shows content that is inapppropiated and not made for children.

Not only adults are getting more and more confindet with technology but also young children. It is common to see little kids watching television, playing with mobile phones and computers but in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. Children at that age should enjoy their childhood interacting with other kids, playing outside, drawing and showing her feelings and thoughts. They shouldn't sit in front of a television consuming stuff and doing nothing.
