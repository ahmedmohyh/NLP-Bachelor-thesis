There certainly are many harmless advertisments on the televison (which are aimed at kids), though the influence which they have on kids is often underestimated. Children aren't adults after all, they can't form their own opinion as easily as an adult can. More often than not, kids immitate their parents trying to get an idea of what to do. That's why it's only natural for them to want something they see in the television as they seek for guidance everywhere. This is probably also one of the reason why advertising tailored towards children is more profitable than other methods. To add to that, children are constantly developing their personality, so any harmful advertisments are going to influence younger children much more than older ones. This may lead to many different kinds of problems later in live, which is not something I or for that matter the majority of people want to see. Now to be fair, there is also a good side to it, because advertising allows for many channels to operate for free or to have a bigger budget to allow for better educational programs or better quality television in general. Especially since advertisments geared towards children are generally more profitable. 
So the question is now, should we allow advertising for younger kids or should we ban it? I believe there is no easy solution to this and I personally do only somewhat agree with the statement, but I think there is a way with which both sides are at least somewhat happy. I think it would be best to have very strict rules on advertisments and to let someone check each one for malicious content. That way we can make sure, that it still exists and finances our television, but companies can't use morally questionable methods to get kids to buy their things.
