Television is getting more and more involved in the world´s daily life and so are advertisments. At the moment we are right now, you barely can watch anything on TV without getting interrupted by them. Especially advertisments directed toward young children have a big influece to them, which isn´t the best thing for those children. In the following there will be a discussion, if they sould be forbidden.

First, the companies want to make the children buy there products. The children sit in front of the TV and then they see an "awesome" advertisment spot about that one super cool toy and then they decide they really, really want to have that. They go ask their parents and try to get them to buy that toy, so the parents go and buy that toy. That is what the companies want to achieve and if there would only be one companie, it woulnd´t really be a problem. Now if there would only be one spot, it could be tolerated, but sadly, this happens like 19 times in one break. Because of that the children want to have every toy and the parents end up being under a lot of stress.
Second, the only thing the companies want is money. They don´t care about giving the children a wrong ideal of beauty or telling them that they are only cool, if they have that one special toy. The children are just being used as the people who buy the companies´ stuff and maybe not even seen as human beings, who don´t know much about the world and it´s people yet. The children are just an unexperienced source of money and the companies use that to get the most profit they can. With that point of view, the companies manipulate the children into buying their stuff.


I think it should definitely be forbidden to direct advertisments to children of young age. The companies simply use the young age of the children to tell them they´re product is the best and give them fals ideals.
