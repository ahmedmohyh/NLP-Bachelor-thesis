Nowadays  everybody has a computer or a smartphone. Young children also as adults. People learn more  by television and lesser from books or other people. But is this way of modern studying good for children ?
 
Today there were a lot of different channels on TV also channels speciel for children. On this channels a lot of shows try to teach young children on an easy way about different science. From physics about biologie and chemie. Usual, all day situation, were explained by simple test, mostly on a funny way. 
This shows were created very funny speciel to children so they were interest and learn more effectifly.
On the otherhand side were the most programms on TV not made for chilfren at all. There werde sitcoms with dirty jokes or boring newsshows. Children watch bad shows and comedies, they were very funny but are not created to teach anything to young cildren. 

I think young children learn most effectifly in human contact, with their mum and dad or their friends. In this way they get their  education in early years by own adventures, TV should also be allowed but only in regulated   times and with special shows for children with a high potencial of education.
