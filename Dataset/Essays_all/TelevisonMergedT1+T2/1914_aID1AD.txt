In the following text I want to tell you if it is right that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
At first I want to give good reasons for the statement and later against the statement.
Young children could be addicted to the television because it is a good entertainment for their. Also they chould see another films which they should not allowed to watch. If the parents do not care about this it is difficult to show the young kids in his later time the right direction.
But it is good that also young children are allowed to watch TV because these are a important sources for kids where they can learn and comprehend. The Tv is more than one film. The kids have the choice to watch what they want in this age.
Surely, there are silly films too because you can say in slang these films make the kids silly. It isn't really exactly this. But you can bring kids with films in a different way and that's let them make bad things.
That is why parents should care about what their kids are watching. If they did everything is okay and it is  even a succes for the young children.
I disagree with the statement.
