Children at a young age are a great audience for big buisneses, who want to sell their stuff. But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.
In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television. They got easily distracted by it and they also got influenced by the advertising in television. Little children can't understand that the toys or sweets that are shown are rarely the way as we see them in TV.  They start asking their parents, if they may have all this too expensive things. Often the parents won't allow them buying those things, but when children get confronted with this "cool stuff" their friends in kindergarten may have, they get sad and won't be part of the group.
Buisneses are spending a lot of money on advertisings in general and they know exactly in which way they can reach everybody, from small children to old people. For their younger audience, they use bright and shiny colours and cool effects. They often know, in which way they may influence the parents of the children too, they make them believe, that those things are good for their children.
At least, I agree with the statement, advertising should be used on older peolpe, but not on kids at this young age. Children shouldn't get to know the way, money, beauty and  expensiv stuff in general influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life.
