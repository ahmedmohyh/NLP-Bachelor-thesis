Whenever you watch a movie which is played in the television, you're interrupted by some annoying advertisement. Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. 

In fact, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages.
Some people would say, there's no need to hide commercial from children, because they do no harm. It's a everyday thing and belongs to the televison programm. There's no reason to feel any guilt in showing advertisements.
The advertisement is made for new products and they're often not showing the whole truth. They're made to influence people to buy something really good without giving any information about the negative side. The children will believe everything they hear. So it's not the best idea to make them think everything is only good and perfect.
There are also advertisement especially made for children at this age to make them wanted their toys. Companies should have this ability to have a chance to grow. In our world, marketing is a huge and important factor.
Another thing is that children aged two to five have no money and the parents have to buy them the things they want. Without television advertising, parents aren't forced to buy that many toys.
Even if there aren't advertising directed toward young children there are some toward adults, so there would be the same effect.

To sum up, television advertising is part of our everyday life and have some influence on young children. In my point of view, television advertising is nothing bad and should be part of the television.
