Televison advertising should be allowed for young children. 
In my opinion it's a great idea to let children as soon as possible to work with multimedia electronics. Children at a young age are very talented in learning new things very fast so they they will never be faster and better in learning new things than at that age. In our culture television and other multimedia are very expended and important, so chlidren automatic will be conformed with these medias, so why keep it back and don't let them use it at a young age. 
Some doctors may say that it's dangerous to let children playing and working with multimedia things at a young age, but i think sooner or later they will get used to the television and Co. 
In many countrys televiosion advertising is already in use and the children don't get sick of it or have any problems with the handeling. If we don't allow television advertising now it will happen in a few years, beacause the market is growing so fast and every minute the electronics get better and faster and we need to use them to get to work or to comunicate with each other. 
So why don't let our children get used to it. I'm sure in the future everyone will let their chilren to advertise direct by televisions, and it will be normal for everyone.
