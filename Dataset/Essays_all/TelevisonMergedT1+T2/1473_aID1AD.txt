The topic if there should be television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, is stated differently. The advertisement could be a good thing for children that age, because these products that are being advertised are specific for young children in that age so they can't get the idee of having to want a plastic gun or other things that aren't ment for them. Also through these shown products children could develope a hobby by finding a toy, that excites them. And it shows them a range of what is possible today.
 
On then other hand side these advertisements aren't alwas good either, they could show sweets and unhealthy stuff that could effect the children in their life. Then some parents don't take their responsibilty towards their children very serious and they buy them those things. Also these children are very naiv this could have effections on their expectations of presents from their parents and relatives. Another argument is that in those advertisments the price isn't mentioned which is why children just want that toy but their parents can't afford it, which could dissapoint the children. 

All in all I think talking about this toping is a good thing and that parents should talk with their children about this, because every child reacts differently on advertisements and every child is effected differently by advertisements. Also some can afford those things that are being advertised and some don't. I think this makes a huge difference on how the children should take the advertisements serious or not.
