A lot of people are against television advertising directed toward young children. But why are they against it? Which effect has television advertising on young children?  Is it absolutely negatif or positive? Or maybe it's something in between? Today we gonna have a look on the arguments of both sides.

Of course is advertising directed toward young children a great chance for the economy to grow. Companies which are using this type of advertising know, how good it works to influence the young children. First of all you need to convince the young children and afterwards every child will do everything to convince their parents to buy it for them. The own children are often way better in influencing the parents to get what they want, than any advertising could ever try. You can see, for the companies this concept has a huge positive effect. And so the argument is, that this concept is good for the economy and if it isn't allowed to use this type of advertising, it will have a bad affect for everyone.

But there are also people who think that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. They say that the advertising teach their children that they can't be satisfied with what they have. In general advertising try to convince people that they need more than they have. Young children are so easy to influence and they can't decide if they really need this or not. 

In my opinion it's true that advertising will teach them that they can't be satisfied with what they have. And I that is the reason why it shouldn't be allowed.
