We all know the advertising for children. They are a lot of things they see and they want to have. In toystores, TV or magazins other people want to make money with articles for children. Is this bad for them?

When you want to make money with your toy then you have to make advertising. And almost every child wants to play with something. It is also good when parents don't know what they could give the child on Christmas or Birthday. With advertising the child can see different things and say what he or she wants.
 
But on the other hand there are many things who don't speak for advertising directed toward young children. They can see that the children in the advertising play with a lot of toys and they want them even if they are dangerouse or not good for the child. But I don't want to write all the time about toys. There are also many other advertising. Sometimes with food or clothes. We often can see in TV young children who eat a chocolat bar or something other sweet. Other children see them and want to eat this too. But the parents don't want them to eat more sweet things than they eat normally and then they are the "bad parents" who don't let their children eat what they want. Children in the age of two to five are also to young to know what is good for them and what isn't. Parents can better know what their children need or want for a present or they can ask the child.

In my opinion it should not be allowed to make television advertising directed toward young children. It is better when the advertisement is directed toward the parents. So everyone who wants (and who have enough money) can make advertising but the parents can say what the children need and what not and it don't give a lot of row. The children are too young for directet advertising.
