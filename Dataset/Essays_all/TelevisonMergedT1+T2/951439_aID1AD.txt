Advertisement is something we see every day. We may come across it at the railway station, on the radio, while browising the internet or just simply while watching TV. It became something so common that we no longer question it. But the advertisements have reached such an extent that there are now some targeted specifically towards children at the age of two to five years. But thats not an issue, or is it?
Childern that age cant buy the products anyways, so why make a fuss about it? In the end its the parents that has to work for the money to buy the products and its the parents who then also buy the products. So the advertisements targeted at children are just other means to reach the parents. Its kinda like putting the sweets right at the cash register at the super market. They try to put the parents in a situation where they have to buy the products because their child wouldn't stop talking about it or maybe the child would even start crying or throw stuff around in anger at its parents. This strategy uses the bond between parents and children to reach its means. And I would even go that far as to say that they dont even care if they destroy these bonds. Children left mentally scarred just because they had some silly fight with their parents over a toy or whatever. Also small children are easily influenced by what they see or hear and some might argue that its good not to confront them with the bitter truth about life but telling them pretty lies might be just as bad.
I dont have any problems with the advertisement of products for young children, but I think its wrong to manipulate children. Those Advertisements should rather be directed towards the parents. So I think its bad to make advertisements specifically for children.
