It depends what kind of ads the kids are watching. First of all a young kid like that should only watch specific series for children on channels like "Kika" that are designed for kids. I don't know if it's still the same a when I was fifteen years younger but at my time I never felt the ads to be distracting or manipulating me to really want an object and even if a kid gets obsessed with an item in an ad they couldn't buy it by themselvs and would need to beg their parents for their desired object. Obviously the responsibility lies in the parents hands. They need to teach their kids that they can't have everything that they see in televison and also observe what the kids are watching. I'm not quite sure if there are even companies that have a specific programm to manipulate kids through advertiment because I don't think that's worth. The ads are like they are for adults, to show their product and perhaps raise interest. Of course little kids, me aswell back in the day, want many things they see in television but if the parents just accept that and buy everything their child wants, they are guilty when their kid becomes a "crybaby" when they don't get what they want. In my opinion it would be a waste of time to ban ads directed toward young children because it is not as important than that the parents watch after their child and control what they are watching until a certain age where the kid beginns to think rational and starts to know by his own what kind of stuff they are watching.
