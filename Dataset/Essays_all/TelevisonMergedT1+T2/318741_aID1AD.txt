In my opinion, childrens between the age of two and five aren't able to notice exactely what the should do with an advertising. I guess they are just thinking how cool this object is especially when it is a toy or generally something to play with.  It could be, that they want to have that so despreatly, that they cry and shout until the parents buy it for them. This is especially a big problem for parents which aren't abel to buy there childrens expensive toys because they aren't earn that much money. I think that gives the parents a bad feeling, because they can't give there childrens what they want.
 It also depends on what they want to present with the advertising and especially how. When they want to present a playgun and shoot at each other then this would havean bad impact on the young viewers. That would be a big no-go for me.
In the other hand advertising could be something useful,because parents can notice what there childrens want and what they would make happy.This helps especially for birthdaypresents or when they are upset to make them happy.
Television advertisings aren't always a bad thing as long they're not silly or bad. But when they are they should need to put out from the TV to protect the childrens from bad thoughts.
