An argument for the television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) is they can learn something about the products they are , in some cases, interested to buy or let buy. Consequently they could choose a game of many others that seems to be the coolest or funiest, if they compare the different advertisments. Thats why kids would be more often settisfying because the parents could buy things the children are want to, if they agree with their selection. 

There are more and stronger arguments against advertisments for young children. One of this is that boys and girls in this age should not be confronted with so much media which would be more if they also must look for a lot of advertisments, if they want to have a new doll or something else.
The most important argument is that kids are not able to handle with advertisments because they don not understand something about trading. The reason for this is that kids aged two to five have not the ability to quote about the advertisment and exspecially about the products, because the seller has a big influence to the feelings, with this always positive advertisments about the products. Thats why children want things which are for example not even worth to buy. 

To summ up this theme, I am against televesion advertising direct toward young children, because there are much stronger aspects against it. Parents should decide what is worth to buy for their kids.
