Children between two and five usually watch a lot of television. Regardless if television it self is damaging to our young children or not, is it good to show our young kids advertizing?
For a lot o companies it is hard to advertize products directed to younger children. Unlike children adultes are constantly confonted with advertizements during their regular day. But as soon as you need to get the attention of a young child it can get harder. Companies had the idea to embed their product advertizement between childrens shows. These companies benefit a lot from these ads and of course would like to continue using them. However is it really that good for children to be conronted with advertizements at this young age? Younger children are usually very oblivious and I can remember from personal experiance that it was not hard to persuade me to buy something from the toy store. Showing young children that advertisement is good would just make them buy more unnessisary products in the future. Of course companies trying to sell as much of their product as possible are happy about this but should think more about the damange they are doing to these young childen watching television. Of couse each individual will have a different oppinion about this topic but a little bit less television or advertisement for our children can't hurt anyone.
