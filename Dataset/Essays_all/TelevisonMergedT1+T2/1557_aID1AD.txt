Television advertising has positiv and negative points. Many young children watched televiosin often and it is good to watch it, because they can learn something from it. But between the movies there are television advertising. 
On the one hand it is good when the children watch this advertising eary, so they could learn what this advertising stands for and why the advertising is in the televion. The young children know in the futur, when they see an advertising, that they do not need all these toys. A next point is that the children see what play is new and what is new from for examlpe barbie or lego. If they see more different toys, they could choose better wha they want to have and what they donot like.
But on the other hand advertising is not nessacary for two years old children. They do not need expencive toys or the new ones. If they see all the toys, plays and dolls, they will want all these things. In television advertising all products are good, helpful, tasty or nessecary. So the young children could not know, If they need the things or not. Also they do not want to play with their things, because they see the new ones.  
In my opinion the advertising is not helpful and nessecary for the children. They do not need the best toys or the expencive teddies. They only need a nice doll and someone who plays together with the child.
