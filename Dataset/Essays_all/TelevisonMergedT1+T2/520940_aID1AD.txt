Television advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed

Television is full of advertising, often it takes as long as 5 minutes until a film continues, way to long. Altought it's sometimes quite interesting to watch the funny advertising  clips for example those during the Super bowl, they are usually annoying and distracting. Televison advertising is very important to finace the television and is a great help for companies to get known or present their new products. Of course we would all prefer to watch a film without  being interrupted every half an hour but advertising is simply necessary for the televison companies.
Sadly there was created an economic sector for advertising toward very young children with terrible results. When children go for the first time to school they know around 300 brands which is nothing a 5 year old should know. In theory advertising would not be that bad, because it depends on the product if it is. And there the problem starts. A child cannot know if the product is good for him and nearly always it's bad for him. For example the unhealthty food that is advertised which will lead to and unhealty nutrition in the future which will also cause problem to the heahlt care system.



I belive that televison advertising toward young children should be forbidden, because it gets them on the wrong path. But I don't think that it will happen any time soon. The Interests of the companies are just to big.
