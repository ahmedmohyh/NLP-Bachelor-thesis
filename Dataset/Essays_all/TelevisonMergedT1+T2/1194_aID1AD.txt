Television advertising for young children should not be allowed because young children are easier to influence than older people. So if they see advertisment for a thing they normally wouldn`t want to have they may will be convinced   
that now they want to have it. So than the parents are gonna have this problem with their children that they are going to cry as long as they don`t get it. On the other hand those really young children possibly don`t even make up their mind if they want to have something or not and just get what they need from their parents. If you look at it from this perspective you could even claim that young children are gonna learn speaking and reading better through these spots. Also normally young children often times don`t watch the television stations where many advertising spots are showed or don`t watch much television in general. It also could have a negative impact on those children because for food advertisement is mainly made for unhealthy food. So if a child sees this advertisement for soda for example, it want to drink it and maybe becomes used to it so this child gets heavy and gets in way too much sugar accasionally it could lead to diabetes. 
In my opinion this advertisements don`t really effect what young children buy because they ain`t buying that much for thereselfs anyway, but it could effect the health as well as the way these children see the world. For example many little children who lived in the city thought, that a cow is purpil because of a specific chocolate brand named milka and they never saw a real cow.
