Television advertisements have always been very influencal. That may be fine for advertisements made for adults. But children can't decide like grown-ups whether they like something or not. For that reason, it is very controversial if ads for infants should be allowed.
On the pro side, the companies have to decide on their own if they want to abuse children like this. At last, it is their product and at the moment, there is no real reason for them, why they schouldn't advertise it. But then, critics say that it is morally wrong to make advertisements for children. Children are so easily influenced, which means that they only want to sell their product. It doesn't always be a bad thing though, since companies that only sell products for infants should also have a possibility to advertise them. But many companies don't care, since it works the best this way. Another argument against such a law is that influencal advertisements shouldn't only be banned for children below the age of five, but for everyone. Because nobody really wants to see those ads and they can also have an impact on older people. Especially old, retired people often fall for those products, because they have seen its adverstisement in the television. 
I think it's very controversial to make advertisements directed towards young children. Those companies often just aim to make profit and don't care, what impact that could have on younger people.
