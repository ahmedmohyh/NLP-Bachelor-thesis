In todays live we often see advertisments which are directed towards us or your group. But to direct advertisments toward young children doesn't make sence at all: In the age two to five children should be playing outside. They shouldn't watch TV. But if they watch TV there shouldn't be any television advertising which is DIRECTED towards young children. 
Television advertising which is dircteted to somebody especially to young children is very dangerous: often those children really want that, what is shown in the advertisment - of course thats the reason of an advertisment - but young children's live shouldn't be inluenced by television advertising. The influence of other advertising (for example supermarket-advertising) is high at all.
So in generell television advertising should be allowed but if television is directed towards young children it should be illegal. 
As I already said the influence of television advertising towards young children is too high that it should be allowed.
