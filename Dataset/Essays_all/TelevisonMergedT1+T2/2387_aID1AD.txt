The statement says that television advertising directed toward young children from age two to five should not be allowed. I think that the author of the statement is mostly correct with his opinion, because these children don´t know what is good for them in their age. Their parents should know whether they should get a new toy or not. In my opionion television advertisings are nothing a child should deal with, because they don´t know how advertisings can build up the extreme will to buy the advertised product. On the other hand it is good for companies to advertise their products toward little children because they often get presents from, for example, their grandparents. If they see a new toy they want in a television advertising, then they probably beg for it in front of them.  To not allow these advertisings could cause big financial problems for the companies. But I think that the mental health of a child is much more important than the financial crisis of a company, so I agree with the statement. Children from two to five should not be directed in television advertisings, because of the spreading will in their little minds to get these advertised products. Whether the parents should care more about their children and don´t let them sit in front of the hypnotisating televison so often, is an other problem. I think parents should watch more carefully over the programms their sons and daughters spend their time with and maybe just turn the TV of while the television advertisings.
