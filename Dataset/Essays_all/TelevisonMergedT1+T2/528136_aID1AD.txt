Television advertising helps the companies to find new consumer. This is good for the company and can be good for the consumer aswell, because he/she gets a product they may or may not have wanted. 
The problem is when you direct it to the children, espetially the young ones around age 5 and older they don't know yet what is really naicessairy and what not. They can be easely influenced. And those comercials are very often filled with sterotyps just like girls have to play with dolls and boys with cars. This leads young childeren to think that they are only allowed to play with those typs of toys. But comertials for two year olds are quite stupid. I don't believe that they really get what the commercial is trying to say them. Children learn best when they see a person speak that is right in front of them or when they can touch the object and look at it. This are things that aren't possible with videos. And when they get older they start to know okay the sound and the picture of the video belongs togheter. And then they are easely influenceable. But those are for me no reasons why you should forbid the comercialsfor two year olds. The parents can easaly control how much and often their child watches TV. So they control if the child sees those adverisments or not. And companies need to sell they're product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way. And the adverises for two year olds are most likely designed for their moms. And they should be able to decide if it is relevant or not. The advertisments I would ban are those who are directed to the older children in the age 5 to 10 because they are the ones that the parents let watch TV on their own for an hour or two and the ones that can be easaly influenced because of that.
