Television advertisement can be very controversial, it can be very usefull to build up economics as selling children furniture is a well-paid business these days butit can also be a factor that can damage children's education and pushing them to controversial materialism.

As we probably all know children are way more influencable than adults. They can not measure the value of money and furniture yet. Children also do not plan things into the future, it often happens that they become a present, for example a toy, and then are fascinated by it for one or two weeks and and after they don't use it anymore. They also don't see a reason to save the small amount of money that they get for the upcoming needs, it easily happens that they splurge all their savings at a time on something not always satisfying. Getting a toy that was advertised and that a lot of friends have is a good reason to do so.Children are known for being cute and innocent, so getting what they want can be way more easy then for other people like me. We all know that they master the art of seducing their parents to get what they want while walking down the aisle of the toy store, so if the saw that fun new toy on television earlier, they will more likely try to get this toy with which they are already familiar. This influence can be damaging for thej kid's education, as they don not learn how to evaluate the value of something on their own.

It is for sure a huge business and a well-paid market, but all-in-all I think advertisement for children should beforbidden because it seems that they get so influenced by it that it feels like children get not only their money stolen but also a part of their education.
