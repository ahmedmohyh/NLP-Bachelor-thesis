This topic seems to me not possible. I mean how do you want to make this statement work? 
Parents often let their children watch television by themselves to have them occupied, and the parents can relax in knowing what they are doing.
How does the government want to control this statement? Do they want to make a Log in and a Password for certain channels?
Do the parents have to hold their hands in front of the kids eyes, so they can not see the advertising during the break of the movie?
I think that this problem is overratet. The government tries to make always more regulations and I think that this trend is overhyped.
I think we should let the parents decide, whether the advertising is good or bad for their kids in if they want their kids to watch them or not. In my opinion, this kind of problem is not the issue of the government.
I grew up in a household, where my sister and I were allowed to watch television on a saturday and sunday morning to let our parents alone and let them sleep in. It worked out very well for the both parties of us. My sister and I had a good time and we were ocuppied. So my parents had time for themselves to sleep in and they were never worried because of the advertising on television. I mean my sister and I never got influenced by an advertising as far as I know. During the daily routines of a five year old child, it has way more and bigger factors who influence the child than the advertising on television. For example their firendships, their environment in the family, their kindergarten teacher, their way to the kindergarten, their tools to play etc. I think the government should have their eyes more on those factors who are much more bigger and influencal for the children up to an age of five.
