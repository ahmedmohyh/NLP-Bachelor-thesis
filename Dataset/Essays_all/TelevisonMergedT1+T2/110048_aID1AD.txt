Advertising is a part of television. Any child who is waching television will watch advertising. Today in the 21th. century is advertesing a part of society. It's not just in televison.  
Chlildren have also a right to know what they could by or what is possible to buy. Even if they don't have pocket money, they could ask their parents to buy them the things which they have seen on television. Young children could also have fun while they're watching the advertising. Most of the advertising are made funny and don't just informate about the product. For example advertising for toys is made funny that the children want to play with it. Then the children will ask their parents for the toys. If there aren't advertisings for toys most of the children wouldn't know about them and their parents would have to search for them specific in the internet or in a toy shop. With the helping Advertising they know what and where to buy it.
But if you look at this theme in an other context, you would agree that so young children can't decide by their own what they need and what's good for them. In this context, advertising can manipulate young children realy good, because they don't have that much expirience to think carefully about the advertising.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five) should be allowed. When I was a young child I liked to see the television advertising to know which new toys are in shops to buy. Sometimes I get one of these toys from my parents. But I think also that young children can't think about the advertising carefully what's tho goal of the advertising. They can be easyly manipulated by it. At the end their parents have to think about it and decide if they would buy something of the advertising for their children.
