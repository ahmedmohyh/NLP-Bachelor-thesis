On one hand, I do not really see a problem with advertisements for children. I mean, if it should be really banned, the companies then will surely find other ways to advertise their products to children. For example they could make product placements in TV-Shows for children, so in the end, it does not matter if you ban it, because they will find other ways to advertise their products for young children. Also when a child sees an advertisement, it can not just go and buy it. It has parents who decide if they get it or not. The Child just can say it wants the product but in the end the parents make the decision if it gets it or not. So banning Television advertising for young children will not help a lot. But on the other hand I think it is important that our children are not manipulated when they are young. Maybe today it's just a advertisement for a soft drink, but in maybe ten years companies might use the advertisements to brain-wash children. So I think this will be in the future an advantages when you banof banning advertisements ditected towards children.
So in the end I think the disadvantages outweight the advanteges of banning television advertising directed to hidlren. It is not a big deal that there are advertisements for young children, as long as they are not too manipulative. And in the end, it is still the decision of the parents of wether buying something or not for their child. So it is not necessaire to ban television advertising directed toward young children.
