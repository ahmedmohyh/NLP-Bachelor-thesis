Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

Many things can influence young children. Of course the adverts in television. And of course in this time period, in which we watch television all the time. Young children trust this things they see first and is not good for them when they watch adverts. 

But how can a this television programms can be financed? It is very expensive to send some programm and when you do not get money from the adverts it does not make any sense for the producer to send this programm for free. And when you do not send this for free the other peoples does not buy them to use and let the children watch the televison programms for free with adverts.

Another thing is the children with the age of two to five years do not have to watch television. Of course it is much more easier for the parents to let their children watch television instead of playing outside with them.


In my opinion, it is not to do for the producer to send the programms for free and the children do not have to watch television with the age of two to five. Clear the children in this peer group are very influencably but all in all this should be allowed, because the children do not have to watch television with this age.
