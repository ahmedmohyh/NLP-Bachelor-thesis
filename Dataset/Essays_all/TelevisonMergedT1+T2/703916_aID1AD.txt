Television advertising directed toward young children is a very common thing nowadays. Through this a lot of money is made by the companies but there are some dangers involved with this. 

First off theese advertisements can influence young children. They will always want what they just saw in the TV. This is pretty hard to handle for parents which don't have a lot of money and can't buy their kids what they want all the time. And if the kids don't get the toy they want they'll be sad. Another point is that this advertisement is often misleading which means that the product isn't correctly described and won't be the same in real life as in the advertisement. Also it's a bad to make money from young children. They will always want the newest toy they saw in the TV because thats just how children are. 

On the other side the companies which produce theese kids toys should be able to advertise in TV because it's very effective. And anyways not getting everything is a good lesson for the young children because that's how life works. You never get everything you want.

I think that advertisement directed to young children in TV should be allowed because it's the parents responsibility to control what the children should watch in TV. I also think that this advertisement generates a lot of money which is very good for our economy.
