This essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television, directing to children between the age of two and five.

On the one hand, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement. They cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant. For example, children do not need their own playstation when they are really young, they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much, for example, that they get problems with their eyes et cetera.  
On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things. 
But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy. For example if a child sees a plastic horse on TV running around and jumping, it would think, that this horse is really able to do that, but it is not. Furthermore, there would be some children, who want to get everything they see on TV and for poor parents, it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important.
But for the industry, it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their acting.They would not profit of this ban, although watching TV for young children is dangerous and unhealthy in general. 

To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit. Their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it.
