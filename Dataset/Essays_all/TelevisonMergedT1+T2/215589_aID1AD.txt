In the following essay i'm gonna write about advertising directed toward young children. 

Well,the first controverse topic i want to write about is television for kids aged 2-5. 
In my opinion kids shouldn't even sit in front of a television untill they are approximately 8 years old. Especially in this age they have to learn a lot of other important stuff of their parents or siblings. So they can learn what really matters in life.
Unfortunately, many parents put their kids in front of a television while they are doing other stuff. What is more, parents kids in this age should have time for them. Games like memory or puzzles are important for the brain and the development of them. Its also very useful for primary school.
So i think kids prefer an afternoon on a playing field than in front of a TV.

Another thing is that ad in television is mostly not made for kids in this age. They recognize it but they can't really understand it. 



So  in conclusion, don't let kids aged 2-5 watching TV.
