Advertising is spread everywhere. On the street, in newspapers, on apps, billboards, mobile devices television, just everwhere you can reach the people. It affects us, more or less. But ever thought how it affects our children especially on TV? Are they even undestanding it?

Children spend more and more time infront of the television. They're not often outdoor, they're more interessted in watching TV. And as it's easier for the parents to let them watch series or films, they spend hours infront of the screen. Let's say an hour a day, makes up seven hours a week. Every twenty minutes an interval of advertising leads to one hour and fourty-five minutes advertising per week. A huge ammount of time.
However are they even affected by advertising? One may say firstly no, cause how should be a child affected by watching coffe, shampoo or car advertising. It neither has a relation to these topics nor has it an interest in them. But as a matter of facts advertising is a huge market and really well done. Of course you don't see a 'head and shoulders' promotion clip on a channel for children. The interests of children are more in toys, adventure parks and other children places. 

Everyone of us has been in the situation walking through shops with a child. It's not that much fun as a normal shopping tour. Every second thing has to be analyzed, every third to be touched and every fourth has to be bought. It's easy to rise desires about new toys or clothes in a child.
Now imagine almost two hours a week advertising agencies have the possibilities to tell our children what their new desires are. Not a nice imagination isn't it? You don't even need fiveteen minutes to persuade an adult of a new good if it's well done, so how long does it need to persuade a child?

Do we really want to let someone else telling our children their desires? Do we really want to have some advertising directed children? Do we really want to allow advertising for children?
