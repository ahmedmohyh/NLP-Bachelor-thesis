The TV is not a new thing anymore. Basically every family has a television at home and watches the TV. There is no television channel without advertising, that's not a problem for adult people but what about children? Can they really understand the advertising shown in tv? Is it necessary? And what woul change if the advertising towards young children was forbidden?

When I was a child I don't think that I watched Tv until I was six years old and even then I wasn't allowed to watch alot of TV. I used to watsch from 7pm to 7.30pm the "Sandmann" which came on the children channel or sometimes I was allowed to watche Barbie-films. In the breaks during the film, came a lot of advertisings. To be honest, it wasn't a problem for me or my family. I could still grow up like a normal child even if I saw some advertising at the television. I am sure, that times changed and my childhood was different than the childhood children have now. I used to go to parcs with my parents and friends and I used to play alot outside. I know that nowdays we have the problem, that children watch alot more TV and they don't move alot. But I don't understand why the advertising should be a big problem. It is more the fault of the parents. Alot of parents are scared that theire children break a leg when the play some wild games and prefere that they stay at home,where the are "save". But that's not a good idea! 

So, I do not allow with the statement written above. The problem is not the advertising itself, the problem are all those parents, who don't want thire children to go out because it's too dangerous. Parents often like to turn on the tv because they want that theire children have something to do (and watching tv is something they can do without any adult). I don't think, that the advertising is dangerous, as long as it is advertising which is adopted to children. It is clear that children shouldn't see advertisings which are scaring, but most of the children channel are aware of this.
