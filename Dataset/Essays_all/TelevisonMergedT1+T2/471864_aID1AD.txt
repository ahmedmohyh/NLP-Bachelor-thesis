I totally agree with this statement.
I don`t have a problem if companies want to advertise for themselves with short television scenes. I just think that they just have to stay fair.
Often if a little child sees a television advertise it really wishes it could have this stuff. The parents often suffer of that and calm the child. If a child knows, that isn`t allowed to have something, he or she starts crying and screaming. The parents have to handle with that.

Another reason why I think that should be banished is, that if a mother wants to purchase the whole food of the week in the supermarket, their children often have to attend them, until they`re not in school. During shoppinng, the children are bored and often just start crying because of very small things. For exampe, the child would like to have the delicious chocoloate, which he or she saw in the advertising, the child doesn`stop crying as long as he or she doesn`nt get it. The mother is annoyed or just feels ashamed and because of that she purchases that chocolate for her kid, that she can continue with her purchase.

In my opinion the companies just want take advantage out of that. They know that if a child really want to have something, they often get that after a certain time.
In my opinion children shouldn`t be influenced by anybody in their chosing of stuff for playing. They should could deside by themselves, without any influence of television advertising. A child should listen to it`s own real desires.

On the other hand I have to be honest and have to say, that I understand the companies. Not only the adults are their customers, but also teenagers and little children. They want to sell as much of their products as possible. Theiy`re often not the only company, which sells products for kids.So they have to advertise for their product as good as possible. Small kids often watc television series. For the companies it is the best place there to reach the children and advertise as good as possible.
