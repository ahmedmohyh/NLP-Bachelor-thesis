Television advertising is a common marketing trick among big concerns. Especially the younger generation is very easy to convince of a product. In our "digital century" more and more young children are watching television and of course concerns are using this to promote their products. But should it be allowed? 
It is so much easier to convince a child of a product. If it is colorful and fancy and the child sees other children playing with this toy, it wants to have it immediately. 

In my opinion it shouldn`t be allowed, because children aren`t watching television to get to know the amount of new toys on the market. They just want to watch cartoons and animal shows. Through the advertising children are getting more attached to material things. They want to be owner of all the toys and fancy things showed on Television, but can`t appreciate them. Of course also the parents don`t want to buy all the useless, advertised things.

For concerns the child himself is the best promoter. It sees the advertising and convinces it`s parents to buy the advertised toy. If the parents would see the advertising they would be far less likely to buy it. It`s also the only oppertunity to adress an advertising directly to the child because it isn`t able yet to read a newspaper or other advertising platforms.

I would definitely avois the television advertising directed toward young children because they aren`t able to make decisions on their own yet.
