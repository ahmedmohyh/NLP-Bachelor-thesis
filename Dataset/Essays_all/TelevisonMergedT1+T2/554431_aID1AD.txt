"Get away from the television, Sarah!", "It's not directed towards children aged 4, Thomas!". Sentences parents often use whilst their children watch television. But meanwhile, with the brightened up technologies nowadays, there are a lot of parents who teach their kids the controvers. Sentences like: "Watch, and learn." or even "Get yourself infront of the television and be quiet for at least an hour." In the following main part I'm going to discuss this theme a bit. 

Watching television is a much more complex theme nowadays than hardly ever expected. Whilst watching television we are able to receive informations. We are even able to learn something such as cooking, baking and much more. There are even kids-shows, especially for teaching some life-skills, rules or how to draw an elephant for example. Whatever it is, it is sometimes useful. But if parents let their children on their own, their able to switch the channel and watch a crime scene or whatever. So I think it's important that parents watch after their kids. Watching television also depends on the duration. Eyes of children are still learning, and could get "injured". So parents should set up a time-limit per day. But in the end it's everyones own choice.
In my own opinion children aged newborn to five shouldn't watch televison at all. There are so many more intelligent activities to get done. In the first five living years children are able to learn much faster and much more intensive then ever after. We should teach them to speak on our own and not by television, in our own words and technics. We should show them as many animals as possible, for example in a zoo. We should show them our beautiful nature and fresh air. It's all much more important than showing them how to turn on a tv. 

In conclusion; everybody has to find their own balance between their kind of teaching their kids, and however they should grow up.
