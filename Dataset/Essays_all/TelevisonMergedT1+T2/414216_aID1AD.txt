When I was a child, I'd loved watching TV, especially the advertisements between two films. I don't why, maybe the reason was that I knew I wouldn't ever get anything of this things or toys they showed me in the TV. So when I watched this, I dreamt about how it would be, when I would be this girl or boy who could play with this toys.

In fact there are a lot of children who see the advertisements and go to their parents and beg for a new toy. But who wouldn't do this? When I, as an adult, watch TV and see a new parfume or something, I also want to get this. Of course when we're older we know about the conditions for buying something and we know how hard it is to earn enough money to get everything we want to have. But the mood to get something new is still here.

So is television advertising directed toward young children wrong? Why should it be? Because of the children who would be sad if they don't get this toy they saw it  in the TV yesterday? Don't you think a child really doesn't matter if it gets new stuff everday ? I remember when I was a child my wishes changes every second. In one second I wanted to have a dog, but in the other second I actually died to get a new Barbie doll. 

Of course the advertisements shows every child what it could but doesn't have. But is this something bad? We must learn to say no to something and be happy without it. Why shouldn't we learn to do this at the age of a child?

What's better? To learn things early or late?

This is a question who everyone must ask itself, there isn't a correct response for everyone.
