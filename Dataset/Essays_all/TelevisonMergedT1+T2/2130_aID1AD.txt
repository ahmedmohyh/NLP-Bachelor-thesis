In modern times, media is an important pillar of our society and available nearly everywhere and to everyone. Thus, companies realised the opportunities using modern media for their advertising and product placement in every kind of technology. Many companies and firms especially rely on the big amount of young children (or potentional consuments) for their advertising, who are easy to manipulate and easily convinced by a remarkable advertising. 
This leads to the question, if television advertising, which is available to nearly every child in the western world and in every age should be allowed legally?

There are several points that support the idea of banning television advertising for young children in order to keep them protected from being manipulated.
Companies know, that small children, whose parents are stressed and more or less careless in modern times, have a big influence on their parents and their shopping. So when mama or papa leave the house, they often let their child sitting in front of the tv, letting it watch his favourite show.
By using this kind of knowledge, companies try every kind of advertising beneath the series/programmes or in the shows themselves in order to convince the children, that this product is neccessary for their "further life". 
The children then tell their parents their new favourite product and won´t stop begging for it until it´s in their hands. Kids are used as an indirect way to force their parents to buy companies products and are therefore intentionally manipulated. Compared to modern regulation and law standards, these methods could be called a child abuse, as kids mental unstabilities are abused willingly in hope to gain the most profitable advertising methos. 
With this fact in mind, everyone would be interested in stopping this kind of manipulative and abusing advertising, especially if it could reach their own child.
