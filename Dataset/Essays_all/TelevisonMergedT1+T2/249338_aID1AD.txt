We know the television is a real problem when it comes to manipulation. Even adults struggle with it. We see new iPhones, new tablets, new furniture and everytime we see it we want to have it more and more. It is enough that adults are confronted with this problem. Why should we then let television manipulate our children?
Advertising is a huge business in today's society and it makes some brands get extremely popular and rich. A lot of money would get lost for brands like Playmobil, Barbie and Lego. These brands want to do something good for our children but technically they are just stealing our money because they manipulate our children to realy wish they had these toys they see on television. Most of the time parents can't resist but buy their children what they want because of course they want to make them happy. In extremely bad cases the children can't stop to wish themselves new toys. 
We have bad issues with the unbelievable high consum in our world, which is not going to get better if we let television manipulate our children to even buy more stuff. 
If we stopped television advertising directed toward young children it would have consequences for the brands, like a lower sum of income, but finally with or without advertising, when the children see toys in a shop they want it anyways so it won't make them exremely less money. It would just prevent the fact that children should not be manipulated.
At the end it would be a huge improvement for the respect towards children because they won't get used for their naivness,this iswhyI think it should be forbitten to do advertising towards children on television.
