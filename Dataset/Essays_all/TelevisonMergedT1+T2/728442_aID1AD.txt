First of all what is exactly meant by television advertising? These are advertisements on the television that want to achieve a child's attention. Those can for example be advertisments for games (physical and electronic).

Reasons why these should not be allowed are first, the children are two to five years old and their brain is in the middle of the process of developping (at this age even more than later) and they are not supposed to watch television anyway because they do not understand it and it could have a bad impact on their developement. Second, children should play outside with other children. It is important for a child to have friends that are the same age. If parents let their child watch television then he or she suddenly absolutely wants the thing that is shown on the advertisement and most of the time it is something stupid because nowadays people produce anything to get a lot of money. So parents should not even let their children know what unnecessairy things exist. But on the hand it can also be a good thing if children see child's advertisments because they get to know new things and it may also give them ideas for new games they can play with their freinds. Another argument for allowing is that they learn new words. Children aged between two and five are learning languages most efficient because the brain is very active. They learns new verbs, nouns and adjective. It can be very helpful for the linguistic process.

My opinion is that advertisements for iPads or other electronic devices for children should be banned but not normal games that one can play with parents and friends. Furthermore advertisments for healthy food should really be a thing because as we all know healthy food is important. Where as unhealthy food such as fast food should not be allowed as television advertising. Advertisements are differentiable and we should know which are the good ones to show the children.
