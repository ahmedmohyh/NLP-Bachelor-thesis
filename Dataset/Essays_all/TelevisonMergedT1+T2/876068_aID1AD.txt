Computers, mobilephones, radio and also television - they are a part of our society. It influencs us often more than we know. Everywhere are advertisments and sometimes we can't even see them. But in the television it isn't the same. Especially young people where impressed by these skinny models and these white teeths or the strong boy with the sunburned skin in the advertisments. Mothers can see how to wash the clothes that they stay white and fathers can see the new car which one should always be the best. But what happens with the young children, when they see these advertisments? Are they also impressed and influenced? Or do they just ignore these?

In my opinion, it shouldn't be forbidden. I think young children maybe see the advertisments but are less impressed. They don't think a lot about the products, they don't realise that the clown with the red hair wants that they buy a new football. They just think about the funny clown with these big nose and the big smile.

An other point is that these young children shouldn't watch a lot of television. So if they play more in the garden or with other children , they will got also less impressed. 


To forbidden the television advertising toward young children doesn't make sense for me. Because the advertising is everywhere, not just in the television. It is on the mobilephone when these children can play while the mother is cooking, it is on the streets and in the shops. In my opinion, you just have to show the children how they can get with it. That these teeths aren't that white and that these cars can't drive toward the ocean. I think that should be the goal of our society.
