 The aim of commercials is to have an effekt on the person who is watching and to create a desire to be in possesion of the promoted product. But should commercials generally aim for young kids aged two to five?

Kids  that young can not decide themselfes wheater to buy the product or not. Still the commercial can achieve  that they wish for the product and to convince their parents to buy it.

A child that is completely dependent on their parents. It is in a stage whereit has to learn many new things. So it is used to observe it's environement. This means it is way easier to influence than older kids.
 
Considering that I don't think that television advertising directed toward children aged two to five is a good idea and agree with the statement.
