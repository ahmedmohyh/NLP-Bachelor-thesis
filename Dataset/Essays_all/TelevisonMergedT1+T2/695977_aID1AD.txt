Nowadays the television has a big influence on the whole society. Mostly children fill their free time more and more with watching television. So it does not surprise that the market reacts of the change in the age of the consumers and starts to produce advertising for children. But should that really be allowed?

On the one hand, television adverts for children open a whole new market, which has an high potential. It is an opportunity for companies to make their brand be aware in the heads of the kids from a really young age on. So they create a higher possibility that these children will stick to this brand even when they grow older. 

But on the other hand, television advertising also has its risks. Their is the possibility that first of all the advert is not appropiated for young children, so they get in contact with subjects they can not cope with. Also the children get, from an early age on, an education in capitalism. They grew up in a world where they get all the time information about what they could buy and what is available out in the stores. This creates a need for this things which should not be told in a such early ages.

In my opinion it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children. Children are not able to cope with the mass on information the would get over television advertising. Also they are emotional not as stable as adults are, so they are more easily captured by the advertising. And what is most dangerousily about this fact is, that children mostly are not able to get the real message behind a advertising and can not put it in the right relations with the real facts, because they are still just children and believe in what adults tell them.
