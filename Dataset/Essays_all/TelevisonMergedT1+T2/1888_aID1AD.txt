First we have to take a look on the positive aspects of television advertisements, if a channel shows more advertisements they get more money and if they have more money that can easily result in a  better product. If the product of the channel is better the ratings grow bigger and they can take more money for advertisements and they can expand or something like that. 
So first of all it is quite good for the television channel but that`s the only positive aspect that i can see at all. I think that young children can`t guess which pictures in the television programm are realistic and which are certainly not. And also if the product, which is shown in the commercial is even good for them and get`s them something in the end or if it is just a waste of money or time. Also they get a wish that maybe even if theire parents want to, can`t fullfill, or maybe get`s them into financial trouble. Because the problem is that little children can`t handle and don`t know the worth that money has. 
 They follow the advertisement because it speaks directly to them and they don`t know that everybody only wants the best for them. Also it gets more difficult for the parents or other people to raise the children because they got certain wishes that are shown in the tv.
But in my opinion the worst point of them all is that small children are moved and pushed to become consumers and spend their, or their parents money on products they have no idea of.
I think that it is wrong to say that this type of tv should be forbidden at all. I think it has to be taken more liberal and parents shouldn`t let their kids watch tv and advertisements at that young age, even if that is far more difficult to look up if they really do but it is the better way in my opinion, but I would also say that I dislike this kind of entertainment or tv programm.
