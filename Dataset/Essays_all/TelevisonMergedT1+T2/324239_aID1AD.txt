Advertisement in TV, which is directed to young children is theme which is critisised by many people.In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to show advertisement, because the children are more affected of advertisement then adults. If adults watch advertisement, they mostly know that these companies just want to make profit and that the products shown, are mostly not as good as they were presented. But if a child watches advertisement, it just sees how cool a toy or something else is and not the background. Especially because the toys are shown in a toyworld and not in a realistic way.

Another point is that a child aged two to five could never afford a toy by themselve. But why do companies then advertise things to children? Of course, because children can more easily confince there parents to buy a toy for them, then the companies could convince the parents to buy a toy for theire children. Children are stubborn and they know much better how to get something of theire parents. This is the second reason why I agree with the statement above. I think that the companies are profiting more with advertisement to children then with advertisement to adults. And this shouldn't be allowed, because children can't think as far and this shouldn't be abused.

Summarizing I would say that advertisement, which is direted to children is kind of an unfaire way to advertise things, beause the companies are using the power of stubborness and joy of children to make profit.
