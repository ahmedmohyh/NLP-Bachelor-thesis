I think most of the people I know would agree with this statement, because they are afraid of electronic technology like some day the whole system could be controlled by machines which are human-made, but let's be honest; television advertising directed toward young children has also its sunny sides. For example get those children used to systems like TV and are faster to lern new things in technology than adults who never had something like a TV. In the West World, electronic technology is used in nearly every activity, so if you watched TV at a very young age, you may understand better how our technology functions, because in television advertising, new technology is often used.
Otherwise it dosen't seem to be good for their future. The media influences people on a very high level. With photoshop, showing only things they want to let the people know and other ways to hide things of the real reality, people who watch too often TV or children who are directed to television advertising only see the opinion of the medias. They don't have the knowledge to do things by themselfes because they saw it in the TV but they didn't tried it by themselfes. They possibly also forget to think by themselfes and realise that TV doesn't show the reality.
In my opinion, televsision advertising directed toward young childern shouldn't be allowed, because like this, people don't do any further progess, they go backwards
