Nowadays, the economy does everything to get in touch with hypotetical consumers. They would like to influence young children with the expactation that their parents buy the product which seem to be the best way to make your child pleased. But should it be allowed to set television advertise toward young children?
On the one hand, we should protect our children from advertisings by the reason that they are too young to understand what a advertise would like to achieve. Another aspect that should be considered is, that children should be able to watch TV without wrong expactations from the world. They should get known about the stuff that they are having at home firstly, before they will fancy the stuff which is cooler because they do not have it available. 
On the other hand, a television advertise which is directed towards young people does not have such a bad impact on little children as some television shows are having. It is a fact, that the modern marketing would not try to get in touch with the littlest enemies in our society, but they think about a huge amount of money which could be gained out of this persons.
To sum up, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because I believe, that the final dicision is taken by the parents and if they think that there child should not have this game or something like that, they should not buy it. As a parent you have to stay strongly by your opinion, because if you do not defend your on decision you will have lost all your impact on your child.
