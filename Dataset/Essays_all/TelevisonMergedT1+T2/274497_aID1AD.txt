There are different points about allowing and not allowing television advertising directed toward young children. The question is which are more  important than the others.

In case that children at that age should not be watching television I would say that there is not a reason to forbid television advertising directed towards them. The parents themselves are responsive for their children and when they do not want that their children are influenced by advertising they should not let them watch television.

But considering that nowadays television and mobile devices in general are getting more and more important there maybe is the wish of having some laws to protect the children. They are very fast greatly influenced by almost everything. But it is obvious that a child of two years can not even realise what it is watching there. So this argument is not that strong as it seems. 

Another point to let this advertising allowed is that buying things supports the local economy. Of course children at that age are not having as much influence at this as other generations, like teenagers for example. But in some degrees they maybe could help with their wish to have everything they see. 

So in conclusion there are wether more good nor more bad points about television advertising directed toward young children. But in my opinion the most important thing should be that children at that age should be playing and not watching televison. Because then the advertising does not matter.
