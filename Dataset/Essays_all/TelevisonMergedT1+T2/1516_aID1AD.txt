Young children could be more confused with advertising and any other things e.g. supermarkets with many sweets or shops for plays etc.. The whole world and the modern lifestyle in cities could be too much for young children. 
I think if we dicuss only about television advertising it is not enough. Telvision in general with advertising or not might be too much for the little brains of such young children. And there are some channels in Germany without advertising, but what is with the following situation. Imagine a child of three years watch e.g. mikey mouse, a few days later the mother goes shopping with the child, the child see a shirt or sweets or anything else with mickey mouse and it wants to have it. But in the shop isn't only mickey mouse there aresuch more superheros, that might be interesting for children. Isn't that the same, as advertising at television? Advertising is a difficult topic, but I think it is more than television advertising, I think it should be the responsible of the parents that their own children haven't too much influences form the television in general and the whole world and lifestyle.
