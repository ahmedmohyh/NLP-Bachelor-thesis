It is said that television avertising toward yound children is unhealthy and should be forbidden. In this essay I want to find out if this statement makes sens and emphasize some arguments for and against advertising.

to begin with, advertising is normal in our society and it`s not possible to ban it beause of young children. I don`t know what your children watch but I was addicted to Superrtl or Nickeloden. These are typical channels for children and don`t include advertising bad things so there is no reason to ban televison advertising because this only happens on channels which your son or girl shouldn`t watch.

I want to mention that there isn`t just one type of advertising. When you hear this word you think about something bad or unimportant. But there are few types of useful advertising for example sofatutor. This is a useful online platform to help your children learn in funny ways.

Finally, it's not that every child who sees advertising buys that instantly. They have not the knowlege to use moms credit card so it's not dangerous that they buy some incorrect things. You must be very stupid as a mom when you buy these thingsvso the children don't even realise that this products can be bought.

In conclusion, there is absolutly no way to ban televison advertising for young children because there is simply no reason to do that because most of the time children don't even realise that it`s advertising.
