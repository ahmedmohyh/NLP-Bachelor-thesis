On the one hand, most of the children aren`t used to give statements about specific things, they can`t understand how advertising works. They don`t know that advertising tries to catch the attention of the audience, and they will think that everything the advertising says have to be true. They won`t speculate about the truth of the advertising, they`ll just try to persuade their parents to buy the things the advertising presents. These are arguments which support the opinion that television advertising for young children should be forbidden. 
But on the other hand, I think that also children should watch advertising, because that`s the best way to teach them that not everything television says is true. If the parents explain that they won`t buy a product from television advertising and why they won`t buy it, children will be able to understand that they can`t own everything. Furthermore, they have to make their own experiences about whether a product from advertising is as good as the advertising claims or not to learn about the methods of advertising, in case their parents buy it. That`s why I am of the opinion that also children should be allowed to watch television advertising, as long as there are only products for children the content of the advertising.  
Of course, the advertising should only show toys or film trailer, for example, things the children know and want to play with, because other advertising elements aren`t on the children`s mind. And there shouldn`t be advertising about political aspects as an example, things children won`t be able to understand and criticise. Furthermore, the advertising musn`t show trailers of films children can`t deal with, like thriller, because many children would get nightmares because of those. The advertising for children should be ruled.
