In this essay I will write my opinion to the statement.
I think it is a very important topic for the parents of the children because when the children watch tv the advertising it is a part which they watch everytime. I think it is good for young children (aged two to five) because if they watch something they had never seen before what they like they want to have it. But the parents must take care of their own childs because sometimes in the advertising are topics or products that the young children will not understand. And sometimes when it is an advertising about for example electric products like a cell phone or something else the children want it too. But in my opinion the children from the age two to five are too young for a cell phone because they do not understand how much money it costs and the can not use it like adults or older people. The advertising must be for the children so that they understand the idea behind it. And I think when children watch the advertising in the tv they want to have all of these things and that can be a reason for a big discuss with the parents. But sometimes it is something what the children can talk with their friends about. An other negativ point is when they watch the advertisings they are in another world it is not even real but the believe that all what the people in the tv say about the products is right. And in this time when the children watch the advertising on the tv they can probably go outside with their friends to play for example soccer or something else what make fun.

I can say that the statement is totally right because there are many point which are against the television advertising. The advertising take fluence to the whole life because the children watch it everyday and everytime. So the advertising must be not allowed for young children.
