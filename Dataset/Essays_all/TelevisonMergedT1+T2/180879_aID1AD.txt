Is television advertising manipulating our young children?


We need to know wich effect television advertising has on the young children (aged two to five), so we can decide if it should be allowed or not. One of the problem is that i`ts very hard to tell if television advertising has an negative effect on our children. If so, it shouldn`t be allowed. 
We can say that the age is the problem, why it should not be allowed. Children in that age can`t differencate what they are seeing, not like adult person. We know that, what is sayed on the TV is not always the truth. We know that companys often lie about their products in the television advertising to promote them and so to sell more and to gain more money. In contrast, when young children see something on the TV they can be so facinaded about it, that they won`t to have it. This can become to a problem, because the companies can manipulate or childreen. They are trying to hunt of the young children with Barbies, Hot-Weels, Dolls to sell their products. Because they know that parents can not resist the wishes of tehir children. On one hand we can say it sholdn`t be allowed, but in the other hand it`s very hard to forbit it. We can say it`s impossible.
Altough advertising on TV can have an negative effect on young children, I think it shouldn`t been forbiten. We live in a free world and in a free economy. In the ages of Internet and YouTube the most young children don`t even care about TV, they don`t watch it. And the partents can always forbit their young children to see TV.
