Television, computers, mobile phones and many other thing are used nowadays by billions of people all around the world. Some parents allow their childen to watch television at an age of 2,3,4 or 5. In the following I will give my opinion about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young (aged two to five) should not be allowed"

First of all in my opinion watching TV is kind of a non-sportive "hobby" which you should use not that much. Especially for childen with low ages the parents have to decide and controll their children. I think every mother or father have to look up for their childen to teach them what they can do and what they can not do. The TV and the theme of the series you watch in the TV can influence the childen with low ages in the future. I think it depends on the series you let your child watch whether it influences your child in a good or bad way. Nethertheless I think that you should not let a 2 year old watch TV, because it just don´t make sense, because the child doesn´t understand those themes. At a higher age I think you can confrontate your children with modern technologies, but a TV should be one of the last things. 

In my opinion at some age you can´t avoid your children watching TV, because then other children are watching TV your child will come to you and will say "my friends are watching TV, I want to watch it too". To avoid this situation you can let your child watch TV in lower ages, but it should be controlled by parents. At the end it depends on the child and their reaction about TV and the parents who can decide on their own whether they want their childen to watch TV or whether not.
