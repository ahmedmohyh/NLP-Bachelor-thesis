Nowadays almost every household owns a television and everyone likes watching television. Moreover television has become such a big part of our life that many families even eat whilst watchig television. So should little children be protected from advertising? There are some good reasons to forbid television advertising directed towards children. Children are easier manipulated by advertising than adults, for they don't realise that advertising tries to manipulate them. Also recent surveys show that advertising sometimes misleads into perceiving fastfood and alike as something that's somehow healthy or at least not very unhealthy. That of course has desastrous effects like raising the already high obesity rate of todays population. You might argue that even with advertising towards young children forbidden there's nevertheless lots of bad influences on TV. Every show has times when parents wish taht it wouldn't portray things as good even though they're quite bad for you. And it's not only TV that gives you wrong impressions but also "normal" advertising where products are often praised as healthy, like fruit yoghurt that more than often doesn't even contains fruit but rather some chemicl flavor plus loads of sugar. So is it necessary or helpful to ban advertising for children on TV? It might be because in many childrens lifes television plays a big role, but trusting the parents, to parent their child, seems to be the better method. Especially since it's bad for little children anyways to spend their entire days in fron of a TV.
