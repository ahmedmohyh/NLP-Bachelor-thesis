Does Television advertision influence young children?
At the moment there is a big discussion in television advertising towards young children should be allowed. One point of view is that young children don't even understand the sense of commercial. Yes maybe they will run to their parents and ask if they could buy this and this but they don't have the money on their own so the parents still can decide. So people say the problem is bigger for teenangers than forchildren because teenagers start to have their own money and yes it's difficult to handle this in the beginning. how much money can I spend? How much momey should I save? So if they see something in TV they can decide on their own if they wanna buy it. so they got much more influenced. 
On the other hand it's not good to be influenced by advertising already in an early age. Because if we want or not we get influenced and we make our decision based on commercials sometimes and we should protect the children from that. They should learn to make decision without getting influenced. But why do such young kids spend their time in front of a TV?
So my personal opinion is that the advertising directed towards young children is not that bad. they don't get influenced by many commercials and the parents still can decide not to buy something even the kids want it. it's worse for teenagers because they need to learn how to handle money and the commercials do not make that easier. they are surrounded by many attractions. so yes I think we can allow it for children but in general we should keep in mind how much we can get influenced.
