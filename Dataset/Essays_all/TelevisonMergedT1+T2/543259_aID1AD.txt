Everytime we watch tv we see advertising. It is used to promote products. The product should speak to some kind of people that should be interested in. For example if the commercial promotes cat food, it should get cat owners to buy the food. 
Advertising is used for people any agebutt is ist really necessary to advertise products for kids? 
What speaks for it, is 'why not' if it's child-friendly?! Children watch tv anyways. The advertising industry might get a lot more money because they speak to a new group of people. Children can see new stuff that is on the market.


But on the other hand, children shouldn't be influenced in that early age. They can't buy the products they see in tv, their parents would have to buy it. If they understand the content is another question. First Children shouldn't watch tv too often and second tv is not the future of the entertainment industry. Advertising is often not even looked at, because it is so annoying. 

I don't think it is a good idea because it is a waste of money and time. To try to convince some toddlers and children of a product is ridiculous. They can not buy the product by themselves.
