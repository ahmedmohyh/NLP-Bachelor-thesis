In todays world television and media are getting more and more important. Advertisising in the television is mostly directed to a specific group of people such as young children are one of them. But should this young group be advertised?
Children aged two to five are very easily influenced by everything they see and hear. Advertisements in the television show them what they really do not need but the adverts make them want that. Sweets are often displayed with children "actors" to gain the feeling of need in the watching child. I do not think that children should be advertised because of their young age and as a consequence to this their easy influenceabilty. Explained on the example of the "Kinder Überraschungsei": in this advertisement adults give the chocolat egg to children telling them not to open it until the adult gets back. The adult leaves the room and the child stays, sitting in an empty room with nothing but the egg on a table in it. Every child gets very temptated by the egg and finally opens it to see the surprise. The watching young children get the feeling to need that too, to want that chocolat and the surprise too. They want to feel the excitement of the children in the television too. In fact I would not want my child to be that influenced by people I, as the mother, do not know and even worse whose intentions I do not know. I would want my child only to be influenced by me and my husband and the only other people I would allow that were other tight family members. I do not know the people that produced these advertising but I think if they would think about this more carefully, think about how their child could be influenced they would probably be more careful with what they advertise.
