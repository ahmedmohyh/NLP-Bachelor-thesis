In the time of today, television plays a big role in the daily life of most of the people around the world. Also chrildren often watch TV, some even every day. They are confronted with much advertising, for example for toys or mostly unhealthy things to eat. But is that really okay to show advertising directed towards young children in TV?
At first it has to be said, that small children are more likely to believe what is said in television and the advertisements oftes abuse this to make them want to buy their products. Often they use characters from TV-shows or films for children, with whom the kids are familiar.
Even though the small children need healthy and good food, the advertisements are mostly for unhelthy candy or snacks with too much sugar in it and so its not made for children. Today there are much more jung humans with an BMI (Body-Mass-Index) which is defenetly to high and they are more likely to get illnisses like Adipositas. One reason for this is the unhealthy livingstandard with the unhealthy food, which selling raises because of the advertising. 
In my opinion the advertising toward young children should not be forbidden at all, but it should be important that the product is healthy udn good for the children and also adults when there is an advertisement for the product shown in TV. There should be less advertising for candy or softdrinks, but more advertising for fruits and vegetables made for children, so they rather want to eat the sweet looking strawberries from TV, than the unhelthy yoghurts with way to much sugar in it.
