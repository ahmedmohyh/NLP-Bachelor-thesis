Should television advertising direct toward young children not be allowed?
It's a controversal topic. I think it's hard to say, because there are two sides against each other.

At the beginning you have to think about the effect advertising has on young children. They are too young to think critical about the things in the television. They see something new and so they want it, no matter if they need it or not. So maybe it's hard for parents to handle this.
The other point is that maybe things in the television advertising aren't so good. Maybe they are insecure or discriminating or something like this. Young children can't form their own oppiniion on something new, they are easy to influence. They orientate on older people, for example the adults of the advertising. 
But on the other side the children are too young to buy these things too. When they see something in the advertising, it's hard for them to buy it by thereselfs, maybe it's even impossible. So parents have a controll on the things the children buy. And they even have a controll on what the children watch in the television. So it's there task to save their children. 
And for me the most important point against the banning of the advertising is that there are concerns which need to make money. It's the fault of our society that they need to make advertising even for young people. They need to sell lots of things and it's easier to influence young children. Maybe it's not totally a moralic, but it's a (notwendige) thing. 

So all in all I think television advertising toward young children is okay, because our society make it (notwendig).
