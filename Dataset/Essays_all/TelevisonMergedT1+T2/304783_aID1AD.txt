This hypothesis is very difficult to answer, because in my opinion young children should not watch free TV at this age. But if they had the possibility and see a advertising there, the possibility that they run after their parents and moan that they want to have this car or something too, is really high. So the strategy isn't bad.
But I do agree with this statement totally. I think it is not too good, when the children see some advertising of the companies which is not meant for them. The children shouldn't watch TV too much and when they want to watch a little story before going to sleep, the parents have to think about it, what theire children are allowed to watch and what not. So they childs can not raise up to the publicity. And during the day the should go out and play with friends. Maybe it is a little old-fashioned, but they have only once their childhood and they can't repeat this time. So it is in the force of the parents to look after theire children and to look that they do not watch television without the agreement of them.
It isn't good for the children when they watch have to watch programms where are many publicity and which are directed to them, because if the companie reach theire end and brings the parents to the shop and buy the toys, the children know that this works and want to have more and more toys of this company, the parents are disagree and then there are arguments in this family and this isn't the cause of the companies I think.
