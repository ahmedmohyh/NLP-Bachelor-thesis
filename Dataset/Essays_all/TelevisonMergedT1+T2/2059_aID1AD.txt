Some people have the opinion that television advertising for young children shouldn't be allowed. 
Maybe they are right. Young children have to learn about the real world. It won't be good for them to take in front of a television and learn with it. If this happens, children will only know about a virtuell world. They wouldn't know much about real things. In worst case young children learn only similuar things. So in future there won't be personal charakters.
Young children has to talk with their parents. It's the exercise by mother and father to learn with the child. They have to give them informations about life and important skills, like speaking and walking for example.
But on other side who and how will look up to this new rule? Nobody is allowed to check up the privat life by a young famaly. You can't controll people at there privat house for advertising the television by young people. And parents are old enough to decide on their own whats the best for their child. Only on this way we have different people with differents skills at the world.
In my opinion is the statemant wrong. The parents should be allowed to decide about their children. Not everything at the television is wrong and bad. People can learn lots of important things there. Maybe in future children learn with television speaking. I think for children with parents who comes not out of the country it is a good selution. So the young children can learn the languge correct. And people who don't want the televison advertising have not use it!
