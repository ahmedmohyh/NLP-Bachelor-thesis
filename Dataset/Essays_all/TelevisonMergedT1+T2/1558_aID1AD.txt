Today everybody has got a television at home and watch a lot of time TV. Sometimes alone, sometimes with the family.  I think everyone is tired of the long television advertisings between a fantastic film. So children see a film and than the advertising starts and shows them the new toys, which will coming soon. Now the question is: Should television advertising, which is directed toward young children (aged two to five), be allowed?

On the one hand the advertising, which is directed toward children, isn't worse for them, because the main thing that is showed, are new toys or activities for young children. So these adverdisings are not brutal or something else. 
One the other hand the economy use the childrens for selling their products, because then a young children see for example a new toy, he ore she wants this and then he or she goes to his parents to ask them, if they buy her or him these new toy. Another point is that thes young children are wanting every time the best and the newest toy, when they see the advertising. This is exactly the thing taht the economic want; to sell their products and earn profit with them.
