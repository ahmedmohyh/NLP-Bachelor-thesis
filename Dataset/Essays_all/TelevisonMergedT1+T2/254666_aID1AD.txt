Since television has become the number one electronical media for children companies have discovered a new way of advertising. Chanels like Nikelodeon, KIKA and many more are interuptet frequently by advertising breaks. Should television really be allowed to advertisise young children directly, since they have such an big impact on them?

Many industries profit from the advertising. How would two to five year olds be reached if not over the thelevision? Many new products have to sell and if people aren't interested in them it will cause harm to the economy. Many adults are glad to know what to gift their children for christmas, for their birthday or for other ocasions. The fact that because of television advertising many children already know what they wish for can be helpful in such situation. An other reason why advertising might be a good thing is that the companies pay taxes to the chanels to be able to stream the cemmercials of their products. If chanels wouldn't have that source of income some chanels for children would transform into "Pay-TV".

Even thought there might be some positive aspects of television advertising direct toward young children there are also many disadwantages. Many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products. Children will always wan't the newest toy and the coolest game. Such behavior can distress the parents. It is not only stressful but also very exepnsive. Many families simply haven't got the money to buy always new toys for their children just to make them confident or make them stop crying.  

In my opinion there shouldn't be that much advertising on thelevision. Not only on chanels for young children but also general in TV.
