The question 'Should advertisments which are directed to young children, between two and five years old, be allowed?' is a controversial question because the children could suffer from the adverts when not advertised properly.

For example if children see a child-friendly add in which they need to download a game, which many children can do nowadays, the game could be locked behind a payment. That payment could be extremly high and the children, manly because many cannot read or do not know the value of money yet, would accept it. Therefore the parents would recieve high accounts and the game manufacturer would become wealthy for using childrens inexperience. 
However, the addvertisments could also show children a toy which they then could wish for, for birthday or christmas. The parents, when shown the addvertisment, could then dicide if the toy could help the child, in which case they would say yes or not and say no. 
Finally, an advert which is for a museum, is helpful for the child and could then awake intrest for something the child did not know exsisted, like dinosaurs or deep-sea creatures. This could help the child in its future career. 

In my opinion, advertisments can be accepted as long as there isn't any money-making scheme behind the advert. Furthermore if the child experiences harm during the advert, the advert should be recalled immediately. But if the advertisments are for enlightening the childs intrests and could possibly help him in the future, for example choosing a subject to study, they should be allowed to broadcast.
