We all know that kids build fast their own opinion. Thats why big companys do much advertising on kids-TV-channels to sell their products. 
Everyone of us can relate to the situation that we saw an advertisement of, for example, a toy and wanted to have it really bad. So bad, that we told our parents, we cant live without it. Thats the negative aspect of commercials toward young children. The kids keep the loud and colorful commercials in mind and start hurassing their parents. In addition to that maybe the kids dont even want this toy and were just impressed of the commercial. In some way they dont have an own opinion in this moment. 
The only positive aspects are for the companys, which sell their products this way. With their loud commercials even adults keep their products in mind. They know how easy they can impress kids and can make fast money out of their young viewers. Because they are the direkt path to the parents, who will buy the product to make their child happy.
In a nutshell, I think advertising toward young children is pretty bad. In one hand, they get influenced by big companys and the parents often feel forced to make their child happy. But on the other hand, how else can the comanys promote their products for children, when the consumers are mostly just reachable through Television. So in my opinion are commercials in kinds-TV-channels just okay, when they dont influence them that much and when they arent that often.
