For adult people TV advertising is nothing special anymore. Most of the people don't even pay attention to it. There is a wide range from different kinds of advertising from cleaning substances to shoes there is everything. But the question is, is TV advertising harming young childern from the age two to five? 

As sad as it sounds but kids these days even in such a young age are confronted with TV and other technical devices. Kids in such a young age are in the middle of developing and learning things about the world, how to act, how to speak and so on. So when a child watches a youtube video for example and suddenly a commercial pops up, the parents don't know what kind of commercial it is. The commercial shows the child a new toy and manipulates it towards wanting it. The child starts to beg for it and the parents are in a dumb situation. Which is a clear pro argument for not allow commercials designed for kids.

On the other hand Parents should guard their children when they are watching something in the internet. In the TV most kids are probably watching the Kids TV-Channel, where the commercials are adapted to the watchers and so are Kids friendly. They should teach their children that they can't have everything in the commercials.

In my opinion I think it is a stupid idea to developed commercials directed towards such young children. I think it is sad that the industry has to target even babies and toddlers to sell their products. But I think if it would happen the parents should teach their children that they can't have everything shown in the commercial. Because this will help them in their life. Because when they get everything they want their whole childhood they learn that this is normal. And they will get problem in their adulthood. They could get ,,shoppoholics'' and could drown in their debts. In the end I would say stop commercials directed towards kids.
