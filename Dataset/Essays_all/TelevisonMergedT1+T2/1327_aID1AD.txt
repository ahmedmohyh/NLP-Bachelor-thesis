Media espcesially television is a huge part in our society. The contant and advertisement have a great impact on our daily lifes. If young childreen toke part in the system of advertisment the economy would gain a new part on the market and grow. Childreen are easy to maipulate in terms of consuming. They get less in touch with self earned money and thats why they are more willing to spend. But this inluence could confuse the childreen and could guiden them to decisions they would never made without the inention of a television advertising.

Televion advertisment is a common thing and it is needed to keep the economy in a flow.
The childreen have the opportunity to experience new things such as toys or playgrounds just by enerting the created world of fairy or a dragon. Even if the ad is made to gain new costumers sometimes they furfill a dream or help childreen in their life. For instance a platform for games in the internet can help the childreen to grow up with more experience and knowledge. 
At the other hand the ads are a possiple danger for parents as they have to pay for the growing dreams of their cildreen. It costs a lot of money to furfill the basic needs of a child, but a child that is desperated to own a toy or the newest clothes is not easy to handle in financial terms.

All in all the ads for young childreen can open up new opportunities but also can have a huge impact on the childhood and most of the time a maipulative and band one. Thats why I think tlevision ads should not be allowed. Moreover the parents should decide
