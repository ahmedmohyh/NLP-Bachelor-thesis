Todays selling strategies are especially about making money in any possible way and of course the advertising towards the costumer plays a big role for that. But should there be an age limit that forbids it that younger children stand under the influence of the companies?

A well known strategy to make profit is adressing the costumer directly and in buisness all tricks are allowed, so why not make the product attracting to little children who are an easy target since they don´t think about the fact if they really need it. Obviously it´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting so that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy. Of course it´s the parents that pay but the children are being annoying and loud for so long until they finally get what they want.
So some people might say those children are too young and shouldn´t stand under that influence because they can´t decide wether that toy is actually that much fun and laugh as it is presented on TV. But that argument is quite small since the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and so they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the TV and that can´t be bad at all.

Finally I support the opinion that television advertising towards young children doesn´t have to be forbidden because it´s not just the influence of TV commercial even when they go to the shops with their parents the companies always try to get the young ones to be interested in their products. So it wouldn´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the TV channels to reorganize the programm.
