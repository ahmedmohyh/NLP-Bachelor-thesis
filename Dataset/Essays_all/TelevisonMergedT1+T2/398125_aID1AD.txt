First I need to say that children between two and five aren't able to decide what's best for them. They probably just want to have everything that is "shiny" or "supercool". If they could choose between something they could use for the next hour that would be absolutely fun and something they could use for the rest of their lives that would be extremely helpful for their future, they would probably go with the first possibility. That shows that children just want to have fun and that's absolutely no problem at all, but it's clear that kids can't know what's best for them. That's the job of their parents. Children don't have a clue about money. But I guess that when they see an advertisment and they would want this superhero or this barbie it would be better if they choose. Otherwise their grandmother buys them something else but they didn't even want that, because they were dreaming of this advertisment. Further I think it's so important that children can play and enjoy their lives. Without any sorrows they just have to be young.Even though in my opinion those advertisments can cause a lot of trouble. If a kid wants one of those things, it's parents sometimes get under pressure. What if the parents can't effort that thing for their daughter. Or what if the son comes home from kindergarten and one of his friends has this superhero from the advertisment. This son wants the same but he gets into an argument with his dad because his wish is too expensive. An other point is, that children shouldn't watch too much television. They should go out and play with friends, this defenitely is possible even without any stuff from an advertising.
This discussion is really difficult because it sometimes gets hard to see into children but in my opinion it's better to not allow advertising directed to young kids.
