If I walk down the street young children do not greet me anymore. I would say this is rude and that in my childhood I would greet every older person because I was afraid of them. I had a huge respect towards elderly. In my opinion the technology is a possible issue which causes rudeness.

Many parents do not know how the raise their children. It is likely to give them a mobile phone or to let them watch television for hours. The time of goinig outside playing with neighboors is gone. When I look at the problem from this angle it is plausible to me. If they are not allowed television would be less watched. Imagine the your favourite television series would not be released no more, you would not watch television either. I guess this would work quiet the same for children. As a result children would not go more outside but they could get a distance between the television and in my opinion this would be a huge development.

On the other side the economy would gain less money. Furthermore some television programms have an effect of learning. In my childhood I got to about some animals by watching television. If I had not the possibility to watch television I doubt that I would be interested in animals now.

Rudeness has to to with caracter. I would say that I had not been rude in my childhood because my parents knew how to raise me. From my point of view the television has an impact on the caracteristics of a child. Additionaly chldren who are busier in watching television than in other things often do not know how to act proparly in society.

In essence, I see the point of the statement. Children get a lack by watching to much tv. I am pretty sure that this trend can not be stopped that easy but if we do not make something about it will get worse. By striking advertising television we could create an impact towards the children in a more positive direction.
