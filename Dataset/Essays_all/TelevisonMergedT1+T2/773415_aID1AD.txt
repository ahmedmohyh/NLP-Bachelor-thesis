Today everywhere we go, we are influenced by advertising. For us we know that and most of us can handle this, but how does it looks with the young childern? Do they know that there are influenced? Do they know that maybe there own desicions are not even there own?

Young childern should learn early to make their own desicions. In the young age they should be told about the television advertising by their parents. Maybe it is not a question about age, just about knowledge. So if they know there are influecend, they will realise it and do not get caught by televiosion advertising.
If the youngest generation knows about this influencing, the question is if they understand it. There is a reason why school starts in the age of seven years. In this young years they are not able to understand and even control that.The Television advertising is getting smater and smater and is finding new tricks to catch the young childern,which makes it even more difficult to understand this for the young childern.

Television advertising toward young children has two side. On one hand it is a great way for the industry to make their money and may also an easy way. On the other hand for the young children it is an unfair game, because they are not able to understand and control this influence. I think it would be good if the television advertising toward young children would not be allowed, but in my opinion it is not possible to stop the television advertising toward young children.
