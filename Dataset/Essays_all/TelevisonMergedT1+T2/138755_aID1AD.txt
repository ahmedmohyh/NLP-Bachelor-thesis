It is commonly known that television can have a big impact in children. Therefore we have to be patient and aware of what or chldren watch. 
The question is if the television should be in position to speak and to advertise directly to our kids. In my opinion they should be allowed. Television should be autorized to show this content. The other question is what they would show. If the publicity is about toys and normal kid's stuff, then it's alright with me. But if the program is leading to change kid's minds and tell them to do bad desicions, teach them bad manners or show them for example how to steal, then I wouldn't definetly aprove to this statement.

Parents have the responsabilty to be aware of what their child is watching. Children's minds should be widely open and show them beautiful and great things. I think television should be allowed to show advertising. It gives children the possibility to see new things.
