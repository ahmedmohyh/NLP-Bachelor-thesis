In the following I will explain my opinion on the topic of advertisements for young children in television.
An argument of the people creating those advertisements could be that children are just younger people so they should get advertisements as the grown-ups get them, too. 
But an argument against it could be that children get influenced by those advertisements in a bad way. So when they get for example an advertisement for a car for children which is maybe bad for the environment they are simply too young to understand that this is not a good thing. They are just so overwhelmed by the effects and the happy children in the advertisement that they think that this must be something good.
That is why I believe many people think that advertisements for children should be forbidden. They get influenced right from the beginning of their lives and are not able to make up their own opinion on things. So this will also have bad consequences for their lives when they are adults. 
Also it is just wrong in an ethical way to force young children to have the opinion on things that the media want them to have. Because in the end it is always the goal to make those children critical and make them really think about whether something that is being told to them is true or right.

So I agree with the statement because they are too young to understand and it's so easy to influence them in a bad way. It is better for the whole society to forbidd advertisements for young children so they get better adults in the end and maybe change something in the world for good.
But probably the creators of those advertisements and the whole company will make it very difficult to forbidd those advertisements at all.
