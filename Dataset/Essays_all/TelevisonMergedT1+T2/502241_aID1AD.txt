First we should have a look at the word "advertising". I think there are differente types of advertisements. For example advertising for violence films and games who should not be watched under 16, should not be directed to young children. They may get impressd of shooting and then in kindergarten they forme weapons with their fingers or take a brick and gunpoint at other children. I think the chance that they get aggressive later on in their life will be bigger than children who havent watched that type of these  advertises.
My oppinion is that if you let your child watching tv where the chance is huge that they see something for what their too young, you should sit next to them and give them the feeling that their not alone and that theres someone carring about them and their reaction about the advertising. 
On tv there are channels especially made for children. It has some stuff that is addapted to their age. I think that they should only watch these things, so they wont get confronted with things not made for their eyes.  
If we talk about the sesonal advertising, I cant see any problems. For example before christmas there is shown a lot of advertising for kids. These advertisings are especially made for kids to make them desire the toy shown in the advertisement. Of course after seeing the advertisement the children want it really badly. But then its your job as a parent to say no to them. Eaven if its hard sometimes. But with saying no they learn that in life you cant get all your wishes.  

At the end of it, I would say that as a parent you should really think about what kinde of advertisement you want your child to see. And if you let it watch a non especially childrenfriendly channel, you should really sit next to them.
