Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?

Is it O.K to show advertising in televison, which is directed to young children? Do these young children know what advertising is and are they able to judge if the object in the advertising is somthing good or if it is a product they can not use? 

In every televison advertising the things the company wants to sell looks so cool and useful. Lego Airplanes seem to fly and action heroes figures are able to walk. The advertising does not show the the products how they are in real life

Young children can't say if the need these things or not. The advertising shows how cool these things are and the young people are automaticly attracted to these things and want to buy them. When I was young, I wasn't able to make the difference between usefull stuff and unusefull shit. I think it's not fair because the young people think of everything in TV: " Oh look at this cool airplane!!! I want to have on of these! Please can I have one??" 

But I think there is also some usefull advertising for young children. If the advertising shows websites and online learning platforms, which are only designed for young children, then I think it's absolutly O.K to make advertising directed to young children. It's a good thing for young children to play easy games on websites like KIKA or SuperRTL. These websites are specially designed for children. The children can't do any faults or dangerous things on these sites.
And the children can learn pretty much from the games or the learning tasks. The children can learn to use the Internet on a save way.

I think toy advertising directed to young children is not a good thing but advertising for websites and learning platforms which are save ist
