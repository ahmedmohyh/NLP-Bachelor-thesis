Advertisements are invented to get more and more people to buy a specific product. Young children, especially aged from two to five are very easy to convince to buy something and mostly the parents also buy it for them, but should it really be banned? 

A lot of people think that the advertisements wich are made just for kids are mostly the ones for toys, but that is wrong. Often they tease stuff like sweets just for kids, and if they see them in the supermarket, they must have it and the parents often allow it, because otherwise the kids would scream through the whole supermarket. 

In my opinion, the bigger problem is not the advertising, it is the parents! Because the parents should theach the kids from when they are young that they can not have everything they want. And often the products from the advertisements are not as good as they are told to be, tha is something the parents should teach the kids too. 

You could protect the kids with not allowing advertisements directed towards young children, but in the end, they need to learn it when they are older. And once you have learned it correctly, you know it for sure.
