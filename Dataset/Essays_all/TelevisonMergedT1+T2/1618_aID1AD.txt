Everyone knows and see it, the happy world of products and advertising in Television. Most of us aren't really interested in watching it, but if something is very colourful and loud,the most childeren want to see it. So there offers the question if these kind of advertising, which is directed toward childeren, shouldn't be allowed?

The most interesting advertisings for childeren in age of two to five are toys, musik or nearly everything thats loud.Now imagine parents with their child are going through the supermarket and there is the new super cool waterpistole. Of cause the child want the toy, but the parents say no. The young child starts to scream, cry and rolling over the ground. These situation is anoying and embarissing, not only for the parents also for every other person around. The positive sites are only seen by the company of the product. Many parents want to stop the terror of their childeren and just buy what they want,and the company sees much money. 

I think it is not possible to stop the adverrtising directed to childeren in age of two to five, because it's a big deal for the companies and they wont stop it. But I would agree, that it should not be allowed to make these kind of advertising.
