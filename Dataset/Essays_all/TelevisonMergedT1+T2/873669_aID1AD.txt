Television for young children is always a big discussion. It had been one since the television was invented and it will be one in the future. There are many pros and cons. 
On the pro side is the fact that children can learn languages with th TV for example greman. Many children in Switzerland learn greman not swiss german but high german. They have a bigger vocablurary and a better pronounciation. Another argument is that the parents have some free time while their children are watching TV. If the mother have to do the housework or the father have to work it's easier to do while they're watching so they don't run around and scream.

But for each pro there is a contra for example in the TV programm there are many series which are totally bad. The figures do things the parents don't want their children to do or the children learn things which aren't correct and sometimes totally false. And in fact if they want to learn a language it's not better learning from the TV then from the parents of friends or in school. Another fact is the time some children spend before the TV. A lot of houres a day and this is worse than the pro arguments because if the children don't do any sports or go outside they become fat and unhealthy and they will have no friends to play with.

I think television advertising is not such a good thing,all in all there are more cons than pros. Althrough there are also chances for examples the children know how the world looks like and some programms have good series for learning something. If I had children, I don't know exactly what I would do but in the end each one have to make his or her own decision if it's wrong or right, good or bad. But we'll have the discussion several times the future because it's an important topic in our conected world.
