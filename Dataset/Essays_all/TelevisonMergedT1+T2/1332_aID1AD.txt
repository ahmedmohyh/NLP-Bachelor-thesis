In my opinion should television advertising not be allowed to young children, because kids in the age of two to five can not diside and handle stuff like that.
I could not answer more, because i do not know what television advertising is. So Ican not agree or disagree. Maybe childrens love it or hate it or they be to young to know what it is. if that is the case parents should diside what is good for their kid
