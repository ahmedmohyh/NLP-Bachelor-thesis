Advertising:
It is actual topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Nowerdays the television is a more and more important thing to younger people andso also theadvertising. 
There are a lot of advertisings directed to young children because if a product ist interessting for young people the chance is very high that they would buy it. If you fix the youth he will grew up as a consuming society. This are the best sights for a good working economy.Children at the age of two to five do not know that you have to work for the money and so they say without thinking, that they want you to buy the produt because they liked the advertising.
On the other hand you have to see that children at the age of two to five should not sit in front of the television. The should play outside with friends or if the weather is bad they should draw or something like that. Because if they just watch television and see the advertising they may will never see the reality. They start to want things because they see them in the advertising. They may loose the connection to the now and the reality. And at this age you are not able to decide what you realy want or need.
In conclusion I have to say that I think it is up to the parents. They should look for their children and should find a balance. It is their responsibility. And you also have to see that he company of the advertised product just does his work. So if you as a parent think that advertising, directed to younger children at the age two to five, should not be allowed, you have to change your own habit. You have to save your children from the advertising because it ist not up to the others. It is your child and you have to be responsible for it.
