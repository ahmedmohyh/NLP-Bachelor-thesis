In my humble opininon television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. In fact, the children in the age of two to five shouldn't watch tv at all. It is also quiet ineffective to direct Television advertising toward the young children because the aim of advertising is to sell their products but in the age of two to five you dont even realise what is going on in this advertisement and it doesnt affect you to buy this stuff. Television advertising can also be dangerous for the children: many advertisements have plenty of things which could affect the children by showing violence for example. In the childhood, watching tv without parents is dangerous. The parents should allow the children to watch specific Programms on specific times. This way doesnt have to watch advertisements at all. The Television advertisements for "pampers" are rather made for the parents than for the children themselves. But I dont see the purpose why the adults should buy this product because they saw it in a television advertisement. To sum it up the parents are responsible for their children not the advertisement company. Thats why it is not necessary to forbid the television advertising directed toward young children.
