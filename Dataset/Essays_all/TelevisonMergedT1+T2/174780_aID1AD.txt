I agree with this statement
I think there are lots of ads in the TV, who direct to young children. If the children look TV, they get attracted by this advertisement. Then they would really like to have this product (mostly toys). The children are easy to convince. If they see a toy and they think it's cool they want to have it. When I was a child I used to watch TV sometimes. I know how that feels, when you see a toy in an advertisement and you really want to get this toy. Thats just manipulative, kids are easy to manipulate.
I think youny children in this age shouldn't be watching TV to often anyways. The should rather go outsiede and play with other children, run around and have fun.
Maybe in these years the children don't even recognize, what's going on in the ads. Perhaps they don't even know what's going on when they watch a film. I guess the advertisements direct to older children. As a child you just think: "This toy is awesome, I wan't it". You don't mind if you have a hundret of toys.Every child would say it's a paradies to own so many toys. So in fact it's just all about the money. The ads direct to such young people, that the company who builds the toys earns lots of money.
