A lot of children start watching television at a young age. But should it be forbiden to let them watch TV?

Depending on what children watch in the television it can influence their life and behaveour in a bad way. For example if the watch series or films, wich aren't made for their age. 

On the other hand, children can also learn a lot by watching TV. It can help them in school and in their education, if they watch television for example in an other language, as they'd normally speak.

Another argument against letting young chlidren watch TV is, that they may spend a lot of their sparetime in front of the television, than playing with their friends.

But it also has to been said, that a lot of children haven't a lot of friends. And if their parents are always working and don't have any time for their children, it isn't that bad, to let these children watch TV. Otherwise they'd maybe do things wich are worse than watching TV.

TV can also teach children good kind of morals and what their rights are. And if a child is very selfcountious, the televison can teach him/her to love himself/herself and become more confident about themselves.

In conclusion I think that it isn't a bad thing, to let kids watch TV sometimes, not the hole day, but, as an example, some minutes per day or some hours each week, or somting like that. In my opinion, if the children watch the right kind of series and films, it teaches them more positive things than negative. So I personaly don't think there's a need to forbid children to watch television at a young age.
