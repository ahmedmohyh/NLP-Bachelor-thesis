Advertising directed towards children of all ages should completly not be allowed. Children don't have the mindset of beeing capable to judge for themselfs and are just influenced by everything they see. So it's crutial that we can regulate what children can see and what they shoulden't be abel to see. I think it would be good also for the parents, because if their children saw something they would want on the televison, they would go to their parents and ask them to buy them the shown item. This can be difficult to handle for yunger parents and parents who don't know how to handle a toddler who wants something so badly that he begenas to scream without a reason and parents who arent as rich than others. 
It would also diminish the advertising time an the television, who in my opinion is just rubbish and is the reason i stopped watching television. Maybe channels would be more attractive to people because they have no advertising at all. 
Toddlers in general are too small and too naive to comprehend anything that is going on, but when its something flashy and colorful they will want it. But children who are a little bit older who comprhend already a litle bit of the whole concept of television (that you can see moving images) they could maybe already understand that they can't have it just like this and they are more influencable of all thos advertisinigs, the reason is they can't have any of this bit they want it very badly.
