When I am alone at home with my little sister, aged four, she always wants to watch televison. Normally I like that too. But there is so much advertising, which makes her sometimes fear. So I often ask myself should it not be allowed that television advertising is directed toward young children. 

An advantage of watching advertising televison is that these children can learn something from the advertising. But it is not so good for them if they watch tv the whole day. They should spend more time with their friends and play together. An other positiv thing is that the parents can have some free time, while the child is watching a movie. But in these chase it is not useful if the child watchs television advertising. A lot of people say that young people get stupid because of the television. 
An other disadvantage is that young people don't learn to spend any time together and have fun without a television. They should play a game in the garden or do something else. An other negativ thing is that the children see things they don't know anything about it. And that's not good for their evelopment.

I think it's really important that young children don't watch too much television. When I was young we didn't have a television and i played a lot with my friends and neighbours. The parents should look by themselves what's good for their children and what not. I think it would be too complecated to itroduce these
