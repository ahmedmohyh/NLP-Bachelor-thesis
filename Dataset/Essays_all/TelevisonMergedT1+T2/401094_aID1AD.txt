These days many kids and toddlers already watch TV and there are many advertisments who are directed to them. But why are there advertisments even before the really understand what they're seeing?

Young kids are easily influenced. And since our society is one that's all about consuming products, there are many advertisments that secretly tell you to buy stuff that benefits their sales to make money. So why not start at a young age? These kids don't really understand what they're seeing and because of that, they can easily be brainwashed. While using a nice and soothing voice in their campaign, they're telling kids to buy these certain things. Suddendly when they're with their mother at the shopping center, they recognize certain items and cry for them until they get them. 
Advertisments are indeed really nice to look at but everyone should decide for themselves and create their own opinion about it.And little kids just aren't ready.

On the other hand, there are many aspects that contradict that. Little kids aren't ready. Maybe that's the point. They don't really understand the advertisments so they sure don't care about it. Then why forbid these advertisments? And if people think that they're kids are getting brainwashed, then maybe they shouldn't put them right in front of the TV. Parents can decide for themselves. It's not as if they are forced to let their kids watch these advertisments.

I, for sure, think that advertisments directed toward young children should not be allowed. The world is full oft advertisments and we really don't need more. Little kids shouldn't care about them.
