The followinf statement is ,,Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five)should not be allowed.'' In my oppinion the age two and the age five is a big difference,when you have a two year old children it's not good when you watch tv with because they're a lot too young for that. Two years old children have better things to do than watching tv,for example exploring new things and grow up,television did not help to grow up good.
When your child is older,for example five years,my opinion is,that it is okay,when they sometimes watch tv,but just for a half or one hour per day,five year aged children have a lot of other and better things,that they can do in their life.A better option what they can do is meeting friends from the Kindergarten and play with them,but in my oppinion it is okay and also normal,when the kinds can watch tv for one hour in the eavening.
 A good example is my babysitter job,the kinds are allowed to watch tv for one hour at the eavening.The kids are seven years,five years and three years old.In this situation it's okay that the three year old child watch tv,because they do it all together after that,they know that they have to go to bed. I think that conseqeces are a good option.
Kids should learn that television is not so good for them like reading a book or play with other kids. Another option is that,when you have for example two childs,the older one is six years old and the younger one is three years old,that you bring the younger one to bed for a little sleep for example after the lunch and in this time the older child can watch tv for a moment.
I think the consume of television in this young age can be really bad for the children,so i agree a bit with the statement.
