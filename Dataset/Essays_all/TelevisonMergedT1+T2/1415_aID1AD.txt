Every mum knows it. The moment when their child watches TV and suddenly screams: I want this! or: Mum, I want this for my birthday. But should it actually be allowed to put advertising directed to children on TV?

A big problem with children is that they want everything they see on TV. When a new ad comes on about a new Playmobil school or Starwars game, they want to have it. This summarizes up to big numbers of toys, which children want to have, which can be a problem for mums who don't have that much money and can't give their children the toy they want. Other than that children see that there is so much more they could have and their old toys or for example the new book their parents got them for their last birthday is already forgotten and they want the next thing. 
Wouldn't it be way better to forbid advertisement on TV for young children? Children are influenced by media already. Do we have to put in front of their eyes every new toy they have to have? And is it even necessairy? Kids should not be influenced and convinced by the media already in such a young age. They should rather watch Teletubbies without screaming: I want this! as soon as the ads are on. 
The problem is that even if ads were forbidden, children would see these toys in a store or at their friends house anyway so theres no point in not allowing advertisement. And what is a childhood without toys?
