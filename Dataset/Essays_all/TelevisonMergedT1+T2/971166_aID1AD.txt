Almost every child nowadays that lives in the developped world has the opportunity to watch television every day. There are even some channals that are especially made for children. In those channels the little ones can watch series all day long. Between every series will appear adverts which are also made especially for children. These adverts, for example adverts for toys, will make the kids want the products really hard and the children will go to their parents and make them buy them the toys or whatever the advert is advertising for.
It's clear that the products made for children must also do some advertising because if they don't do, how could they sell their products then? 
I can understand why parents don't like those adverts, because when they go shopping and take their children with them, the children will penetrate them every second because they see something they have seen in the adverts and with time this sucks.
But if parents don't want their children to do this they should'nt let them watch television. There are many other possibilities to let kids watch series or movies. For example there is a tablet, which I don't remember the name of, where children can download series and movies and there aren't any adverts. I know this because I have a little sister. Another way which is a bit more time consuming is to download the series or movies in the internet and then the children can watch them on the computer or on the television.
I think it's okay that the companies do advertising for children, because if parents don't want their children to watch those there are other possibilities to show them movies or series. There are also other ways to entertain the kids, for example the parents can play games with them.
