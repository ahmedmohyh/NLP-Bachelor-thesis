The question of whether or not television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, is quite difficult but important, since the early years of childhood shape us as humans. 
It goes without saying that children are easily influenced. Parents might want to protect their children from an exposure to advertising, since they fear it could be harmful for their mental well-being. When children see something on the television that is clearly marketed towards their age group, they may suddenly desire these things that they've never really thought about before, and that they don't really need. This could lead to a materialistic world view, that lots of parents disapprove of. 
If the parents spoil their child, the child could become greedy and keep on demanding new things. This can easily become a nuisance for the parents, but punishing the child by not allowing them to watch television anymore doesn't seem like a good solution. The damaging adverts are not the child's fault, after all. But how can parents keep their child from becoming obsessed with expensive toys? Especially when they aren't able to afford the things advertised on television, it may lead to conflict within the family. 
Children don't see advertising as something artificial, they don't recognise the presented scenarios as fictional and romantisised. If a child on TV can have such a good time playing with these dolls, then why shouldn't they? Sooner or later, children have to be made aware of the reality of advertising and its purpose. Some people might say that if the child is used to seeing adverts, it doesn't really pose a problem; the sooner they learn to recognise advertising, the better. But in my opinion, parents should introduce their child cautiously to the world of advertising, and forbidding advertisements aimed directly at them could be a huge benefit because the child can learn about adverts in a more removed, distanced way.
