Television advertising is annoying. But is it also annoying or even bad for children or just for older people like us ?
Some advertisings are psyhologically well-organised and as kids, who are easyly-amazed are watching TV as well, it would be a good question if it should be allowed to direct advertiing to kids or not. 

In sight of a parent I'd say it should noot be allowed. If they see the advertise they want to have it immediately and try to get it. This can be really annoying and also very stressful. A second point to agree to this statement is, that they always got showed what they don't have. They may feel sad because they know they can't afford it. Third, the kids should learn to live with less. So many spoiled kids don't learn how to deal with money and will have problems when they get older. 

But there are also some points which show that it can be allowed but it isn't really necessary. 
For example it is the child who decides whether they buy the toy or whatever. The parents decide and they should have enough confidence to say no if they don't want it. 
Also, I think young children do not care about the advertising too much. They just want to watch their series or films. They may be annoyed by it as well. 

In my opinion, it should not be allowed to direct advertising to young children. It is causes unnecessary problems. Kids should not be influenced by advertising. Otherwise they start to measure themself with other people and with what they have and what they don't have.
