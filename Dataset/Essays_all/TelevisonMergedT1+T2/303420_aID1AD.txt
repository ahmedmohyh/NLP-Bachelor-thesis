Television Advertising today is often directed to young children especially in Christmas time. In the follow sentences i give my statement to this subject.
First of all we must see that the factories and companies want to sell their product, so it's essentially for them to produce television advertising. Especially the Children aged two to five are a goal of this advertisings because they haven't the expierence what they want.
On the other point of view the advertising directed toward them influences the children to much, so that they want this product, and maybe get some anger with the parents, if they don't want that the children get this product. Secondly they didn't know if this product is something good for them or not because they're not able to judge the product and believe everything which is said in this product.

In my point of view it should be allowed to direct advertising toward young children, but with some borders. Only advertising for product which support the childrens learn process should be allowed. Because this product maybe didn't get enough recognicement so they should place the advertisement in the television. Other products like toys with no learn function shouldn't get the possibility to place advertisement toward young childrens
