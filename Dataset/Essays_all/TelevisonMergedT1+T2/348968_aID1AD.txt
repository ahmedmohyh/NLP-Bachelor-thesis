The open market worldwide is booming and every company needs to claim themselve. Just because, the companies need to make advertisements which are shown in the TV then. Young children (aged two to five) have this "aww-effect" which attracts the potential clients attention. Maybe he remembers the advertisement, and thats exactly what its company wanted to reach. In this way, television advertising is a good support for the economic growth. 
But, who thinks at the children, who are effected. I mean, who is able to make serious decisions in this age? Perhaps later, these grown up children regret what hey did in the past. In some way, it`s there parent`s fault. They were the actors who forced there own children to be in a television advertising, just because they are "soooo proud" parents who always wanted the best.
