Television advertising is not a new phenomen in our modern technical world. No matter where we are and go, there will be an advertise following us. It might be in a town on a big promotion board, in the window of shops or it simply appears on our smartphones. But what happens with the new generation that already grows up with such things?
Young children from two to five are highly affectable. They copy the behavior of people around them all the time. If it is the way we talk, how we treat people or simply our gestures, they will adapt to it. This means that advertising directed toward young children might end really bad, depending on what advertise it is. Imagine young girls, not even six yet, already get told what they should wear and how they should look to count as "pretty". It sets up a picture of how life should be, rather then letting children try it out themselves by going out and discover new things in nature or with friends.
On the other hand, advertising towards children might not be too bad. You could use it to show them how important a good school degree is or that sport is good for your health. 
However advertising affects without us actually realizing it. Can we let that happen to our children? Can we just let them slowly be "brainwashed" by our economy? No, we can't! 
In my opinion, advertising is far too present in our modern lifestyles. It affects us so strongly and not a lot seem to know or care about it. I'm against advertising in general, but especially our children should be protected against television advertising!
