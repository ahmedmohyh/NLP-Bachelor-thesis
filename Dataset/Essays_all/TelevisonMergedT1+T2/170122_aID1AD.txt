The question here is should it be allowed that televison advertising be directed toward to young children aged two to five. It is something that concern a lot of people almost parents who are interested how they children should get adults. 
The first advantage is when de advertisement would be allowed to young children that mostly the shops or the people behind the advertisement who are trying to sell something could better do this than. Young children are simple to manipulate because if they see something in the televison the want to have it. So the parents have to buy it because they want to see their children happy. The second advantage could be if young children can choose if they want to watch an advertisement or not they could influence that. 
On the other hand this idea have also his disadvantages. For example children aged two to five are kids and they do not really think about what they do or watch on the television. They just want to play and have fun and do not think that they become manipulated of any advertisement. An other disadvantage is when young children watch to much television they can end up being alone all the time and do not have any friends or other hobbies. They forget that it exist an other world outside and they might become unreliable at school. 
But who say that children aged two to five even should watch televison and then advertising directed toward them? I think young children should live their life as a child and play a lot with their friends, being outside. If they want to rest for a time alone they could read a book or something like that but they should not spend too much time watching televison and get manipulated of different advertisement. 
For conclusing I would say that children aged two to five are too young for television or for example using to often applications on the smartphone. They should not be confrontated as young kids because they do not know always what they really want or need and what they just want to have.
