In the modern world advertising becomes more and more important. You cant step out of your house and not be bombared by dozends of advertisments. Even the children are nowadays a target because of their influence on their parents. I think that somewhere there have to be limitations regarding the age. 

Of course there are some realy good reasons for the advertisments for children. These days the content on television is suffering because fewer people watch television than before. Many people have even refused to own a tv because of the poor content. The children channles are also forced to alter their programe. Somebody has to pay for their cartoons. This problem would be solved if companies could make money with them.
The economy would also grow because the consumation of goods would grow. The society would profit from that.
Of course the parenting would be a bit more complicated because of the many wisches their children would have. 
 
On the other side though children would become conditioned from an early age on and woulg probably think twice before buying stuff when they reach their teenage years. This on the oter hand has a negative effect on the economy and would destroy our financial system because a psychologcal responce to adverisments is crutial these days. 
My biggest problem is that the companies manipulate children who are not able to take dessisions yet. That is a very dangerous development.

To conclude there are a lot of arguments against and some good reasonst for the advertisment allowing. I think that our society is used to the order and rules of our world and to change such vital things would mean to make dangerous experiments. Are we really ready to do such things?
