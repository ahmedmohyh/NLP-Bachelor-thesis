Since the last few years technology made a big step forward. Every family in Europe has at least one tv at home and is watching it one or more times a week. Today is it impossible to grow up without these things (like tv, internet...) and because of this we are confronted with the enormous development since our youth. In school we have to be able to say what's going on in the world and the most of young people don't like reading the newspaper. 

The same is for the young Children (aged two to five). Parents are often busy and let them watch tv when they haven't time to play or talk with them. For the children it is like learing the language and understanding the connection between humans and their life. So when they are watching tv and it appears an advertising about a product for example a choclat drink and they were talking about how healthy this is, the child thinks that this is so. But we adult persons (most of us) know, that this could be also fake or not right. The same in an advertising with a for example young man smoking, It shows the young children that smoking isn't something terrible and unhealthy. They see just the good in this situation, like the smile of this young guy or how he enjoys the smoking.

In my opinion there are too many advertising in the tv. I wouldn't say that the advertising is at all worse but it shows often not the reality about product. Just the good side of it, so that the persons which are seeing it buy it later. On one hand I don't like these advertising in the tv, especially when I think about the fact that young children watch the same as me. On the other hand it isn't everytime so bad. We learn new things about new products and we keep in touch with the development of the technology, nutriation etc. Because of this I think is it more  importante how the children grow up or more how the parents handle with this situation.
