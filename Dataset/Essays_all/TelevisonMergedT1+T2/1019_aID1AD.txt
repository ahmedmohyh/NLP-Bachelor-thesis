A argument on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
First i will write the argument against the statement. Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need. In this age they are  already able to show us what they want. The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment. Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.
Second i will write arguments for the statement. The advertisment has an influence on the Children and in this age they don't know when they are under an influence. Additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the Children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not. The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money. 
I think that television advertising that is directed towards young Children should not be allowed, but young Children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their Children watch.
