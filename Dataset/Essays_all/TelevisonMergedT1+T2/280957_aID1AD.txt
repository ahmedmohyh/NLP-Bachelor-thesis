A controversal subject nowerdays is television advertising directed toward young children. It is often seen as a problem because the young children get very fast fascinated from the advertisment and then force the parents to buy certain things. Television advertising should be allowed because thats the reason how they get their money but for the kids that don't really understand how the advertising influenc them its a bad thing.

  One aspect why television advertising is allowed is because thats the way how the producer get their money. With that money they make new shows or series and pay their worker. We and our kids whatch it later. This is the good part about television advertising. The problem is how they make their advertising. 

  The producer of the TV shows know exactly how advertising for kids work. It must have a lot of bright colours and has to be very loud. The children get a feeling of "WoW, thats awesome" then they want to buy it. They don't understand that they got influenced by the advertising and thats the problem. The kids have a lack of knowledge and are not experienced with such things. And the advertising producer use that for their profit.

The idea of the advertising for getting money for producing and other things is good. The problem is that the producer use the lack of knowledge and experience from the kids for their profit. This is very mean and nasty and should not be allowed for kids aged two to five.
