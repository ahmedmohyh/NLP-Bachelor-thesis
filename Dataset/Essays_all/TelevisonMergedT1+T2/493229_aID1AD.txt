Should television advertising for children be allowed?

Nowadays there are many children who already have access to smartphones or tablets, eventhough they are very young. Television consume has got advantages and of course also disadvantages. In the following explanation I try to show you them.

First of all, television advertising can be a good thing, if they show you for example how to behave in society. When they explain why you should always sneeze into your elbow or why you should always be friendly to people even if you do not like them, they can give the children tips how to survive in their further life. they would learn those behaviours from young age on, and would possibly behave like that without asking themselves why they have to do that. It would also be a good thing for the parents, because they do not have to tell them the whole time, how they have to behave, because the aready got drilled like that.

But on the other hand, television consume should not be allowed for that young aged children. Instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature. The children should learn to beschäftigen themself. Advertsising can be really bad, when they show the children a wrong picture of a average lifestyle, then the children get a wrong impression. For example they could think that it is totally normal to move into their own house with eightteen and already own a expensive car. Those habits can influence the children really badly and make their lives more complicated than it has to be.

I think it should be forbidden, because children are too young to handle all those impression. And the parents should teach their children on their own, how to possibly best manage their future life.
