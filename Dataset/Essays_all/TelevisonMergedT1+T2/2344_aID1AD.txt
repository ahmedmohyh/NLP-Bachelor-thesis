There are many arguments pro and contra the telivision advertising with children. One argument contra is that mostly the parents decide their children be in the advertising and it is not the wish of the child. The parents, who do something it that way, are very interessted in the carier of the child, so the young person doesn't have a chance to say something against it. Also the kids have to work as hard as a normal person and can not live like a child. They start their life in the spotlight and that is not a good thing for young children.
On the other hand some children are interessted in this world and it is fun for them. Some of them really want to do this and their wish is to be a star. The way is very hard, but they wanna make it because it is their dream.

In my opinion that should not be allowed because the children can not be children. They are too young to think about that and this life, this step is mostly too hard for them. I think, most children, who think that they really want this, say this only because it is the wish of the parents and don't know what it is like to life like a normal kid.
