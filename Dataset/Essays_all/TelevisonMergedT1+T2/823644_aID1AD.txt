I think letting young people (aged two to five) watching TV won't bring huge problmes within, if you let them see stuff made for their age.
That means that parents have to know what their children watch and when series are on the TV specially produced for childrens learning. From 6 AM to 12Am are channels like bbc full of learning series like laura the explorer and others, while at 8PM films with violent scenes are on which can cause sleeping problems by little children. So good parenting means letting your child watch TV when something approached is on and at specific times not all they long bacause children should still make use of their own fantasie and play games with their mates. In my opinion watching TV for a long time will make you lazy to do activities made up on your own, so in younger years it's a huge danger because what you learned once you won't forget easily. After all I can't really take a black or white opinion on this statement because watching TV can be good for children when you give it to them in a responsible dosis, and it can be worse than bad if you let them watch all day long. 
Finally i think it's difficult to not allow television advertising directed toward young children because how do you wanna control if someone let them watch,and when we think of the fact that some parents will let them watch and some don't we have an other problem that children aren't treated ecually what causes disappointment and fights between childrens and their parents.Further the new technology brings up mobile phones on which children can watch youtubevideos or do online games all day long, I'd say that's a bigger problem, which should be discussed.
