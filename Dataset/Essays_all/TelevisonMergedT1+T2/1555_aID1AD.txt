Television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed. I really agree with this statement and I will show you the reasons in the following text.
A boy watch television and after every thirty minutes there comes different advertising for ten minutes. The young boy ,who is just two to five years old see the advertising and that ist not very good. At first he will be influenced with five years or lower. That could be very bad for his following future. For example: He watchs very often TV and because of that he realize all the new products, which he always want to buy. 
The advertising for young children is very attractive for them, because there they show the young children new "Barbies" or anything else. The hypothalamus, the most important thing of the head, of the children is not completly produced. So they can not devide between the advertising that is good for them and the advertising that should manipulate them. 
Arguments against the advertising toward children are in the following text. A young child, aged two to five, should not watch television. And if they don't watch television they won't be influenced. So in my opinion the parents should have a look on their children and control they media life of their child.
The reason of advertising is that it should make the people buy these things in the supermarket for much money. 

All in all I would say that the advertising directed toward young children, isn't very good for the future of the children. And I hope that the whole world could see that the future of our children is the most important exercise in our world and I really hope that we stopp manipulate ourselves and our future with advertising.
The children are our future so don't destroy these good base
