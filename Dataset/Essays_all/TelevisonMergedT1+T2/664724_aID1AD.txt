These days while watching TV, every 30 minutes there will be an ad. Obvioulsy if you are watching TV online, you can have an adblocker but the people on television will experience those ads. They might effect us but especially our children. Therefore should we forbid television ads which even are directed to the children? 

First, the parents would save a lot of money. Children do want whatever they see (based on my experience). So let's say they want an iPhone which they saw on TV while watching an ad. They would beg and beg for this kind of piece of technology and even they are starting to make a mess. What can we do then? We nearly "have to" buy it for them and those aren't that cheap like a teddy bear. 
Second and last those ads might shape their life. In the future they could be all lazy bed room sleepers with their iPads and iPhones in their hands and doing nothing. They wouldn't go out to play with friends or even doing sports because they are used to be on their new devices. Those ads provide different things to them which might be dangerous in the near future.
On the other hand, they might see something very useful due to an ad like a useful gadget or stuff like that. The ads these day does have some really useful stuff. 
Another aspects by allowing the ads would be getting ideas for the future. They might get an useful idea of a future product. So in that case it would be good to direct those ads to children.

But if I have to decide to forbid those ads directed to children or not, I would probably say yes. When I was a child, I wasn't hanging out on PC's/ iPhones, I was going out playing some football and having fun with my friends. Those ads weren't effecting us because there were just toys stuff like teddy bears these days. But now we have iPhone ads or even worse. As I said in the beginning in every 30 minutes there is an ad. Maybe in the near future there will be an adblocker for TV's?
