Television advertising is nowadays exrteamly popular. A couple of years ago mostly adults and adolesents watched TV. Nowadays there are many TV programs for children only. Betweeen the different shows there is alot of advertising directet toward  young children. The advertising mostly includes advertising for toys. The thing is most of the advertising is about toys for young children but at the same time designed to adjust the parents. The üarents decide in the end if the toy is going to be bought or not. A child under the age of five like to touch and feel stuff. If they only see it on TV they can't really associate with the object. So the advertising is indirectly for the parents. If it is I don't see a reason why it's not okay. 

If you look at the moral aspect of the whole story, it might be not that okay. Advertiser is using young children and mostly young parents. It can be that a chid sees something on the TV, that they despretly want. So it screams and crys till they have it. Young parents mostly don't have alot of money, because they are building a new life and have to stay at home because of the children. So it's not okay to missuse the need of those children, so the parents have to buy the toy. 

All in all you have to see for yourself if it's fine for you or not to advertise on TV towards young children. The advertising is there anyhow so if you don't like it don't let your children watch TV. I don't think it's okay for children at a very young age to sit a wholeday in front of a TV. It leads to stupidity and numness.
