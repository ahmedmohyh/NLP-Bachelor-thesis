In the following essay, I am going to talk about television advertising towards young children. In my opinion, i think advertising is anoying, doesn't matter wich kind of advertising, but there still are differences. If you create advertising for adults, they have to deal with it. It is nessesary for brands/factories to advertise, to sell their products. But it is wrong to create advertising directed toward children or young children. They don't understand what advertising is and they just think the product is so great. They will ask their parents to buy it and they will probably say no. Now the children think their parents just don't want them to have fun and they will get mad. This is really bad for a family and so i think advertising towards children should not be legal. 
But if zou think about television advertising it should be a different discussion. If parents let their little children watch tv it is their own fault. It is wrong to give young children a tablet or a smartphone and it is also wrong to let them watch tv. If these children see some advertising on the tv or in the internet it is the fault of the parents and not the fault of the brands/factories. 
In conclusion i think it should not be allowed to advertise directed toward young children, but television advertising is okay, because young children should not even be allowed to watch tv.
