To ban all television advertising directed to children this age you would have to prove that such advertisement harms them. Otherwise I don't see a problem why it shouldn't be allowed. Children that age are already able to watch television and understand what is being shown. There are many shows on TV directed towards children aged two to five. Of course advertisement is a bit different than kid's shows but the idea is still the same. Especially when the advertisements look just like or are even about TV shows for young children. Although the children cannot purchase the products shown in the commercials themselves they can ask their parents if they are allowed to have it.  Many may argue that airing advertisement for kids can be annoying for parents and spoil the children but I don't see how this does any long-term damage to the children. The commercials should be reviewed by experts so it is made sure that they are acceptable for children. As long as the advertisements do not promote bad things for example violence I don't see a problem with them being shown on TV. They could even promote toys with learning effects. I think television advertisement should be allowed as long as it has been reviewed.
