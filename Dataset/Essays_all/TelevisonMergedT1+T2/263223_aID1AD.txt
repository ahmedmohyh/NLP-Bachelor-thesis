In this essay I will write about television advertising, and if it should be prohibited to diect it towards children aged two to five. With pro and cons I will explain my point of view and how I experienced it as I was a child. 

Advertisment is part of our every day life. Werever we go, we see it on TV, hear it on the radio or pass them on the highway. But why is television advertising differently? Probably because we don't have to have a big imagination and the feelings which they want to connect with the product are more real and more easily to transmit to the audience. 

Especially for products made for children, it's one of the easiest way to show it during a break on TV. Children can be highly influenced by television advertisment, as they aren't yet able to completly  disinguish between real and fake. Reality and fiction are close together and with their  fantasy and the shown product they want to make it to a part of their own life.  

In my opinion it's not a necessitiy to prohibit advertisment towards children. It's part of our society and every one is influenced by it. It's nearly impossible not to come in contact with any kind of advertisment. The only thing parents can do to keep their children partly away, is to control what they are watching and to explain the goal of the advertisment.
