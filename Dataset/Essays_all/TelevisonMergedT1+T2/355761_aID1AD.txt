Btw. im tired and hungry so dont expect anything.

Television advertisements are a thing, every television watcher is exposed to. From a very young age, to uneducated and older people. Advertisements can be very manipulative and almost brainwashing, so therefore a majority of people think that advertisements to small children should be banned. In this Essay I will figure out wether or not this is worthy my time or not.

On one hand, they are ads and people who put their two year old children infront of a television either know, that they are confronting their children with ads and don't care, or if they don't know, they are probably too dumb to have children anyway.

Also, how are companies supposed to sell their products, if they are not allowed to promote their products. Every big company we know got their name off of marketing, for example coca cola or mc donalds. They will make no to little profit and stop selling products directed towards young children.

On the other hand, children are easily manipulated and an easy target for any kind of ad or propaganda. They can bevery stubborn in what they want and they don't fear the ways to prove this.

To conclude I will say that all parents should be aware of the consequences. If they don't want to confront their children with ads etc. they can buy them DVD's and download movies, because "free" telelevision also needs a way to earn money and stay alive. Therefore i think advertisements in any way should not be banned.
