Nowadays a lot of children in our society grow up with electronic. Especially young Children aged two to five, which haven't yet been at school spend a lot of time watching TV. But can we agree with this phenomen?

Today there are a lot of televison shows in which children can learn for example how to act in our society. Their are some shows in other languages, in those the children can learn how to count, to spell or to write. Also for parents it is sometimes really practical, when the parents are busy the kids chan watch TV. The children grew up with the new technicals and electroncis in our world.

When the parents don't have a lot of time, little children are sometimes watching to much TV. They spent the whole day inside and can't play outside with other children in the same age. This influences their social compartment and has an impact on their behaviour. Sometimes I see little children in the bus witch are watching televison during the whole busdrive and they don't even recognize their enviroment. 

In my opinion Televison has positive and negative influences on young children. I think it is really effective to learn for example languages. But if they are only sitting in front of the TV and don't play outside or with other children their are negative impacts.
