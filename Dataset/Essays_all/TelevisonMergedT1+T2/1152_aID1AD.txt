When it comes to young children parents tend to protect them from outer influences as long as possible. On the one hand you could say parents are overprotective, children must learn about the actual reality and have to deal with the triggers people send with advertisements. Parents themselves often cannot recognize the triggers in advertisements and watch them daily without fearing an influence by media. So you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children. On the other hand the young children's brain must firstly learn when truths and when lies are told before they can be confronted with advertisements which influence children's thoughts. Television advertisements manipulate the brain by sending out triggers often not recognized by the mentality. Children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age. To not leave children with this manipulation is not overprotective it is good parenting, which protects young children from problematic influences until they can do it themselves, so I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, but only until they do can tell truths from lies or triggers, they cannot be cut of reality because of potential influences for their whole life.
