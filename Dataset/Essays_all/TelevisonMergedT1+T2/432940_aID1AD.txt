In my opinion television should be allowed but just in small ammounts because it is really unhealthy. The brain can not fully develope if they do watch too much television. But i dont think that  a small ammount of television is too bad. If ou watch a presentation of Manfred Spitzer he can explain you every single detail. He is a professor for neurosciences. If you want you can also ask Samuel Tschokke he is a very good informed man if you want to know something about biology. When i was a child i didnt watched too much television but sometimes i watches some Walt Disney movies together with my family. I think this has yust a good influence as long as the consume isnt too high.
