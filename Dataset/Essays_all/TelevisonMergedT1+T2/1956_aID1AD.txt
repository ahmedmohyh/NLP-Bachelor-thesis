Since the technology developed in the past years it is nearly normal that every child watches TV or play with mobile phones, tablet computers or laptops of their parents or already their own devices. A good point about television is that there is a control what children are doing and what they watch. On the world wide web you can never now which page your child just visit and what the content of this page is. That should not mean that Television is good for kids and that they should be allowed to watch it as long and as often as they want.
The biggest problem with adverising directed towards young children is that they can be manipulated really fast. For example if your child watches an advertisment for a toy and on TV is is presented with chilren playing with it your child maybe really wants to have this toy as well because in the advertisment the children all looked so happy. 
Allowing the direct advertising could effect that the products the advertisment is for are already seen by the kids and not by their parents so the childen can choose on their own if they like the toy or not. If just the parents get to know this advertisment and think that this could be good for their children the children could not like it and are manipulated by their parents if they introduce the toy to them and tell what the good things are about it.
But controverse to that point just named,it is important that young children mostly watch TV to see the next story of their favorite children series. They do not want to the story to be interrupted because of some advertisments, they want to know what will happen with the people and animals in the show.
To come to a conclusion, I defenetly agree with the named statement. Childhood should be playing outside with friends and do what children like to do. And if they watch a children story for half an our a day on TV they should be allwoed to do that and not be interrupted by things their parents should buy to help the capitalism to rise.
