The first thing that comes to my mind, is that this statement can't be answered by yes or no.
Advertising is made by companies which wan't to sell their products. They're using their knowledge to catch the attention of the group of people they want to speak to. So when they sell something for young children, aged two to five, the products are things which kids love, like sweets or things to play. 
Young children don't think about the original thought of the advertisment, they just think 'I like that' or 'I don't care'
As I was a little child a few years ago, I can face this problem quite well. The next thing they do is talk to their mother and ask if she could buy that. I think parents don't even react anymore to this question, beacuse they're ask that all few seconds. 
Another question is, how much television do children in this age watch. All the technological progress causes youth using television earlier and earlier.
I think companies achieve much more sucess when they use advertising which is directed toward adults, because they can buy all the things themselves. 
Little children first have to ask the parents which decide if the product will be bought. So in my opinion this is mainly a question of annoyed parents. If you look at this question from the psychological part I think children are influenced by all the advertisments in medias, but I don't think it changes much in the emotional part, So if I look at the statement now, I think it doesn't have any positive aspects from the side of the client, but it forces the the companies.
