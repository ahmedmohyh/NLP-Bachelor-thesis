Should we ban ads for kids in TV?
We all would rather like to live in a world without advertising, but if that would be the case, we wouldn't have any money for the entertainement we crave for. But with children, especially young ones, we have the problem, that they can be easily manipulated. So the trivial answer would be to just ban ads directed towards kids, but is this better? The entertainment branche would loose the money and therefore the interest to produce quality content for children. The consequence would be, that there will be none or bad television for children and that's not the aim with this ban. Also this ban would only affect the television, but what about other media like magazines or the internet, where there can still be advertised towards kids. And since we live in a capitalist society the television would get less popular and the problem will just shift to other media. We could argue, that it is better if the children don't watch any TV at all or that kids these days don't watch on the classical TV screen and rather are surfing the internet, but that's beside the point. 
My opinion is, that we shouldn't ban all advertising directed to children, but regulate it stronger, to prevent from biasing the next generation.
