Nowadays many children spend hours in front of electronic devices and the worst part of it, they get animated by advertising and pictures. Back in time the kids were playing football outside and today you can find them playing football in the living room, their eyes fixed on a screen. 

Fist we should point out the medical part. Spend to much time in front of the television can lead to overweight and socail isolation that has an effect to the physical and psychical life. Children in their young ages shouldn't have any contact with electronic devices that are showing us pictures and impressions because eyes that are that young aren't able to capture all of them and the brain has not been ready yet to identify this rapidly chanching moments.

However, if children below the age of five get in contact with advertising especially produced for them, they make the parent to buy this stuff that appeared in the television. The problematic is that familiys who have not that much money and  buy this things to make their children happy, often get in struggle with dealing way more important things like paying bills for school and medicine. 

On the other hand we always get in connact with advertising, even if we are going to the supermarket or just for a walk on the strees. Children see pictures that are producet to animate adults to buy something and if their seeing advertising anyway, why should they see advertisig directed toward them. 

In my opinion it sould not be allowd to produce advertising especially for children under the age of five because they are not able to identify that impressions and it is nearly impossible for them to handle with all this pictures. This advertisings in the television leads to a social isolation of the child and exactly in that young ages it is important to have connections to other children and familys and if they can not grow up with that knowlege how to threat and talk to other people it can have fatal influences for their entire life.
