Some people think that it isn't good when little children watch TV. They say that the television destroys the eyes of the children because children are then right now in the process where they are growing and getting educated. That the television makes the children stupid is also a opinion of some people. Children in this age should go better outside and see the natur and have fun by getting dirty in the playground. So they can be fit and not sitting on the couch and be lazy, It's also better when children are outside and getting dirty so they can have a better imunsystem and so they can't get often sick.Sometimes they are very stupid children shows like Teletubbies. The childrens are imitating the language of Teletubbies and it can have influenc in the futur. So they will have problems when they are learning how to speak. But they are also positiv sides. They are so many TV shows for children that are very helpfull to learn important things. Dora is that kind of show that improve the language and the logic thinking. In the show Dora they learn the colours, numbers, shapes and a lot of other important things that a children at this age should know. The Tv is also a good chance for children that don't like to go outside to learn view things. When it's raining children can watch TV and have fun. I also watched very often TV when i was a little child and i learn a lot by watching TV. But i think it's not okay when the children never go outside because the real life is outside and not in the living room. For one hour a day watching TV is okay at this age but not more. It's funnier at the playground that inside the house.
