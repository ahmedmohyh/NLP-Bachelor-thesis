Should the television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) be allowed or not allowed ?

Personnaly I think that the telivision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think at the age of two to five years the children are to young and it will be better waiting more years with it or you can make a limit of watching television and only 1 hour at one day or something in this way. 
I think that it is not a good way to grow up your child if it can watch television because then he wants it more and more and it will be more difficult to not allowed them watching televison so long or all day. 
I think it has to have a limit how long and when young children ( aged two to five ) can watch television because it has also more think to learn for them and it has very much better things to do. The children has to learn things also outside and do something and they have to be activ when they are so young, they don't have to sit at home infront of the television and doing and learning nothing. It can be one hour ore more like a limit how I sayd because to watch television isn't a bad thing for young children but it has to have a limit.
It has so much things to do with young children, they have to see something and be activ at their young age that's important for them. 
At the end I can say that I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed. But I can also say that I agree not totally with the statement because it isn't a bad thing and if it has a limit and it is controlled it can be allowed.
