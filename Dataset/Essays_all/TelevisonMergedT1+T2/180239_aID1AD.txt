I grew up without television and I think that wasn't that bad. Nowadays the problem is that alot of parents use the technology more often then mine. So the child also, but it is bad when the child just watch TV without do something with the neiborhood childrens. The kids can watch TV thats absolutly no problem but they have to do also other things. It's also important what they watch on TV, if they watch some shooter movies is that acutually very bad. But kids also could learn from watching television, when they watch documantary about animals that isn't that bad, beause they learn something. I think the parentes should watch what there children watch on TV. But like under five years I think they shouldn't watch at all TV. At that age the kids have to learn more important things. At this time they aren't even in the kindergarden. But you can't say that it isn't allowed, because how do you wonna know that? The parentes should make the decision even if I say no to that.cIt's actually normal that today the people work with more techonolgy or just always use it. A live with out smartphone? Alot of people can't imagine that. So it's just likely that the kids grow up with that. Even if it would be better with out.
For me it would be no, I won't do that.i know alot of kids which grow up like that. But writer now we can't make a decison, when this generation is at our age we can tell. Not before. A day ago I read an article about parents, which don't care about there kids, so thats just an excample how it could end. If you wonna chill with your friend and just because of that your kids watch TV it's worse.
