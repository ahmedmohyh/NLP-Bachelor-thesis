The statement which says " A teacher´s ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught." is not correct. Because a theachers job is to teach the school things that students need to know and not to be nice and being close to the students. 
The teachers job ist about teaching students, giving them advice and telling them how to behave. These are reasons why there are teachers in this economie. Students have to go to school and they don´t want to be close with there teachers, they want to learn things about life and all the things they have to know. 
It´s good if the teacher can relate to the students, so the teacher knows what they think about specific themes, which is good aswell. Because if the teacher is not friendly to the students and can´t relate to them in any way, then the comunication is totally wrong. 
There somehow needs to be a relation between the students and the teachers, because without this the teacher and the students can´t work well together. So if there is a main relation in which everyone can work good, than it´s perfect. Learning is also more fun when the teacher can relate to the students. 
But all of this doesn´t count more than the excellent knowledge of the teacher about their subject. Than if the teacher can´t teach students anything, why would students have to go to school then? 
A teacher needs to know everything about theire subject, so students can understand how everything works. 
I disagree with this statement, because , as i said in my text, a good level of comunication is good, but the teacher needs to teach students properly. So the  relation to students is not more important than the subject itself.
