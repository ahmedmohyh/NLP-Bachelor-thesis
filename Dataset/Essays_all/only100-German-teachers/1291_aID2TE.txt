It is always a good thing to relate good with people. In a school it is very important, because the students are there because they want/ have to, so it needs a neat atmosphere.It is easier to learn/ study when the atmosphere is good. But the students are there because they want to learn, to "become intelligent".
The students can´t learn efficient when the teacher relates to good to the students. But when they have to come to school, bescause they want to learn, it´s a good thing to relate good on them, because then a kind of motivation appears.
The motivation will bring them to the point, that the students go to school because it feels right and they want to learn more and more, because the teacher is nice and neat. It´s fun to work with the students and the teachers. In my opinion one of the best aspects in life is that that you need fun while school or working. When you don´t have fun, it´s a problem, because then you´re not motivated enough, to go there. Especially while school, the school is the best thing to get knowledge, and to get a good work, to have money in the rest of your life, is decided by the "rate of knowledge" you´ll earn.
When you want an really good Abitur, then you´ll have to learn a lot. So the best way to get a good Abitur is just learn and go to school, it doesnt matter if you don´t like the teacher or the teacher doesn´t like you. It´s easier when you and the teacher like eachother, but that´s not always possible.
So my main opinion about the statement is, that a point is needed, where both of these theses meat eachother, so the teacher have to be nice, but not that nice, but he needs an excellent knowledge of the subject as well.
