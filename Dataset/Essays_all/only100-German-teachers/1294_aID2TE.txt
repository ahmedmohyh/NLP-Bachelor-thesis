Teachers can have a huge influence according to the way a pupil/student learns something that they try them to teach. There are two possible scenarios of what can happen with the student. The first one is a good memorization of the information that the student is getting taught and being motivated. The "realtionship" between him and the teacher plays an important role. If the teacher's lessons aren't boring for the students but interesting, he will be motivated to learn more and maybe even remember that what he learned years after the lesson. Another aspect is the beahaviour of the teacher towards the student. If he for example often criticizes the student because of mistakes he made he then will be as a consequence very demotivated und pessimistic. The reason is that he doesn't believe that he someday will be doing something right. He thinks himself of being a loser. The first scenario can only be accomplished if the mentioned aspects necessarily are existent. If not than the hopefully happening first scenario leads to the second scenario, where the student doesn't really learn because he doesn`t want to.
