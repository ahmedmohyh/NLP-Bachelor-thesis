The ability to relate well with students is more important because school is a lot about communication. Even tough a teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subjects it doesm't mean that the sudents will understand it if he isn't able to emphasize. 
In my opinion the main point about being a good teacher is to motivate the students, to make interesting lessons even if the topic might be boring and to have fun in school. For all of this things it's not nessecary to be able to know everything regarding the subject, it's important to know how a student feels and how you must interact with him. If the clima in class is good because the teacher has a good relation the students have a better base to concentrate and learn. 
Teaching the stuff in school with sucess might be easier if you have a very good knowledge, but it ins't for granted that the students will understand it just because of it. If some of them have problems or questions a complicate answer doesn't help them. In such a standart situation in class it's more important that the teacher has the abbility to know where the probleme is and how to explain it the way the students needs it to. 
The teachers ability to relate well with students will make it easier for himself/ herself to get respected by the students and to have their attention which is needed for a good working lesson in school. Also it's a lot more fun for all of the involved people. 
So a good realtion between the teacher and the students is more important than the knowledge because the process of leraning is gonna be way more easier and fun for all of them.
