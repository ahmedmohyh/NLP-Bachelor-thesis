A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I would agree to this sentence because in my opinion it is really important to have  good relationship between sudents and their teacher. The schhol time is a really hard and boring time for many students but a teacher who is a little bit funnier might really improve his lessons. Students will listen to him/her and so they will remember more of the lesson. Even if his/her knowledge of the subject mighr be not as good as some of the oher teachers it seems to me really possible that his7her srudents will learn more of the teached stuff. Also the teacher will have more fun in his leesons and so he will prpair better for his lessons and so he will teach less knowledge better to his students. SO also the teacher will get more from the lessons an his job will improve. LAso i dont think that more knowldge is better in every case. A teacher with to much knowledge might expext too much of every student and might give them too much unneeded information. A teacher with an average amount of knowldege will focus on the important information and so his students will haver a better overview of the theme. tudents cant remebr everything from every lessons so they just need the important information which they will remeber in 10 years so that they cann use them. So a teacher with  go relation to his students will help them much more.
As i said the scholl time isnt the favourite time of many kids and the realitionship between student and teacher isnt always the best as well. So if a teacher can relate well with his students he/she will be a good teacher in my opinion and much better than a teacher with just many school knowledge and  the students will see that teachers are "normal" person aswell and that every teacher has also went trough the hard school time.
