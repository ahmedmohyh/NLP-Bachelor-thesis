When a teacher can relate well to his students, he knows how much he can take from his student and what is too much for them. With the ability to relate to them he can make his lessons easier for his students and can easily acchieve better results from his students, because he understands where they have problems and when they really understand the subject. He also has a better way of communication with them, because he understands them well enough to support them and their abilitys. The problem with his ability to relate to the students could be that the teacher gets too personal and too friendly with his students, which can lead the students to have fewer respect to the teacher as a person, who should only teach them with or without a personal bond. When the teacher only has a good knowledge but can´t relate to his students he may will make good lessons but can´t understand the students in the right way to give them the best chances to learn from him. The lessons could may be too hard for the students, so that they don´t acchieve the best results.
I think it is important, that the teacher has a good knowledge about the subject he is teaching, but he should also have the ability to relate to his students so that they can have the best learnig experience and acchieve the best results they can get. I think you can only can get the best results, when the teacher can relate to his students and when he can understand where the students have more problems with the subject so that he can teach them in another way, where the students understand the topic better and all of their problems with the subject are solved.
