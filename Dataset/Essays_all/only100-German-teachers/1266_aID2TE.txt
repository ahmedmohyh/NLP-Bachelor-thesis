The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." can be seen in different ways. Everyone has an other opinion about that and a reason why. But is it really more important than know all about a subject?
One point is that when the teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject he can answers every questions of the students and can help them when they have a problem to make an exercise. Also he can tell the students many information about the subject and themes they have. So they learn much more than when the teacher does not know all. 
When you look at the other side there are reasons why it is better to have a well relation. If he relate well with them the students have more fun to have him as a teacher and it is easier to listen to the informations he gives the students. The students want to learn something and work together with the teacher. Something else is when he has a well relation to the students they come to him if there is any problem they want to talk about with a person. Then the students trust the teacher more than a teacher they has not a well relation. 
In my opinion a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important. Nobody must know everything or have a knowledge. It is no problem to look it up in a book or in the internet and everybody sometimes is in a situation that they does not know something. I think it is better to have a well relation and good communication with teachers than just listen to what he says and have no motiavion
