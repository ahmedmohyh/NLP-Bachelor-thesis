A student is in the school, his thoughts drifting away and he starts to think about what a good teacher is like. This is a common situation for a student, who got a bad teacher, but where is the difference between a good and a bad teacher? Is it the ability to be friendly and kind to you, should he or she be like one of your friends or should he or she deliver the knowledge of a wise man/woman?

As a teacher you have to show the students what they'll need in their everyday life. This means that the teacher have to get the students attention and they need to give them their knockledge. Additional to that, they have to teach them what the ministery tells them(the teachers). But the teachers aren't only teaching formulas or other things like that, they also deliver does and don'ts, by showing behavior manners and things you shouldn't do. Everything written above needs the attention of the audience, in this case the students, which is easier to get, if you have a good relationship to your students, because you know what the audience "enjoys" and what they dislike, you know where you can make a joke or how to stop the students of falling asleep.

All in all, the teacher could be seen as a parent who is not in your family. This leads us to the conclusion that a good relation between student and teacher is important, but the job of the teacher is to deliver a good alround knowledge and the manners for the students. Both of this things are important (if you can show them the important thinks but nobody cares, nobody learns anything. If you don't tell the important things but the students are lsitening, nobody learns anything.) and as a good teacher you're able to do both things in a proper way.
