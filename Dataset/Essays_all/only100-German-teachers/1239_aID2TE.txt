The statement that  " A teacher's ability to releate well with students is more important than excellent knopwledge of the subject being taught" is absolutelely right, i think. Its the best  way to be great to the students, because of the communication and realationship between students an teachers. This is the most importend.

I agree with this statement, because i think, that they must have a good communication with the students. This is importent because when the teacher hat a good realationship with the students, than the students would listen to him and they could learn something. An example for this are these old teachers who thinks they are the best and nobody could be better and these who justt attack the students with information and tests. 
When the teacher is  just pushing the stuff into the students and is bad to them, then the students wouldn't listen to him anymore and they would miss something from the lesson. And when there is this situation the going to be bad in school. You could see this by your own kids or from your brother or sister when they come to you and tells that they have a very bad teacher and you doesn't understand something.
An other point is that the teachers with the better knowledge could give the students better informations, but the teachers, with the best realationship to the students have the easiest way to teach them. I think everybody would have some of these teachers, but they would be better i the lesson with the good teacher, because they respect these teacher and so they listen carefully to him.

In my opinion a teacher must have a little bit of both of these points. They must be in a good communication with the students and must respect them, but he also have to had a good knowledge to teach the students in the best way.
