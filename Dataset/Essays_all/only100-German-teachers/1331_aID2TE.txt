Today we are discussing about the question if teachers ability is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject to relate well with students.
At the following I will show some advantages and disadvantages about the teachers ability to relate well with students.

It is important that the stundents know the information that the teacher taught them for her life later. So the taecher schould give the students right information.
for that he have to know all the information about his subject. For example english is an very important language at this time and if the teacher doesn´t the the students right they couldn`t travel in another country and understand the people there because of their language.

On the other side it is an advantage if the teachers ability is good to relate with the students. When he gets an good relationship to his students he know more about their skills and their personality. So he could teach their strenghs and help them if they have any problems. 

My opinion is that the teacher should have a good relationship to his students because an good relationship could be much more important than the knowledge of the subject. If the relationship is bad to his students he couldn`t teach them very well also if he knows a lot about his subject.
