That a teacher can relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught because a teacher can be a role model for many students. In that case it is imporftant that the teacher gets along with them very well und that he is nice to them so they get the feeling of aceptance.
 It is also very important because the students will  learn more by a teacher they like. They don't need to be afraid to say something wrong or to go to the school director just because the teacher was so angry that the students forgot their books.

A disadvantage is that it is difficult for the teacher to give the students grades because they may have a friend base and the teacher does not want to make them feel bad or to give the parents a reason to argue with their kids. The kids could also have a disadvantage because of the good of the good relationship. It might lead to the point that the students don't do their homework anymore becausse they think that they the teacher won't be angry. That means that they learn less with that teacher because on the one hand he doesn't have an excellent knowledge of the subject and can't answer all the questions the students have and on the other hand it could be that he destroys the future of the students because the teacher can't teach them all the important stuff, that is rellvant for the abitur.

I personally think that the relationship between a teacher and a student is really important because it is one of the reasons that a student have good grades. The student get the feeling that it's not worse to say something wrong and get a strong mind for the rest of his life .I think it's not worse that a teacher doen+t have the most excellent knowledge of the subject but he must teach the things well which are rellevant for the abitur.
