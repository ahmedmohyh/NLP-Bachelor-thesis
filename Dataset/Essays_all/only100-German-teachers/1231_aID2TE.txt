On the one hand it is really important for students that they have a good atmosphere in class and on the other hand the teacher have to focus on the schoolmaterial and on the stuff his students have to learn.

But about this fact the teacher has to relate well with his students so that his students feel supported and don't put under pressure. Especially young students have maybe problems in their family or with friends, so when they have problems they could talk with their (class-)teacher about the problems. Also the teacher could help if there are any problems in the class for example between two students. 
Moreover the students have to learn the material, because they have to write good notes and should pass their examinations and when the students or the whole class have really bad notes then the teachers has maybe a problem with his boss or the parents of his students. 

To conclude I would say that the teacher's ability to relate well with the students is as important as the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because the students should be able to talk with the teacher about problems or something else but also the students have to learn something in school about the different subjects.
