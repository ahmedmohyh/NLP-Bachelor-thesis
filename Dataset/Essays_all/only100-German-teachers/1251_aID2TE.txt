A better way to illustrate would be to give him examples or help him to learn it with the "right and left hand-rule". 

To summ it up, both abilities are very important. There is no good teacher who don´t have any knowledge of a issue and there is no good teacher who don´t no how to explain the issue for everyone of his students.
