In the following text I show you my opion to the questionin the top of this text.

I think for a good teacher is it important, that he hve good knowledge in his lesson. for example an englisch teacher must have very good englisch knowledge to teach the students, but when he can't explain the students, what he want from them or what they  must learn, then is it not positiv that he have so good englisch knowledge, because the stundents, can't learn anything. So it is important that he can explain the exisys good to the students.
 Also the stundent and the teacher must have a good (Verhältnis), because so the stundents are motivated and have fun in the lessons. for example when the teacher have good knowledge in his lesson and he can explain it well, but he is very boring or hard to the students it's not good, because some students can't hear to him because he is so boring that they fall in sleep or students doesn't go to the lessons, becaus they don't like the lessons or they are scared, then is it not positive. 
Finaly I think that it's important that a teacher`s ability to relate well with stundents, but without knowledges in his lesson he can't teach the students. So the teacher must find good compromis from this two things to be a good teacher.
