Knowledge or personality?
Imagine you are a teacher. What is the first thing you have to own? Exactely, knowledge of the subject. That's the answer which is in everybodys mind first, I think. You can't teach a subject to your student if you haven't a clue of it. This is clear but a teacher needs one other, very important talent.
He must know how to relate well with his students. He needs to be kind, strict, funny, helpful and trustworthy. If the students don't like you, as their teacher, you can't teach them any stuff. They won't listen to you and they won't do their exercises with happiness and motivation.
I think it doesn't matter if you're the best in your subject and left your university with marks, higher than the Eiffeltower or just as a normal student who passed the tests with medium marks. Fact is: You have to be able to create ineresting lessons with variety. Work in groups, watch a movie, listen to tapes or playing a scene from the literature book as a theater in front of the class. Obviously, it's impossible to be a teacher just because you're such a nice person. Some knowledge has to be in your head.
My opinion about the statement is definitely positiv. I agree because I had teachers in my school career who were exactely the second type of the statement. They knew everything about their subject but they couldn't teach it to me. It was like they were living in their own math bubble for example. Everything was easy for them and when somebody asked a question, they couldn't answer because for them everything was clear. These teacher seem to be teacher because they want to show their knowledge to the students, not to teach it to them.
