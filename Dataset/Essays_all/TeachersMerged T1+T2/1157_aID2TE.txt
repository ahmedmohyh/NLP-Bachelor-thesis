In every school there are students, who have somestimes problems with their teachers. To fix that problem there is the question, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
It is important for students to get good marks in school, so they can go to a university after school or get the job which they want. But to get good marks in school, the students should be interessed in the subjects. This is for some students maybe easier, if they have teachers, who relate well with them even if they haven't got an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
But on the other hand there is the problem, that if a teacher hasn't got the best knowledge of a subject, he can't teach the students the way they needed it. The reason for that is, that if a teacher doesn't really know what he is actually doing, then he can't really teach the studends, because he hasn't got the right and needed knowledge of that subject. This would be bad for the students, because if the teacher doesn't know what he is doing, then the students also don't know what they should do, so they get bad marks and bad exams.
So all in all I would say that an excellent knowledge of a teacher is more important than the ability to relate well with students, beacause the students will understand the subject better and get good marks and exams, so they can go to a university after school or get any job they want.
