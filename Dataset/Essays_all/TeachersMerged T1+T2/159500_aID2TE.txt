I discuss now the statement if a teacher's ability to relate well with with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
In first place when people, who are teachers, are not able to make the subject understandable, students will not learn anything about the issue, so it makes no sense that those people are teachers.Because first the students are getting bored and it will be very hard for them when they go to university after school. For example when someone teaches maths at the KSWE, and the person can not explain mathematical terms, it will be very hard for those students, who want to do something with math afterwards because they have to do a great effort. So teachers should be able to explain their subject well.
In second place teachers should have a big knowledge about their subjets, because  they are interessested in and they studied that subject. Ithink there are teachers who have more knowledge than other teacher but this does not matter, because they know more as their students. And it is not possible that teachers, who have got no knowledge about their subject, are teachers.  


So I think it is important that teachers have both ablities, relating well with students and having excellent knowledge. hey should have mixture of both.
