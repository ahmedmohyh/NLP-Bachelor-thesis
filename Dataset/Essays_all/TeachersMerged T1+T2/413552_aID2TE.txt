When I look at this statement, the first thing which comes to my mind is that of course, if a teacher doesn't know what he is teaching, he probably is a bad teacher. But on the other hand, if a teacher knows everything about the subject he is teaching but doesn't know how to teach it he oviously is a bad techer as well. 
So, what does it mean to know how to teach? This is something every teacher should know and be able to do. You have to understand the way your students think. How could you explain anything to anyone if you don't understand how they process their thoughts? For that reason a teacher needs to relate with his students, he needs to find a connection with them on which they can access to what he is trying to teach them. 

For example, if a teacher knows a lot but his students can't follow his thinking process they will learn nothing at all. But if a teacher knows just a little of something, but knows just how to explain it, they will understand everything he is trying to teach. 
In conclusion the students with the teacher who can relate to them but doesn't know that much about the subject, know more than the students with the teacher who knows everything but doesn't know how to put it. In other words, a teacher is called a teacher because he has to teach his students. He isn't called 'a knower'. There is no use in excellent knowledge if he doesn't know how to share it. 

Personally, I think that it needs both knowledge and the ability to relate. But i understand that it's more difficult to find a connection to a group of individuals than achieving a lot of knowledge for yourself.
