In our country children have to go to school and the relationship between the students and the teacher is very important.It is also important that the teacher has excellent knowledge about his subject. But is it better to have a Teacher who understands the studens or should the teacher only be able tp teach a subject perfectly? 
You often hear about teachers and students who doesn't have a good relationship between them. The problem is that if there isn't a good relationship the children don't want to go to school and bring home bad grades. The parents have to force the child to go to school and that doesn't make the situation any better. If the child has a bad beginning with his schoolyears  he doesn't want to go there later either. So the worst thing that could happen is that the child leaves school early and doesn't get a good job and this only because the teacher didn't know how to relate with the students.
On the other hand you hear that children love to go to school but they don't realy learn something. Comparing them to other children from other teachers they have bad grades. The teacher knows how to relate with the students but doesn't know how to teach the subject right. These students love to go to school but they didn't really learn the basics and if you don't have the basics you can't build up on them.
In my opinion the teacher should have a goob ablility to realte with his students. In that way he can understand their problems better and can try to help them. But it is also important for a teacher to have much knowloedge about the subject he is teaching. A good teacher has to have both of the abilities to give the students the education they deserve.
