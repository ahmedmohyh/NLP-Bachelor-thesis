 I think two of the facts are omportent but i think the first fact is more importent. Because of that i agree the statement. The teacher has to understand the students, because i thing than the student are also really listening and want to learn something and want to be involved and want to ask more. The teacher don't has to have a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, he has to know good about the subject and he has also to understand it really good, the subject it's being thaugt but  i think he hasn't to have a excellent knowledge about the subject. He should explaining it really good to the student so good that the students understand it and could work with the informations. I think the student will be more interesting at the subject if the teacher understands, involved and is ability to realte well with students. The teacher has to know well about the subject but i don't think so that he has to has a very excellent knowledge about the subject he is talking about. They could find out a question, which the teacher cant respond, together and then also the other studenst are involved and also more interested for the subject and they could find out the question together and talk, learn and think about the subject more when the teacher said everythung.

I agree with the statement, that a teacher's ability to realte well with students is more important that the fact that a teacher has to have a excellent knowledge of the subject he is talking about with the students.
