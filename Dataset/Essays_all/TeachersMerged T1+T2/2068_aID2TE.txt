The statement says that a teacher should rather relate to the students well than have a good knowledge of his subject. 
Of course it is a good thing if the teachers relate to students and students relate to teachers very well. It can make the way of working a lot easier. If people feel comfortable they will always work faster and more relaxed. They often even have better outcomes than people who don't feel welcomed on their working places. The same fact goes for students. But on the other hand the students do not need a friendly teacher who is talking trash all day long.
You would probably ecpect from a teacher that this is not the case, but sometimes students have this exact problem. Normally this ends in some kind of disaster for the students. A relateable teacher or profesor who has no idea abou the topic he is trying to teach is no help for students.
On the other hand, students do not need a well educated teacher who has the worst charakter in the whole world.
Relateability and good knowledge are both very important abilities for teachers and profesors. Maybe there is some kind of difference by percents (maybe something like 40:60 for the good knowledge), but one of them does not work without the other. 
Therefore, relating well with students is not more important than excellent knowledge, but knwoledge does not go for itself either. For teaching (and every kind of work with human beings) it has to be a mix of both abilities. Otherwise there will always appear problems between teacher and student.
