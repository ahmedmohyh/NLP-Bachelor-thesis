A teacher who can relate well with students would create a friendly atmosphere in class during the lessons. Students within such an atmosphere would like the lessons more and listen more carefully. But really friendly teaching is not good, because the quality and amount of knowledge which is being teached decreases.
Excellent knowlegde on the other hand is important until a certain level. Background knowledge should be there anytime for the topics that are teached. But with the knowledgelevel advances less students are able to understand. As I experienced by myself the teachers with excellent knowledge aren't as capable of teaching properbly as teacchers with less knowledge.
I would recommend an combination of both. A teacher who is able to teach the right things properbly.
