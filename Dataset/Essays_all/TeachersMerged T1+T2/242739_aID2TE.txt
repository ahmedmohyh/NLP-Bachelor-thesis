I agree partialy. It is surely very important to relate well with students. Otherwise it won`t work. If a teacher doesn`t have a good relation with his students he can`t teach his subject properly because it could happen that the students don`t repect him, wich results probably in not making homework, or could even make it impossible to teach in class because they are just to loud. It`s also possible that there is a neutral relation between the students and the teacher. But in this case it`s also very important. It`s probably working good until there is a controversial discussion about tests or grades. If the teacher is liked by the students his possible ununderstanding in such discussions or the fact that some students will say things against him, because they are not happy with their grades, will be overviewed by the mayority of the other students. If it`s the case that his realtion to his students is alredy neutral or even cold, much more students will be convinced to be against the teacher. On the other hand it`s also very important to have a excellent knowledge about the subject. It`s as important as the ability to relate well with students. If a teacher has a good relation to his students and the mayority of them does homework, they probably won`t learn something either, even if they do homework. If the teacher teaches bad, the students will have a good relation until there is the point where thy can`t go further because they are just not enough good in theyr subject. They could fail in final exams. In this case they will be pretty angry on the teacher.
