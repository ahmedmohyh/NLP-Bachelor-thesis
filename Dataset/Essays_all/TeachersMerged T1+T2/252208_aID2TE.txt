When talking about the necessary abilities and skills of a teacher, it is important to specify what kind of teaching one is talking about. Teaching at different levels of education requires different skills of teaching. A person that educates second graders in an elementary school should definetly be equipped with the right social skills that enable one to explain a certain subject to the young audiance. These may include all sorts of different abilities ranging from a good understanding of social interaction to a good mental attitude that enables one to be patient with the younger students. Since younger kids still have to develope their general understanding of society, teaching them very specific knowledge about a subject can prove to be very trickey. In the enviroment of a university however, it is of upmost importance that the professor has in depth knowledge of the subject they are talking about. 
Because the right mental attitude for studying can be expected of university, it should come as no surprise that I personaly do not think of the professor's ability to relate well with students as absolutley essential. On the other hand such an ability might prove to be very helpful in todays job market when looking for a position in the acedemic world. The overall impact teachers have on their students declines over the life span of their acedemic career which is another reason why I view social skills as less important for professors.
