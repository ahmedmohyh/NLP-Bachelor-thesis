"A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.". This quote was presented to us in the MEWS-study and now I will reason whether I agree with that statement or not.

On the one hand, knowledge about something you want to relay to others is required to a high degree because you can only teach someone as much about a subject as you know about it yourself. If for example our math teacher had no idea about algebra, she would not be able to make us understand anything.
On the other hand, a teacher who can not relate to his/her students would also be difficult for those students to open up to in order to talk about problems concerning learning and comprehension because they propably would not trust the teacher enough. If the student for example had problems at home which lead to his/her grades to suffer they would be much more likely to talk about it with a person they know they can trust and will understand them.
Also it would be difficult for a teacher who can not relate to his/her students to keep them interested in the subjects in their class because they will propably feel like they are being talked at rather than taught. For example, if our chemistry teacher just gave us papers to fill out and then just sat at his/her desk reading a book the lesson would quickly become very dull. But if instead the teacher gave us a paper and then worked together with us to solve it while not giving away the answers we would propably be more interested in filling out the paper.

In conclusion, teachers should both have vast knowledge about the subject they are teaching and also relate to and work together with their students in order to keep them interested and make them feel like they are truly being taught something by a mentor instead of listening to a tape recording, which leads me to not agree with the statement entirely.
