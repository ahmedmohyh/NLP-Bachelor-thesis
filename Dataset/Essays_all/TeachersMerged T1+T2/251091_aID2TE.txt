This writing is about whether a teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject or a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important. Of course a teacher needs to have both, but not every teacher has both the same. 

On the one hand teachers with an excellent knowledge of the subject know more than teachers without a complete knowledge of the subject. Therefore it is very good to have or be a teacher with excellent knowledge so that the students who ask difficult questions can be satisfied by a reasonable answer.

On the other hand it is very important that teachers can relate to the students. There is not use in teachers with an excellent knowledge but without understanding and relating to students. Usually students who do not feel understood by their teachers automatically do not like the subject and that can lead to problems in exams and in the lesson. Therefore it is very important that the students feel understood, related to and included in discussions. For teachers, who can relate to students it is not very grave if they fail in giving a satisfying answer a few times, because the students like them and can understand that even a teacher does not know everything. Also teachers with a wide knowledge of their subject but no relating to students are often very strict and do not try to understand and include the student's opinions.

Of course a teacher needs a good knowledge of his subject, because even if the teacher can relate it can get very annoying for students when teachers can't answer every second question asked by them. In my opinion teachers should have a happy medium between an excellent knowledge, because a relating teachers is a lot more understanding and easier to talk to, but the knowledge also needs to be there to be a good teacher.
