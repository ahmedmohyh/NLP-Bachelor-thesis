For me is bouth very inportant. Because when a teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject, but he can't explain anything, is doesn't serve that much. And when the teacher has the ability to relate with students, but he can't explain something simple, it also doesn't make sense. 
For exemple, a maths teacher that can relate with students very well, must explain a very complex mathematical problem. But the teacher has nearby no konwledge in maths, so he can relate with the students, as much as he want, but he never can explain the mathematical problem without a good knowledge in maths.
An other example. The teacher has an huge knowledge of physics, for example he has worked as a scienist in the company CERN, and he know everything about physics, but when he can relate with hs students, nobody will unterstand something, he tries to explain.
To put all in a nutshell, we can say that's really inportant if a teacher can relate well with students or not, but with no knowledge he can't explain anything. So it's really important that a teacher has the ability to relate well, but of course it's also very imortant that the teachers have a good knowledge of teh subjetct being taught.
