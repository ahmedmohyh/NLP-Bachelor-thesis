The statement that was given, can't be answer in about 300 words, but i'll give it a try:
Knowledge is the key, which is needed to have a converstion on a topic. Therefor a school lesson where students know their teachers are less informed about the topic, the lesson will be boring for the students and they won't lisen to the teacher. But on the other hand a teacher, which is unfriendly and hasn't got a good relation to the students can't teach properly because most of the stundent will be full of anger. Because of that they can't concentrate on the given topic, so a conversation between teacher and student won't come up.
Given these two positions you need to judge which one is more importent. 
A perfect teacher doesn't exist, so there can only be an optimized teacher, which is supposed to be friendly and clever at the same time, because both sides are importend. But you can't judge all teachers at the same time and focus on one side only because that would make the other side weaker. Also every teacher is different.
All in all the statement isn't true, because by giving a teacher only social aspects he won't have acceptable knowledge on the topic.
