In my opinion the statement is as said before a very critical question but i do not agree with it. Firstly of course the ability to relate well with students is not completely unimportant but for me it is more important that a teacher for example a biology teacher can answer a not very difficult question by himself. If a teachers i not knowing the answer for a question, for me it is okay that he can make up a research to this topic to the next lesson. This should not be the case every time, but i think sometimes it is good and knowing not anything is normal. Teachers are human too. But looking on the ability to relate again personally this is sometimes very important but in most cases and at most schools it is not in everyday use. SOmething that is a bit weird in the sentence is that there is stated about excellence knowledge. Nevertheless as i said before TEACHERS ARE JUST HUMANS and have a live as we, they can not research the whole time of their live. 
Looking back to the topic i would say the ability to relate and good knowledge are both needed for a teacher nowadays, as a result of always more student, which have sometimes problems in their private life efecting the grades for example, is needed more than ever. Moreover of course it is needed too that a  teacher has backround knowledge, but it does not be excellent. 
To sum up i would adjust the statement to the following: A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is as important than good knowledge of the subject being taught.
