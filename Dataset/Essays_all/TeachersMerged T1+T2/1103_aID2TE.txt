The importance of accuracy in teaching gets clear when teachers change and students are suddenly confronted with a new way of being taught. Sometimes the teacher thinks that other information about a topic is more important than the teacher before did. But in some cases teachers do also give different statements about the same topics. Students will use the information they got from they're current teacher often not questioning which statement is true. They'll write and say what the teacher thinks or says is right to get good grades. So the excellent knowledge about a topic that is being taught is really important. Of course there's a difference between teaching wrong things and not knowing everything about a subject, although not definitely knowing something can easily lead to false assumptions.The social aspect of being a teacher is also not unimportant for the qualification of a teacher. Someone who can relate well with his students is often more successful in causing ambition or willingness to learn in a students mind than someone who isn't able to do that. Of course the fact wether a teacher has great knowledge or not is also relevant for the relation between students and teachers. Teachers who aren't excellently informed about what they teach will have to deal with the problem of not being taken serious enough to allow a good and respectful relationship.In conclusion i think that the qualities of a teacher are more depending on the knowledge he has than on his ability to relate with students. His task is to make students pass their exams and prepare them for the life they'll lead one day. But there's no way to deny that excellent knowledge and the ability to relate with students combined are the best conditions to become a teacher.
