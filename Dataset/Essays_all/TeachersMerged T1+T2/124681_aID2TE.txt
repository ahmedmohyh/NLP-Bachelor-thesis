In this text i will write about the statement: A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important then excellentknowledgeof the subject being taught.

For a teacher it is very important to have a good knowedge about the subject, so they can answer the most questions about their subjects. If you had geography and you are now learning the stones in the central of switzerland and than you ask the teacher a question about the geography history than he have to answer the question.
You have to teach your students without your notices. If you are a german teacher and you forgot all your notices at home, you have to teach your students without your notices.

When you have an excursion with your class its important for you to stay in contact with the students. You go on a trip with your class and you have contact with all the students then you get something from their live and in the next lesson you know more about their characters and you know how speak with the students.
When you have the ability to relate well with students it is easier to learn the things for the students. Your favourite teacher is the math teacher than you are happier to have a lesson of math than a lesson of french, because you do not like the french teacher. In the math lesson you listen more to the teacher than in the french lesson. And you prefer to learn for the math exam than for the french exam. And the marks in math is better than in french, expect you are a french genius.

It is  important to have the ability to relate well with students. Of course you have to understand your subject but the other thing is much more important for me.
