I agree with this statement, because it is very important to have a good relation with the students.
If a teacher isnt in a good realtion with the students, the students work very bad and do not there homework or something like that, but if a teacher is in a good relation with the students the students follow the teachers lesson and feeling comftable.
The problem is,that the students cant learn very well, if the teacher cant teach his subject very well, but when the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject he can teach it and the students have a chance to learn something.
A teacher with an excellent knowledge, know his subject, but when he hasnt a good relation, the students wont follow his lesson and feeling very uncomftable.
The students hate him and wont do anything with him.
If a teacher hasnt a good realation to the students but and excellent knowledge, he can teach his subject and give them his knowledge, but the students feeling so uncomftable that they hate him and his subject isnt important for them.
So it is more important to have a teacher with a good realtion, because he can teach them too, mabye not excellent but he can teach it and the students want to learn something, have fun in his lessons and feeling comftable, without these points you cant teach the students.
Students love "cool" teachers and have a good motivation to go to school.They are happy and ready to learn something.
