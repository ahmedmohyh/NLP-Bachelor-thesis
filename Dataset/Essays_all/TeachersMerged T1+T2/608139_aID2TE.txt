First of all is an understanding and communicating teacher the most importtant part for a working and healthy relationship between him or her and their children. But is this enough? And isn't a sustainble knowledge about his or her subject more important since it's the foundation of his or her profession.

From my experience has a teacher a lot to do with your final grades, there are a few that aren't a 100% sure about their subject but still manage to get their students sticked to the actual topic. In terms of interest and motivation are teachers with a healthy relation to their children a major pillar upon the education of each depends.

But what about the kind of teacher that knows it all but doesn't care about the children primarly? This kind may be beneficial for the educational "elite" of the class. The best learners and the smartest kids will adapt to this kind of person adn will enormously profit from their knowledge but the other part,the part of the class which struggles to collect all the information education simply provides will struggle even more.

From my point of view both attitudes are necessary to be able to educate children the most effective and sustainable way.
