Some teachers are great at dealing with their specific subject, though, lack the ability to pass this knowledge on to their students.

In the following text, I will discuss if it is more important being able to relate to your students or having excellent knowledge of your subject for being a good teacher.

As a teacher, being an expert at your subject is very important, especially for those few very interested students, as you are able to answer probably every question they might ask you.
Also, if you really understand what you are trying to teach your students, this will help you to choose what exactly to teach and explain to them, giving you room for freedom in your teaching style.

However, a teacher has to be able to get his students' attention to make them understand what he is explaining in front of them. If the students neither listen to him nor care about the subject, he will not be able to reach them, resulting in the stundents not learning much.
Furtermore, if he is really unable to explain what he is thinking, he will have no chance of sharing these thoughts with his students.

Today quite some teachers not teaching in elementary school often do not recieve the necessary education needed to get across their knowledge, which is in most cases enough for the students to learn what they are supposed to learn in school, resulting in them being unable to achieve this goal.

So, in conclusion, I think a fundamental knwoledge of his subject is vital and all knowledge past this point certainly helps a teacher, but if he lacks the required skills to treansfer this knowledge to his students, this knowledge is wasted on him.
