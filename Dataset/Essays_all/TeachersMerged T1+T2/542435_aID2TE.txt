Teacher should be able to have both: They should to be there for their students and they should be understanding, they have to have this ability but of course the should know pretty everything about the subject they teach too. So what is more important? 
To have a big knowledge of the subjects you teach is indeed very important. You can not teach something you don't fully understand and know, it's just not possible. Then you are not able to help them to learn stuff and make them ready for the future and you can't answer the students' questions if they don't understand something. So you need to know much about the subjects.
But if a teacher doesn't have the ability to have a good and understanding relationship with his/her students, it's gonna make working with students much more complicated and harder. If a student doesn't understand something and his teacher has to explain it to him, but he just can't relate to what his/her student is trying to say or to how he is feeling he can't really help him. Then  what the teacher is saying just sounds too intelligent for the student and he doesn't get it and the teacher just doesn't know what the problem is and how to help him. Yes, excellent knowledge can help a teacher to explain the subject perfectly but if a student needs help the ability to understand him and relate to him is more helpful and more important. Another argument is that students can feel it if the teacher likes them and can relate well with them, which leads to more respect for their teacher.
All in all I say a good balance of both abilities is what a teacher needs to have, but if I really had to choose I'd rather say the ability to relate well with students is a bit more important.
