I don't agree with it at all. From my experience I can say it never hurt a teacher, if he was able to relate well with student, but excellent knowledge is much more important than that. I think a teacher is obliged to have a good understanding of his subject. A teacher's job is to teach and know their subject to interest students, in order to get their attention. If they do not even have basic knowledge, how will they teach their students and explain the subject? For example in case of a substitute teacher who only teaches a class for a short amount of time. If he or she is well at grabbing student's attention, while not releating well, because of the age gap, it would not matter, since the students would learn so much more from her/ him. But if a substitute teacher is only able to relate well with the students and have a great time, not being able to explain questions students have, they would have a great time of course, but they would not learn much from it. This type of teacher is the kind to always stick to their essay or book. And when students would have questions the teacher will only ever explain with the same exact words as are in the script or book. 
Another important point while answering students' questions is to give them good examples. There it would not matter if a teacher relates well with a student, since that doesn't have much to do with answering the question. 
Some may say, they are able to learn much more from a friendly teacher, to whom they are able to relate well. But this only is the case, when these teachers also have a good understanding of the subject they teach.
This may vary from student to student, but luckily there are also the great types of teacher which have a profound knowledge and are able to relate with students.
