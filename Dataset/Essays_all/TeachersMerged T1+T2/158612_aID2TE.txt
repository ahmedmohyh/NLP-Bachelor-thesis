As we are students, we are daily confronted with people who have to teach us something. Some of these teachers we do like more, others less. But how important is the relation between the tearcher and the student apart from the knowledge? In the following essay I am going to discuss this theme.

On the one hand, since humans exist one of their main wish is to get on well with other people and to affiliate to a group. So our goal is to have a comfortable atmosphere with the people we live and spend time together. To profit as much as possible it is also really important that we like going to school and that the teacher is not the person who takes us away our pleasure to go there. So a good relationship between the teacher and the students is necessary. 
On the other hand, if the teacher does not prepare well his lessons, the students are not going to learn anything. Once in secondary school I have had a teacher who did nothing for his lessons and we always did the same stuff. To be honest, these lessons were the most unuseful I have ever had and I would have rather spent this time at home doing something more productive than attending these time-wasting lessons, beacause the reason why I go to school is because I want to learn something. 

In my opinion, the relationship between the teacher and the students is really important but the competences of the subject should be available. A teacher who has an extremely good relation with me but does not know anything of his subject has no use for me as a student, as well as a teacher with much knowledge and no sense for a good relation. A mix from both would be the best for me and I guess for other students too.
