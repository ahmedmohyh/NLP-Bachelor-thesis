Many people think that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
But is this really true ? As a teacher having a good relationship with your students is really important because it's way easier to learn something when you have fun. Nevertheless you can't be a good teacher without having at least good knowledge about the the subject being taught. Furthermore the most important part of being a teacher is preparing your students for the ''Abitur" and not being the most loved teacher of your school.Still being a teacher is pretty much all about teaching students your own knowledge and having the ability to relate well with your students will be very helpful for that.When your students are looking forward to having classes with you they are more willing to actually something.Nothing is worse than a boring teacher who is just talking all the time without anyone really listening to him. Nobody is learning something that way so the teacher needs to be an "entertainer" too somehow. Yeah, that sounds a little bit weird at first but when you think about it it totally makes sense. When you reallyy interact with your students, make group work or anything that makes your class interesting it's much easier to learn and actually remember stuff from the subject. 
To sum everything up I can not complety agree or disagree with the statement because the mixture of both, relating well with students AND having excellent knowledge of the subject is what makes a good teacher. It's not enough to either just be the funny guy every student likes or knowing basically everything about your subject.
