My personal opinion is that a teacher`s ability to relate well with a student has the same importance like the knowledge about the subject. 

Every teacher has to be qualificated to communicate with students in a well way, because without the correct behavior in school, it is much difficult to learn, but I think it is not more important that his or hers knowledge. Without enough knowledge about the suibjet a teacher is very unqualificated to teach students in this. How will they explain somthing they do not know or theyself can not handle with. That is definetly impossible.
But a teacher, who is perfectly informed about the topic and is unable to to relate well with a student, should not have contact to kids. There is a reason for having programms, where teachers learn, how they have to react in some situations and what they do noz have to do with students. A teacher, with the wrong behavior maybe has false expections to the knowledge of a student an gives bad markes, witch are unacceptable.
