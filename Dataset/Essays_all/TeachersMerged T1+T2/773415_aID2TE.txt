I have to say there really is some truth in this sentence. No matter how much a teacher knows about his subject, if he does not get through to the students then all the work was for nothing. I can relate to this because at my school here we have to learn an insane amount of information every day. I have been here for three years now and still I feel like I know nothing. So how can this be?
Our teachers are very smart and they truly understand their subject matter, but sadly they have no idea how to present it to people in my age in a way that makes us remember it for a longer time period than just until the next exam. I believe that sometimes less is more. I do not think that all the details of a subject are important. In my point of view what we need is a basic understanding of the subject matter. For example it doesn't matter what kind of shoes Napoleon wore when he fought against the european powers, but it might me important to know why they were fighting and what his goals were. 
I only had a few teachers in my school carreer who really wanted me to understand and to see the bigger picture. They put their focus on conversations in the class and they tried to let us shape the class aswell. Sometimes it was almost like they were learning about all these things with us. And that is what I liked. Those are the things I still remember.And I think that is the whole point of education. To learn and to remember.
