As a teacher it's very important to get on well with the students. If a teacher has a unconventional way of teaching it's possible, that the students learn in a better way. A teacher shouldn't always speak the whole time. He or she should be looking for a perfect mix between speaking in front of the class and realating with the students. a teacher who isn't interested in the realation with the students could might have a bad influence for the students-Maybe they think the teacher doesn't take them very serious. That could lead to anxiety of asking for a problem or an issue they don't understand. And finally that could cause bad marks. 
They other way around are some students who have no problem if there's a teacher who isn't really communicative or interested in a realation with the students. Excellent knowledge is important and builds the basis as a teacher. the aim of every teacher should be to combine both aspects in a good way.
I wouldn't say that the ability to realate with students is more important, because if a teacher doeesn't have any clue what he or she is saying it doesn't make any sense. Like I mentioned it above in my text, it's important that a teacher has the ability to combine both aspects. If a teacher finds the perfect combination he or she gets liked by its students.
