There are some discussions about what is more important, a good relationship with the students, or an excellent knowledge of the subject. But what is more important in the end?

First of all, it is really important, that the students and the teacher have a good relationship. It is easier for the students to listen to the teacher and it also is nice for the teacher, because he feels good if the class likes him. Another argument is, that students understand things better if they feel good. If their relationship to the teacher seems to be good, then they can interact better with each other. Also people start to like going to school because they know that it will be a funny day. Those teacher often organise lots of funny and interesting events. 

On the other hand, the knowledge of a teacher should not be at a low level, students are here to learn something from him and if there is no knowledge, then the students will not get smarter and will not improve their knowledge. Somebody with a wide and deep knowledge can help you in almost every situation. A teacher with a really good relationship to the students cannot always achieve both. He mostly is to concentrated on his relationship and sometimes forget about his task to teach us in a very good way. It seems as those teacher come off the right track. Clearly, a good relationship is important, but you are not going to school to have a nice time with your friends and your extremly funny and nice teacher, but to learn something.

In the end I prefer teachers with an excellent knowledge of what they are teaching. You can ask them about anything, and there will always be a good answer which will help you to find a solution and understand the subject at all. Clearly, school should make fun to a certain degree, but if you want to achieve something in your life, then you should listen to somebody who can guide you through. And for that you need somebody with an excellen knowledge of what he or she is teaching.
