A teacher must be fully concerned about his great responsibility of his students. He needs a big knowledge about a certain subject to show the most importance facts. If he does not have the full ability of teaching his students he fails completely in his profission. He must be able to answer every single question a student has. Just like that he can keep alive their curiosity. Also important to mention is that there really is a hierarchy between a teacher and students which must be respected. 

However, I must admit that if a teacher is able to create a nice atmosphere in the class room and manages to have a healthy relation to his students, there is a higher possibility of students actually learning something.If you can't get on with young people you won't get through them. The consequence would be that no interest in the subject being taught can be developped. Being a teacher is one of the most social jobs you can get. If you are not into interaction with young students you should deffenetely find another profession that may be more conviniant for you.

In my opinion it is more important that teachers can relate well with his students than having a perfect knowledge about a single subject. In my case: I totally hate physics just because of my teacher. I'm aware of his great knowledge but his behaviour towards us is just unexceptable. I feel that I were far more interested in being better in that certain subject, but the thing is that it wouldn't only be a succes for me but for him too. I know it may be stupid but that's just how we students feel. So if I'm honest: Having a nice teacher who loves his job and his work with us is far more important than a professor who knows absolutely everything.
