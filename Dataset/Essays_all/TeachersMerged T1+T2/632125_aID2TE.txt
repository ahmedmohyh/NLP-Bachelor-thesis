Good teachers and friends

"I don't like him even though he is a good teacher." I have heard this statement from a lot of students when I asked them what they think of a teacher. There are two main abilities a teacher should have. One is the ability to relate with stundents and the other is to have knowledge of the school subject. However having exellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than being able to relate well with students.
One could argue that a teacher who realy understands his students is a good teacher. He can try to make lessons fitting the needs of each and every class. For example a teacher has two classes in math. Class A has problems with solving equations and class B has promblems with algebra. Because he can relate well with his students he spends more time explaining equations to class A and algebra to class B.
However a teacher having excellent knowledge of the subject may not be confronted with these problems. Because he realy understands his subject he can explain it better than other teachers. Thus his classes won't have alot of problems with his subject and score better grades.
In conclusion there is no doubt that having knowledge of your subject is way more important than being able to relate with students. A teachers task is to teach and not to relate well with stundents. A good teacher should not be your friend. He should be a person of authority and knowledge.
