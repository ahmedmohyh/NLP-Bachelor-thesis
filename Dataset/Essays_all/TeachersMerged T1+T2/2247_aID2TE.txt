Teachers go to universities to learn about the subject they are going to be teaching in every detail but is the ability to relate and help the students taught? Is an excellent knowledge more important than the ability to relate to students? This statement I am going to discuss in the following essay.
Pupils in germany go to school atleast nine years of their lives. Most of time starting at the young age of six. These young children need a figure they can look up to and feel save while they are in elementary school.
Also in secondary school pupils spend five days a week, almost all their free time in school, so they need teachers they can go to in case of an emergency. Also you need teachers who care about their pupils and look for their well being. For example if students stress to much about exams and homework can lead to serious damage to their mental health and parents can not be there to check on their children so students also need someone in school that will check these things. Students can also behave differently in school than at home and these things can not be seen by the parents.
And sure teachers need knowledge but I doubt they would have passed their exams in university if they were not masters at their subject. Most teachers lack
the ability to explain their subject so everyone can understand it and also the passion and the ability to be patient you need to have for this career. A lot of pupils are afraid to ask their teachers if they did not understand something because they are impatient. 

In the end you can say that eventhough both are important but the ability to relate to the students should be given. Also the ability to socialize and work with children should play a bigger part in a teacher`s daily job life and should also be put in consideration if you think about being a teacher in your future.
