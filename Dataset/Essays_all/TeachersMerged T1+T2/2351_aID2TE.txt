The quality of education strongly relies on the quality of the teaching at school. The question is wether it is more important that the teacher has an exellent knowledge of the subject or that he can relate well with students.
First of all it is important to note that it is hard to teach something you yourself aren't really sure about. If you are still unsure of a subject you often make minor mistakes which don't make everything false but still lead to confusion of the students. As a student I can speak only of my own experience that it really doesn't help if the teacher in my case the chemistry teacher often makes erros and has to research something at least once during a lesson on the internet. A teacher should really know the subject he is teching. How should the students understand a subject if even the teacher isn't really sure about the subject?
On the other hand there are a lot of other important things which influence how well students can learn something. For example it doesn'help if the teacher like my math teacher is a genie but can't explain the subject to the class. All knowledege of the teacher doesn't help if he can't teach the students the basics and it isn't helpful as well if the teacher can't motivate the class to work.
Personally I think that it is really hard to say wether it is more important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject or that he can relate well with the students. I think that both things have a strong impact on the quality of the teaching, but if I had to decide I would say that relating well with the students is more important because it is first of all important to have a good atmosphere for learning. Out of my personal experience I can say that most teachers have either both of the qualities or none of them so that you would come scarly into the situation in which you would have to decide.
