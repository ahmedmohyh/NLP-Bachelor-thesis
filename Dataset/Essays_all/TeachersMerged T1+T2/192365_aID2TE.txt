The teacher's ability to relate good with students is very important. The Teacher is the only person who stands between the student and all the knowledge that he have to know at the end of the year. The teacher's influence on students exists between all students and all teachers.
Teachers can influence their students in a bad way but also in a good way. A professor can push his pupil to become better, he can encourage him and give him more help so that he want to become the best student ever. But the controverse of this example could also be the case.

But the knowledge of the subject being taught is also very important, like the relationship between student and professor. It is not your teacher who gonna push you forward in life, it depends only on you and your knowledge. And there you see the controversy, your knowledge gonna be on a the most important things after school and he only depend on your teacher. And as I wright before the knowledge that you get from your teacher only depends on your relationship. 

In the end I think that the knowledge that you get at school is only thing that you gonna need in life
