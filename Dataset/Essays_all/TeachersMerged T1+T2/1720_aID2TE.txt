In the following essay i will discuss if the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject.

In my oppinion it is important because the students get a better idea of the things that they must learn when the teacher related well with students. In this way the teacher has a better relationship to his students and he can put himself better in the position of the students. So he could better reenact the way how the students think. On the other hand you can say that an excellent knowledge is good because the teacher could tell his students very interesting and important things. Also he could teach things which are more interesting because they are not in the regular schoolstuff. So i think a good knowledge of the subject is very important aswell. Because a teacher who relate his students well but has no knowledge of the subject can not teach the students the right things. And when he not teach the right things he is a bad teacher. 
All in all you can say that both points a very important and the mix of both make the teacher to a very good teacher. But I thing a good knowledge is a good base for a good teacher but the way how he relate with them makes a regular teacher to a very good teacher. Thats beacause he could explain the students the themes better.
