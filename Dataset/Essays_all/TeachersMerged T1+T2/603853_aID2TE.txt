I am on the way to my English class. But I have absolutely no motivation to go because my English teacher doesen't like me and I doesn't like him. When I onces told my mother that I don't like my Enlish teacher she told me that I don't have to like him and that it's just important that I can learn a lot. Is it now more important that a teacher relate well with students or does he have to have a excellent knowledge of the subject itselfs? 

It's very important that a teacher can relate well with students because if he doesn't it's quite impossible that the students learn anything. To learn something it's important to have fun. And it's quite difficult to have fun if you relation to the teacher is bad. There is no motivation to take part at a lesson if you don't want to talk to the teacher. And especially languages you can just learn if you talk a lot. 
On the other hand it is also impossible to learn something if even the teacher doesn't know the answer. It is nice when the children have a good realtion to their teachers but in the end it is more important that children learn at school. Their teacher doesn't have to become their best friend.

All in all I can't say one specific answer to this question. I think a teacher has to have both of these qualities. He has to have the necessary knowledge but he also has to have a good realtion to the students.
