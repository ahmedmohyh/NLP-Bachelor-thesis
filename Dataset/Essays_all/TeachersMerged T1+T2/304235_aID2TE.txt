As teacher it is of vital importance to be able to relate with the students as well as to teach the excellent knowledge of his subject. It is the purpose of the following paragraphs to rank these abilities and so to determine the importance of either of them. 

Out of the view of a student the relatability of the teacher is certainly more important due to the fact that this will encourage the stundent to be excellent and joyful about his work at school. An already excellent student, however, is definately not in need of a teacher who can relate well with him. In this case it is mainly about the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. This, though, is not a very common case and so looses part of its' importance.

Another point is the fact that students, mostly younger people in puberty, need different types of teachers at various stages of life. On one side it might be helpful to have a teacher which tries to support you mentally e.g. when one is about to make difficult decision or feeling down in the dumps. On the other side his can also be negative if one really just wants to improve his skills.

It can be summarised that a ranking of the teachers' ability to relate with the students and the teaching of the excellent knowledge can not be done due to the fact that many outside effects demand different abilities and actions of a teacher.
