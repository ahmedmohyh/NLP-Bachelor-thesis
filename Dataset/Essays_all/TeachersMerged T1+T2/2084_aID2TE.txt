An often discussed topic is if it is more important that a teacher knows a lot about the subject he or she is teaching or, ecspecially for the students, if the relationship between students and teacher is very good. 

Students often say that for them it is much better when the relationship to the teacher is on a "friendly" level because they are more motivated to learn and do homeworks just for the reason that it feels like doing something for a friend and not for an unfriendly teacher who is not interested on their feelings if tehy have some problems (in school or at home) and want to talk about it with a person they can trust to but is not so close to them that they have to be afraid of the chance they this person will tell it someone else.
But on the other side there are students and parents who think that it is very important that the teacher is well informated about the subject because they mean that you can not teach something if you do not have the knowledge about it. This will make it really complicated in school when students have questions because the teacher will not be able to answer them or when the students want to go on a university they will have a lot of problems because they do not know so many facts and relations betweeen the parts of a topic as the others and so they have to learn a lot by theirselves or they will get bad marks.
Another problem is that when the students do not understand the subject they will get really frustrated which can cause some kind of fear by them because they will not be able to write good exams without working on their knowledge about it at home and they will not be motivated to answer questions in class because either they do not even understand the question or they are afrsid of saying something wrong because they do not really know the answer but can guess. 

All in all you can say that both is very important: a good realtionship between both partys makes a really good climate and atmosphere for learning in class but they will have a lot of problems in their future without getting good informations about the topic so that they have the possibility to build up on their basic knowledge or to get good marks in school and in their future.
