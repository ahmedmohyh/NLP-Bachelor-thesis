Quite often, children and adolescents do not like to go to school, as they do not like their teacher. One common reason for that is that the students feel misunderstood or unfairly treated. In order to motivate and support their students, it is crucial that teachers understand what is going on in their students' heads. If not, they might not be able to help them with any problems since the only way to deal with a problem is to understand what exactly the problem is. 
Another important aspect of beeing a good teacher is their knowledge of the subject being taught. There is no point in teaching a subject you do not know enough about, of course. However, in my opinion, teachers only need to be familiar with the topics that they acually teach. I mean, what is the benefit of a maths teacher being able to prove a new theory if the students will never be able to wrap their heads around it?
In addition, the studends tend to be more motivated if the teacher can relate well with them since they feel understood and are not alone with their problems.
Even though there is a need for teachers to have the knowledgerequired, you cannot consider them good teachers if they are unable to relate well with student. The teachers ability to relate well with students is therefore more important than an exellent knowledge ofthe subject beeing taught,
