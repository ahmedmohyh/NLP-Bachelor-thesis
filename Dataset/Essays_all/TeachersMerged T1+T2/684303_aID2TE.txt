There has been some controversity over the question whether the ability of a teacher to relate well with students was more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Now, some people might think that all of the progress a student can make relies on the knowledge of the teacher, However, it has been proven that a satisfying relationship between the student and the teacher strongly promotes the learning process. On the other hand, I do believe that not all of the progress made by a student relies on a teacher's social abilities. For instance, a professor without any education would not be able to teach math; therefore, it is absoultely crucial that teachers and professors acquire an appropriate education. Knowledge is not transferable unless it happens under the right circumstances, the teacher needs to find a way to successfully interact with the student. Besides that, humans always learn better and more efficient when they are focussed and find themselves in a comfortable environment. A bad relationship between the teacher and the student would clearly be uncomfortable for both sides. For instance, I used to strongly dislike my physics teacher. We never got along; As a result, I received bad grades and the teacher was annoyed by my behaviour. There are however situations that represent the exact opposite. My French teacher and I used to get a long fantastically, this relationship had a had an enormous effect on my grades. 
Ultimately, it is the student's choice whether he/she wants to be successful at school, university etc. One thing is for sure however, the teacher does not need to learn what he/she is trying to teach us.
