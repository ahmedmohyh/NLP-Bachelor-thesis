Just like every other student, we all have a few subjects we like and others, we would rather eliminate from our timetable.
Often, the dislike of subjects can be explained by the teacher we have. If a teacher is able to relate with students and even our problems, their teaching methods are more successfull because of their empathy. They once were a student too and know how to learn a theme most efficiently.
Teachers who do not have this sense of understanding students, are more likely to be disliked or even hated. Their methods can be the same for years and are not suited for every one, which is what can make the subject being taught more difficult.

On the other hand, it is not always neccessary to be able to relate with students since the subject's content will still be the same. If teachers have too close relations to their students, a loss of respect will follow beacuse they have not as much authority anymore. If students use this relation to their teacher to maybe get better marks, the process of giving marks will not be equal for everyone anymore. Since a teacher does not like every student in a class, they can be influenced by their personal emotions.

In my opinion, it is an important part of being a teacher, to show that they can relate with the student's problems during the learning process. By explaining subjects differently or by giving students the chance to understand also difficult thematics within more time, the students are more likely to succeed in a subject. They also do not fear the classes they have to take because they feel understood and in the time of growing up to an adult, it is a neccessary point to know that someone can understand and help you.
