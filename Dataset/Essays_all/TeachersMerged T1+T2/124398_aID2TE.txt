How important is it as a teacher to know his subject? Should they focus on relating well with students over than precise knowlege.

It is important that a teacher knows what he is talking about. For example if a student is interested in a specific subject it is important that a good teacher can awnser further questions than what he prepared to teach. Imagine an intrested student who euphoricly enjoyes the subject getting shut down because of the teacher not knowing the awnser.
At the same time it is also important that a teacher knows his students and gets on well with them. It is clear that students learn better if they like the teacher. Thus it is a good idea to motivates them to do more and make them enjoy the lessons.
It is also important for the respect, students want to learn from the best and if they think that their teachers are not competent enough they wont listen to them. 

In the end I think that both points excellent knowledge of the subject and an ability to relate well with the sutdents are equally important. So that a teacher can motivate his students and also can give further informations on his topics.
