In the following text I'm going to explain whether or not a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. On the one hand it's important that sudents feel connected and comfortable with the teacher because they won't be scared to ask about things they don't understand or state their opinion. But I don't thing that this is more important than the knowledge of the subject because in the end it only matters if you've learned something and not how. It's the teachers job to explain everything and make sure everyone is able to understand. As long as the students are being taught well, a teachers ability to relate with students is just an advantage.
