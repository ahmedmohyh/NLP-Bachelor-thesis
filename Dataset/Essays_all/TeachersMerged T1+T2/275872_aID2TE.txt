Should a teacher know everything about his subject as precisly as possible or should the teacher be the student's friend? How does it work if no student listens to him at all, because the teacher is like a lexicon? Or if no student takes him seriously because his more a friend then a teacher? Which is more important? The knowledge or the the ability to relate to the students.

A teacher that knows everything into the precise detail is great, you can allways go on asking questions to satisfy your couriosity. But a teacher which can relate to us, the students is great too, especialy because he knows what we think and we are allways on the same wavelenght. But if a teacher which is only one of the two things is disasterous. A theacher which knows everything but doesn't know how we think and what our interests are can't teache us anything because he might just told us the most important story on earth but it sounded like the most boring thing on earth. The other extreme is bad too. If my teacher doesn't know anything about what he is talking about but starts to be funny, the relationship might become great but after three years of school you haven't learend a single thing about the subject.

To come to a conclusion, I think that having a good relationship with te students is more important then knowing absolutly everything. But I think it should be an equilibrum. One without the other is like breakfast witout coffee, the worst.
