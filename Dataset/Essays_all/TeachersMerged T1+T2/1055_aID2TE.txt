The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" has it's positive and negative sides. 
Many times, teachers disagree with students on marks or the amount of homework. Some teachers do not seem to understand that students participate in after school activities and give complex homework assignments. However, teachers have a right do assign homework to the students because it helps with the learning progress of the subject. 
Another thing is that teachers do not realize that their collegues give homework as well which results in a pile of homework for the students.
A different example is that teaching is the teachers occupation. They try to bring knowledge to their students for a living. It does not matter how nice the teacher is when he cannot prepare the students for their exams or class tests. Aspecially the upper classes have interest in learning new things and might even have a fairly good knowledge about the subject themselves. If a teacher cannot have a discussion with the students ha did not do his job right. On the other hand, a teacher who understands that the students are having a hard time with the things he teaches he might be kinder and teach less in the same amount of time other teachers teach to make sure the students understand everything.
I believe that teachers need to have an excellent knowledge of what they are teaching. However, they need to cooperate with the students as well. A good teacher is someone who knows by far more than the students and can always refer to almost any topic of their subject and who is understanding, kind, humorous at the same time.
