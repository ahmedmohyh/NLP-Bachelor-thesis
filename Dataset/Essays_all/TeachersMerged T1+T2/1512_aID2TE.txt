In every school there are a few stereotypes of teachers. One of wich is often the one that students like because he's young and is able to relate to them better. But often the one's that are far less popular have the superior knowledge in their subject. It's arguable with which one if these two examples students can learn better with, so the following text contains arguments for and against both of them.

First of all some students that are better at a subject and have questions concerning higher levels of the topic being taught may not be pleased with the answers someone with less knowledge could give them. On the other hand that could make things tought harder and students that aren't as interested in the subject could fastly be left behind.
Apart from that a teacher with perfect skills at his subject could make class more interesting with information to tell that you can't find on every random website if he knows how to tell it wich also gives him 
Psychologists are mostly concerned that a that teacher that motivates children to learn by being able to relate to the mistakes they are making is more important than someone that bores them with complex information.
In some cases a teacher that is more popular with the students may even be able to help with problems out of school and at home beacause he is more trusted. For example if a child has a struggle with it's parents, it would rather tell the teacher that is always nice about it than the one that is known for being e.g. a perfect Physicist.

I guess everybody would agree that the perfect tacher would have both of these attributes. To conclude I would still say that a teacher that is able to understand his students is far more competent than one that only relies on scientific and difficult knowledge in his subject but then doesn't know what to do when the students don't understand his questions.
