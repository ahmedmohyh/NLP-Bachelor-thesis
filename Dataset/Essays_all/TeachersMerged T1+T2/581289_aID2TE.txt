A teacher is there to teach the student in a specific subject. First he has to be good in this subject but on the other side he also has to relate well with the students. What is more important?
First, the teachers have to have an excellent knowledge of their subject. They must be able to teach us the right grammar, the best way to solve the math problems and so on. Our goal for the future is to be able to use the things they taught us. 
Also important is that "the experts" know how to transmit the things. When they use different medias and create an interesting lesson the students have more fun and for this they have to relate well with us. SOme teachers are able to do that, mostly young teachers. For the old ones it's more difficult beacause of the age diffrences. Maybe they try their best but we can't handl
I'm interested in language subjects. Especially in this subjects it's important that the teachers are able to speak the language fluently without any mistakes. Some of them also have the ability to relate well with us. I can see this difference with the results of the exams. I'm better informed about a theme and I have fun to learn it when the teacher isn't very strict and tries to understand us.
All in all, I would say that the thing that counts most is the ability to relate well with us but we also want a good teacher with a knowledge of the subject. I agree with the statement.
