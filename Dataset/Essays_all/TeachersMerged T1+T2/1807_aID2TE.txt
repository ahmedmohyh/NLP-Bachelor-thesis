In the following text I will write an Essay about the topic if teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt.

An argument for the ability to relate well with students is that you have to motivate the students to learn something and a good relationship between students and the teacher can help extrem to motivate. When the students have fun in the lesson they can remind themselfs much better on the stuff the learnd. 

But on the other hand the knowledge is also important because when the atmosphere is perfect in the class and the students are motivated to learn something but the teacher has not a good knowledge about the topic it is also not good.  

In my opinon, the ability to relate well with the students is very important, because if it is a good atmosphere in the classroom the pupil or students want to learn something about the topic the teacher is talking about. It not has to be perfect or excellent knowledge, but knowledge should be there otherwise the students would not learn something about the topic. 

In conclusion it has to be a good mix between knowledge and the ability to relate well with the students.
That is the key for a good and interesting lesson.
