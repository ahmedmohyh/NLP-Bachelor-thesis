It is more important for the students to get taught very well then to be friends with the teacher. The thing that matters after the school is the knowledge, which is although really bad in some cases, and not the friendship with the teacher.
  
Also it could be dangerous if the teachers and students have a to nice relationship. This could cause a disrespect to the teachers and students who do not focus on the lesson but on joking with the teacher. 

Furthermore there is a difference of teachers and students. The students have to know that there is a older person trying to teach them, so they can do something with their lives and start a career. That is why it could be problematic. 

Of course it is important for a teacher to stay nice with the students and guarantee a friedly and unstressed atmosphere in the lessons. Also it could be possible to build up trust with the teacher, so the students, especially in lower grades, can turn to the teachers if they have problems. 
But the most important is that the teacher teaches the students so they profit of the knowledge.

So it is better to keep a authority position and to keep stay friendly but strict to guarantee a good teaching.
