My opinion is that a teacher should relate well with his student, because the students need a external person they can talk to if they have problems with their family or on other places in the life. Sadly today in the school only the knowlege and achievment counts and we have to do test like "mews" to see how our level in some subjects is (; . On the other side in our today society excellent knowlege in so many as possible parts of the live is quite important in the work world. The work world is today many times harder that in the past and cauce of this a teacher should have exellent knowlege. The optimum kind of teacher should have bouth abilitys. A teacher that doesn`t relate well with his students could never realizise what goes on in his class. A student which suffers under mobbing don`t become any help. The thematic is complecate and it isn`t easy to decide what`s more important. Now we arrived at the end of my essay.
