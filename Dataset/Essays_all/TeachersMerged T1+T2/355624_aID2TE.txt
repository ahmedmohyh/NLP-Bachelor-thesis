A good bond between teacher and student is important, but people go to class to learn something and not to find a very good friend in the teacher. The question is, if it's more important, to have a good realationship between student and teacher then the knowlegde of the teacher.

A teacher should know a lot about they subject which they teach. Great discussion and interessting lessons can only be made when the teacher knows nearly everything about the theme. But for good discussions it's needed a good realationship between student and teacher. When the teacher doesn't care about the students feelings, the students could be frightend to say something loud in class, because of the reaction of the teacher. A teacher shouln'd be like a good friend, because in this case, the students won't take their teacher sereous and don't learn a lot anymore. But the opposit isn't the best solution as well. If the teacher just want his students to learn something, students maybe feel kind of forced to learn.   
If the teacher has an ability to relate well with students it makes it easer for him to teach as well for the students to learn. If students feel comfortable in class they automatically can rember the stuff better. 

In my opinion the teacher's ability to reate well with students is as important than his excellent knowlegde. Then just an amazing knowledge isn't enough, when the students don't feel comfortable in class, because than they aren't consentrating. But only a good realationship between student and teacher isn't helpful to learn something if the knowledge is missing. There should be a good middle from both aspects for interssting sessions in class.
