In the following essay i will describe and argument the question: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject  being taught. 

It is very important to be a good teacher and have a good relationship with your students. When you have a good relationsship, when you make some jokes and when the atmoshpaire is well, then you have automaticly better results in tests. For me it's very important beacause when a good teacher teach the class you make a bigger effort. When you doesn't relate well with your students they often don't agree with you, they are against you and to teach can be very unpleasant.

On the other hand it is very important to learn the subject, learn the learning goals and have a excellent knowledge in ths subject. One reason for this side is that you have a problem when your class come to a next teacher and they have a lack of knowledge in this subject just beacause you don't was a good teacher.For a important subject like mathematics or german you have to learn constantly. Another argument is that you are a teacher and your exercise is to teach a class and bring them knowledge and in every job you have to do what you must.

For me it's clear that you must have a excellent knowledge and that is important. But you also must have a good relationsship with your students. It's both who makes you to a good teacher.
