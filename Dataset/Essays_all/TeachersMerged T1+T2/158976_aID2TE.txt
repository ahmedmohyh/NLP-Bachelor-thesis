A teacher's main job is, that at the end of the day, every single student should have learnt something.
There are many different ways to reach this goal: there are teachers who let their students do a lot of work by themselves, there are some who write a lot of important informations out of a book on the blackboard and there are some who talk a lot out of their backpack of knowledge. 
Every student remarks after a few minutes, if a teacher knows what he is talking about. If he does not have enough knowledge, he or she is not able to talk deeply about the topics. In this case, it is less interesting to pay attention to this teacher, than if he would be really fascinated about the specific topic. So if a teacher does not have enough knowlede of a subject, he is not able to motivate the students to learn something new about this topic, what would be pretty much the worst case. So it is really important for a teacher to introduce the students with a whole bunch of knowledge. 
But there is one more problem of teaching: Even if a teacher has an immense amount of knowledge, but he can not work with the students, he is the opposite of a good teacher. 
Not a single student will ever listen to somebody who talks in an absolutely different niveau and confuses everyone with some complicated expressions. If a teacher does not make an effort to let the students understand something of his knowledge, the teaching lessons are a waste of time. 
So if there would be a teacher with less knowledge but with the ability to rely with students, I would prefer him or her of someone who has a lot of knowledge but is not able to explain it very well.
So I can say that I agree with this statement, but the best solution would be, that a teacher has a lot of knowledge but is able to rely well with students aswell. In this way, the goal of teaching something to the students, could be reached as affective as possible.
