Millions of people go to school every day. The reason is that they can, should or want to learn new things. The biggest factor of a good school are good teachers because they are the bridge from knowledge to the scholars. If that bridge isn`t good, the scholars won`t learn anything. But is it necessaire that this this bridge is decorated with a good relationship between the teachers and the scholars?
One argument that is against this statement is the reality. In many schools, the relathion between teachers and students isn`t that good or there isn`t even any relation. At universitys for example. The teacher or professor just stands in front of the class and holds a presentation. But it works. There are also examples at normal schools. The classic example is that a student doesn`t like a teacher. But that doesn`t mean that he can`t learn anything. On the other side, a bad relationship between a student and a teacher could cause that the student doesn`t like to go to school anymore. He doesn`t has any motivation and thats why the grades will become worse.
