on the one hand it is very important to have a teacher, who can teach you very much and very detailed. Because you learn in school for your life and this is why a teacher should have a excellent knowledge of the subject.
Moreover a teacher should be able to answer your questions and many students are intellegent and ask complex questions so a teacher has to have a big knowledge of every toppic he or she is teaching.
But on the other hand students will learn better if they have a teacher they like because people like to listen to people they like and if you listen in school, it is easier to understand the things you have to learn for your a levels. A secound argument that the teacher´s ability to relate well with students is, that many students have problems with other students, teacher or subjects. And if a teacher work very well with his students, the students have trust in them, so they go to ther teacher and talk about their problems, so they are able to handle with it. 
But a big piont is, that students like to go to school if there are many people they like. No matter if other students or teacher. And if the students like to go to school they are happier and have more fun in learning. So it is easier to learn more.

So all in all it is very important how a teacher work with his students and also his ability to realate well with them has a big impact how well Students learn. But it is also important that a teacher has a good knowledge about his subject, because the students are in school to learn for their life so this should not get in the background.
