As I many times realized, the abilitiy of teachers to relate well with student is a really important part of a school lesson. With this condition, poeple like to come to the lesson and they are motivated to learn something. If teachers are mean or they think they're something better than the students, the lesson gonna be boring and long. 
On the other side, a good knowledge of the teacher is important. Well without any know-how he can't teach... But what I actually want to say is, if he don't know how to connect to his students , this means if he doesn't have the ability to relate well with them, all the knowledge is unusable. 
Summarized I want to say, that if the relation between teacher and students doesn't work, all the know-how of the teaching person isn't worth to talk about. 

Generally my opinion is that a teacher has to know a lot and may can explain well this things to his students. But I think the most important thing is how he explains it. If there is no harmony between the teacher and the student, the teaching person will never can give all his knowledge to the learning person. And i'm really more willing to go the lesson if the teacher can also laugh with us and talk about other things than only school. So the lesson is more various and interesting. For a perfect school lesson it needs a lot of differently explained knowledge and a funny, also a bit rare teacher.
