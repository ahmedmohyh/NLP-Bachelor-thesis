I do agree with the statement.
As long as the teacher is able to answer the questions the students are asking and as long as he is beware of the themes he has to teach the class about it is more important to have the ability to relate well with his students.

I think someone who hasn't got a good ability to relate with students wouldn't become a teacher.
If a teacher is very ruff and unfriendly the students will not listen to his lessons and even if he has an exellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching it wouldn't help anybody.
As a teacher it is important to find a good balance between teaching (and being a person which is respected by his students) and someone who is accepted like a class member the students like to talk with.
But in my oppinion often the studets' parents want a teacher to be very strict. Parents sometimes complain about the teachers of today and I think that sentences beginning with: "When I went to school ......." are very common. But often when the teacher becomes more strict parents do also complain and say that the teacher is too strict and demands too many things from his students.
There is a lot of pressure on teachers. They have sometime classes of more than 25 students and all this students have different niveaus so how to treat everybody the same way? And if it is a very loudly class how to tell them to be quiet without being a little bit louder too?

So, as I told you so: it is very diffucult to find the perfect balance between being a friendly and niche teacher with whome every student likes to talk and being a good teacher who teaches the class and knows everythinh about the subject he's teaching.
