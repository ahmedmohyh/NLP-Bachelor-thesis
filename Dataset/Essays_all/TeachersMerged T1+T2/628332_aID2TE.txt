It is very important that teachers can relate well with students, because then he can teach them more and better. It's easer for the students because they can talk and always ask the teacher. In a good relation it's easier to 'work together' and that's what is important in school. But only a good relation won't help the students, if the teachers knowledge isn't correct or not good enough. The teacher has to have the whole knowledge of the subject he's teaching and he has to be able to teach it the students and to answer their questions properly. I think that's also what students are expecting from they're teachers. They want to learn and the things they're learning they want to learn correctly. Because later they'll have a problem if they would learn incorrect things or things they don't fully understand. The students shouldn't fail only because of the teachers missing knowledge. 

In my opinion it's a very hard questino to answer. I think it's not easy as a teacher to show students his knowlegde without a good relation. Students won't take it up as good as in a good relation. But only a good relation doesn't help the teacher nor the students. There has to be knowledge but there also has to be some kind of connection between the teacher and the students. I personally like it more to learn for subjects, where there's a good relation between us the students and the teacher. Then I like the subject automatically more. But there are also subjects which I personally don't like, only because of the teacher. Then it's very hard to follow in the lessons. But I think in the end it's just a matter of balance between a good relation and the excellent knowledge of the teacher.
