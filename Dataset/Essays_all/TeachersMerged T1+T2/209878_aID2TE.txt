I think this is a very difficult question, because you can not simply concentrate on one of the two. 

The relationship a teacher has with a student is very important. If students trust their teacher they will perform better in class, meaning they will be more eager to answer the questions, participate and pay attention in class and also treat the teacher with more respect. But then again you can not just hire someone because of their social skills, you also have to make sure the person, or teacher for that matter, has knowledge of the subject he's teaching. So I guess yes, the teacher does have to have a certain understanding or connection toward his or her students but also has to be competent in the subject he's teaching. 

What might be a problem is, that to a person who is excellent in one subject, everything he or she has to teach seems logic to them. That probably leads the teacher to teach the material very fast, which is difficult for the students who need more time to understand things or the people who have trouble with the subject. Another point to me is, that if that person is really that excellent I don't think that he or she really wants to teach childern. Because their knowledge is on a much higher level than what we learn in school. 

So no, I do not agree with the question because I don't think it's very intelligent to just focus on the social skills of a person. You have to look at all of the applicant's skillset. The employer should check that the person wants and enjoys to be around childern and that he or she can deal with different students of differents speeds and needs. Also they should be happy to teach what they're teaching and they should also be on a quite high level of that said subject. So in the end it's just very important that the teacher has a healthy balance between the two.
