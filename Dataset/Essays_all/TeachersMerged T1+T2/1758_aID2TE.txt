The statement says that it is more important for a teacher to relate well with his students than to teach them the perfect knowledge.
There are some arguments for and some against this topic.
There is nothing wrong with a teacher who is nice, funny and friendly to his students.It is the opposite; the students have fun in school and are much more motivated to go there everyday. A good social area can also lead to more concentrated and productiv work and this is useful for being successful. So it would be very helpful for the students if their teachers were more human to them.
But the statement says that this all would be more important than to learn well what you should be able to know. And this is not right because school exists for earning knowledge and it is really important for your future to have a good education. If the teachers were not strict enough they could not handle the class. It would be loud and the students could not work concentrated because they would have too much fun. But it is important to understand exercises in school because not everyone is able to teach it hisself/herself at home and should not be like that either. And during an exam a friendly teacher cannot help you, although this is a very stressful situation for you in school and it is one of the most important aspects for your grades.
So I do not agree with the statement that the relation between teacher and student would be more important than the subject. Of course, it is better to be friendly to each other and it can help to be happier in school, but the main point of school is to create a base with enough knowledge for your future life. So it is more important to be taugh well than to have a good connection.
