I disagree, a teacher need to teach as correct and as accurate as possible, therefor his first goal is to have an  absolute high knowledge on his subject. On the other hand a teacher needs to be able to relate well with students and he must be able to explain himself in different ways, but he must not be choosen because of his well-relation but for his excellent knowledge. Every now and than there are students that need another way of explanation to  understand some of the subject, in this case the teacher has to do his best to make them understand or if he isn't able he has to help seeking a solution or provide a different, understandable way to help this students. But it would be ridiculess if the focus of the teachers ability was not to provide knowledge but to be able to explain himself. There are always people that won't understand something the way you can explain it, so it won't help to set your focus on understandability. A teacher needs to provide knowledge, help, and the ability to guide students trough their subject, showing them what they may take with them for their life. In order to that a teacher needs to be friendly but doesn't need to become best friends with the students. This would even be very unfavourable becAUSE IF IT WERE SO, THE TEACHER WOULD HAVE TO MUCH INFLUENCE ON THE STUDENTS AS THEY COULD MANIPULATE THEM INTO COMMUNISM. AND NO ONE COULD USE COMMUNISTIC STUDENTS, OR DO YOU WANT TO GET IN CLASSROOM AND PEOPLE THERE WERE LIKE: OH! THAT'S OUR ONLY PENCIL BECAUSE EVERYONE IS RICH. sry caps
