The quality of teaching is a very important and current topic. Many schools send their teachers to special courses every year to ensure that the teachers keep a certain level of teaching quality. But what is more important, the knowledge of the subject or the social abilities and good understanding of the students?
I personnaly believe, that this changes with the age of the students. In primary school for example, where the students are very young and excited to learn new things, it is of enormous importance, that the teacher appeals to the students. If they like the person who is standing in front of them for many hours each week, and the teaching style fits them well, the children will learn absolutely anything without problems. Also the amount and the importance of most of the matter, which is learned in school at this age, isn`t very big.
At a higher age this isn`t the case anymore. Imagine the same students as before, but now 17 years old and in the 11th grade. A lot has changed during the last ten years when they were in school. Now they are almost adults, are in school for over 30 hours a week and learn highly complex topics in different subjects, which they will need later when they will go to work or study at a university. Also they don`t have two or three teachers anymore, but every subject is taught by a different teacher. At this level, it is much more important, that the teacher understands his subject perfectly and can teach and explain everything flawlessly. In the optimal case, the teacher will also relate well with students, but often its an "either or" decision.
So to conclude my essay I can say that im my opinion the most important quality of a teacher switches from his social skills to the knowledge of his topic with the growing age pf the students.
