Yes,I agree with this statement. Nowadays, many of the students in school are rude and not easy to handle. In exact this type of situations I think, we need teachers, wich can relate well with students. A teacher who can handle his stuff well, but has no idea how to educate the students, is so usless  like a teacher who can teach well, but has no knowledge of the subject being taught.

In fact one of the main reasons why i think it is important to have a good relation to the students is,that if the student likes you as a teacher,he will learn more and be more active in the lessons. Another issue, why I think it is better is, that if the teacher has a good relation to his student, he will be more relaxt, because the student will be more patient, if the teacher makes a mistake.
 
On the other side, the ability to relate well with students,can`t be to good, because the student will take advantage of the good relation and won`t take the school topics to serious. 

In conclusion, I can say that a relation between a student and a theacher has to be good, but they mustn`t have a to strong relation, because that woul not be good for the öearning effect.






This topic is really difficult to find pros and cons.
