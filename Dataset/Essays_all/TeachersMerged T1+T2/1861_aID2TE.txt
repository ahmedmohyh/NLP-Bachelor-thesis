The question if the ability of a teacher to relate with the stundents is more importsnt than his knowledge of the subject beeing taught is important because it may influence what the student learn when they become a teacher. There is no doubt that both things are important, a teacher who can relate to the students but doesnt't know what he's talking about is as bad as one whoose knowledge is big but doesn't know how to teach it. Beside that, I think that the relation of the teacher to the students is slightly more important than his knowledge. An important argument to support my theory is, that students are taught so much from many subjects, so that it is almost impossible to learn everything and remember everything. So its not that important that the teacher can teach you everything,it's important that he teaches you the important things and how he does that. A good relation between the teacher and his students can achieve exactly that. Because when you like a teacher and the way he teaches you, you probably learn more from him. So that at the end of the day more knowledge doesnt mean that the student learns more. On the other hand its important that the teacher knows what hes talking about but I think the answer of this question is a good compromise between knwolegde and relation. I think that it does depend on the subject too, because some subjects are all about listening to what the teacher is telling you like eg. german, while others are about talking and interacting with other stundents and the teacher eg. politics. At the end of the day, maybe both aspects are equally important. And in my opinion its hard to say wich one is more important because there is so much that influences the answer, so that it would be a way too general answer.
