The statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.", is an often discussed thema, wich is importand for the students to have the best results in tests. And a good qualification for there life after school. In the following text I will show the diferent sites related to the statement above. 

First of all the ability of teacher´s to relate well with students has an importand role, because the most students are better in school, if they like the teacher and understand his desisions. Following to this they are open to the lessons and understand the stuff the teacher was teaching them. Another point is if the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students, that they have fun and willing to work.
The other side is that the teacher needs the excellent knowledge to teach his students, because just relating well doesn´t mean that the students learn something and are prepared for there time after school.

I thing both is importand, bacause to teach the teacher needs the excellent knowledge, but also the ability to bring the stuff in the heads of the students, for them to understand. Following to this I don´t agree with the statement. Both are really important for the students to be prepared.
