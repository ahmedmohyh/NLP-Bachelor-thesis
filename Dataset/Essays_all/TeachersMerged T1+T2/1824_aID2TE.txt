In the follwing text I will give my opinien on the question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
First, I think it is hard to give a yes or no answer, because I think it has to be a mix between both. A teacher has to be polite and helpfully and maybe like a friend to the students but he also has to teach them the best he can, because they have to do thier degree based on his knowledge. 

On the one hand a teacher has to tell the students about his or her subject. It is its job to do this. The students are in the school to been told, to been taught about knowledge. The job of a teacher is give its knowledge to others like parents do it to thier children but on a more specific way, e.g. in a special subject. The students do not have to like the teacher because he is only there to teach them about his subject. They have to learn it on there own anyway and in there later life they also cannot chose who they want to be thier boss, thier supervisor. 

On the other hand a teacher, a specially in the primary school but in higher grades as well, is like the second parents. They should listen to problems of the children. Sometimes maybe be like a friend or a uncle you can tell everything, e.g. if a child has problems with other kids or maybe the parents he or she need a person who listen and trys to defeat the problem. A teacher can be this person. Students are not machines which are only based on knowledge. They have feelings and emotions who they have to speak about. When the parents cannot or do not want to help a teacher often can. 

In the end I agree with the statement but I also disagree. I think it is not the way to answer such a big question like this. You have to find a mixture of both to find the best solution. There is no perfect way of handling this problem.
