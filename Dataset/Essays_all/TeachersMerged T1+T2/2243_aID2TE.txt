On the one hand it is necessary for a teacher to relate well with students, because they have to be a role-model for the students. If they would not relate well with the students the students could get the feeling that it is okay to be unpolite or to give someone a bad feeling just because of the personal meaning to this person. And when the students like their teachers, they have even more fun in the lessons and the learning is easier. In the oppesite, when the students do not like the teacher, the lessons get borring and there is no fun anymore in doing something for this lessons.
On the other hand it is imposible to teach the students, if the teacher of no good knowledge of the topic, they have to teach. So if a students would ask the teacher something about the topic and he does not know the answer, the students get the feeling, that the teacher himself is not good and lose the respect for him. Espacially if it is more often like this. 
But even if it is necessary for the teacher to know a lot, it is not necessary to know everything, to have an "excellent knowledge". It is just normal that a teacher can not know everything, it is humanlity. The real important thing is that the teacher, even if he can not answer directly, makes some research to be able to answer it in the next lesson. So they should not try to hide the fact that they do not know everything, cause the students learn in this case even that it is okay to be not perfect. And this is, what is really important for the teachers, to act personally. So the way how the teachers act with the students, if they relate well with students is more important than the knowledge.
Overall, I agree the statement, cause just because the teachers know everything about the topics, it is not said that they can teach well, so that the topic gets interesting and the students are motivated to learn. But if the teacher relate well with the students, the lessons and topics get so interesting.
