A teacher is required to have a lot of qualities and abilities, for example excellent knowledge on his subject and the ability to realte well with his students. But which one is more important?
The teacher obviously needs a lot of knowledge in order to teach his students well, since they will have to graduate on their own later, with only the information that they gained in school. If the teacher spreads false information or doesn't know enough to teaach the students well, they will fail because of that.
However, the most educated teacher can't teach his students well if he is unable to relate with them. Such a teacher is likely to teach complex topics and explaining them using many details and facts, while the students fall asleep in his lessons or just cannot follow his explanations. He needs to relate to his students to get them to listen to him in the first place.
Yet a techer who relates to the students very well but otherwise has no idea what exactly he has to teach will probably fail. The students, of course, will most likely love his lessons and probably pay a lot of attention to what he says, but they will not gain any of the information the require later in their lives. 
Hence, a teacher definitely needs both of these qualities or he won't be able to teach his students. 
In my opinion though, the ability to relate well to the students is more important, since even if they will not learn much, both the teacher and the students will have fun in the lessons. Additionally, it is nearly impossible to know nothing, especially as an adult. So no matter what, the teacher will be able to teach his students something, it may not be very relevant for the subject, but they will still profit from his experience, while they might not even remember the information a knowledgable but unrelatable teacher will share with them.
