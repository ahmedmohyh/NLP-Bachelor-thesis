Students often like a good relationship with teacher's. But we have to realise that in some lessons we really don't learn something. And at the end it's important that we learn something. A good atmosphere in the lesson can be very nice and make the learning probably easier. For example in a lesson where a teacher makes a very borring presentation, the students will do some other things. But in a interesting lesson where the students can work together or the teacher change a little bit the lesson, the students would listen and learn more. On the other side it's very important that the teacher know his subject. If he don't know the subject, we will also don't learn something. 
So I think the school is here to learn something. Andfor this the relationshi with a teacher isn't really important. If a students only learn with nice and kindly teachers they are at the wrong place Because after the high school you go to the university or college and the you have no relationship the teachers or professor. At te moment a lot of people are in the mood to say school has to be funny. But I would say ths isn't right. Not everything in the can be fnny somtimes you have to do something you don't like. We can also say that if youdon't like school and learning the high school isn't probably the right thing and you should do something diffrent. So I disagree with this sentence and would say the escellent knowledge of the subject is more important then the realtionship with the students.
