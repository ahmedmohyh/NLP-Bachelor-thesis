Everyone can study hard to be a teacher of a school. But only the name ,,teacher'' doesn't make you a good teacher. A teachers job is to teach the students their subject. And the goal of teaching the subject, is that at the end of a lesson, the students know, and more importantly understand the new subject.

It is easy to learn the facts of a subject, the difficulty is to answer the students questions to make it clear for him again. And that I think can only be achieved by understanding the problem of the student. So if you can relate to a student it is easier to understand what the student doesn't understand, because you can set yourself in the eyes of the student.

But all that doesn't mean that the teacher doesn't have to know what his subject is all about. This is also very important, because if you know what your subject is about and more importantly if you're interested in your subject, it is much easier to explain stuff. And because you can explain your subject very good, there may be fewer questions about your subject. Another point of knowledge about your subject is, that if a question appears you can answer it way better than if you have no clue about your subject. But again there may be difficult questions which don't exactly relate to the subject and then it is important to understand where the problem of the student might be.

At the end I thnk for a teacher it is important to understand the student but at the same time be a master of your own subject. Because you can't answer a question if you can't relate to the problem of the student, or the other way, you can't answer a question if you have no clue about your subject. So as a teacher you have to find kind of a balance between those two points. Which makes teaching a really difficult job, if you do it the right way.
