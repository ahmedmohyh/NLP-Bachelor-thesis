To answer the question, if the ability to relate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject, there are some notes that go for it and some notes that go against it.
The notes for it are for example that the students are feeling more comfortable with their teacher, so they can learn much more better and maybe they will be more interested in the lesson when they are following the subject better when they have a better relation to their teacher.
But there are also some points that are against the statement that the ability to relate well with students is more important than the knowledge of the subject.A point against it is for example that the stundents will miss much time to learn something about other subjects, that could be very important. So they will miss the important knowledge for the next exam and the problem that follows is that they could fail this exam.An d to fail the exam will make you very sad and demotivated that will lead you to the point that you don´t want to go to school anymore because yopu already know before you write an exam or maybejust a test, that you will fail it. so you don´t learn for it because you already know that it would be the same situation like when you have learned like 3 hours for this exam.

I agree with the statement that the ability to relate well with students is more important, because when the relation between the teacher and the students is not well, you can´t work very well with him, so you can´t learn lots of things in the lesson. Another point is that you could have some fun in the hard lessons, because the teacher is joking with you. You could learn better and you would learn something with a lot of fun. So you forget the feeling that school is awful and maybe you go with much more motivation to school that could lead to better marks and good mood because you get good marks.
