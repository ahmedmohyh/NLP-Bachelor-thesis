The discussion wheter teacher's ability to relate well with students or the knowledge of the subject is more important, is a very important question. It has a big impact on the students and the lessons.

We can say that the relation with the students is more important, because the students have to be intersted in the subject. This is more likely, when the teacher can relate well with the students. According to this, the teacher can teach things, students are more interested in. Otherwise the students will not like the subject and perform less, because they do not like the teacher.
On the other hand if the teacher has less knowledge of the subject, the lessons will have less quality. The studetns often realize this. As a consequence the stundents will learn less.

Now we could say both things are equally important. But all teachers have or should have excellent knowledge of the subject they are teaching, because ohterwise they would not be teaching this subjet. That's why the ability to relate well with students is more important.
