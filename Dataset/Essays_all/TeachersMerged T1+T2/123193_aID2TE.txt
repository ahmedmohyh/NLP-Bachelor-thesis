Teachers have to have the ability to relate well with there students. But sometimes this is not the most important thing.

What are you doing, when your teacher have the biggest knowledge of is subcejt, but he can not talk with the class  an relate to them well, because he is shy? Then his job as a teacher is not a good jobdesicion for him, because he can not use his knowledge and give it to his students so he would better be an scientist or something like this. So he can use his knowledge very well and do not has to come in contact with many other poeple and also do not have to talk in front of many people. 

But on the other side:What is when the teacher is funny and can relate very well with the students, but he his students knows more than himself? There is also a problem. When the teacher have no idea what he is doing or what he have to do, he is also has the wrong job.

It is very obvious that it has to have both. A teacher need the ability to relate well with his students, but he also have to have a big knowledge about his subject. What is also very important to have is that the teacher can hold his students in the lesson.
