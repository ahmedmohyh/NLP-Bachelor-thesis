The ability of a teacher
The students speak often about her teacher. How they think about them and so on. Much have to do with the teachers ability to relate well with sudents. But what is more important an excellent knowlege or a good relation with the students?
Surely, it is very important that the teachers know about what he is speaking. For that he needs the knowledge of the subject being thaught. 
On the other side it is very important that the students have a good relationship with the teacher. The teacher would be much more motivated if they like the teacher.

So I think a good relationship between the students and the teacher is much more important than a excellent knowledge of the teacher. If the chemical the classroom is not good the teacher can know as much as possible the sudents would not hear to him. So they wouldn't learn anything.
