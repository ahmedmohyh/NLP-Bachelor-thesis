Tousands of students are bored in school every single day. Their teachers create eather a exteamly exhausting lessons or some which are not worth to follow at all, even if they are really good qualified. So an important point to consider is, if a teacher's ability to relate well with studtens more important is than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

First of all, in grammar schools the students have already a wide varity of knowledge. They can solve complicated math problems or write a complete essay in a forgein language. Some students for instance have an extreamly high IQ and they come up with problems, only a good qualified teacher can solve. So a teacher has to understand his subject very well. 
Secondly, if a teacher doesn't know exactly evertything he teaches, he can't transfer everything to the students and then they are bored in his lessons. 

On the other hand, teachers communicate with studens every day. They have the influence of a student's mood. If there is a teacher who always shouts at others, the pupils do not want to go to school at all. 
Furthermore, some students do not like some subjects. So many teachers have to motivate many stutens to stay focused in the lessons. If a teacher is creative, he can help the pupils to concentrate an the subjcet.

In conclusion I can say that a high qualified teacher can help the students to learn quicker and pay attention to the lessens, but if the teacher is a bugger, the children are not very motivated in class. In my opinion it also depends on which age the stutens are. For younger pupils it is more important to get along well.
