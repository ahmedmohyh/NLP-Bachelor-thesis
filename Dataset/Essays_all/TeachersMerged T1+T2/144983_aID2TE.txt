Do teachers really have to relate to the student or should they also be able to relate to them? I will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of a relating teacher versus those of a knowing teacher.
First of all, every teacher used to be a student himself hence he can somewhat relate to each and every student. Every teacher knows how it is to not understand a new subject or to need help. Moreover, they surely need it themselves from time to time. Furthermore, a student which does not understand the teacher is not going to understand the topic at all meaning that the teacher has to be able to explain things in a way so the student can comprehend it. Despite many teachers already relating very well to students they should not relate too much because that would ruin the whole teacher-student relation due to the students taking the teacher's cooperation for granted which would be contraproductive.
On the other hand, a teacher must have knowledge. Not only that, a teacher without knowledge about his subject cannot be a good teacher no matter how much he is able to relate to students because he is not able to teach them anything which is the purpose of a teacher. In spite of that, a teacher still has to have a little relateabilty because a solely knowing teacher may not quite teach his stuff the way the students can understand it thus knowledge is a very important factor for a teacher. 
In conclusion, a teacher should be able to relate to the students and cooperate but still have the excellent knowledge. Teachers who are able to combine both of these factors are also able to teach in a very good and compelling type of way.
