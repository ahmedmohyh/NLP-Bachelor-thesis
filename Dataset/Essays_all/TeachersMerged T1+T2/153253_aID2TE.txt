In this eassay we want to answer the question if techers should better relate with their students or if it is more important that they have a good knowledge about their material. I think it's an important question which we should discus.

There are many teachers who want to teach their student i a specific material. In my opinion a lot of mathematik teachers have a very good knowledge about their subject but theycan't really relate with their students. So this is the reason, why many students have a problem with math or hate it. THereby they have a very good knowledge tey can't manage that their is a good atmossphere in class. 
Another problem is when the teachers can't relate with their students, that the stuff takes much longer than when the teacher and the students have a good relation. 

Other people say that it is more important that the teachers should have a good knowledge about their subject. The main goal of the school is to learn things in different areas, not to have a good atmossphere with the teachers. 
Another reason is, that we don't see the teachers so much because we have in every subject an other teacher. So it isn't so dramatic if we don't like the teachers.

All in all i think there are for both sides adantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion it's much more important to have a good relatio between students and teachers. It's much more easier to learn things in this case.
