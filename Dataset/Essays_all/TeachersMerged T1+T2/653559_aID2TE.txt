What makes a good teacher? The ability to realte well with students or excellent knowledge?
On the one hand a teacher clearly must be very skilled in his or her subject because otherwise, he or she won't be able to explain and answer questions asked by students and it makes no sense to be a teacher if you don't understand your subject. Also, a skilled teacher has the respect of his class, which is essential for good lessons because only if the students take the teacher for serious, they can truly learn something from him or her. 
On the other hand, it is very important that a teacher can relate well with the students because otherwise, he or she won't be able to explain his subject in a way the students understand. After having studied in an University, a many people forget, that there are a lot of others who aren't as fast as them in grasping content of their subject. They are in an ivory tower and therefore can't be good teachers. So it is important that a teacher doesn't forget about how it was to be a young student and how it feels to not understand. The teacher must teach with empathy so the students won't have the feeling that they are stupid and that it doesn't matter wether they try or don't try to understand.
So I think both abilities are essential for being a good teacher for the reason that one of the abilities is nothing without the other.
