I can not agree with the statement ,beeing very interseting for a student in my age, because the two abilitys are both extremly important for a teacher if he/she does not have mastered both abilitys they should not be allowed to teach any student anything. 
First of all pupils spend a big amount of their time in school for 9 to 13 years in Germany so the teachers need to have good skills in relating with students. Many students see their teachers as an example for a well educated grown up person and so they want to be as well educated and socialy skilled as them too. Im saying that teachers have a very big impact on the later live of a student beeing the persons that the students see for a very long time of their live nearly every day. But if a teacher does not know his own subject as well as he should the students learn many wrong things that could have a effect on their later lives aswell considering the search for a job. So i can say that a teacher has to be very well educated in social skills aswell as in his subject wether it beeing math, geographie, religion or sports because if they lack any of the latter they could ruin many lives or at least make many things alot more complicated for the students in later live as it should be. 
As for my opinion i think we have too many teachers that dont have any knowledge about children or teenagers and their development in age but also alot of teachers that have old knowledge of their subjects or no knowledge about the modern technology which is very important in this time. I can not say more about this statement because there is no point in discussing the importance of the two abilitys because they are both very important.
