A teacher needs knowledge of his subject to teach well. He needs also to be able to explain good and clear. If "to relate" is understood with students like him because he doesn't give homework or he can well with students because he know how to talk and work with them, thats a big differents.
It's good when the teacher knows a lot and can answer answer the quetions asked by the students. But if he can't use his knowledge because he's too busy to control the class and keep them calm, it doesn't work for both. 
A point is that teachers often uses grammar and excercises books to work with. And there are so many different books, it's complicate to choose a good one which is interessting and supportive for the class. To choose a right book it need that th teacher has a good relation to the students and knows how they want to learn.
It's better if he relates well with the students and can explain and make it easier to understand english, than knowing the most complicate grammar.
To conclude, I agree and think it's better when the teacher can explain and create a good english lesson, whether he had excellent marks in his studytime and doesn't relate well with the students because he can't teach.
