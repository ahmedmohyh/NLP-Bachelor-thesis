The main subject is about if a techer's ability to relate well with students is more important than execellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
There are a many scientists which are working with this subject. Now I will give my reasons for agree and disagree this statement.
  
My secound opinion is if the teacher teach you well, you don't have to study at home for long because you understand quickly at school or you can ask the teacher if you don't understand.

In contrast a teacher's ability to relate well with students is also a little bit important. If a teacher teach you well but she don't show motivation to you and blaim on you, I think you don't have motivation to listen to her. 

At least I disagree that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of th subject being taught. Better marks will bring succes in your future. If you lern well you will reach your top. So the future of you are in teacher's hand how they teach you.
