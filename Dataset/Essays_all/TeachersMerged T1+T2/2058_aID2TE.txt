The topic of this essay is " A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught." 
This statement isn't that stupid. It is very important, that the teacher and the student have a good connection to each other. We all know that: When we had a teacher who knew everything about for example math and about the specific topic there was taught at the moment, but he could't explain it to the students he or she was teaching, it was so bad like he would't have knewn anything about this topic. I don't want to say, that the only thing teachers should be is friendly. The teacher should be good imformed about his or her subject and should have studied that. So it is very important too, that the teacher has an exellent knowledge about the subject he is teaching! What a shame would it be, when the students would know more about the subject, than the teacher. This is the worst case that can happen. 
A perfect teacher should have the exellent knowledge about his topic and should have a good relation to the students. This is the best way for the student to get the important knowledge on the smartest and easiest way. 
I disagree with this statement, but not comlpetely. It is very importabt, that the theacher is able to relate well with students, but when he doesn't know a bit about the subject this isn't enought. In my opinion the teacher should have the perfect knowledge and have a perfect relation to his students. Otherwise would the students don't have fun while learning. And this is the most important fact of all. Student should be happy to go to school and to learn something new. 
That is the best way to learn effectively.
