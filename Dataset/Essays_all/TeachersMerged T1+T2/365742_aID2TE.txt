From my own experience with the many teachers I've had, is that a certain sympathy between teacher and student should exist. If a teacher has good relations with his students and they trust and respect him, they will learn faster, better and easier. If they have no relation to the teacher and he's just standing there, talking for 45 minutes and then leaves, the students cannot really build up trust and that sympathy that makes learning easier. If learning and studying makes fun, then you'll learn things easier, that's a truth. And if the teacher can relate with the students he knows how they feel and can make it easier for them to understand things, and that makes them more comfortable.

On the other hand, a teacher needs a certain knowledge to teach. If a teacher doesn't know his subject well, then he cannot explain things as good. And that results in the students not understanding what he's trying to explain to them. So the teacher shoud really know his "stuff". The better he knows it the better he can explain it. 

In conclusion I think that a combination of knowledge and good relation to the students should be the properties of a good teacher. A teacher's ability to relate well with his students is only going to help if the teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. If that knowledge is given, then the ability to relate well to students is a must to teach things easily to the students and make it more understandable for them.
