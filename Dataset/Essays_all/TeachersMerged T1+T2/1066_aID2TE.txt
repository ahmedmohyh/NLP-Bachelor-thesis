Often I heard a student complain about that his teacher can not explain. But is it really more importend to be a good communicater than to know all the subjects facts?

First of all every teacher should be confident in his/her class, which they teach. Somethimes students have a question not related to this piticular topic and for me it is important that the teacher can give the student a good and corrct anwer. We also want that our doctor know how to heal us. 
But it is also very important that the teacher is  good in explaining his material, because there is nothing more frustrating than just to dont understand what the teacher is talking about. Another skill what a teacher should have is, that he/she is able to facinate the students. 
If there is one topic and two different teacher present this topic, the first one does it really boring on his own in front of the class without letting the class ask any question, with a lot work by their own and quite later on and the second one interacts with the students maybe starts with a mind map to collect the thoughts to the topic or even with a short film the students will enjoy the second one way more. 
But not even that they will also lear way more, because for them the whole topic is more interesting and they learn already more by just listening to the teacher .
This is way I think that the skill to relate well with the students is more importend than to know every small detail to it, because what can you achieve with this grat knowlege when nobody is listening to you. Of couse can the teacher not be to easy with the students that they still respect him/her. And also the fact, that of course he/she knows what they are talinkg about and teach the correct stuff is important, but should not be a skill is should be clear.
And when the students than realice that they really like this class they can still go to university and learn every small detail about this topc.
