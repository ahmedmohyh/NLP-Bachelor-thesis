The world's society today is built on education. To be able to do a job one has to be educated, first in a basic and widespread way, later specifically for his job. Our abilities are highly related to what we learn in our time in school, because there we learn to differentiate, interpretate and connect our knowledge. Teachers are here to teach us those abilities. In our system their job is to pass on their knowledge to us students. But what abilities are more important for a teacher? Is it more having excellent knowledge or is it being able to connect with students?

First it can be of importance to know more about the subject than it is taught, because if there are questions not concerning the material directly but it would be interesting to know, a teacher should know most of the answers.

In contrary teachers have to study the subject they teach at university. They should have a better knowledge than every student they have. But also if teachers only had a good knowledge on the subject but not extremely detailed, it would be enough to teach the basics.
The ability to connect with the students, to motivate them to learn not only for grades but because they are interested in the subject can substantial.

This question is basically about whether being a teacher should be directly relied to having extremely good knowledge or if people that are not totally familiar with the subject should be also able to teach it. I think gaining the class to take part actively in class is far more important, because then they are far more willing to learn than if they just "have to do it" for their grades.
