Nowadays there are a lot of similar discussions about the relationship between a teacher and his students. There is always the question about the perfect teacher and how he should create his lessons, so that the students like to visit his lessons and also learn much about a topic. In my opinion it is more important that the teacher can biuld a  good relationship with the students and a happy and good atmoshpere as well.
I guess students who feel good and concentrated and especially who feel that the teacher take their problems serious, can learn better and are more motivated. if your teacher has an excellent knowledge ofthe topic but he can`t tell you the topic in an easy way, so that you understand everything, you can`t learn this and you have to study it all by yourself. In that case you can ask yourself, what is the porpose of a teacher then?
In my point of view I can talk about my own experiences with different sorts of teachers but my class and i, always liked the one the most, who could talk to us like a friendand who understood also our point of view, when we had a problem with him. But i would like to add that it`s also very important to have a big knowledge of the topic as a teacher. Obviously a perfekt mixture of knowledge and relate well with students is the aim, which every good teacher should work for.
In conclusion I fell it`s definetly more important that a teacher can relate well with students than to have just knowledge, which he can`t teach the students in a good way. Because every teacher should want to have the aim, that their students can learn in a nice way of them and this is just possible with the ability of relate well with students or the miture of both.
