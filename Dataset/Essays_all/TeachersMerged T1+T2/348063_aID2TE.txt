In this essay I would like to argument about the more important skill for a teacher: the ability to relate well with students or the knowledge of the subject which the teacher is teaching. 
The ability to relate well with the students creates a lot of confidence at the students. They like to go to the classes with the teacher who understands them. 
Another argument pro the relationship student/teacher is less stress during the lessons. If I take myself for example, I love the teachers who listen to me and I value that with a lot of answers to their question.
I think, a teacher who can relate well or better with the students can explain them things better because he understands their problems. 
On the other hand, a teacher with excellent knowledge makes very rare faults. He teaches the students the subject very well and can answer all their questions.
If the students have a problem, he is the man who solves it. With an excellent knowledge he can teach the students the backgrounds of the subjects. 
But excellent knowledge doesn't mean, he can teach the subject very well. He has to explain a subject that he knows a lot of to students who hear the first time of it. So he has to find easy reasons and a easy language to explain the students the subject with good arguments. That is a challenge. 
The problems of a teacher with a good abilty to relate with students has similar problems. He has to teach a subject with his better relationship to the students and sometimes the only thing that counts is the knowledge. Maybe, he cannot answer every question. 

In conclusion I think the most important is to have both, a good relationship with the students and an excellent knowledge. I like the teachers which I can better relate to but I learn more from the teacher with the better knowledge. Generally, every teacher has a bit of both abilitys.
