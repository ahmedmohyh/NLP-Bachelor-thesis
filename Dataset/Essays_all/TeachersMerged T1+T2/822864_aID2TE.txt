Essay Teachers

If the teacher has a good relationship to the students they will have more fun to learn and the students will use their knowledge which they have learnt in the future. Another positive aspect is that there are less problems in the classroom. For example if you discuss a topic and a student has a problem to understand something. A better relationship helps that the student can ask his question. Another pro is that in the future it isn't so important to know all details of a topic. You learn much more if you learn to have a good relation to a person than knowing the topic excellently. ¨

A big con is the aspect that the teacher could become a person who only wants a good relation with the students. So the teacher might forget his primary task to teach Students. It's also important for the students to know a topic exactly for example if they want to go to another school like an university. There they have to know the topics excellent to pass the final exams. It could also happen that a row starts in the classroom. So the techer will use their subjective opinion and not the objective site to solve the problem. Or another situation: Maybe a teacher prefers a students. If this teacher has a good relationship to this student he or she will give him better marks or support this student more than the others.

I think you shoud make a compromise. It's important to know many topics excellent, But it is also important to have a good relation to the students because they should have fun to learn it. Otherwise they will have no fun and they would never use their knowledge in the future. But the relationship should also be not to strong to avoid conflicts.
