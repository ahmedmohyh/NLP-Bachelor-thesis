The following text is about the question if a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Against this statement stands the argument that the children have to be taught how to get along with people they do not like and at the same time do work for themselves and their future. You could for example have a bad boss in your future job as well but since you want to earn money, you have to get along well with him. In addition the pupil do not learn enough when the teacher does not have the needed knowledge about the topics.
Against this argument stands that the teachers all went to the university or other schools to get their jobs and they have a plan what they need to teach the students. This means that they will get enough knowledge being taught in school definitely. A good relation to the teacher also makes the lessons more fun and the people want to go to school. If I personally look into the faces of my classmates, I can see the total boredness and sometimes I can surely agree. So if there is a bad relation to the teacher, the students just do not want to learn and then the best knowledge in the subject will not help at all. 
This is why a good relation to the teacher is so important and not just everyone should be able to become a teacher when they do not get along well with children. The best way would be if the teacher just understands the students well, has fun and a good class climate and in the end brings the excellent knowledge to the children anyway. The problem is that I have not met many teachers who can make school fun. You should also criticise the school system itself then but that is another topic.
