I think that a teacher has to be able to do many different things to be a good teacher. First, he needs to know the subject that he's teaching and he needs to explain it in a way that students understand what he's saying. In additionto that, he needs to be like a friend to students because students can learn much more efficiently if they like the person who's teaching the subject. 
The statement above is a bit strange because it states that it's not important for a teacher to know the subject that he's teaching. So it's a bit ironic that teachers have to go to school for a very long time and once they are a teacher, all the time spent in school is more or less useless if the only important thing is that they are good with people.
My opinion is that it depends how old the students of the teacher are. If they are very young, maybe in primary school, the teachers knowledge of the subject isn't important. But if they teach at a middle school or at a university it's very important that they know what the're talking about and their behavious towards students isn't that important because they are much older and more independent.
All in all I say that i neither agree nor disagree with the statement because it depends on the age of the students.
