A teacher has many different jobs to do in order to have success at his job. From a student's view it's hard to compare these two statements because not every student needs the same treatment from his teacher.

 It is very fundamental that a teacher can relate well with his students because a main goal during class is to make the students feel comfortable and in order to reach that goal you have to be able to understand how to treat the younger people. It should be clear that teaching isn't that easy as it looks. There are day's when you are stressed from thing's beside your school and when it comes to this point it is vital to keep calm and still try to give your best. 

On the other hand, you can't teach well without a knowledge of the subject. You can be as good in explaining and speaking but without the right amount of knowledge you won't teach that much. It often happens that a stundent asks something explicit and in order to give the right answer you need to be an expert in the subject. Being intelligent isn't everything, even if you know every rule in maths without rethoric you are screwed up. The formula for good teaching is a mix of both. 

As long as you fully understand what the students have to learn, i think that the relationship between the students and the teacher is more important than an excellent knowledge. This has a simple reason: you can know everything about a subject but if your style of teaching makes students bored during class you will make them not wanting to go to school anymore and as a consequence you will be marked as a bad teacher.

If you don't want to become a "bad" teacher then you should train your skills in teaching first before you try to rise your knowledge of a subject.
