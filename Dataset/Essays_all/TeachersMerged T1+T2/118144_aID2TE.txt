There are many arrcuments to support this statement. A teacher should have pedagocicaly experiences for teaching students. In fact they should have both. Knowledge and ability to relate well with students. When a person didn't have any knowledge then he/she couldn't be a teacher. This is the base of being a teacher. So you have to had a basically knowledge, when you want to be a teacher at a school. But on the other side it is also very helpful when you have a good pedagocically experience because you have to relate well with the students and they have to accept you and you have to accept hem. So when a student has forgotten his homework or didn't know the answer of your question it isn't the best idea that you punish them so hard. It would be better that you talk to them normally and ask why he hasn't done his homework or said him that he should have to ask when anything isn't clear in the lesson. 
In my opinion it is more important that you have a good relationship with the students as a teacher and you understand them really well. This is the base for being a teacher. Of corse you have to know the things about your subject that you theach and that you can give the students your knowledge for the exams and the university later. This is shurely very important too. So in fact a teacher has to know the things about his/her subject but on the other side he/she has to be nice and good to the students.
