Every student has one. "One what?" you're asking, a favorite teacher. But is it more important to have a good relation between students and teachers than having a teacher with huge knowledge?

First of all, about which kind of students are we talking? I guess it would make a huge difference if we'd analysed the situation between primary school kids and the students we are (however this educational way is called in english...). So for this essay I want to focus on us.

I think iIf you are having a teacher you like, you most likely looking forward to his lessons. This is very good, becuase it means that you are motivated. And it sure has a reason why you like him, so he's probably funny or just very kind. So you going to laugh a bit in the lessons which means, you are havin fun. Again, this is very motivating for students. But there is one problem; even if you are the most motivated person in earth, it doesn't help you a bit if the content of the lesson is bad.

The other teacher may not be as sympathic as the other one, but he knows what he's doing. If you are having any questions, he sure knows the answer. Also I think teachers which know what they are doing, or better said, what they are teaching can help you much better with learn. Because they know what is important. They can tell you what to learn and how to learn it easily.

So yeah, probably a teacher is a bit harder to you and he's not making jokes all the time but I guess he's helping you more with giving you great content then having a good relation to you. I mean, you're in school, you want to educate, this should be your primary goal. And if you also have a good relation to the teacher(s), that's great. But still, I would rather focus on content than on the relation.
