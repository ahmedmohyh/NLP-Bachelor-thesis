Firstable if you don't have the knowledge the subjet can^t be taught. For example if someone is teacher in maths and he has its problems with it how can it teach the students? He can't. Someone who hasn't the knowledge can't be a teacher. If the teacher is unreliable the students are not going to like the class anymore, it just pisses them of, not more or less. In one hand if the students think they can not learn anything from the teacher, they maybe will not come to classe anymore. "Why wasting my time for this?" will they think eventually.

In the other hand to have the ability to relate to them is a good point for the students. If they can relate with him , they will come to the class with smile and enjoy it together. A fact is that the students learn better if they like it and this feeling gives the teacher will the ability to relate. This kind of teachers can help his students with social problems and are more often with him than with other teachers or even students. To relate to the students makes it easier to taught the something and they are going to learn it for 100%!

So knowledge is good, the ability to relate is better;)!
