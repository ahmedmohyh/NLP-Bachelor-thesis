I think everyone had at least one cool and young teacher he/she really liked but didn't really learned a lot during his lessons. Of course, also everyone had (probably quit a lot of) boring, unsypathetic theachers that really knew theyr subject and torchered the class with lessons alike the ones they give in university. Although almost everyone preferes the first type of theachers, they somehow seem to not be able to really teach theyr students a lot. 
So to be able answer which type of teacher is preferable, it depends under which subject you ask. If you want to learn a lot, go to the second one. The probem with the second one is, that his lesson almost bores you to death and studying for a teacher like that will feel like a torcher method from the middle ages. The cool and relating teacher on the other hand will be able to make the lesson interesting and maybe fun, even studying for his subject probably won't be to hard. the thing is that at the end of the semester your still have the knowledge from the beginning because he wasn't hard enough on you. 
I believe it is important for a teacher to both know his subject well and to be able to be relate to the students. Like that you enjoy visiting his lessons but still take some knowledge from it. Especally in gymnasium this seems to be an issue. Most of the teachers studied theyr subject but never leard a lot about the way of teaching. But i the younger the teacher, the less this seems to be problematic. Maybe this is because theyr age gap is smaller than from the older teachers and so they can be more apathetic.
