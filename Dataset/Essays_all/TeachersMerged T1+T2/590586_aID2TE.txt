Teacher are the most important people in school. They are responsible to teach studants the relevant subjects. So, they have to explain it to the students in an understanding way.

Mostly the relationship between a teacher and a student in school has influence in their ability to learn. It is said that teacher who don't relate well with their students they have issues to get the knowledge about the subject. For example when the teacher always screams at them for not making homework and embaraces them for not knowing the answer to his question, then it causes bad air between teacher and student. In this case the students suffer from this and it is shown in their exams.

The best way to teach students the subject is to relate well with them. If teacher help them with exercises and explain it again and again to them, it will generate a better knowledge of the subject. This causes that parents are more happy because of their children's better marks, also teacher and students themself can profite. With better marks children are able to go on better schools and will get a good job in their future.

In my opinion the relationship between teacher and students are very important, because there may be a negative effect of student's knowledge if teacher aren't able to teach them in a wright way only because of a bad condition.
