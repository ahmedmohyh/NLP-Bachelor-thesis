Education is one of the most important parts in our life. Because of that many people discuss about how students have the best chance to learn. Some of them think a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In my opinion both aspects are correct.

Because students can't learn, if they only hear facts and don't really get interressted. The teacher should be motivated and love to teach students. However he should also know his subject. For example I had a teacher, who was motivated and he was very famous in school, because of he had a good connection to the students. But he had no structur in his lessons and when the school year had ended, the students had no idea about what they actually learned in his lessons. So a good connection to students is good, but the knowledge shoundn't miss either. 

So all in all I think when a teacher really loves his job, he will combinate the motivation aspect with his knowledge. Because then the students have the best chance to learn and maybe to have fun with this subject.
