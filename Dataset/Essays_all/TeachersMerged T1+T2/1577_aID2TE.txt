Is it more important for teachers to relate well with their students or to have excellent knowledge of the subject he taughts? In the following I will discuss this question.

Nowadays many teacher have a good connection to their students and that is very important, beacause the students have no problems to talk to the teacher about personal problems. The teacher is like a person they can talk to, aside of their parents. When they for example  have problems with their parents or in school. But the main part of a teachers work is to teach the students and they should learn in school about the subject he teaches and not just have a nice teacher, who does not have excellent knowledge of their subject.
On the one hand it is good to have a friend in your teacher, but on the other hand it could influence the grades he gives the student or could even lead to, that the students do not have a lot of respect for the teacher.
A good connection to the teacher, could motivate the students to work more active in these classes, for example in group projects. One argument you can not ignore is, that you are in school to learn for your future and in your job your boss is not interested if you had a good connection to your teacher, but what you learned in school.

To put everything into a nutshell I think, that it is more important to have a teacher, who has excellemt knowledge of his subject, than to have a good connection to your teacher, because it is totally unimportant for your future. In the best case a teacher would have a good relationship with their students and have excellent knowledge of the subject, they teach.
