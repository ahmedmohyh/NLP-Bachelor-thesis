I think it is very important for a teacher to relate well with his/her students than excellent knowledge of the subject because it is better to like the teacher and his/her lessons. It makes more fun when you get along with the teacher and have fun in class. But when he/she go straight with the subject and beeing very strict than the lesson is very boring and the students don´t want to learn. Sometimes it is better to be strict because the students learn more but not every students like it. 
But not everytime it is this way e.a. my math teacher get along with us student very well and he is also very nice but he doesn´t teach us well. Most of us don´t understand the theme and he doesn´t understand why we are so bad at math. So both points of the statment are (for me) very important for a teacher.

Although I stand between of agree and disagree I think I agree to this because I learned more and better from teachers I like and get along with him/her than from teachers I don´t like and don´t get along with him/her. It was quiet easier to learn thing when the atmosphere in class is good and not bored or bad. Also I had a favorite teacher but he isn´t at this school anymore but his lessons were my favorite lessons every week and I was glad to have him at this time I had also because of him very good grades. His lessons were diffrent everytime and weren´t boring (biology). The did everytime experiments and he taught us in a funny way so everybody understand it and sometimes I miss this in other subjects. 
So I think every teacher has to have the ability to relate to students but also the knowledge of the subject.
