In our modern world school seems to be the most important thing for every child that's older than seven years. At least in many parents' opinions. Since education is so important in our system, naturally teachers are too. But what makes a good teacher? Is it the ability to relate to students or rather their excellent knowledge of the subject they teach?

On one hand, teachers are supposed to be excellent at the subject they're teaching, otherwise there would be no need for teachers and the parents could educate their children on their own. If a teacher wasn't good at the subject he was teaching, what exactly would he be teaching? He would possibly be spreading false informations, not knowing the truth himself. Also, he probably wouldn't be able to provide help to students with complicated questions, possibly harming their motivation to work since their teacher wouldn't even understand what they're doing.

On the other hand, teaching shouldn't be about telling students truths without discussing the matter. A good teacher should be able to understand the students feelings and to dicuss the subject to let the students have their own opinion but to guide them into the right direction. If a teacher was unable to relate to his students, he would be unable to teach, since he wouldn't understand the difficulties of his students and therefore wouldn't be able to explain the subject in a way the students would understand. These issues would eventually lead to the students losing their motivation to learn and the teacher wouldn't be able to fulfill his duty.

In conclusion, a perfect teacher should have both, an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught as well as the ability to relate to his students. However since no one is perfect, a good knowledge of the subject, an open mind and the ability to understand and relate to students would make a very good teacher.
