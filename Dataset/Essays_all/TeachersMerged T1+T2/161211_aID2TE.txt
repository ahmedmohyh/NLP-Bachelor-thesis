Every year children start with school. First they vist the Kindergarten and then the middle school and in the end the highschool. This is the maine system in almost every Country.

The Human beeing is born to learn and will learn until he or she will die. Learning could be in their volunteer time or how it is use to be at school. In people lives it is all about learning. We want a huge amount of knwoledge to be the greatest, to be intelligent to knwo everything, but what about how we are taught? In fact this is more imortant than have an excellent knwoledge. It is not all about learing jsut fact. What really matters is how we treat with our opposite and how we speak to them and how we are to them. In schools we also learn to be social with humans. We learn how to have respect from others, confidence and acceptance of other beeings.

In my oppinion in schools we learn more than it seems to be. We do not just learn facts of nature. We learn to share to act right in a conflict and so on. In school we have almost every situation a human could have in his future life. School prepares us to be able to live in this world.
