It is important to have a good relationship with the students. A teacher's ability to relate well with students helps to have a better learning atmosphere in the classroom and to reach a better motivation of learning. Also a good relation with the teacher helps to have an activ lesson. When a teacher relate well with students it helps to have a relation and to support them better. Also the grades get better because the motivation of the students is bigger with a teacher who relates to the students than a teacher which doesn't care for the students.

But it is also important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject. When there is no knownledge it is difficult to teach thm and help them to get better grades. When the students notice that the teacher hasn't got an excellent knowledge of the subject they don't respect him and doesn't give him the fullest attention.

I think it is important for the development of the students that the teacher relates well with the students. But it is also important that the teacher has a good knowledge of the subject so he can teach better and the students make better developments. For the results I think the realtion with the teacher is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject because a teacher which relates well with the students can motivate them better for learning than a teacher which only has an excellent knowledge.
