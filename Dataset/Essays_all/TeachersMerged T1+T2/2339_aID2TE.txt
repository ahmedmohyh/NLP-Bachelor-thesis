Yes,I agree with that statement.Excellent knowledge is important to run a class but the most important thing is that the teacher or all teachers relate well with their students,because then the whole atmosphere for the students AND the teacher is better and for the most part the students will have more fun in class.
A bad relation to the students could mean they don´t want to learn and/or won´t concentrate anymore;and I don´t think the teacher wants that.In my opinion it is better to have a good relation between teacher and student but not such a good class than having a good class but having nobody really liking the theacher.It would be perfect to have a good relation to each other and excellent knowledge of the subject.For the most part that´s actually true but sometimes in some classes you have a problem with your teacher and you think you don´t like him but at the end of the day all is perfectly fine again.
Of course it depends to the students if the teacher likes them or not.And if the students missbehave they will feel it by the teacher by shouting at them or most likely getting extra homework and next lesson they think twice about missbehaving again.But on the other side sometimes the TEACHER doesn´t act right and then it´s his fault students don´t like him.Luckily it´s possible for the students to talk to him about the problem then and if the taecher ignores them rhey could also talk to the "director" of the school.
