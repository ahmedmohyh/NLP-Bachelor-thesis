She's standing in the front and she's talking about a bored dead human whose name was Louis XIV. and nobody is listening. I hope she's going to leave the school before i gratuate. Something similiar could pass in a head of a student who don't like the teacher who is standing in front of the class. Is it really important to have a good relationship between students and teacher?

The ability to relate well with students is really important for a successful schoolyear because by likeing the teacher the time pass faster and the students skip less schoollessons. In the first high school year I had a great teacher who made sometimes jokes during the lessons and made us laughing and forgetting the schoolstuff for a second. The lessons passed very fast. It was like the time was flying away. 

In the opposite if a teacher doesn't have any idea about the schoolstuff he should teach then he's sitting at the wrong place. Without the knowledge teacher and students are loosing time. An intelligent teacher who press everything in the brain of a student like people in a crowded elevator with the time the sudents are going to skip school because they feel unwell and starts hating the materia.

At the end I'm arriving at the point by saying that a good relationship between students and teacher the stundent didn't skip school. By explaining important points in a funny way the students are going to memorise the points better and pay more attention during a lesson. And so also the half part for preparing an exam at home is done. I'm also the opinion that if a students likes a class depents on the teacher's ability to relate with students.
