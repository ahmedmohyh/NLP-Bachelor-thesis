In my oppinion this matter depends on whom the teacher is teaching.
There is a difference between being a professor and giving lectures to students at University or if this person does his daily work with children in primary school. 
With the latter I agree with the statement. When children are that young, it is most important that the teacher is able to keep the children willing to lern and to make them like school, because these first years are 
quite significant so the pupils attitude towards school his entire life. 
One neccessarity that in my oppinion must be furfilled on these terms is that the elementary school teacher has to be able to relate well to his pupils. 
On the other hand for the first, I find the situation can be the opposite. In lectures students don't really care about this ability of relating. Their main goal is to lern as much as the they can, so the professor should have good knowledge of the subject he teaches,so his relating abilities are not the most important ones, although every student big and small appreciates most a teacher with both knowledge and relating ability.

For me, I would prefer a teacher who shows and shares his feelings with the class and and understands me and my class mates.
