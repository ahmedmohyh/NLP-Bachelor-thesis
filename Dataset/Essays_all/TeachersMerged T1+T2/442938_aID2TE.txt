Every teacher has its own caracteristics, some stand in front of the class and just talk about the subject, they have to teach us about. Other ones build a relationship to the students and care about the students qualities. But is a good relationship to student more important as an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

An excellent knowledge of the subject has its advantages. All of the questions, that the students might have, could be answered without any doubt and the class itself could be more interesting. The teacher himself/herself takes advantages of his knowledge and he/she can use them all the time, because its something they love to talk about.
But do the teachers really need an excellent knowledge to teach the students what they need to know?

On the other hand does the teacher have to build a relationship to the students? I think it is very important to know the students personally. A lot of teachers don't even know their students by name, which is probably a sign to the students that the teachers don't take them serious. The students, as a consequence, won't follow the class properly. If you have a pretty good relationship to the students you can help them where they need help and also bring another atmosphere to the class.

Personally I can say that pretty decent knowledge of the subject as well as the ability to relate well to the students is both important. But if you don't build a relationship to the students and the classes, that you give are too theoretical, the students could loose interest. This is why I think a good relationship to the students is maybe a little more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject.
