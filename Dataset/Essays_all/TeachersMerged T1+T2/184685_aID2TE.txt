I think, based on my own experience, that it is very important to have a good conection to the teacher. Which means if you are not on the same wavelengh with you teacher it is much more difficult to motivate yourself for studying. If the teacher can relate to his students, he can also create a more specific lesson and can probably give more useful information for the students. The students can also remember the subject better. But thats only if the teacher knows something about the subject being taught.
In contrast I really think that if a teacher is seen as a friend only and knows not very much about a subject, it is better to have a teacher with an excellent knowledge and one's not a friend with every single student. Because you can not learn something from a teacher that is only friendly and has the ability to relate well with students. He has to know at least a bit about the subject and in addition knowing how to animate the students.
In conclusion I would say that this statement can not be taken too serious, because to be a good teacher there has to be a mix of both. Having the ability to relate well with student and having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But I can imagine that it is very difficult for a teacher to be in balance and also not being too much a friend. Because if a teacher is seen too much as a friend, he is no longer a person of respect. In addition we can not always have everything. So if I have to choose between a teacher being my friend, understand me as a person and not knowing much about the topic or a teacher knowing very much about the subject but having not quiet a good realtion to the students, I would choose the second one. Because I am at school to learn and not to be friends with my teacher. And to find motivation there are several other ways.
