Excellent knowledge or the right chemistery?

Often are the students in the lesson and the only thaught they have is "why is our teacher such a d...?" My little motivation for the school is often gone when  I see such a teacher. But when I see a teacher that i like is the chance bigger that I listen to him. But which one is better? Maybe is excellent knowledge the better oportunity.
Let's compare this the subjects. In my oppinion is the teacher with excellent knowledge not so bad. But why? Because a teacher is not your friend and he has just the job to teach you something. The problem is just that sometimes he has a negative appereance. But when you try to lisen in the lessons maybe it will work well. 
On the other side there is the teacher with well ability's to realte with his students. He lisents what they want and they can cooperate very well. But this has also a bad side. If the teacher is so friendly, kind or someting like that. He could probably appear like a friend and that could end up bad. Maybe you start to make too much jokes with the teacher and suddenly you does not take him serious anymore. 
The excellent knowledge teacher had the same kind of problem when he appears to be unfriendly or such things. This is also a problem that should have his acceptance. My father would say to this that the only way is the "golden middle" 
The teacher should be a bit of both. He should have knowledge and good ability to realte well with students. But in my oppinion he should be more the teacher with well ability's to realte with students because we the students would never need the whole knowledge of the teacher. He has a huge knowledge and we just need a part of it.
