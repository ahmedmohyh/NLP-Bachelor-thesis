Who don't know the teacher who has an excellent knowledge of the subjekt he teaches, but at the same time he is mad and no one likes him. Who also don't know the teacher who is very nice and everyone likes to go to school if he teach the subject. Now the question is, which of this two charakters or kind of teachers are for the students better?

It's important that you understand the subject you teach, that you can answers to specific questions. You can't teach something you don't understand by yourselfs. 
On the other side the students go to school with more funn if they have an teacher who can relate well with his students. If students have a teacher who see the problems they have and can support them the marks will get better and better.

I think it's important that the teacher has a ability to relate well with his student, specialy in the primary and secondary school. If the students haven't a teacher with thes character, they dont like to go to school and have no good marks. So they can't or don't like to go to the highschool. In the highschool the teachers have to have an excellent knowledge of the subject he's being taught. Othervice the students can't learn now stuff. But they should treat the students well and fair and they should support the students if they have problems. Sn my opinion a theacher between thes two characters is the best.
