My first argument for this statement is, that everyone has to be nice and friendly to other people. So a teacher also has to be it. If a teacher is unfriendly to the students, it could be that students dont want to come to school anymore, because they are scared.
My first argument against this statement is, that it is very important to learn something in school. This is the job of the teacher, so he has to do this well. He has to know what he teach and this should be right. 
I thing a teacher has to be friendly and the relation of a teacher and a student have to be good, but it is also important that a teacher taught good, because its important fot student to become later a good job too. So I do not agree with this statement, beacause if the teacher is very friendly and nice to the students but he can not teach, students learn nothing and this is not the job of a teacher.
