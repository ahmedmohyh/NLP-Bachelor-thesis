Basically, I think that the task of a teacher is to give students a good preparation for life and to what will expect them in it. That should be as reality-near as possible by giving you a chance for finding some work that intersts the student but also by giving the students a sort of education. 

On the one hand a teacher who is unable to communicate well with students obwiously then isn't a very good teacher. But you still have to think of the fact that all students are very different from each other so that not everyone understands things the same way. Some sort of communicating may work for part of the students, but still not for all of them. It is then primordial that a teache rdoesn't just try to communicate alwys the same way, but that he tries to interact with all of the students on equal bases. 

On the other hand a teacher who is for example communicating perfectly with all ohf his or her students but still doesn't have any knowledge at all of the subject he or she sould be teaching may not be the good teacher eighter.

So in my oppinion it is nor communication nor knowledge that makes a good or a less good teacher. An ideal teacher results from the combination of both of them and, additionally, has the ability to give the students entousiasme for his or her subject. The very important thing I think is that student love to come to the teachers lesson an dat the end of it have the impreesion to having learnt soneting about useful. There is noting more frustrating that having the impression of beeing stting around and waisting time on a thing you don't understand or that doen't mean anything t oyou at all.
