There are two types of teachers nowadays, those who are absolute experts in their field and those who have more of a friendly relationship towards their students. But which is the more important? 

Many students argue that their teachers don't understand them, which demotivates many students from going to school. If the teacher has the ability to relate to their students,it often makes the motivation for school a lot larger. Whereas a teacher who is more interested in the subject they teach, rather than supporting their students, can often demotivate many students not so keen on the topic.

Teachers who are more invested in their students also seem to be more admired. The students view them rather as a friend and although the teacher may not have excellent knowledge on the subject being taught, the teacher can together with the students further explore the topic. But being seen as more of a friend can also become rather challenging. Students will not always give this type of teacher the respect they should deserve. Students won't always do their homework since they think that they won't get into trouble anyway.    

Also if the motivation, love and detailed understanding from a teacher for a certain subject is visible, it often reflects onto the students. Whereas if another teacher is invested into the student's lives but themself doesn't enjoy and fully grasp the subject they teach, they can't possibly motivate the students to put in a lot of work.

In conclusion, either sort of teacher brings certain good and bad aspects with them. At the end of the day though, one needs to ask themself what a teacher is there for. Although it helps a lot if the teacher can relate to the students and unerstand their worries, students are in school to learn and to do so they often need to be put under pressure. Therefore it is the best for the students to not be friends with the teacher but to respect them for their knowledge and love for the subject.
