In the following essay i am going to dicuss the question, if exellent knowledge of the subject, or social abilitys are the more important traits of teachers.

On the one hand, the job of the teacher is to teach and prepare the students for their future lifes. If he hasn´t got the knowledge of the subject he won´t be able to prepare the students for their test and exams in an appropriate way. In the end that might even lead to a bad Abitur, what will effect the whole career of the student. 
But especially in the lower classes the learned material is easy to understand and could even be reviewed later if nessesairy. The more important aspect there, is the social aspect like the ability to work in groups and to behave disciplined. 
In addition, the more motivating a teacher is, the more fun will the students have with learning. 

Finally i don´t think you could rate one of the abilities (to relate with students,the exact knowledge of the subject) higher than the other. In my opinion both traits are equally important for a teacher: He might be an expert in his subject, but when he cant relate to the students they won´t learn it properly. As well the connection between teachers and students might be very good, but if he just doesn´t know what he is talking about no one will underrstand. But when he has both his students will be sucessfull.
