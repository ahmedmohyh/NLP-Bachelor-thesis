Teachers

"A teacher`s ability to relate well with studends is more importand than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

The teacher in primary school has a huge influence on students. In some cases the entire future of studends depend on one person- the teacher because a theacher has the ability to eather motivate or demotivate a student. If you have a teacher who is totally in their subject and doesn`t know how to relate with the students it`s just a waiste of time because the studends are going to be demotivatet and you lern the best with emotions. So the whole knowledge it might be the best is just waisted.
But if the teacher can relate with students, can make them calm and listening they are going to really listen what he sais. We need teachers who know what techniques are the best to hold their studends motivated.
Of course it`s very important to know the subject well but in some cases less is just more.
I personally made the experiance of experts teaching their subjekt as kind of a hobby. Maby they know so much more than a "normal" teacher who theach a few more subjects but in some cases they are absolutely catastrophic theachers because they don`t know how to relate with students. For examplen when someone only do the teaching because he can`t gain enough money with his obsession so he has to do another job and in which he isn`t completely in the students will get to know that. It`s just boring when you have a teacher who doesn`t like his job.

As conclusion i would say that a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is much more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Only because of that teachers have to lern pedagogic things and it isn`t easy to get allong with students who alredy hit puberty and doesn`t have the motivation for anything.
So before you decide to become a teacher you have to ask yourself if you are able to put very much effort in your job.
