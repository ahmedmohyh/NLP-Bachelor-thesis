The connection between teachers and their students plays an important role in their motivation, their studying and their grades. A reacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the knowledge of the subject being taught. It has also something to do with the atmosphere a teacher is creating in his room. Students can feel if the teacher is building up a good relation to his students and it makes them enjoying their classes more and it lets them know that their teacher cares about them. Imagine a teacher knowing everything, teaching it to his students without any personal Beteiligung. All the information he is giving them would`nt stay in their minds as good as if he'd showed just a litte humor, trying to relate to the kids. On the other hand having a good relation to his students isn't everything that counts. Personally i think it needs something in between both of it. A teacher must know his subject and does have to build up his knowledge, but he also needs to know how to give it away to others. I think if teachers can have good relations to their classes, sutdent automatically feel more understanded and worth of their time. Its like a subject at school: If you like it and you can relate to it, it lets you being more motivated and more passionate about. As a side effect you may get better grades. Same with the teachers: if you feel that this person is able to relate well wih you, you'll feel a better connection not only to your teacher but to the subject as well. Better grades could be following. In the end, the relation to their teachers affects a important part in the school life of a kid.
