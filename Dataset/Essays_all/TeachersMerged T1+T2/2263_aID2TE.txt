Today I want to give a statement if the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
In my opinion it is very important that the teachers ability is good. The students are more interested into the subject and want to understand the topic and want to learn something new.
When the teachers ability to relate well with the student is good the students are more interested to learn something new.
Otherwise it is also important that the teacher has a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, beacause they students need this knowledge they get in school for the whole life.Therefore it is important that the teachers teach the students well. But iportant is that the students want to lear. That can be possible if the teacher have a good ability to relate well with students.
All in all I would say that the teachers ability to relate well with students is important at all, but is better for the students to learn something. Also the teachers knowledge of the subject being taught is very important so that the students learn something.Both facts are important that students learn very much.
