My math teacher for example is making me feel very uncomfortable eventhough I`m a good student in math. He is doing a good job in explaining all the formulas and so but he is lacking of an important amount of emotional intelligence. He is trying to teach us his subject in a forceful way and tries to make us study more for math by his scary attitude, but what he doesn`t understand is that students don`t study if they simply don`t feel like it. Studying, as bad as it sounds, comes from the inner will, just like all the other things mankind desires. I understand that his intentions are good but he doesn`t seem to understand that his plan is going the wrong way. My history teacher for instance is such an angel. I am not the slightest fan of history but still manage to compete in her class like a pro. I like her more than the subjekt and my whole class tries to not hurt her feelings by studiying hard for every exam just to make her feel statisfied with us. 
To sum up, I`m pretty sure that if a class fails, it`s the teachers fault. You need to feel comfortable around your teachers in order to like the idea of going to school and studying. I never like the idea of going to school on a Wednesday morning because i know my somewhat sadistic math teacher is awaiting me..

P.S. I exaggerated a bit ,so don`t worry about me;), it`s still the truth though.
