The question if the teacher should've a better connection to the students than the knowledge of its topic is a important discussion. In the following essay I'll write about the pro and contra arguments in relation to this topic.
Firstly I think it's really important to have a good connection to your teacher because whenever you've a problem or a question, you should go to your teacher and if you think he won't be nice to you or isn't interested in helping you, you don't ask in the first place and afterwards you'll get a bad mark. Especially a teacher wouldn't be a teacher if he hadn't the knowledge about his subject.
Further points that are speaking for a good relation is that students work better with a teacher who can relate with us. For instance, since we're at this school, we had more or less three different math teachers and with our current math teacher we had a little struggles to relate because we didn't accept her and her art to teach neither did she. And it wasn't important if she has the knowledge of her subject, when we didn't get along.
On the other hand is the knowledge of its subject the most important thing. That's why we're in the school and a too nice teacher or someone who doesn't teach us right is bad. Bad for our future. In addition to this, your teacher isn't your friend. He desn't have to relate with us.
Let's go back so the question at the start. A excellent knowledge is as important as the ability to relate with students. Both of the arguments are needed because without one it, the subject is less interesting and there's a lack of quality.
