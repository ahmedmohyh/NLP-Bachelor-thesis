A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In this essay, I will explain whether or not I agree with this statement and account specific reasons for my opinion.
The ability to relate well with students as a teacher can be defined by how well the teacher knows how to teach. For example, if a biology teacher does not know all species of fungi of the local forest but can teach in a way that fascinates the students, the lesson will be interesting, and the teacher will relate better with his students. This way, it will be beneficial to both teacher and student to be in this lesson, since it will make both parties grow intellectually.
On the other hand, if the teacher only spends time chatting with the students or making up incredible experiments just to fascinate them, the lesson won't be beneficial to the teacher nor to the students, who will not profit of an enriching working environment. Relating well with people is fairly important, but the priority is to teach and not to make friends. By knowing what you are teaching excellently, you will be a reliable source for your students' information.
To conclude, I can tell that the best thing to do is find a balance between relating well with students while being aware of the fact that the priority is to learn something. So, even if as a teacher you do not relate all too well with your students, you might be consolated by the fact that the most important thing is to teach. If this is the case, pay a small amount of attention to how you are teaching. By making small changes, such as not discussing one specific topic too precisely or inventing new experiments, you will see that many students will automatically relate much better to you.
