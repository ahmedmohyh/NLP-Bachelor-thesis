The statement talks about two important points in our school time.

For some students its the ability of the teacher. If they like the teacher then they also like the subject. For example in Chemieit could be a really nice and interessting subject but as soon as the teacher is lazy or doesnt want to have fun teaching this subject then its just the worst subject in the entire week.
 
For the other students they dont want to come along with the teacher they really just want to learn what its all about. Like just said in Chemie. They want to bring those two or more lessons every week behind them and are happy when they recieve a acceptable mark at the test in a subject where they dont like the teacher doesnt matter why.

For myself I just want to understand the subjet and the thema which we try to learn there. I dont mind if i get along with the teacher in this subject or dont. As long as I am getting good grades and keep understanding everything. 

Everyone has to decide by himself. Its not a choice that you choose just because your friends dont like that teacher its really something you have to choose by yourself and for yourself.
