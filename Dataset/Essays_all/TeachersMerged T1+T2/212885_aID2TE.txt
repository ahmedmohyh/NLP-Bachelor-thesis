Since eleven years, I've been sitting in school every day and in this timeperiod I've learnd many teachers and their teaching methods. The statement I will write my essay about says, that teachers better should be able to relate well with students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject they're teaching.
Once I had a maths and physics teacher, who knew a lot about his subject. He could talk about numbres and figures for hours with a huge fascination. The problem of him was, that he couldn't teach us. He was unable to understand, that maths and physics weren't that easy to us as they were for him. So it is important, to be able torelate well and to understand the students, because it is very difficult to learn the subject if that isn't existing.
Another teacher I had was such a nice person and she could relate so well with students, but her problem was, that she didn't have the knowledge of the subject that was good enough for teaching students with a level like ours was. It is important to have a good knowledge about the subject - how should you teach something without knowing it yourself? 
These two examples show, that on one hand, it is important to be able to understand children or stundents in general to teach them in the subject, because otherwise, they hardly learn what they should. On the other hand is it important to have an excellent knowledge of the teaching subject because the effect of learning is very little if the students are at the same level or even know more than the teacher itself. 
In my opinion it is more important to be able to relate well with students but the teacher still should have a very important knowledge of the subject being taught. Both is essential because if one of the two aspects isn't there, the effect of learning is very small.
