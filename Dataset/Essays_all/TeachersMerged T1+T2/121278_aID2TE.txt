I think that both of these abilities are more or less important. At one point a teacher must know much about his subject(sure much more than the students) that he could teach the students something new and something that not everyone knows on his own. Also the the teacher must know as much of the subject that he understand it completly. Because if he dosen't there wouldn't be a reason to go to school. But also the best knowledge of the world dosen't use so much if the teacher can't submit the knwoledge to the student's. I think that the teacher in minimum must understand the students a little bit and must see if they understand what he says and if they don't he must know how to explaine it that the students know what he means and also understand it. Also if the teacher has a good relationship to his class or to most of his students they have more fun to learn the stuff and also they make less crap in the lesson, aren't so loud and also they are more concentrated. An other fact is that they hear to the teacher if he says something and do it like he says. In fact of these reasons i think i agree to this statement because I think the knowledge of the teacher must be quiet good and in all cases better than this of the students but it hasn't to be perfect. I think its more important that the teacher can build a relationship to the students and could tell them the stuff so that they can understand it. I mean a teacher couldn't use the best knowledge of the world if no one of the students hears to the teacher and dosen't understands anything.
