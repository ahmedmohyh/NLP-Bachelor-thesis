"Being able to relate well with his students is the most important ability of a teacher." Is this statement correct or not? 

One aspect in favour is that if the teacher relates well with his students, they like going to school much more, than if he cannot. It is essential that a teacher is able to understand the problems of the students. He has to show empathy and needs to search a solution so that the students have a "save" feeling in school. Another aspect is that the action of a person is often as important as the knowledge. You can see this in TV shows like "Arena": How they act is often as vital as what they know. Moreover, the students learn easier, if the teacher can teach in a simple and appropriate way.
But,the job of a teacher consists of teaching, they have to prepare their students for the next school, for their job and of course for life. If a teacher has only less knowledge and cannot do his job in an appropriate way, the students are not prepared well.
 
From my point of view, it is essential that a teacher has both. On the one hand, he need to have an excellent knowledge of the subject, so that he can teach his students correctly. On the other hand, he should be able to relate well with his students to give them a feeling of being understood and motivation for coming to school.
