In this statement, there is the problem between the knowledge a teacher must have and his social abilitys. 
In my opinion it is really important how the teacher explains and how he wants the students to learn. If a teacher hasn't so much knowledges about his subject, but he explains very well it isn't as bad as a teacher who knows everything about his subject, but he can't explain it to the students. 
For example in my mathslessons. My teacher knows so much about maths and the rules and I'm not dumb, but I don't understand what he wants from me, so I get a really bad mark in maths, because my teacher hasn't got a good social ability.
I think something between a really good knowlegde and a bad ability and a bad knowledge and a well ability is the best for students, because everybody wants a teacher who understand his students and knows how to speak with them. But when you have to correct your teacher in language or grammatic or sometimes even in some rules about maths, the teacher have to lern more about his own subject so that he can explain it to the students and not the students have to explain it to the teacher.

So I agree with the statement that it is more important that the teacher's ability relate well with students then he has a really good knowledge about his subject.
