Let's compare two teachers and try to figure out which teacher is better. The first teacher has studied multiple topics in the specific subject and he knows much more than he uses to know to teach the subject. But he can't explain the stuff, the students don't like him and the tests are much too difficult because he expects to much from the students. The second teacher teaches three different subjects, is young and gets along with the students very well. He knows how to spread his knowledge. But because he doesn't have any main subject to teach, in one subject his knowledge isn't perfect at all. There are often questions he can't answer and sometimes the stuff he tells is wrong.
It's obvious, that the perfect teacher would be a good mixeaure from these two teachers. But is one of them better or more important than te other? Of course it is very important to have a good knowledge about the topic. If the teacher knows to answer all the asked questions, it's much easier for the students to learn more about the topic. But there are teachers which are so inabled to spread knowledge or to answer questions that students still don't understand the topic after they asked a hundred times. My brother for example has a math teacher which actually is a brilliant mind in math. But the whole class doesn't understand anything? They have so many bad grades in the tests and all his other classes do too. Some students drop out of school, just because this teacher isn't able to spread his knowledge.
But what if a teacher gets along with the students perfectly and the stuff he teaches always gets understanded but he often doesn't know the answers or answer the questions wrong? How should the students learn more about the topic?
In my eyes, the second teacher is definitely better because of course he uses to have enough knowledge to teach this subject and
