Knowledge or relation?

It is always hard for a teacher when the students don't like them. But have the teacher thought about that? Why do students like some teacher and in the other hand they don't like the other ones? Is it easier for students to be taught by a teacher with good knowledge or by a teacher with good relation. 

First of all it is good when the teacher has some knowledge about the subject they teach. When you don't even know what you teach, why do you want to be teacher?
Secondly it is surely much easier for the teacher to explain something to a student when you have enough knowledge about the theme you're teaching. It is also much easier for the student to understand what the teacher can explain it well. 
But in the other hand, it is very very hard for a teacher to give lessons when nobody likes them and also the teacher don't have fun when they have to work.
In addition when the teacher is liked by the students it is much easier for them to explain something to a student, to talk to a student and it is also much easier for a student to go to the school when they can enjoy the school. 

In my opinion a mix of good relation and knowladge is very important for a teacher, but even if teacher's are genius', what have you reached when the students don't understand you or when they don't like you? So in my view it is more important to relate well with students than to have the biggest knowledge. It means I agree with the statement.
