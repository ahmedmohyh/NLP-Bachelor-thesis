No, I dont agree with that, because I think that knowledge is the most important thing to have in our society in many ways. IIf you and you teacher are happy together it is pretty cool but wount help in your future, because life is not easy at all, as far as I can say. Being cool with your teacher can prevent social problems like mobbing or other types of punishment for one person only, so I guess in that way we are totally fine with being cool with our teacher. Now lets see what a teacher with a lot of knowledge can do to you for your further going life generally. In a job it is not important to hang out with your Boss or your co workers, but to bring in usefull information to your branche. Now how does it effect you if your teacher is a cold robot? I guess it wouldnt be so good for you when looking at your social skills. But those can be tought to you by your parents and friends too. To have a conclusion, I would want to say that for me a teacher with knowledge would be ideal because he could teach me important stuff. For all the social aspects I have my friends and family to teach me how to treat people right.
