To have the ability to relate well with students is really important. If the teacher just teaches his school stuff and isn't able to relate well it's more difficult for the students because they might not like having school at this teacher. This is a problem because the students maybe don't want to be in class or are afraid to ask questions. If the teacher relates well with the students they could have a good time and this creates a good atmospere in class.

If the teacher relates well with the students but isn't that good at his own subject the students think his a kind of a joke. If i have to choose which one is more important i would choose the knowledge. The students can learn and be good in the subject without liking the teacher as a person but if the teacher just relates well but isn't excellent in his own subject it's difficult to have good marks especially if the get tested by another teacher for example at the matura.

I think it's important to have both abilities. The teacher should have an excellent knowledge of his subject so he could answer the questions of being asked. He should be able to know more than the things he's teaching because of the students could having more interest in the subject. The atmospere in class has to be good so the students are more likely to paricipate and to learn new things. A good teacher has the ability to relate well and has an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
