Is the relation with students more importent than knowledge?

A good relationship with your teacher makes many things easier for you as a student. It helps you much in these particular subjects and makes it easier to handle learning. Students ask questions more often when they like the teacher than when they don't get on well with him or her. But is it more important as a teacher to have the ability to get on well with the students than their knowledge of the subject being taught? Would you rather like the subject with a nice teacher or the one with the teacher having the most knowledge?

Knowledge is not useful for a teacher when he or she isn't able to bring it nearer to someone. It is not the main thing as a teacher to know a lot about their subject but to make the students learn something about it. It isn't the teacher who has to write tests to prove what they know. It is the students. Good teachers are only good when they manage that their class to know afterwards more about that subject.

The relation between you and your teacher is always a very important aspect for your marks. When you don't like the teacher you are not motivated to learn and you don't dare to ask question for better understanding. This might even lead to that you don't even care about it and never learn and afterwards always blame the teacher for your bad marks. 

On one hand knowledge is essential to be able to teach because you cant give knowledge to anyone if you don't have any. To have a good relation with the individuals is important too to encourage them for asking question. But on the other hand teachers can have both and can't bring the knowledge to their students. So I think being able to teach needs also other aspects.
