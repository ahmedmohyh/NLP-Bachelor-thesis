A proper teacher should always have both, the ability to relate well with students and excellent knowledge. 

While communication and empathy are important qualities of a good teacher, knowledge still is key to teaching. John Hattie, a famous writer and scientist, describes those factors in his book called "Visible Learning". This book is sort of a study of studies, a meta-meta study. Excellent knowledge is the key, to answer questions, to explain the situations, experiments and theory easily and simple. If a teacher isn't confident in his abilities, the students will feel that - and react accordingly. There's also the point, that the teacher could teach students things that aren't true. The consequences of are apparent.

Still, empathy certainly helps in teaching. If a lecturer understands, where he has to pause his lecture so that the students have time to write things down, they will profit from that. Also, using different types of teaching/learning methods, and especially the correct use of them, will also boost the students marks and knowledge. An emphatic teacher will also help maintaining the class climata and will help and mediate if there are conflicts. While this empathy is escpecially important for teachers on lower grades or teachers who spend lots of time with the class (e.g. class teachers), it gets gradually less important, the higher your study goes. 

Personally, I think that knowledge is more important than empathy. Today, schools have psychologists that can help with all sort of problems. Also, this empathy doesn't help much in certain subjects, let's say IT or physics for example. Visible learning indicates the same, the teachers knowledge has a bigger impact on the learning effects of the students than the teachers empathy. Plus, this type of communication is often outsourced to those psychologists I mentioned above. There's also the fact, that there are teachers that have "too much" empathy, and drown themselves in the students' problems.
