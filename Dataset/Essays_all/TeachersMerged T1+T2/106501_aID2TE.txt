A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Both aspects are very important for different reasons. But what is more important?

In one hand, the relationship between the teacher and his stundets is very important. If they can communicate well with each other, stundents will have more respect and they will also have more fun in the lessons. But at the same time, the teacher should have autority. The relationship has to base on a relaxed stage, but also not too realxed. Stundents should follow their advises and introductions. If a teacher have the ability to relate well with students, he will be more loved by his students, so they automaticly learn more and have fun when they are studying. Simply, they enjoy going to school.

But in the other hand, the excellent knowledge of the subject the teacher is being taught is also very important. The teacher has to know nearly everything about his subject, because he has to taught his students well. If he knows a lot, the students are impressed and have respect. So they know that they can ask every question and that the teacher will answer with a good explanation.

Finally, I think that a combination of both aspects is the best one. If a teacher can relate good with students and if he has an excellent knowledge of the subject. students will learn most. Students and teachers have fun while the lessons, but they are still listening what the teacher explains. So the combination is perfect for a good atmpshere in the class.
