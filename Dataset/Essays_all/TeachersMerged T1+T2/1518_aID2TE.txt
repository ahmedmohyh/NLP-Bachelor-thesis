In  the follwing text I´m going to write an essay about the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject bein taught".

I think that both, the ability to relate well with students and a excelllent knowledge about the subject, is necessary. 

The teacher needs a good relationship to the students, because without this, there is the problem that the content of the subject reaches not every students. In every class there are students who are uninterested in the subject. Furthermore there is always a student who is too shy for taking part in the subject. Without a good relationship there is no possibility to help these students, so they get the content of the subject too. But if the teachers knows well about his students and maybe knows about their strongnesses and weaknesses, he is able to motivate the uninterested students and help the shy student to get the content. Especially the chance to making more fun with the students can help, to get their attention and to focus their concentration. 

Like I said, the relationship to the students is very important, but without the excellent knowledge it is nothing. If the teachers does not exactly knows what he taughts, the student are getting the wrong content of the subject. Especially if this happens in the 5. or 6. grade this can leads to a big lack of knowledge in the future. From the beginning studenst must be taught by teachers with excellent knowledge, so the following teahcers in the future can build there content on the basics. Otherwise those students have big problems in the higher school classes and problems with there A-levels on the end of school.

All in all I disagree with the statement. Both is same important. The raltionship and the knowledge is necessary. I think the first one doesn´t work without the second one.
