Nowadays it is discussed wheta teacher's ability to relate students is more important than excellent konwledge of the subject being taught. At first you can say that there arguments which agree and disagree with this statement. An positive argument would be that if the relation between the students and the teachers are bad it could have consequences for the students for example because they are not motivated in learning or listening to the teacher becuase they think that the teachers do not like him or her. Furthermore they could feel like they are unfair treated because if they get a bad mark they could think this is because of the relation between him/her and the teacher. Another aspect which also agrees with this statment is that the teachers could not teach the studtens very well when he/she can not relate well with students because then the students do not do anything the teachers say. 

But there are also aspects against this statement for example if the teacher has no idea of his/her subject he/she can not teach the studenst anything and this is their job so if the teachers can not teach the students they can not learn anything but this is the reason for going to school and because the teachers have to write exams and tests this would have bad consequences for the students because without the teaching of the teachers they can not learn anything and as a consequence the exams/tests maybe will be bad.
 Finally I would say that both is important so that the realtion must be good and of course the teachers should know how to teach, but without a good relation between teachers and students I think it is not possible to teach the students very well. As a result you could say that firstly the relation must work and then comes the konwledge of the teachers, but this is not everytime possible because people are different so not every teacher can get along with every student.
