A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught

Nowadays it is extremly important for students to get an excelent education. This demands a professional teaching of the staff. But many students have psycological problems due to the huge amount of subjects they have to study. Is it also important that the teachers are able to emphasize with the students and help them out if needed?

Owing to the huge competition in finding an employment in a good company, it is extremly important that students get a good teaching from the staff. The teachers must have a huge knowledge of the subject they are teaching. If the students have a lack in their knowledge it is much more difficult to compete with other students and later on they have a disadvantage in finding a good job.

Since many young students can't deal with the pressure they have, due to the subjects they have to study, it becomes more and more important that teachers are able the relate well with students and emphasize with them. If a student is set under pressure it becomes very difficult for him to study and write good tests. If the teachers could help them out and talk to them about their problems the marks are bound to increase.

To sum up, it is very important that teachers are qualified and have a great knowledge of the subject they teach. But as important as this is, that they understand the students and are able to relate well with them. A mixture of these two aspects should a good teacher have.
