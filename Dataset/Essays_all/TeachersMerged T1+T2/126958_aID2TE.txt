This statement is a very well discussed topic among students. To be a teacher in high school, people must study a subject they want to teach later on and also have a teachers diploma, for which the they must have learned how to deal with teenagers and how to educate them. 

In my opinion it is more important that I feel like the teacher can realte to us in a certain way because when I do feel like this, I am more interessted in the topics they teach us. To me it seems like the teachers who relate to us want to be in the classroom and are motivated to work with us. For instance when our geography teacher shows us photos of places he took by himself, I am way more willing to pay attention to what he is saying. 
In addition to that, teachers who can relate well with students seem to teach a lot more interessting. They usually know how to motivate the students and add sometimes funny learning games to their class, like an online game where we can compete against each others. This makes school feel more comfortable and we are happy to go there. 
Futhermore teachers can always educate themselves when they do not know something. The excellent knowledge about the subjecs being taught comes with the years of teaching. The ability to relate with students is either something people can or can not have. An example for this is when a teacher knows about a subject not so well but good enough to teach. As long as he or she can motivate the students to wanting to know more about the subject, they did their job. With the technology we have it is easy for us to simply looking something up in the internet we are interessted in. 

To sum up, in my opinion it is a lot more important that teachers relate to us well than have an excellent knowledge of a subject they teach because the most important thing in learning is to have the motivation to do so. We do not go to school forever, but when the teacher raises the curiosity in us, we will learn forever.
