The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." has different pro and cotra sides.

Pro: 
It's great to have a teacher who is really kind. I think students will feel more conftable next to their teacher. It would downsize the distance between the teacher and the student. Lessons would be more funny. Because the attention of students are higher. I think in primary school it's more important to relate well with the teacher. 

Conrta:
He studied for this subject, so the teacher has to know the subject well. Only if the teacher can explain in easy words the students can learn. If the teacher is nice to the students and will become like a "friend" that wouldn't be good. It isn't the excersic to be a "friend". The teacher won't be paid for being a friend only for give the information to the people. So they can learn. If the students get plder I think it's more imprtant to have a teacher who han an excellent knowledge. 

I think a perfect teacher has both of them. The "perfect teacher" relate well with their students and has an excellent knowledge of the subject. But if I have to decide what would be more important for the student than it would be the knowledge of the subject.
