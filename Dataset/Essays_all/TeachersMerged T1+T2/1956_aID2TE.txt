I nether agree or disagree with the statement. When I think about this quote I think about my teachers I had until now and try to reflect, which was the best for me? It is hard to say but I try to explain what I think about this topic even when it is always the person and not only the teacher.
I think both is quite important as a teacher`s ability. On the one hand the teacher has to have a very good knowlege on his subject to answer also difficult questions of students. With that knowlege the teacher can teach the students on a high level of the subject. On the other hand it is also important for a teacher to relate good with students so to be nice and understanding and not too strict and hard. Generally I would say it is more important to have a teacher which can teach good especially in primary school. The young students have to get used to the early school life and it is muchg easier for them with a nice and good-relating teacher as with one with a good knowlege. Their task is it to motivate and teach the children, school is fun so they don`t need to be afraid of going to school. Because of that I would agree with the statement above. In high school it is different. The teacher`s knowlege is more important than the human handling. The task of (high) school is it to teach information to the students to prepare them to the following parts of life like university or a job. So in high school, especially the last few years, I would disagree with the statement. The relating of the teacher is the students is not as relevant as the facts they have and need to learn.
It is both what makes a teacher a good teacher. It is not helpful for stsudents if the teacher is very nice and understanding but the level of it`s lessons are low but the otherway around, when the teacher has an excellent knowlege of its subject but is not nice to his students but he isn`t good at handling with human or especially children.
