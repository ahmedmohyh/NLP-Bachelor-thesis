I think, that it is very important for a teacher to be  good with his students. But its also important to have the knowledge of the subject, otherwise he cant teach them.in my own opinion its nice to have a teacher which is cool,but its also good when he can teach you. so if I have to choose which type of teacher i would prefer, I would choose the teacher who have more knowledge about a subject. The test are coming... and i prefer it to learn the stuff in school and not at home.Another reason to choose the teacher who is more in the subject and not so cool with his students is, that that it will bring your knowledge much more further.
In the end you can say that it is better for all of  us to have good teachers, who does their jobs well.
