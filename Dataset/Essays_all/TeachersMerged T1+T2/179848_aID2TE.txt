So first of all we all know that there's no perfect teacher and every teacher is different.If I think of all the teachers I liked in my whole school carreer there were so many diffrent ways of teaching. But I never liked a teacher simply because of his knowledge and there's never been a teacher who could motivate me because of his knowledge. That doesn't mean a teacher doesn't need no knowledge. There are teachers with a huge knowledge but no ability to relate well but there are also some with a huge knowledge and a excellent ability to relate! But my experiences tell me that teachers with a bad connection to their students can't motivate their class and so their incredible knowledge can't really reach the students. It's so important for a teacher to make students listening and try to make them interested in what you want to tell them so they'll concentrate and try to keep up with you! Basically every teacher has a quite good knowledge of his own subject. It's just normal that a teacher doesn't spread wrong information and that he's ready to answer all of your question. An ideal teacher needs to reach the attention of every single student, which is actually very  hard, I know, to share his knowledge. Otherwise the huge knowledge of a teacher is absolutely misplaced and should be used for science or things like this! To be a good teacher is one of the hardest jobs, you needs strong nerves, power and you should understand and feel the needs of your class! This is just my opinion and teachers might have a different view but as a student I'm currently quite into this 'good teacher bad teacher' thing so that's what I think about good teachers. But as I said, no teacher is perfect and it also depend on the class you're teaching.
