First of all I would say it´s important to relate well with students but also to have an excellent knowledge of the subject.
But was is more important?
In our time you can look up nearly everything because everybody is able to use a computer or smartphone or can read in a book. Because of that teachers don´t have to know everything. 
On the other side it is better to have a good knowledge of the own subject because sometimes students don´t understand things which they looked up, so they are addictet to the help of other people. Most times it is eaysier to understand themes when you get teached by another person. Computer or books don´t do misstakes while teaching, but they also can´t solve personal problems from the student. Its is much better when you have someone who can explain it in his own words.
All of this is good to give the students knowledge but it doesn´t help anyone when the student and the teacher can´t relate well together. When a teacher is an completly asshole but knows much about his subject, the students don´t have "fun" while learning, so they are not able to learn anything.

With regard to this I would say it is more important to relate well with students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject. You can´t learn with an teacher who knows everything but can not teach you in a way you understand it. It is much better to have a teacher who don´t know everything but can show you how things work, because he can easily look things up to hisself when he forgot some important informations.
