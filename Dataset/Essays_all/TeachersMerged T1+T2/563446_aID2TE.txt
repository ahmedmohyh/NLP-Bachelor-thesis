How good are you in english and french? How is your relation to these teacher who teach them? Which one is more important for you? Students mostely like the lessons more when teachers are friendly to them. But it is more comfortable when the lessons are easy. Therefore, the best teachers are these who are friendly and have a good relation to the class and whose lessons are not highly qualified.

Firstly, it is important to learn a subject not only for exams and good marks. Every student should learn for his life. This means that teahers need to have a good knowledge about their subject. Otherwise the lessons are useless and the knowledge of the students rubbish. It is possible that they will have in their daily life because of a lack of knowledge. For example, a preganant woman can harm her non born baby when she does not know that consuming alcohol during the pregnancy causes damages. But with a good teacher in biology can such problems be vanished.

Secondly, these students build during their school life a base for the university. If they cannot form a good base then the chance to fail in the university will increase. Then they will not be happy about hte good relation to their old teacher because this relation will not help them in their future. 

Finally, it is much more important to have excellent knowlegde of the subject than having a good relation to the teacher because this knowlegde will a student carry a whole life while the relation is only for a few years. This knowlegde is also a very important preparation for the university.
