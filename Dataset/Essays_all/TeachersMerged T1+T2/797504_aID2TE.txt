I totally agree with the statement. Of course, knowledge is fundamental for a  good teacher but the ability to relate with the students is much more mportant. To give an example, our physic teacher is a highly intelligent man. He studied at the ETH, wich is one of the most renomated schools in switzerland. He is capable to answer very deep and difficult questions. Now we could say, that he is a really good teacher but in fact he isn't able to explain physics to us. The reason is his knowledge. He can't understand why some of us aren't interested in physics and he can't explain something on our level. So basically, knowledge about the subject, that is beaing taught, is important but the ability to relate to the students even more. A teacher has to be a social worker , more than a scientific in my opinion. But never the less it depends highly on the school level we are talking about. The higher the level, the more important the knowlegde gets. But the social side schould never decrease to much, even at university. 
If it comes to insufficient knowledge, the teacher loses his or her ability to teach. Students are the base and fundamental for the futur. If already at school the children get to know the wrong things, they will never again learn it the wright way. A bad teacher gives us bad teachers for the future, and not only teacher but all sorts of incapable workers and scientifics, so we can never leave out the imotance of knowledge.
