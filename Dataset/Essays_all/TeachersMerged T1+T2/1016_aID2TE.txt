In the following text I am going to discuss the question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject.

Of course it is important that a teacher relates well with students, because in another case the students would not listen and as a result they would not learn something.
 It is also important because if students like the teacher they like to go to school and they like to learn - and learning is the most important thing about school. And because learning does not only mean to learn things about specific subjects, the way in which a teacher teach and communicate with the students is very important, because they see how the teacher act and maybe they want to act in this good behaviour as well. 
For a teacher who relates well with the students i is easier to create a feeling of being a group and safety. For learning it is important to be somewhere where you like to be.

Nevertheless a teacher has to have a good knowledge of the subject which he teaches. Only a person that knows a lot about a topic is able to explain it to another person. If a teacher relates well with students, but does not know anything, the students could not learn anything. 
Another reason that a good knowledge is important is that it gives authority to the teacher which makes the students having respect.

In my opinion a teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important than his knowledge, if he teaches in classes with young students. Because for them are the social things theay learn more important than knowledge. Nevertheless they should learn reading and writing, but learing facts is not the most important thing. I think for older students the excellent knowledge of their teacher is a bit more important than his ability to relate well with them. They need knowledge for their future, if they want to study for example.
