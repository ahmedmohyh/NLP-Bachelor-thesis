A teacher has the job to teach students certain subjects. Some of them are good at it, some are not. But is the problem the lack of knowledge of the teacher or is it that he just does not relate well with students? 

First and foremost I think that a teacher is here to teach students a subject. However, having a teacher who is relatable can be a nice alternative to the teachers that seem to have no soul. But if I had to choose between having a cool teacher or having someone actually teaching me stuff, I would choose the teaching teacher. Students need the knowledge of some subjects, to be able to go on with school and maybe even go to a university or so. There is no subject as "Have a good relation to your teacher". 

Secondly I know that having classes with a relatable teacher is not always that good. I myself have some teachers that are really nice and they always say things such as: "I know that it sucks but school is like that" etc. And I just have to say that this does not help me. I am here to learn something not to talk with the teacher about stuff that is not relevant at the end of the day. I do not want to spend the evenings at home googling things our teacher should have taught us in class, just because he does not know simple stuff about the subject he is teaching.

In conclusion I would say that knowledge is the key to good teaching. A relatable teacher would be a nice add but is not always necessary. Having someone who actually knows what he or she is talking about on the other hand, is the most important thing when talking about teachers. So, I disagree with the statement.
