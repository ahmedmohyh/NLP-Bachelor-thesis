It is often said that the teacher's ability to relate with students is a very important part of teaching in general, but is this ability more imporatant than the actual knowledge a teacher has? 
To understand the students is a huge part of the teaching profession. If a teacher can communicate well with the students, he will know better about their problems and difficulties. This is an advantage when it comes to individual coaching by the teacher. Not only subject related problems can be solved but also struggles in the personal life, which influences the students can be reduced with this ability.
However, is it more important than the knowledge a teacher has? To make a good lesson at school it is very important that the teacher is very familiar with the subject in order to teaching it correctly. But if the teaching profession depents only on the knowledge, many lessons would be very boring and just a recitation of facts. In this case a teacher can easily be replaced by a computer, which can as well tell you all the facts needed.
To conclude one has to decide which of these ability is more imparative to have as person who is working in a teaching porfession, but this decition is very difficult. It depends on wheter you like to have a teacher who is not intrested in your personal struggles but tells you every fact you need for your exam precicly or a teacher who can help you personally but is not really more useful than an intelligent student who has the same lessons and who can tell you the most important facts. 
For me personally it is very important to have facts in the lessons rather than a emotional conversation at a point, so I would say that I have to disagree with the statement that 'A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught'.
