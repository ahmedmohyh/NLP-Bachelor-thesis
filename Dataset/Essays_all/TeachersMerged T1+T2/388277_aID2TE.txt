I think the statement is neither true of false because a perfect teacher should  incorporate both of these qualities. A teacher which can relate to students is important because often they are more liked by the students and if a teacher is popular among the students, they enjoy the learning process more. If a student has the feeling a teacher understands what the problems for him are in the specific subject they are more likely to ask for help and ask questions. But if a teacher has great knowledge in the subject but cannot relate and explain the current topic it is very discouraging for the students. There is nothing worse for a student than not understanding the topic and  not being able to ask the teacher because they cannot relate to their problem. This case would usually end up with the students being unmotivated because they don't understand anything and the teacher being frustrated because the class didn't do well on the test.
But of course all of this depends on the degree of knowledge the teacher has. If he doesn't know anything except the things he is teaching at the moment and can't answer questions which are out of the topic range, he is a bad teacher aswell. A teacher has to be able to answer questions even if they differ slightly from the topic. 
Another important point is, is on which level of education the students are. Personally i think that the higher the education the more the teacher has to have great knowledge instead of the ability to relate with students. This is easy to see in our current educational system. In primary and middle school the most important thing is, that the teachers are nice and motivating to the students to get them to like learning new things. But in higher grades like the sekundarschule or the gymnasium it is more important that the teacher gives them the knowlege they will need for their future at the university or the Berufsschule.
