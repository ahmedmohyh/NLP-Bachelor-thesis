In the following writing task I will discuss the following statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

The knowledge of the teacher is something very important, because there aren't many things which are more annoying than a teacher who can't answer any questions. Teachers who are like this seem not that serious and the students also wont take him or her serious if they have to think that their knowledge is better than the one of their teacher. The lessons are also much more interesting if the teacher knows many things which you normally don't know. 

On the other hand no one likes teachers who put themselfs in a position which is that high, that they can't relate with the students anymore. This are exactly these teachers who are thinking, that their students just live for school, or even more just for their subject. It's also because some teachers have that high standarts. They think, that our day has more than 24 hours. After them we should play an instrument, do sports, meet friends, because of social life, sleep enaugh and after all this things we also should have good grades. Sometimes I think that they forgot how it was in their schooltime and that they maybe also had hobbies ore friends and not just school and that they also couldn't manage everything at the same time. 

In my opnion both parts are importatnt because as I have already written, if I have the feeling that I know more about the subject than the teacher, I won't take him serious but for me it's also important that the teacher shows that he can relate with us and understands our situation and problems. This makes me feel more comfortable and becaue of that I will also understand, if he needs somewhen more time to correct a test or something like that.
