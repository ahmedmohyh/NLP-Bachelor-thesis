A teacher who knows each and everything about a subject that's being taught or a teacher who can relate well with students?
Which one is more effective not only for the students but for the teacher himself/herself? 

I think when a teacher just is a teacher to the students a lot of time's being wasted. Nobody will actually listen to the person standing in frot of the classroom. The teacher could go on and on about the way a cell is built or the the right way to calculate the angle of a traiangle but the only thing the students are thinking about is the ring of the bell when he or she finally is released from the 'torture'. It doesn't matter how well a teacher knows the subject because if that was the only important thing you could just have a robot teaching the class. The way of teaching is so much more important. A good teacher is also a friend. In my opinion so many students would actually pay attention if the teacher has a funny way of teaching and isn't the typical strict figure that you are fored to listen to if you want to get somewhere in your life. Students expecially teenagers will profit much more if the teacher enlightens you about your individual questions. When a teacher builds some sort of relationship to the student and the students feels like he's/she's understood.

In conclusion, I think the teacher's ability to relate well with studentsis more important and mandatory than excellentknowledgeof the subjects being taught.
