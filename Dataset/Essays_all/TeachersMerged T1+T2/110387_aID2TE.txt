In today's essay, we're talking about a very interesting topic in teaching.
"A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." 
Trust is a very valuable quality that occurs in, related to today's topic, relations between people. To trust someone means to have a certain closeness to a perosn, which is very important for life, for example in teaching. Why should you believe something somebody tells you you don not trust? Trust is the basic of every class and thing beeing taught. Id describes this mental basis of every following is based on. In addition to this fact, psychology states that this interraction between human is extremly important for life, a valuable real life lesson. So it doesn't even matter which subject is beeing taught, the athmosphere of it, trust and manners, is just as important for life as the facts of it. Haters are going to be like: It doesn't matter how the lesson and teaching strategies look like, only the facts of every subject matters for life.If the teacher relates too much with students, valuable time, which could be used for subject specific facts and theories, gets waisted. A qualitatif lesson needs to have no other energies than energy used for the facts. In university for example, teachers do not even know the students, and it works perfectly fine. So this states, that the ability of relations between teachers and students are not neccessary in order to establish a highstanding learning situation and atmosphere.
In my opinion, it is very important and inevitable that teachers can rely on their students in order of having an encouraging teaching atmosphere and students can get the most of every single class.
