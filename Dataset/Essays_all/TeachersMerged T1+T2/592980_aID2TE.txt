According to the before mentioned statement it is more important that a teacher can relate well with stundents than having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But is this ability more important than the quality of lessons that are to be taught?

First of all, a teacher's job is to educate his students about his subject. In order to accomplish this task a teacher needs excellent knowledge. A lesson of a teacher who knows a lot about his subject is interesting and you learn a lot more from such a teacher who is motivated to teach. 

Furthermore, it is important to mention that a teacher mustn`t always relate well to his students. A teacher is a person of authority and in order to keep this authority and be taken seriously by the students, a teacher must be strict at certain times. However, it is obviously important that a teacher can understand the feelings of his students and can relate to them in order to help them accordingly whith difficulties they might face whilst learning. 

In conclusion I would say that a teacher should have both qualities, but it should be kept in mind that going to school aims at gaining a good education, not becoming friends with teachers. Afterall, an education is everlasting, but friendships eventually do end. Therefore I disagree with this statement.
