In the following essay i am going to discuss the question, if a teacher should relate to his students more or  have excellent knowledge of the subject.

First of all it´s important to have knowledge on the subject you´re teaching, because without it´s impossible to do so. Imagine a teacher, who doesn´t know, what he is talking about. Especially with good or excellent knowledge it is easier to teach something and of course the possibilty that the pupils will have that knowledge either is higher. It is also important that when you know everything on that subject, you can explain things better, because you can decide what is important to understand the whole topic. For example you know, that it is not neccesary to know every equotation, if you can build them new, when you truly understand the topic.

But to have great knowledge doesn´t mean that you can teach it well. A teacher who can relate to his students, can teach better, because he knows how to present the topic in the class. Someone, who knows everything of the subject might expect that his student have to know it either and doesn´t start to explain the basics or tells the pupils to learn it by heart other than to truly understand it. Furthermore can he or she help students who need longer for a certain topic. So everyone understands it at the end. Also  the social enviroment in  a class with a teacher relating to his students is better, because he or she can stop arguments between pupils. 

As result i would say, that both things are important. Not only to have the knowledge on the subject that you can teach your students, but also the possibilty to make the students understand and like the topic.
