As a teacher you have to know the things you teach. But is an excellent knowledge of the subject more important than the ability to relate well with the students?
Well, when a teachers want to teach students in a subject they have to know about it. It is difficult to make the pupils understand the things when they do not even understand it by theirself. Also answering question romoving from the topic could be difficult. But to make the students understand the topic it is not enough to know about it. They have to be able to tell it the students and find a way to help them if they do not understand. In this case a good relation between teachers and students is important. A good clima in class brings more fun for the students so they have more motivation to learn. For example when a boring person stands in the front at just gives information after information for hours the students hear the things and forget them instant. And when the teacher is not nice to the students they are not nice to him and do not do want he says. But the relation schould not become too friendly. The students schould always respect the teacher. If not, they do what they want and he loses the controll.
So in the end I would say knowledge about the subject is, but it is not enough to to be a good teacher.
