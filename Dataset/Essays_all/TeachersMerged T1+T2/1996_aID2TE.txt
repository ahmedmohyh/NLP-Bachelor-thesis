Imagine that your teacher doesn´t know the topic very well and hopes thart he can relate you with in the topic.
Do you think that it is more important that he or she relate well with you or that is has an excellent knowledge of the subject?

The following statement has a lot of reasons for the agree and the disagree statement. Of course it is important to relate the students and try that the students find the right answer as well. It has more ability`s for students to understand the question and think about the solution in their mind. Some people need that to think about it too and try to explain it in their own words so sometoimes it helps when the teacher do it so. So they could understand it better than when the teacher knows the topic very well and write something on the bord and nobody can understand it because the teacher speaks to fast or he explain it in a "other" language than the students couild understand. Sometimes the teacher can't explain it so that the stundents think about it. But if you look on the other side most of the students can understand it bettter when the teacher explain it on a example and write on the  bord the abilities of solution than he stands befor them and explain it without something that can help.Every student has a other way to think about the topics they were given.
All in all it is better when the teacher explain it in different ways so that he can take everyone of the students in the "boat" to learn with them together, and help them that they can see it in different ways so they could apply it in the life after studying.
