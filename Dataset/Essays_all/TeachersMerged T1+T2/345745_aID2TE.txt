The teachers: A group of people everyone has to meet in their lives. Mostly a lot of years. But what is exactly a good teacher? Is it the ability to relate well with students or is it the knowledge teachers have? A hard question which many discussion and studies try to answer.

There are several different arguments about this discussion. You could say that if the teacher doesn't have any knowledge, how can he or she even teach the children or young adults anything. That would be quite difficult and the children or young adults would learn nothing from school. The same with not excellent knowledge. The students would learn false things which is also rather difficult.But if the teacher can't relate at all with his or her students, will the students even listen to them? And like that, will they even learn something from their teachers? 

For me personally their has to be a mixture between knowledge and the ability to relate. Probably the older a student gets the more knowledge it takes. For example in primary school it's not that important that the teacher knows a lot. It's just important that the teacher can relate to their students. But for example in the gymnasium students wouldn't take the teachers serious if they didn't know anything about their subject. But still it needs the ability to relate to them. Because otherwise the student probably won't like the teacher and there are studies that show that students are more willing to learn something in school when they like their teachers.
