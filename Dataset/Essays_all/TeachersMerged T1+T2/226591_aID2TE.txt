Especially when it comes to teaching, everyone has a different opinion and everyone thinks he is right. But one point that is very controverse and which many people disagree with is what makes a good teacher. A common question is wether teachers should be rather strict or nice. But what is the most important is that some think only excellent knowledge is relevant in order to teach. However they can be proven wrong.

First of all it is of couse clear that a teacher needs to know certain things in order to teach his students. However the ability to explain things to the students is way more important. All the knowledge of the world is useless if pupils do not understand what they are taught. So in order to make them understand you have to be able too relate to your students and have a connection with them. Of course it can be very useful if a teacher knows a bit of extra information or can do a thing or two better than others. Nevertheless it is vital for good lessons that teaches have other qualities besides their knowledge and also the method of teaching plays a very big role. Given the example of a mathematics teacher who is excellent in his subject, his knowledge is absolutely gapless and his mind exceedingly brilliant you would think he makes the perfect teacher. But does he also know that his students wont lean anything if he keeps standing in front of the blackboard solving difficult equations all by himself? I will not deny that knowledge is very helpful and important but I would not want him to be my teacher. In my opinion it is less important what you say, but how you say it in order to make other people understand.

To conclude, there needs to be a bit of both in order to have the qualities that are required to teach yet in my opinion, the ability to relate to students and explain is a bit more important than simply knowing a lot.
