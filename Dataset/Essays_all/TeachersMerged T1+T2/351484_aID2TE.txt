It is important that our teachers are well informed about the world and especially the subject that they are teaching. But if a teacher only has an excellent knowledge of their subject but doesn't know how to relate to the students is not acceptable either. A good teacher has to be able to do both: Be a kind and socially active person and know what he or she is doing in front of a class. Teachers have a big responsibility when teaching students, because they learn from the teachers and often believe everything that is being told to them. So if a person is not familiar with the things he or she is teaching it is likely to happen that false information is passed on to students. That is a high risk because me as a student expects the things a teacher says to be true and accurate. But the key skill a teacher must have, is being able to explain a certain subject in a way that kids and teenagers can relate to and understand. To do that, the students have to accept their teachers and need to be willing to listen to the them, they have to open up and be comfortable with them. If a teacher has achieved that, it doesn't matter if he or she has not got an excellent knowledge. More important is to be motivated and wanting students to learn something they have not known about yet. I am not saying that it is okay if a teacher is not educated well enough but is able to perfectly relate to pupils. A teacher is just not fitted for this profession if he can't relate to children. Out of own experience I can tell one thing: Students are no motivated and willing to learn something if they feel like the teacher can't explain a subject without motivation.
