A teacher's job is obviously to teach their students and make sure they understand the topic at hand sufficiently. For a teacher to achieve this they need to understand how to teach, explain and how a student learns. 
A teacher who relates very well to their students is very likely to understand the students' needs in terms of learning the subject, but also in terms of paying attention or learning at general. A concentrated class makes the lessons easier for the teacher and assures that the students pay attention and therefor learn properly. A teacher who understands the class's problems and the struggles of the individuals can motivate the students better or even mould the education to better suit the students' current needs. A teacher who can thusly relate is more sympathetic and gains more respect from the class. And in my opinion the students' respect is one of the most helpful assets a teacher can get.
But none of this is very helpful if the teacher doesn't understand their subject well enough. To sufficiently explain something, one needs to understand it on a higher level. Curious studens are a blessing for every teacher who can answer their questions well, but if a teacher doesn't understand the subject well beyond the planed curiculum and therefor isn't able to answer curious stundents, it can evoke a sense of overwhelming difficulty of the subject and even demotivate the students.
I conclude there's a clear priority for a teacher and that is understanding
