I can't possibly agree with that statement. These are two things incomparable to each other.
 You can easily be a teacher without the skill to relate to your students, though it's impossible for you to teach if aren't properly informed about the subject. 

Knowledge is crucial it's that simple. You must be well educatet in the subject you are teaching in order to pass the knowledge onto the next generation.
Teachers educate you about the things you'll need later in life. Most of the time they're even teaching you something you'll be needing later on in life to earn your living. And not being able to provide you with the nessesary skills is just like robbing you from future success. 

On the other hand side it is important to be able to have a good understanding with your students. I am convinced that a significant amout of students does appreciate an empathic teacher. I also believe that students are way more motivated as well as less afraid to make mistakes if they have a compassionate teacher.
Tthough I am aware of the importance of a teacher that can relate to his students I am convinced that being able to inform correctly is crucial. you're not getting anything from someone that is nice and understanding but cant teach
