The ability of a teacher being able to relate well with students is very important. If they do so, the students feel more comfortable to participate in class and interact or communicate more with the teacher and other students. To communicate and keep the interesst about a topic up is a more effective way of teaching then trying to teach the excellent knowledge in a monologue of the teacher.
If students participate more in class they have to do less work at home because the interaction between each other is less forced and based on a free will. If something is intensively discussed in class, students start to think more on their own and they try to understand the topic because they are interessted and start doing researches without being asked to do so. If one compares this to a monologue of a teacher who tries to teach the theoretical aspects of a theme we can often see that it is harder for a student to understand how something works and they have to ask for help and are forced to do researches. They are less concentrated and the consequence is, that students start to do something else instead of following the  teacher's explainations.
In my opinion it's very important to have the ability of relate well with students and create a comfortable athmosphere in class, so the students feel well and think more on their own.
