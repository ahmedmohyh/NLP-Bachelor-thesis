There are different ideas about how a teacher should be. Especially tudents like those, who understand them. But is the ability of relating to students more important that excellent knowledge about the taught subject?
First of all, it is important for students to learn, they also need details to fully understand the topic. This means that the teachers must know everything himself, so that he can tell the students. For example, it is necessary for an exam to know much about the taught subject. If the students have not been told about everything, they will not be as good as other students who have been told.
Secondly, a teacher's job is teaching and not relating to his students. A teacher who can understand his students very well is not a good teacher if he is not well informed about the topics. A teacher might be nearly friend to his student and make jokes with them etc. but  he might not be able to teach properly because he does not know too much about his subject.
On the other hand, students are probably more interested in the subject if they have a teacher who relates well with them. Exact information and details might not be useful if they are presented in a boring or frustrated way, for instance.
As a consequence of being interested, students can learn better because they want to get as much knowledge as possible about the certain topic. The teacher might support them, this avoids frustration and gives the students a positive feeling. This support might also motivate the students to research on their own.
To sum up, I would say that a teacher's ability of relating to students is more important than exact knowledge about the subject. A relating teacher is more sympathic to students, so they will be more interested and more willing to do even hard work.
