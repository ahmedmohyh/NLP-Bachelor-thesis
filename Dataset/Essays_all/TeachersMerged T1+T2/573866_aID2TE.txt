I am going to write the question, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt. When I would be asked, what the main skills of a teacher should be, my answer would be, that they should like children and should relate well with them. But to answer this question, it's important to think of a special age of children. While primary students need a lot of attention and a good relation with their teacher, high school students don't need love from their teacher. I'm going to refer to younger children in priary school. In this period of time, the childen have to learn more about other people, life and general knwoledge than scientific subjects. It's really important that this children have a good relation to their teatcher and that they listen to him/her. All the knowledge a teatcher in primary school should have, is a lot of general knowledge. The children have to learn how to read and write, they have to learn how to cooperate with other children and to solve math equations. A normal person who graduated from high school should have this knowledge. In my opinion a good relation between a child and a teacher is realy important. If someone loves children and is intrested in spending time with them, the level of intelligence and knowldege is less important. I think it is more important to study in university about how to deal with children with special needs and how childrens minds work. So my answer to the topic question is yes.
