There has been controversial discussion about the importance of the knowledge of the teacher. Some people spend less attention to ability of interaction with the students than the ability of knowledge of their subject. This essay will discuss the importance of the knowledge of the teacher.
Firstly, a teacher is hired to teach a topic and not to entertain the students. Therefore the students need the possibility to learn things they haven't known before. Additionally a teacher with no knowledge istn't possible to do this.
Secondly, another significant point is the fact, that the students aren't forced to go to school. Especially students from the hight-school or the university go to school liberally. It's their own decission to make what they are told to do. Accordingly you will may have in future a boss, who you won't like at all. In this case you need the knowledge to deal with this kind of people.
Thirdly, it's difficult to get well with all kind of people. There are worldwide people like or dislike. If a teacher gives you a bad note you will maight won't like him. But we sould mention, that this is a result of the unknowledge of the teacher to teach his subject.
To sum up the knowledge is an important point to do your job. In my opinion it's importent to generate your own motivation to go to school, if you wan't to achieve something in life.
