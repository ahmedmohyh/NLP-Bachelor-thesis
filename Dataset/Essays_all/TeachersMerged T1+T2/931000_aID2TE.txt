I personaly like teachers who relate well with their students. But what do you want to teach the students if you're not an expert in your subject? The bond between a teacher and his students is something special. It is not a typical bond as known with friends, family or co-workers. There has to be a bond, for sure, but it also has to stay just a teacher-student bond. If it gets more than that, the way you look at your teacher would change. For me, the teacher is an autority. It is a person witch you have to respect. Of course you have to respect everyone, but you have to respect your teacher in a diffrent way than your friends. The excellent knowledge of the subject is something very important. We (the students) may be thaught to not believe everything we hear and to ask questions.But when you listen to your teacher you should be able to trust him/her. And if he/she doesn't have that excellent knowledge of his/her subject it will get hard to teach in that subject. The teacher needs to know what he/she is talking about to actually make a good job in teaching. The job of a teacher is to teach. The ability to relate well with your students is needed as a teacher, but it doesn't have the number one priority. The most important thing as a teacher is to know what you are talkin about. A great conection between the teacher and the students help to create an interessting and informative lesson. But it is the information that is the most important not the relation to the students.
