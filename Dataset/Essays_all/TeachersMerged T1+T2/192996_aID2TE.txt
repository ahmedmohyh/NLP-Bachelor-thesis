The teacher student relationship is one of a speacial kind. Either good or bad, it can have a big impact on the students life. A teachers task is to bring knowledge to the children. In which way this knowlegde is presented and transferred to the kids depends on the teacher and his or her style of teaching.

There is no denying that the students should learn in school through their teachers. It therefore does not matter if the teacher is personally kind or has the same interests as the students through which they could bond. The important thing is his expertise and professionality. To give an example, it would make no sense to give a teaching job to a very lovely young man if he failed to explain the questions asked by his pupils. It would contradict the purpose of teaching.

Contrary, there is no sense in giving this job to a very strict teacher feared by all students. To learn with fear and pressure is much more difficult than to learn with fun and passion. If the passion of the teacher ignites the passion of the students they are not forced to learn and therefore not blocked in their creativity and intelligence. 

A teachers sole task is to teach. Of course it is academic knowledge but it is not the only thing a teacher should give his students. Lessons for life and adulthood like social conduct are as important as maths. The experiences of an older person are interesting and can augment the life of the students on other levels as academic success.

Personally, I find it so incredibly important to have a well balanced and fair relationship with my teachers. I can learn a lot from them and they are willing to invest time and effort in my education and therefore life. The big impact teachers can have on their students should be a good one.
