I would say yes a techer should relate well with the students but I wouldn't agree because an excellent knowledge of the subject is really important if you want to teach somebody.On one hand if you have a good relationship with your teacher it gives you also more motivation for the subject and you really want to improve in that subject. On the other hand an excellent knowledge for the subject as a teacher is essential and you can't teach somebody in something if you don't understand it yourself.So my opinion on this is that you need both, a good combination of both. It isn't good either to have a bad reputation as a teacher if the whole class hates you they will not show you any respect for what you are doing or what you are talking. They wouldn't any motivation to learn and improve. As a consequence on that it will influence their grades in a bad way. On the other side if you are to collegual with your students they will start to not take you serious anymore and also want to test your limits. They will  start to discuss with you during the lessons about unnecessary things and about their freetime. All in all I have to say I experienced both sides and I know it's easy to say but a good mixture of both is the best but it's also difficult as a teacher to know where the limits are between friends and teacher-student and because of that they prefer to be strict instead of being to much like a collegue.
