In the following I am going to express my own thoughts to the statement " A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".
At first you can say that it is always important for a student to have a teacher who is not acting like he is the boss and nobody is allowed to ask "stupid" questions. As a student you need a teacher who is nice to you and where you don't have any fears or feelings like that coming into his class.  A good teacher has to be able to talk normally with students, not like a person who is standing over the students but like a person who wants to have a great time while learning something. The teacher has to create a good and relaxed atmosphere in class so the students really want to learn something  and don't do any kind of dumb things. So the relation between the teacher and the students is very important.
But you can't be a good teacher by only beeing nice to your students. You also have to know what you are doing and what you are talking about. If your knowledge of the subject you teach is not very good and the students notice that, they could start thinking that they don't need to know anything about the subject. They quickly loose the interest in you and your subject. If the teacher has no idea what he's talking about the students go to his class knowing that nothing important or exciting will happen. So it is in fact a big problem if the teacher has a bad knowledge of the subject he teaches.
To summarize it up I can say that I don't agree with the statement because I think that no point is more important than the other one. There can't be a good class with a teacher who is only nice and cool but has no idea what he is talking about. There also can't be a good class with a teacher that has a very good knowledge but sucks as a person.
So you can say that the mix of a good knowledge and a good relation to the students is the recipie for having a good class.
