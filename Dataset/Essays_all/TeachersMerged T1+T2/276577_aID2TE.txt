More and more students go to school every year. Therefore more and more imporovements are made to the schoolsystem. One big question that is being discussed at the moment is: wheter a teacher should have excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches or that he is able to realte well with students.

The teacher himself once had to learn the subject from scratch, like his students are doing in his lessons. In that case, it is more usefull if the teacher can relate to the problems students are having while trying to understand the subject, then for him to know everything about the subject.

That leads us right to the next point. In each class there are students that have more problems with understanding new things then others. If a teacher sees which students still need help and which students would rather go on with the subject, he can adjust his teaching.

Also, if a teacher reaches his boundries with a subject, he can always learn more about it and gain better knowledge. It is way harder for someone to learn how to relate to other people, in this example students, then to learn more about a certain subject.

All in all, both things are important. In my opinion it depends on the school that you are looking at. In primary school it is way more important for a teacher to relate to his students, so he can be helpful. At university level though, it is much more important that the teacher know as much about the subject as he possibly can, so he can answer every question that might come up.
