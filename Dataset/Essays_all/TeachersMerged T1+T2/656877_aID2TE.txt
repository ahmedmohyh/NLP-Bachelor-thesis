In this time it is very important to learn much in school. The knowledge of each person rises every year and so the people will be more and more smarter than many years ago. And so it is important to have a teacher with an excellent knowledge but a good relation with the students is important too. But what is more important?
First, the students want to know many and for most of them school is very important for the future. The teachers have a responsibility for the knowledge of the class. For example today in many jobs you will speak or write in english, but if the teacher learned the language only for teaching he wont be a really good teacher for the class. The class neads a teacher who learned the language more than only for teaching so he know much more than only grammatics and this knowledge help to learn more.
Second, if an other teacher learned the language with fun and for more than teaching grammatics, he will be a better teacher than the teacher in the other example. So if he tells for example from his journeys or from other things when he used his english. He will have more relate with the class and the class will learn it better. Then they think: Oh, cool my teacher was in London and spoke with the Royals. This I want to do that too. So then they learn with more elan to reach this aim.
Al in all it is important to have a teacher with a good knowledge but he should have a good ability to ralte with his student. So I do not agree or disagree with the statement. I would have a mixture of both teacher to learn something/ a subject really good.
So for the future, if we will have probably roboter as teacher, we should ask us the same question for them. So can a robotor have a good ability to relate with students an from where has he his knowledge?
