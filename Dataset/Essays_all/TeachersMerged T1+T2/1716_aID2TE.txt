Every child, who wants a succesfull future, needs good educdation. For finding a job or just in their daily lifes. This knowledge is brought by their teachers in schools. The question i will discuss now is about this topic. Is it more important to relate well with your students? Or has to be the teachers knowledge on an excellent standard.

One important fact in classes is the force of believing. Pupils who are believing in their teachers words, can be a lot mor productive in learning. They wouldnt ask twice and just learn the stuff, the teacher is saying, becaue "it must be true". Also the cognition about the subject would be better and teachers and students would work better together. But without the teachers knowledge, the learning fact could also be very negative. A teacher should also be very intelligent. Just teaching well isnt the whole thing. He schould know very well about his subject and should be always prepared for lessons. But what if the theacher knows very well about his subject, but doesnt know how to interact with their students. If teachers dont know how to present, the students would just write down what they are saying without any interest and without asking them questions. The knowledge would be a lot more harder to understand and recognize in class tests or just during lessons. Not only the teachers would be responsible, but also the students an their non-interesting act. 

Overall we can say, no metter what the teacher is saying, it needs to be correct, but it also has to be presented in a understandeble way. To find the right teacher is not easy, but if you find someone, who has a little bit of both, you can be very happy as a student.
