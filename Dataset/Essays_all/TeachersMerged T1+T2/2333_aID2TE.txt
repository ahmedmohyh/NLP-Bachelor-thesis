 I think it is more importand that teacher relate well with the students, because the students need a good feeling to learn more. When students are stressed they   do not agree with the teachers and then everybody are angry and stressed. When teacher with exellent knowledge try to work with the students and the students have no fun they are very sad and they don´t have fun with learning. when the teacher have exellent knowledge of being tought and they don´t can work with children or students they have a problem, the are very angry teacher´s and the students are very angry and they don´t want to learn with them.
Also I can say that I agree with the statment, because it´s importand that students have fun with learning in school and the teachers don´t stressed them 
 with to much homework.
