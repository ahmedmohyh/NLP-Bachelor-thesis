Is it more important that teachers have a good knowledge or that they relate well with their students? Well, this is a good question, which I´ve asked myself too. 

First, all teachers have, or should have a good knowledge, but some have just a better one than others, but does that really mean that the teacher is better? In fact, teachers who can relate very well with their students, the students will probably like this teacher more. And when you like something, you are more likely to learn it. As example, french is a mature that not that many students like, but if they have a good teacher who relates well with them, they will begin liking this mature and will prbably learn more. Exactly this was the case while I went to secondary school. 
Teachers, whose knowledge is great, often have problems bringing it to the students. They know for sure what they´re speaking about, but they´re just speaking and not relating with the class. For example, my chemistry teacher knows a lot about chemistry, but he explains it so difficulty, almost no one understands it. And due that, many won´t even learn it, because they think it´s boring and that they will never understand it.

In my opinion, it make a difference between the knowledge and the ability to relate with the students. It is good if the teacher has a bigger knowledge, but more important, he should be able to relate with the students, that they will start liking that mature. So on they will more likely learn more for that mature and get better grades, so yes, it is more important that the teacher can relate well with their students than the teachers knowledge.
