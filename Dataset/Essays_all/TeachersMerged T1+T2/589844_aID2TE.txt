I strongly disagree. But that doesn't mean that I think that excellent knowledge is more important. Balance in all things is important. If a teacher can only relate with students but doesn't have any knowledge, she is limited by the knowledge she can teach to the next generation. If she only has for example primary school knowledge she may be able to communicate her ideas perfectly to her students and make them understand her knowledge, but this level of knowledge may not be sufficient enough for the studnets future.
On the other hand if a teacher has all the knowledge of the world but can't teach it to anyone efficiently, why is she a teacher in the first place? A teacher needs to be able to teach knowledge efficiently and if they can't relate with their student they can only teach a small portion of their knowledge and the students will have a hard time following a single thought of the teacher.
The best solution is something inbetween. A teacher that knows alot about her subject and can communicate with their students is the best teacher. The teacher doesn't need to have all the knowledge of the world, nor do they have to know every trait of their students, but if they can take all there knowledge which is for example on bachelor level and through their understanding of their students bestow it on them, even if it is only 80%, they are doing a great job. Those teachers are the best teachers in the world. When a teacher can teach you the most boring subject and keep you interested and smiling, then that is the optimum, that is the ability a teacher should seek.
