A teachers ability to relate well with students and excellent knowledge about the subject being taught should be balanced.
Since that is a standard that cannot be fulfilled by every teacher it is an important question which of those two skills is more important.
If a teacher is unable to relate with their students he isn´t able to teach them much either because the communication between both the teacher and the students doesn´t work properly.
It might aswell cause a bad working atmosphere in that subject and not only would the students lose their interest and fun in the taught subject but it would also result in worse grades even if the teacher has excellent knowledge about the topic.
If a teacher does have the ability to relate well with stundents, though, the communication between the students and the teacher mostly works really well, too.
Good communication makes the subject more interesting to the students and leads to them paying attention and an overall good atmosphere to learn in.
And even if that teacher doesn´t have excellent knowledge about the subject he or she probably still has a fair enough decent knowledge and still teaches more or might even get the students to keep the taught information longer simply by building up a good base.
Looking at these arguments I´d personally say a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important.
The atmosphere I´m learning in has a huge influence on how well I understand the subject and how my grades are.
And finally what´s really important is that a teacher with those abilities and only decent knowledge can still learn and gain excellent knowledge whereas for a teacher with excellent knowledge and a lack of ability to relate with students it is hard to change their whole personality for better social skills.
