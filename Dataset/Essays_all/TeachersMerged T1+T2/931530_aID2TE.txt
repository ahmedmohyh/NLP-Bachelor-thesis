If a teacher is good is mostly answered with the question if he could relate well with students not if he had a good knowledge about the subject being taught. There is a positive and a negative side. I try to explain both side of this theme.

In advantage if he is a primary teacher the students have to learn the stuff but they aren't likely to ask details which are hard to answer unless you studied the subject for many years. As an example. A primary student won't ask you why it is like that. He will acept it, that it is like that. Also in the primary school students are better in subjects where they like their teacher. In the gymnasium it's harder stuff so they should follow your lessons.

In the other hand if you want to teach on a gymansium you should know what you are talking about. There it's more likely that the teacher is being ask a compicated question. The teacher has to to a more difficult test so he had to know more about the subject. There it's not so important to be able to relate well with students. But if you are unable to relate well with students they won't like you and your lessons and mabye won't get through the matura.

In my opinion you shouldn't be a teacher if you don't like children and can't explain. But you also have to know what you are talking about. You should be able to relate well with students and have a big knowledge in the subject you are teaching. But I think you should be able to relate well with students and it's not a problem if you don't know every detail. Teacher are also humans even when students think they are monsters.
