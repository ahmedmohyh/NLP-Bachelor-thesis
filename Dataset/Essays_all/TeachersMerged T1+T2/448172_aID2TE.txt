I don't think that excellent knowledge of a subject isn't as important as the ability to relate well with students, because if a teacher has excellent knowledge of a subject the relationship between the students and the teacher is already better. As the human being wants to learn something and to get further in their lifes they want to learn something at school, even if a thirteen year old teenager wouldn't agree because he or she hates school. And if students realise that their teacher isn't correctly informed about something they are supposed to learn, they tend to lose their respect from from the teacher and in that situation isn't the ability to relate well with students worth anything. But on the other hand it can be very helpful especially for younger students aged six till ten, to have a good relationship to their teacher and to know the teacher is at the same time somebody to trust. In this span of growing up, children learn a lot, wheter it is in the maths lesson or on their way back home, like right communication with others. And if there's a a good atmosphere in class, students can learn better and definitely easier, because it is more fun, either for the teacher and the students. But the older they become, the more they want to break rules and "be cool". So it is even more important in teenage years, that the teacher becomes an authorising person, who children have respect of, but still like to talk to. From High School or College on the relationship between a teacher and their students is almost not important at all, because they decide to go to school by themsleves and have to learn how to handle with people they probably don't like that much and don't get on very well. In life it's the same, you don't always like the people you work with, but the earlier you learn how to handle this, the less problems you have.
