 It is important, that teachers have a large knowledge of the subject they're teaching, but on the other hand the kowledge isn't very useful when teachers can't give some parts of it to their students. So a good teacher must be able to handle with the children (aswell in more difficult situations). An other important skill a teacher should have, is the ability to motivate the children or students to learn, and teach them in a way that they don't lose their interest. But if a teaching person copes very well with the students but haven't got any idea of what exactly he/she is teaching, it's obviously useless too. But the knowledge mustn't be just in the teachers head an stay there. A brilliant teacher knows nearly everything of his subject, an overall is able to explain it to his students so they understand.To me it seems also extremly important, that teachers can answer "higher" questions breavly, and not only  know the things which the students can read for themselves in the books. 
So in conclusion I would say, that both things are very important and the mixture is the secret of the success. But I agree with the statement in some way, because the ability to relate well with students, is especially with children very important. So for primary schools for example, this thing seems more important to me than the knowledge.
