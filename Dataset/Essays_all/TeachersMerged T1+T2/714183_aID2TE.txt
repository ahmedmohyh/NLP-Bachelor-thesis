Often the problem that a student can't learn a perticular subject is that the relation between him and the teacher is bad. This can easily lead to the student hating the subject and/or not learning anything from it. That's why the relation between students and their teacher is arguebly the most important thing in a school and has priority over any subject. 
If teachers don't optain any knowledge about a subject they obviously can't teache this subject  well. This is something everyone, who ever had a bad teacher, can relate with. 
But a bad teacher doesn't necessarly needs to be bad in his/her subject. A teachers job is to explain something to his students which is only possible if their relation is in a way that allows him/her to do so. The younger the students are the more this relation only depends on the teacher. So having a good relation to his students should be the priority of any teacher.
In the end one can't say that a teacher, whose relation to his students is perfect, but he does not know anything about his subject, is a good teacher nor is his extreme counterpart one. But at least some skill in building a relation with students is needed to teach anything, so the relation is more important than additional knowledge on the subject.
