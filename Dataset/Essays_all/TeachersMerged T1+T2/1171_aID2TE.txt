Lots of students prefer a teachers ability to themselves before an excellent knowledge, but why??? In the following i will summerise my important arguments and will show you my view of this statement.
many of my teachers can not teach us to achieve a great grade at the end of my school life as a  result i am agianst techears who have an great ability to students but no knowledge because we learn for our future and specially i dont even enjoy my school life so that i simply want to learn good . it isnt helpfull than a teacher has a nice ability because at the end only the knowledge of  the students will be counted . agianst this argument its to say that teahcers who dont like you can decide against you be counting the grades and writing the end grade but that is often when the techears standing in the class is low and his influence also. In my view the perfect teacher is someone who has a great ability to  students and who can teach the students perfect for their restless school lifes and their future lifes . if this would be real the school life would be simply perfecct and easy for students. Back to the statement i would say that it is important to have a mixture of both thinks which were maintuned in the statement to achieve "The perfect teacher".
