Firstly the abilty to relate with the students is the key tho a good climate in the class. If the teacher does not have a good connection to the class, often the case is that the students are unconcentrated and don't bother themselfs to listen. The teacher is like a mirror to the students. If the teacher is strict from the first day on, the class will know that they have to behave and for this it's important for the teacher to be able to relate to the studnets

It must be stayed though that a teacher with great pedagogical skills but no knowledge, won't lead to a sufficiant education of the students. If the teacher can realte to the students but does not have any idea what she is talking about would be in the end contra productive.

I personally think that you can't say that one thing is more important than the other. A balance between both is the key to success as a teacher. You have control the class but at the same time you have to have a ceratain knowledge to educate the class in a way that's appropriate to the level of school.
