It is very important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject. he has to teach the subject to the students very well. Only when they get teached well they can become a good job where you need good marks. And when a teacher have no excellent knowledge about his subject how can get students a good abitur?
But teachers with excellent knowledge have not often the ability to relate well with students. And nobody listen to a teacher who can not relate well with students. So his excellent knowledge is not important. Also students need some fun to learn very well. The best way would be a teacher who has excellent knwoledge, he is a ``friend´´ for the students and he follows the most time the rules. A big problem is when the teacher have no excellent knwoledge, he can relate with students very well and he teach the students only bullshit. Then is his ability to relate well with students is not important. Yes the students will like this teacher because everything is easy. And yes a teacher is important who relate well with students and he teach them something for the life after school.
But in my mind a teacher with excellent knowledge is more important than a teacher who relate well with his students. Students go to school or to university to learn for their exams and not to find a ``friend´´ in their teacher.
Teachers who only teachs are for many students not so good. So i think also that a teacher who is kind of a friend or a teacher who teachs sometimes a bit easier is also important.
At the end I totally not disagree with the statement but knowledge is a bit more important.
