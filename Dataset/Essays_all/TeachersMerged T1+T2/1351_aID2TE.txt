The following statement is " A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subjec being taught".

I am not sure, because both of that are important.
A good relationship is good for both because if there questions or they have different opinions about a theme so they can easier talk  eachother. Another reason is that a student can learn better when the relationship  between them is good. But its important when you have some knowledge about the subject because it makes much easier the relationship between teacher and student. For example you have a teacher and he hasn´t a well relate with students but the students have a excellent knowledge of the subject. My conlusion is that the subject doesn´t make fun when the teacher hasn´t a well relate with students. So they don`t like eachother. But when the relate between them is good then they can have fun with the subject and so they can learn better and easier. Its much easier for the teacher because its for him easier to make the lesson and he knows that their relationship is good. And wheen it is not then he is every lesson under pressure to make a well lesson for his students and its hard for him to thing every time about the lesson or stundents.
So in the end  I agree the statement and accept it.
