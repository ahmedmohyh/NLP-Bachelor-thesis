What defines a good teacher?

Teaching at most schools, such as the Kantonsschule Wettingen, always gets rebuild to find the best and most comfortable way of studying for students. There are different thoughts of which way of teaching should be the best one. Most likely, people who analyse the forms of education are also trying to find a solution through teachers.

There are several options of a good teacher. One way of a good teaching form and ability to make the students be interested in the certain subject is, if the tutor has a huge know-how about what he is teaching the younger generation. Like that, the student recognizes the teacher as wisely and as an idol. He believes the words spoken by the teacher and eventually, has more fun by enlarging his knowledge about the specific subject.

On the other hand, humans tend to listen more to people they like and can emphasize with. In that case, a teacher who is showing his own interest to the subject doesn't actually mean that the students are able to study easier, but a teacher who acts like a human, like one of them. Here, the teacher should be in a easy relation with his students. Moreover, the certain classes would probably not only be about the subject by itself but also about generall all-day situations to relate better with the students.

After all, there is no right or wrong way of teaching, as every single person is different and furthermore, prefers another way of teaching. Me, I would choose the teacher with excellent knowledge, as he assures me of teaching me right in most of the time. Additionally the teacher's ability to relate well with students is hard to find, because obviously it will build a small gap between the good and funny teacher and just a friend, who then will have the same level as the student himself and won't be seen as a teacher anymore.
