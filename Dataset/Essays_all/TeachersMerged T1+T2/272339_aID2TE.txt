I think yes, it is more important for a student, when the teacher has the ability to relate well with students; at my own example, you can see that it is like this. I learn more and I want to learn more when I like the teacher. But when I don't like the teacher, I dont want to learn for this subject, even when teacher is a good at his subject and the subject is or could be interresting. When a student, exspecialy a young student, has a teacher who can relate very well with him, he wants to learn more about this subjekt even when the teacher has not an excellent knowledge of the subject. I think as a theacher you can't teach the students everything you know, because a teacher has mostly studied for years. He studied things the students don't have to know. Also when the teacher has anexcelent knwoledge of the subject, but he can't relate very well with the students, they will not be concentrated will not listen what the teacher says. But when a teacher can relate very well to his sudents, the students will listen to him and have fun by learning new things.
I think it's important that teachers can relate well with students and students well with teachers, so the students can learn new things and not be stressed the whole time because they don't like their teacher. But its also very important that the teacher has a knwoledge of his subjekt, it mustn't be an excellent knowledge, but the teacher has to know what he's teaching and he has to know the answers to the questions of the students. Because when a student knows, that the teacher can't answer his question, he will not pose a question any more and will be disinterrestet in the subjekt. But I think it's more important when a teacher and a student can relate very well, so the student can have fun by learning in a stressfull schoolday.
