I would say that there isn't a clear answer to this question. Both aspects are important. If the teacher doesn't relate well with his students, the konwoledge won't stick as much to the students as when the teacher has a great connection to them. If the lessons are no fun you will notice it at least when the students are writig an essay or an exam. The best mix is an informatif, fun lesson. There shouldn't be any pressure, because this would lead to stress. As a result the informations of the lesson won't stick as long to the brain. In fact the lesson should be creativ. Not just the teacher talking in front of the class. The teacher should use the new technologie as a help. Starting the lesson with a YouTube video would be a good solution. There should be a lot of interraction in groups, which leads to stuents improving their oral skills. In our lessons we aren't allowed talking german. If we break this rule, we have to pay fifty Rappen to our teacher. At the end of the year we are dining together and we pay with the money collected through this rule. It's a playfull way, leading the students to speak english to their neighbours even if it isn't about the lesson.
