First of all: Yes and no. I think it's very important that a teacher has the skills to relate well to all their students but how could he teach something to a student if he did't had any kind of excellent knowledge in his subject? I think first of all you have to have the ability to teach a subject, that means you should be very well educated and trained in all aspects of your subject. Then you can try to increase your social skills to teach your knowledge faster and more fun to your students. But you just can't be the coolest teacher in the world without knowing your subject well. That what its all about. You are a TEACHER. If you read the word "teacher" your can find the word "teach" in it. And "to teach" means to express your experiences and your knowledge to a person who hasn't already got through this process. So I personally think the best way to teach a subject is to do it with the right mix of kowledge and social skills. You don't have to be loved by all your students though but the important part is that they learn something for their lives. I think that is how it works i guess. I'm not a teacher, I'm a normal student who tries to do his best in an essay, but I kinda understand my teachers. I go to school for like 10 years now and I have had many teachers. Some where good and some where not really my favourite. But they all have something in common: They taught me something I can use in my live.
I've got now like 270 words but of course I have to write the right amount of words so the essay is complete and now I wish you a nice day reading hundereds of essays. XD
