A teacher should know his subject well and he should be aible to get his knowledge to the next generation.But besides the shoud be aible to realise that not every studend learns the same way. Sometimes there are teacher they don`t understand studens beacause the know the subject to good ,and the know to much. For them everything seams to be logical and make sense. But for us studens how maybe don`t know anything about it`s sometimes very complicated. We studens need somethimes someone who can teach us things the easiest and simpliest way to understand something. And to increase this it must be a teacher how understands his subject and undersand his studens and know how he must teach something that everybody in his classroom understands it.There`s a quoate from Albert Einstein and it says that if you want to learn something you must be aible to understands it the most simple way.I think that so true that if you are learing for a exam you must be ailbe to create a simple form of the things you have to learn because thats the only way you can be sure that you have understand the stuff you have to know. And thats the same thing with the teacher because a teacher can only teach his things if he understand his subject and he must understand how studens think and must be ailbe to explain this stuff to his studens that they will understand it for sure.
To my own smart oppinon im quitte sure that my own oppinon to this statement is clear because i already mention it in the upper part of my little essay.
