Since we are all still students we are confronted with teachers and at adaily basis so some of us may have the question, wether the teachers in schools should be either more relatable towards us students or to be more smart than relatable. So I decided to answer that exact question.
First of all i would say that it is of course important for teachers to have enough knowlegde to teach to ensure that all of the students can learn as much as possible, however it is not usefull if teachers posses a splendid knowlwegde but lack the ability to give that konwoledge to other people espacialy younger ones.
Moreover it could be possible that a teacher who is only focused on teaching the students and does not get along with his students might not be able to help the students if they have certain physicle or psychological issues and that is neither good for their educational process nor for their personal and social education, but if the teacher is too soft on their students or is relatable but not "hard" enough with their students they might loose their respect towards him and this would be bad for their learning process as well.
Another argument could be that teachers with very much knowlegde would expect too much from the children they teach and try to make them learn at a pace that is not fit for everyone or they could try to make them learn an amount of knowlegde the students can`t comprehend so in that case some students might get the idea of this teahcer being arrogant or not fit for teaching. Because of a constant feeling of not reaching their teachers expectations that could lead to them not exapting their teacher and therefore not listening to him or to the students being stressed and feeling pressured. Yet if a teacher relates very well with their students they might not be as neutral as they should be because they could get to like some students more than others or even classes and therefore their grades wouldn`t be fair any longer.
Looking back on all those arguments I would say that a healthy mix of knowlegde and the ability to relate is needed to teach children so the students can be good at the subjects and will not be pressured or socialy awkward in any way
