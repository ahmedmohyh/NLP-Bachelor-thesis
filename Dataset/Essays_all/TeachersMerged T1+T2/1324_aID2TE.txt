Is a teacher´s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?
In the following essay I will give you my own opinion about this statement.
One the one hand it´s good, when a teacher knows everything of the subject, so you can be sure you get everything that you must know. But it´s also really difficult to follow a lesson, when a teacher teach things you never heard about and he can´t really explain it. It will be also a big problem,when you´re bad in a subject and the teacher might can not relate well with the students, so you never get all informations and you will always have that problem.
One the other hand it´s also good, when the teacher relate well with students. That can might be more important for the final exam. In the lessons you have the chance to understand everything he or she is talking about and that´s why you´re propably more informated for the exams. Another important fact is, that you can be better in this subject, because the teacher give all of the students the time to learn things, they need to. And that can be positiv for a classtest or everything else. For example, you can be more relaxed, because you have a better understandig of the subject being taught.
To put it in a nutshell, I think it´s quite more important to have a teacher with the ability to relate well with students. It can help the students a lot in their time at school and also in their life after. But it´s also important that a teacher has the right knowledge of the subject. Both abilities must work together to be a good teacher.
