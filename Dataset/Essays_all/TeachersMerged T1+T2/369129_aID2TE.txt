I disagree and agree with this following statement in a diffrent way. It is very important for students to have a good teacher. But what is a good teacher and how does he behave? For me a good teacher is someone who is able to understand your mistakes but not only on a schoollevel. I do think that your teacher should also be able to see when someone of their students is going through a very hard time in their life. So it's also important to care for students and to see how they feel in the way they act in school. But they should not only see it and recognize it they should also react on it and try to help their students. It doesn't really matter if the problem is a problem in algebra or a problem in the family it still is a problem in their lifes. I think the best thing would be that the students tell their teachers why they can't focus on school and why they have problems to be focused in class. But then again the teacher has to be very reliable and open towards them. So this is the reason why I kind of agree with this sentence but otherwise the second part is also very important. Why should someone want to be tought by someone who doesn't have a clue what they are doing or saying? Why should someone want to go to school when they know they are not gonna learn something from this teacher? Of course here they talk about "excellent knowledge" but I do think that this is also a very important aspect. In my opinion every student deserves a teacher who has a excellent knowledge because then the student will be able to know more things and learn more things. So isn't this what school is all about? To learn as much as you can? So how could you learn a lot when your teacher has a small knowledge? As you can see while reading my essay I do disagree and agree because I think both statements are very important for the students.
