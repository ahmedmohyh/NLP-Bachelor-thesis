In my opinion the knowledge of the teacher is more important. It's important that a teacher knows about the subject he is teaching. It's not necessary that he has an excellent knowledge but at least it's important that he knows more than the students he is teaching. Otherwise he wouldn't be able to teach students stuff which they didn't already know all about.
But I wouldn't say that having the ability to relate with students is not importent at all. For me it's a kind of a bonus if a teacher has this ability and it makes him an even better teacher. If a teacher can relate with students he understands them better and knows how to teach them things in a way the students can understand. 
A teacher with the ability to relate well with students is also more likely to be love by the students. Which leads to the point that students listen and also learn more. The students know that their teacher understands and can relate with them.
