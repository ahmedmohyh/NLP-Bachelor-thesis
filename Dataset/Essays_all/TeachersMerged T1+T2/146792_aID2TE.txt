In the following argument the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" will be discussed. Is it really like this? Which skills are more important?

I think without social skills it's nearly impossible to teach good, because you have not a great communication between teacher and students. And without that, you cannot act well with them.
Another point of view is, when you relate well with students they trust you more and take you serious. When they do not take you serious it is really hard to teach when nobody cares.

But on the other hand how could you be a good teacher without knowledge of your subject? The students come to school to learn something new, they ask questions about things they did not know before and are very interested if it is their favorite subject. So it is very important to be able to answer these questions. I think you do not have to know everything but the bigger the knowledge the better for the students and also for yourself.

To sum up I would say both skills are important because it goes hand in hand with each other and I think when you have both you can be a better teacher than having only one skill.
If I had to choose the more important one, I would definitely say that knowledge is the better thing. The teacher is the one who has to make students more intelligent and maybe prepare them for university. So the ability to relate well with students would be more an addition to the knowledge which has to be the main skill.
