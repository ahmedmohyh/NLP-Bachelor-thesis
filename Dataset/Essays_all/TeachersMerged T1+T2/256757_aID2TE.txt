As a teacher you need both, a good relationship with the students and an excellent knowledge to teach about a specific subject.You need a sertain knowledge to teach student about a subject. The more you know, the better you can explain the subject. For that you need to study. This knowledge you get by studiying at a univeristy and reading books by hard. It is something that takes years to lern. But a good relation to students is not something you can study. You learn it trough experiences and interactions with the students. Every teacher starts at the beginning. The more they teach, the better they get to relate well with the stundets. Of corse there are teachers who have a natural talent for social interaction, but if you decide to become a teacher you will need a stertain talent.

I myself had both teachers. The one who had an excellent knowledge and the one who could relate well with students and I have to say, that I did not like eather of the. I only had few teacher who had a nice balance of both. And these teachers where my favourites. I like the fact that you can learn a lot from them and that the lessons are extremly interesting. If my teachers is interested in me and cares that I learn something diyuring the lessons, I am much more willing to participate and to be a good student myself.
