In the following essay I want to point out what the most important ability of a teacher is. In the statement it is either the knowledge of the subject or how he or she relate with the students.
If a teacher actually don't really understand the subject it can be quite hard to explain it to the class. As an example in a situation where the teacher just hand in a dossier an other one wrote and let the students fill it out, but he actually doesn't understand everything. But this excellent knowledge isn't usefull if you can't explain it correctly. For example if the teacher is speaking too fast or just on a too high level, for everyone it's hard to focus on the subject. So if a teacher relate well with his students, the last point is way easier. The teacher knows the students better, as well as vice-versa. The students realise if the teacher has got the ability to relate well and they listen to him in an other way. 
In my opinion both are important because of the simple fact that if he doesn't know enough about a subject he might not be able to answer questions. On the other hand the ability to relate well and harmonate with the students is as essential as the first point. So when the teacher has both, the students like it more to go to his lessons.
