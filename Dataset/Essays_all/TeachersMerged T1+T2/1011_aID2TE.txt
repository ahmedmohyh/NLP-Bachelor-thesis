Is knowledge more important than the ability to relate with students? A good question which answer might sound obviously but actually it is a good theme to discuss about.

A teacher is not a teacher if he does not know how to get along with people. Espacially the relationship between teacher and student can be important for students motivation. A good teacher can bring any student into following his lesson.
On the other hand it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the subject which is taught. A selfconfident teacher is really important because otherwise students won´t let the teacher taught. A good relationship between student and techer might motivate and make the lessons more interesting but in the end one can`t teach something without an excellent knowledge. How one can see the most loved subjects are the one which are taught by one`s favorite teacher. Even if his knowledge is not perfect the student will follow the lessons and informate himself in the end. This is a good example to show that teachers do not have to know everything because if they  bring students into falling for a subject they will learn it on their own.

Finally I can say that it changes a lot if the teacher has got a good reltationship with his class. From my own experiences I can say that the marks depend a lot on the relationship with the teacher. A good reltionship had motivated me to follow and to participate during lessons. To sum up I think that it must be a good mixture made out of knowledge and the ability to relate because without the knowledge how to relate well it is not possible to teach someone anything. That`s what a good teacher is made of.
