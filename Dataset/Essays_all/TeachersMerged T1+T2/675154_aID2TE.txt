There are lot of different types of teachers. Some have the ability to relate well with students and others have an excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. But is it in the end really more important to have a teacher's ability to relate well with students? 

First of all it's important to have a good atmosphare in the class. And for this it's better to have a teacher who relate well with the students. A good atmosphare has a big influence of the learn ability of students. If they like the teacher and they feel comfortable in the class they do more for the school because they enjoy to learn new stuff. 

But on the other hand it's very important that the teacher knows a lot about a subejct. Because the students are in school to learn something. And than it doesn't really matters if the teacher is nice when the students don't know more at the end of a school year than at the beginning. So the knowledge of a teacher is very important.

For my opinion I think it doesnt't really matter if a teacher has the ability to relate well with student or if the teacher has an excellent knowledge. In the end it's important to have both. A teacher just who is friendly but knows nothing isn't a good teacher. And also a teacher who knows a lot but is mean is also not a good teacher. I think this statement is really wrong. For me a good teacher has to know a lot and has to be friendly. But the most important thing a teacher has to be is that he also knows how to give this huge knowledge he has to me. Because I go to school to learn something. And as long as I learn a lot I don't care if the tacher is nice or not to me.
