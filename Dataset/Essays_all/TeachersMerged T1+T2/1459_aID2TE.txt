I disagree with the statement because in my opinion both skills are very important for teaching students. The ability to relate well with them is important because an excellent knowledge of a subject is not enough to teach somebody. The relation between the teacher and the students should be good because a bad relation could cause that they disrespect each other and that the stundents start to dislike the subject and they will lose their motivation. When they disrespect each other or the students lose their motivation thee cause would be that they would not like to learn anymore and the teacher would not like to teach them so the quality of the lesson would not be good. On the other hand the ability to relate well with the students would catch the attention of the most or maybe of all students and a teacher has always the possibility to prepare the lessons and to increase his knowledge about the topic. The problem is that he could not answer every question of the students without being prepared when his knowledge is not well. So an effective teacher needs both skills to creaate a good lesson and to catch the attention of the students.
