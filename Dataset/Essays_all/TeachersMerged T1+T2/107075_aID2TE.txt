A teacher's main purpose is to teach his students everything about his subject that they need to know to pass tests and eventually graduate. There are different ways to do that. He can for example hand out worksheets and let them teach themselves. Or he can make presentations. These are just some of many different ways. If he relates well to students, their motivation to work will be higher than with other teachers that don't relate well with them. That paired with self-teaching could make the students learn very good. The downside of that is, if the teacher has a class that does not take school seriously at all, he will be virtually powerless. There, the opposite way of teaching comes into play, where the teacher's knowledge of his subject is much more important. The teacher stands in front of the class and presents it a certain topic ideally with the help of a presentation. If the teacher doesn't know his facts very well, he will not be able to answer any questions that a student might have. With a presentation, and a topic that is rather small however, there aren't many questions to ask. Therefore the relation between student and teacher is more important. The importancy is also dependent on the subject, that the teacher teaches. When teaching a language, it's not as important to know it extremely well, because there are rules that can be relied on. In physics thats different, because there the rules are not always obvious and sometimes exercises require a lot of creativity to solve. There it's important, that the teacher know exactly what works and what doesn't.
A teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important than his knowledge of the subject he's teaching, if that subject requires simple studying instead of creativity, because it boosts the student's motivation. Everywhere else knowledge is more important.
My answer is yes, because the big part of
