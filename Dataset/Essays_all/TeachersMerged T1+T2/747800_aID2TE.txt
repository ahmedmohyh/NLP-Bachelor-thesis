Very often, the relationship between student and teacher is not very good. On one hand the teacher maybe does not like the student because he is talking and interrupting the class all day, on the other hand the student maybe does not like the teacher because he is not comfortable with the way the teacher is teaching a specific subject. These are just some reasons there is no "perfect" relationship between student and teacher.

So, what is more important? The ability to teach subjects perfectly to give the students the best knowledge for their future life, or the possibility to relate well with all students and be more interesting.
The biggest and almost the only reason why people visit school is because they want to learn something new. It is hard for every teacher to give the students the knowledge they want in a easy, interestig and excellent way. On one side, if it is just interesting and easy it may not be excellent taught. On the other side the subject may not be interesting if it is taught very detailed. The teacher needs to decide how to work with his students. Maybe he or she wants to have a great relationship with his or her students, mabye he or she doesnt want a relationship with the students and only teach them the subjects they need to know. To relate well with the students and teaching them the subjects in an amazing way is very hard and mostly there is a focus needed on one of these two ways of teaching.
I think it is better to relate well with the students because it is more fun for the teacher and more fun for the students.

In conclusion every teacher needs to know
