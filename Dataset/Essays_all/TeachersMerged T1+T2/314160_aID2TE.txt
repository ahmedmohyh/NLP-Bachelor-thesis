It is a often discussed question if it is more important that a teacher relates well with the students or that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject.

In my opinion it is very important that a teacher relates well with the students. If the teacher can not deal with children, they do not explain their problems. Especially in primary school it is important that the children can talk to their teacher and discuss their problems. If a student for example does not have a good mark and he can not talk to the teacher, he could be very nervous in the following exam and maybe gets another bad mark. 
The teacher is an idol of this children and they must be able to rely on this person. The teacher is also the person who connects the class. If the teacher does not have a good relation to the students. They can not solve problems in the class. Furthermore the students are not motivated to learn, if the teacher does not relate well with the students. 

But it surely is also important that the teacher knows his or her subject very well. Especially in secondary schools, the students go their own way and they need a person who can teach the subject very well. The students are able to solve their problems on their own. 

I think both it is importantant, to relate with the students and to know the subject. It depends on how old the students are. In primary school it is much more important to relate well with the students but it is not that difficult to know the subject that the students have to know. In secondary school it is easier to relate with the students, because they are able to come up for themself but it is hard to know the subject.
