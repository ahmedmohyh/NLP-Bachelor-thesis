The most important fact in case you disagree with the thesis is that a teacher can be the friendliest and nicest of his kind but if he has no clue what he is doing and no clue at all about the subject he is teaching the pupils will not learn anything about the subject, but at least about a friendly living style. That means that every teacher has to have the ability to teach his knowledge about the subject he is teaching to the pupils. Furthermore, in case nobody likes the teacher because he is very unfriendly and unfair, the pupils may not even listen to him because they do not take him serious. But this is depending very hardly on the age and grade of the pupils. For example, some pupils from the tenth class do not take the Latin lessons serious, especially if they have a teacher which is not that friendly in relation with his pupils, though they will not have Latin in the eleventh or twelvth class again and the tenth class not relevant for the a levels. In my opinion a teacher is better if he has semi good abilities to relate well with students and a semi good knowledge of the subject he is going to teach. This is the better option than a teacher who is either very friendly or has very good knowledge of the subject he is teaching. But in my opinion the most important ability is that the teacher is very good in teaching pupils things because a teacher can be the new Albert Einstein or so and despite that he is a bad teacher if he cannot share parts of his knowledge with the pupils. And if the teacher is super friendly but cannot teach you anything, he is also useless.
