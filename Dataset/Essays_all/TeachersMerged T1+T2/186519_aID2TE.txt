Everyone questioned onetimes himself what a good teacher is. What should he have? Should he has an excellent knowledge of a subject being taught or is it more important that he has the ability to relate well with students?

I do not know if I agree with the statement or if I disagree. My opinion is splitted in two different parts. It is very important that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught because if he has not he cannot teach you something. In the other hand it is important that a teacher's ability to relate well with students, because otherwise the students cannot learn from you well. They are very fast bored or something else. I think the best solution is when both, the teacher's ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is in a balance, because both subjects are very important for a good teacher and for a good school lesson. If a teacher just has an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught then he is not a good teacher because he has the knowledge but he has not the ability to teach the students and in consequence, the students know after a lesson as much as they know before a lesson. They have learned nothing. And if the teacher's ability to relate well with students but the teacher has not an excellent knwoledge of the subject being taught the lesson is very good created but the studens learn nothing too because the teacher has no knowledge of the subject being taught.

Without an healthy balance between this two abilities the students cannot learn anything. I think each subject is as important
