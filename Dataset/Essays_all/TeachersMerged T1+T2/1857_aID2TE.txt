Is a teachers ability to relate well with students more important than excellenz knowledge of the subject being taught ? I think you can not say yes or no because it depends on the knowledge the teacher has. If the knowledge is very bad than it is also bad for the kids because they do not learn the things they need for the A-Levels. And when the teacher has not enough knowledge it would be a taff thing for the students to write a classtest about it. But also it is importent that the teachers are a bit closer to the students and that they can understand them. But is is risky. If they are to close it would not be good too. But if I only have the chance of one "type" I might choose the second one. Because then the lessons are easier to pass. And also when the knowledge is not the best but it is okey than it is also good for me because I better learn things while having fun. I think every ex-student knows the lessons where you just sit there waiting till the lesson is over and thats probably the badest way to learn something. So at the end for me personally is the ability to relate well more important then the knowledge but it must be a bit knowledge and not completely nothing. So you can say the best way to teach your students is a mixture of the ability to relate well and have good knowledge about the subject being taught.
