On one hand I agree because how should a teacher be a good teacher, when he has no good social relations. A teacher has to be able to talk to students aswell as relating with them. It is very important that teachers know what they are talking about but at the same time also being able to have an argue with their students. On the other hand i do not agree because if a teacher just talk the whole lesson and does not answer any questions in that time because he is so focused on teaching his knowledge, I think that is very counter productive. If a teacher does not even know excactly about his subject then good social abilities will not bring him further.
