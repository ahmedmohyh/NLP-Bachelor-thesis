Excellent knowledge or a good realtion to the students?

There are different ways to think about the statement that a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
If a teacher has excellent knowledge, the students will learn a lot. But the way how the teacher teach is very important too. Teaching by only stand in front of the class and talk the whole lesson without making a break or including the students is in my opinion the wrong way. 
On the one hand a teacher can reach with knowledge of the subject being taught, that the students have respect about the things he or she knows. But on the other hand I think that students will learn only something, if they have a good relation to their teachers. There couldn´t be a good result, if the students aren´t motivated to go to school. 
Another important point is that teachers can teach better with their experiences than with their knowledge. It means that teachers act as role models. Not only with what they do in school. The students are interested in their lifes and in their free-time, I think. 
So in my opinion the statement is right. Teachers have to be motivated in teaching children and students. The aim has to be a good relation to the scholars so that they can learn a lot more about social life which is more and more important in our society. If they don´t like them or they are only interested in money, the job as a teacher is absolutely wrong.
