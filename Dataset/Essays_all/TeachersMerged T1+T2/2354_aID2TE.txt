Today i will discuss the question, whether it is more important, that the teachers relate good with students, than that they have a good knowledge of the subject they teach. There are different opinions about this question and each of them has some strong arguments to show itself.

 On the side, that has the opinion that it's more important to relate good with the students, than having a good knowledge about the subject, we have some arguments like that the teacher has to reach the students, to secure that they learn something from him. The teachers have to be able to transport the message. On the other side we have some arguments like that the message has to be good, the teacher transports. Because what does it help to be good in transport information, if the information is just wrong? It does not help anything. The teachers have to study the subject they want to teach, to become a good teacher. They will lead a part of the next generation in one of its subjects, so they have to know what they do and how they do it. 

 I am not able to say that one of the two things is better than the other. On my opinion, Its the ability to know about the things you teach and to be able to let the students understand them, that makes you to a good teacher. You can't teach very good, if you are just doing well in one of this aspects. Like it is so often the mix makes the best result.
