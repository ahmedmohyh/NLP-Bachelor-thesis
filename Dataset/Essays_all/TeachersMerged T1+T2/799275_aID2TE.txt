On one hand, it is very important to relate well with students. On the other hand, a teacher without knowledge of the subject being taught, is rather useless. What we need is a well balance between knowledge and the ability to relate well with student. The teacher should be able to teach the right thing, and bring the subject to the student, in advantage they learn something. A teacher with excellent knowledge but no idea how to bring the subject to the students, is es bad as the other example. He might not tell rubbish to the students but talking and teaching like a professor at an university doesn't help anyone. Teachers with the perfect talent of bringing their subject understandable to their students, but having no clue of what they're talking about are also very well known.

In my few years being a student, I have experienced nearly every kind of teacher. For example, at the secondary class (college) I had a teacher who taught the subject completely understandable and idotic compatible, but talked such a rubbish that I got headake. In my opinion, it's better to have a teacher who teaches at a high level and kinda talks mysterious of his subject, than having a teacher like I had at the secondary. The university-professor-like teacher is a challenge to understand, and because I like challenges, it's just predictable that I'd rather sit in a lesson understanding nothing and trying to understand until I do, than feeling back to the kindergarten and being bored by the nonsense the schoolbook-teacher (how I call them) talks about. The way many different students think, may be also important. But that makes school interesting.
