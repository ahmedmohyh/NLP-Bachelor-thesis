Fun won't get you anything. Many people say that your school life has to be followed by fun, love and not having to worry too much. There's also an opinio of not stressing the students too much. Today many teachers don't act as conservative as they were 40 years back. They do also have a different relationship to their students. They wen't with the flow of society and are way more open. But is this really helpful for the education of our children.

Today almost everyone can be a teacher. You just have to visit some schools and go to some meetings and after that you will be able to work as a teacher. But our children grow up in a time where education and a huge knowledge is very important for their working life. But today there are working way too many kind people as teachers while they aren't made for this job. They worked in another job for years and have a lack of knowledge. To compensate this lack of knowledge they are nice tho their students what leads to the point that the students are not willing to do anything - they get too comfortable. The students won't do their homework anymore and they won't learn anything. I think it's very important to put a teacher in front of a class who has a huge knowledge of the subject he or she teaches. They shouldn't be too nice to their students and just teach their subject. They have to put some pressure on the students that they are ready for their later on life. If they don't learn how to work with stress, they will be lost in their life. If teachers like the subject that they will have fun in their profession and bring this spirit to the people.
