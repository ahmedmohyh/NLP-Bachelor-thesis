'A teacher´s abilitiy to relate well with students is more  important taht excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.', that is what the statement says. But is that true? In the following I will show on same agruments for and against it.

When the teacher is better to relate with us students, it is better for the air in our class, so you look forward to go to the class with teacher. Also a good point is that you would look forward to learn for this subject more than for the others with a theacher who it much more strict. Also this one teacher would better your mind to school, so that you would look forward to go to school and learn and have with it a better education. 
Studens are the most time of there life in school, some days till three or longer, it is like a secound home for them and when there would just be teacher, who are just strict and not kind it is not nice for them and they would not like the school, more than yet. When the teacher is insted a bit kind and also maybe a bit like a friend you would lookward for it. 
For some students the teacher can be also a person, where you would go when you are in trouble, like you were hurt in school or something like taht. When the teacher has no ability to relate with the students, the students would not go to them and the trouble would not stop.
On the other hand it could be difficult that the teacher has nto a knowlegd about his own subject, because we students can not decid what it rigth or what is wrong in this subject and we will need this for our education-test at the end of the school. When he do not have such a big knowledg about his subject, he would not able to teach us. 

All in all Iwould say that the teacher has to have a good knowledg about what he teach us, but also he hase to be kind and a bit like a friend to the studens for the good air in the school, so that the studens want to go school but themself, not because they have to.
