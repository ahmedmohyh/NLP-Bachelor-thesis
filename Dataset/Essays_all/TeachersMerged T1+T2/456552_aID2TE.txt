I agree that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Its important for the teacher to have a good relationship with students. If you like your teacher you automatically start to like your subject. And the same in the other way; if you hate your teacher you automatically start to hate their su Its easier to learn things and to have fun in the class. The students are motivated to do their homework and to prepare for the next lesson. 
Example: Your history teacher is a very boring person because he never does something cool or something different in class. He just works trought the things he has to do with his students in a year. The teacher doesn't even try to remember the names of his students and never talks to them. So the students automatically start to dislike him and they never like to go to the history lessons. As a result you begin to hate this subject. If you hate something you are not motivated to learn it for the test. At the end you get bad marks because you have a bad experience with this teacher and his subject. 
I can relate to that because I experienced this by myself. Three years ago I had a teacher who always laughed and was positiv, made funny jokes with the students, was very easy-going and had the interest to talk to us in class; he related well with us students. With the smalltalks in the class we could practice our English and tried hard. I was motivated to have good marks and to be active in the lessons, because I liked my teacher and I wanted to show him that I am good in his subject. 
It is important for a student to get on well with teachers and to feel good in the class. I think the best advice I can give to a teacher is that a good atmosphere in the school helps the students to be motivated to learn things and try their best.
