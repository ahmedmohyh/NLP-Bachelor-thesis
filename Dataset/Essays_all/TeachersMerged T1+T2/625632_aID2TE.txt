In primary school important subjects are not as hard to understand as in secondary school and there are just basics but still the teacher has to know about what he or she is going to teach. The main subjects in primary school like math or in Switzerland where I grew up German, are as important as relations between humans. But right now here at college-like schools techer should just focus on their subjects. A good relationship between teacher and student is still very important but in the end grades count and not 'how well do I relate with my teacher' even if the importance of grades for our future is not that high. For our future it would be more important to know how to relate greatly with for example your boss. 

Furthermore every theacher should know how to talk with your students but I think the further you get in educational level the more important is the knoledge and less important is the relationship between teacher and student. But even if it is not that important anymore the teacher has to know how to make stdents interrested in his own subject and I think at my level this is the biggest problem ever French teacher has.

In the end I think it is very hard to answer the question. But I think I partly agree to the statement because it is important that teacher relate well with their students but its importance gets smaller the further you get on educational level which I think is sad because in our lifes after school and university it is more important to relate well with others in our job than just being extraordinary in everything we do. We need to find an averige between learning to relate well and learning how to be great in our professional life. And to bring this to an end want to add that grades are to important in our society because no one is going to ask you after university with which grade you passed but your social competences need to be aprooved.
