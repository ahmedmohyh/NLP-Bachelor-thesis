Ability to relate or knowledge

What characteristic of a teacher is more important for students to improve as much as possible in school? I'll discuss whether it's the ability to relate well with students or to have a great knowledge of the specific subject. There is no doubt that a teacher needs to have a excellent knowledge, especially in higher schools. I'd say a teacher who teaches to children who are in their obligatoy school time have to have a certain ability to relate to children and try to make it as easy and relateable for them. But on the other hand a student who's visiting a non-obligatory school such as a college or university have to be able to understand their subjects even if their teacher/professor might not be very good at relating with students. I'd underline this argument with the facts that a student at a college (Kanti) or university has made his choice to go there and from "school level" to "school level" the "distance" between teacher/professor and students always gets larger. But still, I think the ability to relate well to the students is an important ability a teacher should have because it's his job to teach them as good as possible.

To sum it up, a teacher should have a certain skill in relating to their students but this ability should never compensate any lack of knowledge of the specific subject. In my opinion it's more important for teachers who are working with younger children to relate well than a teacher/professor at a college or university.
