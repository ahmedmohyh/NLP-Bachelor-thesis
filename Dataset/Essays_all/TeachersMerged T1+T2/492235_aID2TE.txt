It is an old story. A remarcable teacher in his subject, an expert on his field but no communication skills. Something a lot of students complain about. Specially in the subject math. At this point peoplte ask the question, wether it is more important to have a teacher which knows how to communicate with his students and can explain difficult tasks in a easy way, but may perhaps not know all the details of the subject. 
Communication is the base of a effective education. It is essantial to our schoolsystem. So when a teacher isn`t able to explain something in a reasonable way, all his knowledge is no use to him nor his students. Sometimes a teacher who lakes in knowledge has an advantage over the expert, because he knows which points of a matter are the key points which are difficult to understand and therefore must be explained more carefully.
On the other you cant`t just hire a teacher who can talk good, but has no idea what he is talking about. Furthermore you can argument, that it is a must for a teacher to know every detail of his subject in order to make connections between different kind of matters or to break it down to an easier level. 
All in all what you need is a mix of both, knowledge and social skills to connect with the students in order to have  effective lessons.
