Education is one of the most important things of human civilization. To ensure a high level of education many teachers are needed. 

Before you try to explain or teach a subject a perfect knowledge is the most important. Without this it will be impossible to answer all the question or even to be authentic. I would not believe a teacher who isn't even sure about the subject he taughts. To garantee a high quality education, a high level of knowledge is required.
On the otther side it is also very important to relate well with the students. Otherwise they will get bored easily. So a teacher needs to understand what is going on in a class, what is already there and what do the students need. A teacher has to try to teach as interesting as possible. Once a student gets bored in a subject he will never be interested again. 

I think it needs both, the perfect knowledge and a really good intercourse with the students. If a teacher has not the required knowledge, he is really bad at his job. And if he can't relate to all the students, there is no chance how he can teach them his subject or even fascinate them for it.
