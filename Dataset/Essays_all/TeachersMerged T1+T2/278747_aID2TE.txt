If a teacher relates well with students, an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches is less important. Because students get a better commitment for school and a teacher like this encourage the students more. 


First it is more fun to study with your friends than alone and if your teacher is your friend he will encourage you to study like a friend and he can also give you advises.An upside is that the students are not under pressure if the teacher relates well with them. So you feel welcome in your class and maybe you will get on better with your class. 

Something positive is also that students can tell everything what is on their mind without being afraid of if the teacher is going to tell them off for doing this. Because your friend would not, either.
By the way, you get the feeling that your class is one team and your teacher is the leader, not the boss.

On the other side, the biggest disadvantage is that the teacher could teach the subject wrong if he does not have an excellent knowledge about the subject. And to be honest, your teacher is not your best friend. He is being paid for teaching you right so he can not be your best friend if your parents are paying him or her.

An other downside is that the school should prepare you for going to university, not for having fun. You could easily mess up at university or college if a subject has not been taught right.


My opinion is that a teacher should be nice to you but he also has to teach you your subject right. It is about your future and your teacher has to know everything about the subject he's teaching. If you ask me, the these is wrong. Who is going to answer your questions if nobody has the perfect knowledge of the subject? To conclude school is not fun. You go to school to study and learn new things. And if a teacher is not teaching well than you are prepared badly for your future, no matter if you are going to college or university.
