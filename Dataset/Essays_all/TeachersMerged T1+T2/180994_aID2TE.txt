I mostly agree with this statement.
I think it's really important that a teacher can relate with the students. Because otherwise he can't explain his knowledge to the students. He has to be able to express himself in a way his students understand him or her. If he isn't able to do so, it doesn't matter how deep his knowledge is because if the students are not able to understand what he is trying to say it doesn't matter what he is saying.
But if he or she is able to explain his knowledge to the students and to relate with them it is important that (s)he has a great knowledge. It has to be deep in his own subject but it also has to be there in other subjects. I think more knowledge can bring him also more respect. But this will only be the case if he is able to show this knowledge to the students.
I also think students learn better if they like the subject and the teacher and also if they find the things which are said interesting. In my opinion this comes from the fact that they listen better. Because of that they can think back at some situations in which they learned something and don't have to think back at boring lessons.
For example: I really like my economics teacher and when I'm trying to learn for the economics test  can think back to some funny moments in class in which I learnd what I need to know for the test. Otherwise e.g. in french  have to learn the vocab and stuff all myself which is very boring.
