There is this interesting thinking about teachers. I think you should differ in this question. There is the option, that you have two teachers, for example maths, one is like best friends with all the students, and he is abled to tell them how thinks work really easy, but he knows not more about the topics then his students, and the other one is the best maths genie and got many prices for his important work, but he is not abled to imagine how two explain things to some people with an as low intelligence as his students. In this case i would not any both of them work on my school if it would be my choice. But there could be also the choice between one teacher who is nice to his students, and when they listen to him, he can explain things good enaugh to unterstand it with the first try, but he doesn't know everything about his topics and needs help from the internet or some kind of helping books every lesson, and another teacher who is really interessed in his topics, knows them really well and is just bad at explaining, so he has to explain things at least twice so everyone understands it. On one hand, i think the teacher should know everything about his topic because he is getting paid for it, and if not, the students could use the same helping books as the teacher to learn their topics, but on the other hand i think it would be really annoying if i would have to listen to the same things twice ore even more often. If the teacher is good at explaining and helps himself with books and the internet about his little issues i would have to listen everything just once or maybe twice. Furthermore, there is the problem, that you can learn more easily if you like the teacher, and every student i know likes teachers who are abled to relate well with them more than teachers who are not. So everything summed up, I prefer the teachers ability to relate well with students over his excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
