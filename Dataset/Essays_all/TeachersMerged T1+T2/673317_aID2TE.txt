Children in school often like some teachers, but they also can't stand out some. But is the relation between the teachers and the students more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

If you have a good relation to a teacher you might be more motivated to go to the lessons, but also to participate more while the lessons. Because when you like a teacher, for example how he make the lessons or just his character, it's quite likely that you're also more familiar with the subject being taught.

But what is when the teacher isn't able to teach the subject in a way, where you can understand everything. For example when he doesn't have an excellent knowledge of what he teaches. So what is the advantage when you have a good relation with your teachers but they can't teach you anything? There isn't any.

Another point of view is, when you hate a teacher and don't like to go to his lessons. Here it doesn't depand on how good a teacher can teach you a topic and how his knowledge of this subject is. Because when you don't like a teacher you might also hate his lessons and you might not be interrested in what he teaches you. So a bad relation to a teacher can end in not participating in the lessons.

But how many students have a bad relation with their teachers? It always depands on the teachers and the students, but in general you can say that most of the students accept a teacher and that they would like to attend his lessons. A much bigger problem comes up if the teacher doesn't even now exactly about what he teaches, if he isn't able to teach the subject in an excellent way. So most of the students might not be able to understand this uzbject.

All in all I can say that the relation between teachers and students is important, but it's much more important that the teachers have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
