In my opinion the statements is not clearly wrong ore wright. I think both sides are very important. It is important to relate well with students, that they can trust the teachers and feel safe when they are with them. I think it is important, than there is a good atmosphere in the class, while learning. When everybody is in a good mood they can learn faster and with more motiavation. But if the teacher is only well related and has no knowledge about the subjects, he can´t teach the students very well too. You must understand the topic o explsin it to others. 
But i have to agree, that only much knowledge isn´t the perfect ability for beeing a teacher. 
A good teacher should be able to do both at once. For example i had a teacher, who knew very much, he was a very intelligent person. But he wasn´t able to explain the things to the pupils. Also he doesn´t understand, when anybody didn´t understand the topic and got in bad mood. 
An other teacher i had was very funny. Every student had to laugh about his jokes and everybody was in a good mood at his lessons, but nobody learned anything, because the teacher had so less knowledge about his subject.
I think both teachers aren´t perfect. A combination of both would be better.
