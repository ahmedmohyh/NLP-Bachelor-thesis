The relationship from a teacher to a student is of course a really important thing in school. But I don't think that it is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In some situations you need a teacher as a friend. But that doesn't mean that you have to be best friends with the teacher.
In class it could be a huge help if you relate well with your teacher to get great notes. But those note you can get aswell if the teacher has excellent knowledge of the things he should teach you and teaches you those things well.
So, as you see, there are a lot of arguments for and against the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".
First I'll tell you a pro argument. 
In some cases it is a really good help to get along well with teacher. For example if you are not the best in some in classes, you can get great notes, too, because of your good relationship with the teacher. 
But it has also some negative arguments. 
At the end of your school life, when you're writing your "Abitur" you have to be on the same level as other students and if your teacher just tried to be the cool, friendly teacher, but forget to teach you the important stuff, you might fail. 
In my opinion it is more important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject that he should taught you than your well realtionship with him, because in the end you might fail for not being taught everything.
