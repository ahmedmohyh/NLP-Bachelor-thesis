Being a teacher requires not only knowledge to be thaught, but also social skills. Nevertheless as a teacher, you are surounded by people. 
The teachers could have excellent knowledge about the current topic and could talk for hundred hours straight about it, but who would be listening to that? An important part is how the teacher presents that material to the students. The key is to keep the students interested, therefore they need to interact with them. This takes not only knowledge, but mostly an ability to relate with the students. They need to be aware of their attention span and if they are actually listening to them or thinking about the lunch, they are going to be having. A student can learn as much with a teacher who just read a book about the topic for the first time, as with one who wrote that book for that topic. Because where the teacher with not as much knowledge succeded, is in this ability to relate and to make the students keep that shared information in their heads. Students are no robots that can just take up all informations at once. They also need time to process and to think about for themselves. A teacher who knows that, can make use of it and be successful at his job.
