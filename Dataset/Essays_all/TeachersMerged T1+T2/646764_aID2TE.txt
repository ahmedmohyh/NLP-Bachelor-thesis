A teacher's knowledge concerning his subject is very important, if he does not know his subject he can't teach anyone. Still; lacking knowledge can be compensated by careful preparation of the lessons. The lessons might even be better that way, since a lack of preparation makes a lesson boring. No one will pay attention in a boring lesson. To make a lesson interesting  it needs to be adapted to the class. What good is absolute knowledge if no one pays attention? If  the students don't pay attention the teacher's knowledge is wasted. A teacher who can relate with his students and knows what they need can create a good lesson without knowing what he is talking about. A good lesson is still worth little if no one can profit from it. For anyone to profit from a lesson the teacher needs to have a certain understanding of his subject. At this point it is improtant to say, that knowledge is not the same as understanding. With other words, a teacher doesn't need excellent knowledge of his subject if he understands it and knows where to get the knowledge he needs. The lack of skills in terms of people can not be compensated. A teacher can be brilliant at his subject, but if he doesn't know how to make his lessons interesting enough to get his students to pay attention all his skills are wasted. The ability to relate with students is not the same thing as knowing how to create an interresting lesson and is not by far as important, but still is more important than excellent knowlegde of his subject.
