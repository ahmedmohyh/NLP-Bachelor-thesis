It is proven that students learn better in a good environement, where they feel encouraged to learn rather than pressured. Also an environement where they can feel free to give their opinion and can stand up for themselves. It is good to create such an environment for students but only as far as their education is still in focus. In the end wrong information neither helps the students nor the teachers, so the information that is taught at schools has to be a hundred percent true. 
A good knowledge is very important for every students future so it is their right to be given a good knowledge in school. In public schools in the United States but also in other countries this is a big problem, because the teachers that work for such a little sallery often don't have such a good knowledge. All around the world it is a big problem that good teachers have a long and hard education to fullfill but in the end the don't earn very much, so they rather teach at private schools. This problem can be seen in rankings of the top schools worldwide, where private schools and university are always ranked very high. 

I think that in preschool it is more important that teachers have the ability to relate well with their students since the stundents are young children. This young the children need a teacher that they feel good and loved, so that they can learn something. But as older as the students get it gets more important that the teachers have a excellent knowledge that students can have the best education possible. A good education is so important today for every student and their futures that a lack of knowledge from the teachers side is worse than we might think
