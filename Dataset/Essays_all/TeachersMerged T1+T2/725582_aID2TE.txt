At first, the students don't have to like the teacher, they have to learn what he/she is teaching. In fact, the teacher don't have to relate with the students, he/she have to do his work good. An excellent knowledge of the subject he/she is teaching is important, that he could explain it good and easy to the students. If this knowledge isn't there he/she couldn't teach the class efficient. In other words, the class wouldn't learn the subject that exactly as they should.

To every minus there's a plus. Of course a teacher have to know what he is doing, but the ability to relate with his/her students is very important. The students learn much more and faster if they like the teacher and have a good relation to him/her. Also the teacher knows better the weaks and streanghts of the only students, so he could explain it more exactly. And if a student needs help, he will ask the teacher, because he knows, that the teacher will help him. To summarize, the relation between class and teacher is more important than a good knowlegde of the teacher.

All in all, both is really important. When the teacher has a huge knowledge and the students like him, they learn good and much in the same time. But we have to see, that every student likes/dislikes different teachers the his classmates. Also there are theachers, who are disliked and have no knowledge, and teachers who are liked and have a good knowledge.

In my point of view, it's more important, that the teacher is teaching good and have a big knowledge. I don't have to like him, but in the end I have to learn the subjet he/she is teaching. Of course it's better to have a good relation to the teacher, because he/she makes your marks, but if you don't learn something you could use in the future, it's better to have a teacher you don't like, but he/she teaches you things you could use. That's the reason why I like to learn more in school, than have a good relation to the teacher.
