Getting along with students is a very improtant part for every teacher. Some seem to care more about indivitual students than others. Overall a teachers realtionship with his students can affect their learning in multiple ways. 

Teachers who get along well with their students clearly have an advantage regarding the sudents' attention and motivation. Especially younger studens are likely to take critics personally from a teacher who's personallity they do not like. This will affect their attitude towards this teacher's subject negatively. A teacher who relates well with students will probably be able to motivate them for a subject they do not particularely enjoy, simply because the students want to support the teacher. 
Unfortunately, even a teacher who is loved by his or her students cannot automatically become a good teacher. The ability to get the knowledge on the subjet across and to help the students understand it marks a better teacher than the one just getting along with his students. Logically, there is no use of a teacher who may have willing students but no knowledge to teach them.

In my opinion, a mixture of both abilities is necessary for a good teacher. A teacher who almost acts as a friend but who is not able to teach his students because of a lack of knowledge cannot be a good teacher. Neither can one who is very knowledgable but does not have the attention of his or her students because they dislike him or her.
