Nowadays, many people discuss if teacher should relate well with students or if it is more important that they have an excellent knowledge of the subject they are teaching. In this essay I try to show both the positive and negatve aspects of teacher's ability to relate with students. 

On the one hand it is very important that a teacher understands his students. Students between 13 and 17 years are not that easy to educate and it is necessary that a teacher can deal with that. For example it is very important that students can go to their teacher and speak about every problem if they cannot discuss it at home or with friends. Especially in the teenage years teachers have an enormous impact on the evaluation of every single student. 

On the other hand students go to school to learn something, so it is very imporant that every teacher is able to teach. If a teacher has not a good knowledge of the subject he is teaching, it could be very difficult for him to teach and also very boring for the students to listen to him. We are going to school to learn something and it is absolutly necessary that the teacher can teach every subject and that he can answer different questions. 

To sum up I can say that it is important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject but also to understand students. In my opinion a mixture of both is the most efficient way to be a good teacher. Futhermore, every teacher has a long and specific education and so I think it should not be a problem to achieve the ability to relate well with students and to have an exellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
