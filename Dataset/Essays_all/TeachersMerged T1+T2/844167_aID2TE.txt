A teacher has to have lots of abilities. Including excellent knowledge of the subject being taught and the ability to havegood relationships with the students. But what is more important? Is it really the social part or is it the knowledge?

First of all, a student needs to have fun in school too. If he isn't happy with the themes and the teacher it is going to be difficult for him to concentrate and to be good in school. If a teacher has the ability to build a relationship between him and a student it will be easier for him to learn.
Furthermore it is important that a student knows, that there is always an open ear for him, which is easier when the teacher is not a boring, unfriendly person.

Although the facts above are undoubtedly true, there are also arguments against the statement on top.
For example, if the teaching person gets too close to a student. Emotionally as much as physically. 
In addition to this is, that you can't learn something from a teacher, when he's kind and you like him. Healso has to be good in his subject.He has to know almost everything about it, in casea studentwants to study it someday...
Moreover a teacher has a responsability that a student learns something. He can't just make jokes and do nothing else in his lesson. He has to be serious, so that the students, their parents and the school can trust him.

In conclusion it is very important for a teacher to have a relationship to his students, but not as important as having an excellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching. A Student has to learn something and he can only do this when someone's teaching him. If that's not the case he will have it hard to build a promissing future fore himself. Because of those reasons I disagree with the statement on top.
