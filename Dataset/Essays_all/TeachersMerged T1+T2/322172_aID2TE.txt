I go to School now since 11 years. I had a lot of different teachers and classes. In every Schoolyear I had my favorite teacher and teachers which I didn't realy like. My favorite teachers always had to gat along well with the students. You can't just read out of a schoolbook and belive that students like you...As a teacher you must relate well with children or young adults but you also must teach them your nowledge!
Does a teacher realy need to achive both characteristics?
In the following sentences I will talk out of a student-view and I'll try to compare different teachers and their abilities.

First of all, not every teacher is a good teacher. A lot teachers concentrate just on one thing, but teachers must be vareable and should offer a lot of different workingmethods to give away their nowledge.
If a teacher nows alot and realy is interessted in his subjet the students automatical listen more and talk less.
So the nowledge is important but you must now, if a teacher is to interested in something it could quikly endup in a long long story telling lesson and the students nearly cant't keep their eyes open. I'm talking with experience. I have a history teacher, who is absolutly great! He knows so much but he often can't stop himself and it realy ends boring.

After all there are also a lot of teachers who put their main subjet on the good relation to the students. But a teacher isn't your "bestfriend". Its good to now that your teacher would help you in every hard situation but it musten't realy be a near relation.

For me its important that a teacher has both sides. He should be friendly and show me that he likes to teach things. I mean learning isn't always that fun. But if you have a teacher who helps you to have fun, you have found the right one!
The best teachers, for me personally, are those who realy love their lessons, those who realy want to give their nowledge to others but still love to work with children and young adults.
