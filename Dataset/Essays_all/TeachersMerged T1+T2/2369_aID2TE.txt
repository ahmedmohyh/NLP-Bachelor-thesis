'A teacher's ability to realte well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught' - in the following i would like to give you some ascpects agreeing this statement and disagreeing it. 

It is very important to understand the things you do and to like what you are doing. When you are a teacher and you don't know everything about your subject, it could be very dangerous, that your students don't unterstand the teacher and the lessons are very boring for them. Students don't listen to things, they don't understand. 
But the other point of view is, Students in my age are often very difficult. They go trough a time, where they try to find out who they are or who are their real friends. In this time it is very important to talk with the students. It is important to understand them and to help them trough this time. They don't need a teacher, who said them they must have a good grade or something like that. Some students are already very emotional and maybe sad, so that they are don't know, if it's right, what they are doing. They need somebody, who tell them, it's good what they are and they are very good at something. 

In my opinion, everybody said School is so important and knowledge is so important, everybody should have the highest schooleducation. But that's it? I don't think so. People are so much more than their grades. They are sometimes and especially in this time, so emotional and need help to handle the situations, which happens in life. So, teacher who can help their students, are so important and for me there is no other opinion.
