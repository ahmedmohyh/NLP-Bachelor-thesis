Teachers need to have certain qualities in order to be good at what they're doing. I recently read an article in which someone claimed that the empathy of a teacher is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject they are teaching. I would like to discuss now: Can you be a good teacher if you don't know your subject perfectly but can relate very well with the students?
Being able to understand the students and how they feel and think is an important quality of a good teacher for sure. In my experience it makes us students feel better understood and more comfortable with the person that teaches. This also results in us wanting to know more about the subjet because we sympathize with the teacher. I used to dislike History a lot because my teacher was a man who thought that everything he did was right and perfectly understandable and therefore didn't want to answer questions when we missed something, because he said it should all be clear. However since I am tought by Mrs. Knüsel, who is always up for answering questions and clarifying whatever is unclear, History became one of my favorite subjects.
On the other hand being able to relate well with the students isn't very useful when you don't know what you're talking about. It makes them nice human beings but when the students have questions and the teacher can't answer them because of a lack of knowledge they will get frustrated.
Last but not least, perfect knowledge of a subject is just as useless if you can't relate with the students. That's the case with my Physics teacher, he is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met but he does not understand me and other clueless students which often results in us getting angry.
