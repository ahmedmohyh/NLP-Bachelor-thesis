No, I think booth things are important for being a good teacher.

If you are a very intelligent men and you can explain every thing, what students are asking, its good. But that doesent matter if your students hate you. Because when you could explain things its good but no body lissten to  you. Becaus when a teacher is not good in explainig you lose anyway the plaesure for school and then his kindness doesent helps anyone.

Once I had a teacher: He was very gently and social, but he didnt explain something well and thats why no body liked him at the end of the year. But if this teacher could explain better, every body would have liked him. But if the teacher is roughly and can explain good, its also a kind of shit for the students.

So as you can see a teacher needs booth of this things to be a good teacher.
