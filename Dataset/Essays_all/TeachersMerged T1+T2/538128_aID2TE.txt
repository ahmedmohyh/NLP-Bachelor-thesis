The question whether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more  important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught points out a very important aspect of pedagoics. We can reformulate the question like this: Is it more important for a teacher to explain an issue or to know a lot about it?

A argument for the relate-site is that without communication the teacher isn't able to explain and teach anything. From this point of view it's inevitable that the teacher can relate well with his students. On the other hand if he don't know anything it's impossible to teach anything and his skill to relate well wiht students will not help him. 

If the issue is looked from the pro-knowledge-site, one could argue that knowledge is the more important one because only if the teacher himself knows a lot about the topic in question he will fully understand it and be able to explain it in a well manner. He will be able to communicate with his students and teach them the topic.

Considering my own opinion I think that a mixture of both features will be create the perfect teacher. Both is needed. Wihtout a good knowledg about the subject it will be impossible to teach something. The same counts for the realtion skill. The teacher has to be able to give his knowledge to his students. So he needs to make them understand what he know about the topic. A unbalanced realtion between the two features will make one part of one useless.
