If a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowlede of the subject being taught is a topic some people might disagree with each other. What is more important? What does it matter wheter a teacher is understanding or has a huge knowlede when it comes to his subject?

On one hand it is really important that a teacher can feel empathy for the students in his class. There might be some people in the class that don't get the idea when it's explained for the first time. In situations like this it is very important that a teacher understands the pupils situation, is patient and tries to explaint it again in a slightly diffrent way. Also, The students might be less afraid to ask the teacher for help if they don't get it because they know that the teacher will help them without humiliating them in front of the whole class.

On the other hand the way a subject is taught is very important. A teacher who is passionate about his subject can spread this feeling of passion and the class might get as passionate about the subject as the teacher. Furthermore, a teacher that has a excellent knowledge about his subject knows many diffrent ways to explain one and the same thing. He is able to answer really difficult questions from students and also make some explanations.

I personally tend to disagree with this statement. While it is important for a teacher to relate well with his students it shouldn't be more important than his knowledge about the subject he's teaching. We go to school to learn something. It isn't helpful if the teacher has no idea of what he is talking about but knows how you feel  as a student when you don't get something. I don't see why a teacher can't be both; intelligent and understanding.
