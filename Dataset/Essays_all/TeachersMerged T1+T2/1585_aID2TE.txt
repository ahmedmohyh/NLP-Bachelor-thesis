"Being a teacher, that is easy! You have got so much of free time and you do not have to teach the students correctly!" 
That is what many people say about teachers. But is it right? Do they really have an easy job? Sitting 45 minutes in a classrooom while the pupils watch a film? Teachers have to have a good relation with their students and do also need a knowledge of many things. But what is more important? 
Knowledge is important to teach the students, so the teacher hat to be educated. The teacher must help his pupils to be educated enough for their final exams, so he has to prepare them for it and also for their later jobs.
But knowledge is not the only thing that is important for a teacher: He has to relate well with them to make them learn something.
For students it is also important to have fun, so they are motivated to go to school. Although, the teachers do also want fun, so it is easier to do a good job. Good relations make it possible to help difficult children easier, who might have had a thraumatic childhood or difficulties in learning. 
Education does not only have to do with school education, but it is also education for life. Teachers have to support students who are not supported by their families or who have perhaps problems with alcohol and drugs. To help students with their problems, teachers have to be "on the same layer", they have to seem understanding and trustworthy. This cannot be done by teaching correctly, so the teaching person has to be friendly. 
Finally, good didactical knowledge of the subject is important for a teacher to create future opportunities for young people, but it is a way more important to communicate with the students and to create a good atmosphere.
