A teacher is useless if the students do not understand what he is teaching. Having a connection with the students and understanding how they think is very important for a teacher. Only if he understands his students, he can fully help them understand his students. Most of the time a teacher is a person who failed to excel in their subject and the people with excellent knowlegde are working or researching in their specific fields. It would be a waste if such a gifted person would limit him or herself to just teaching especially because the students do not even need to know that much.  Apart from the obvious fact that a teacher has to educate his pupils, he has various other roles. A teacher has to be able to relate to his students personally and it is his obligation to notice if their student has any problems, especially if the students are young.

Despite everything, a teacher needs to understand what he is teaching so that he can answer all of the students' questions regarding his subject. If a teacher does not sufficiently know his subject, he can lose the respect of his students and the may start to doubt everything he says.

All in All a teacher needs to have the necessary knowledge and be able to relate to his students though I would say it is a little more important to be able to relate.
