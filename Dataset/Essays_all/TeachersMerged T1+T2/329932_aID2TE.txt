We all remember this friend like teacher during our school life. The lessons were fun and we all had a great time. But did we really learn something during this lessons?
In my opinion the statement, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subjet being taught, is wrong.

First of all what helped the "friendly lessons" our life after school?
I remember that we often played or watched TV for expample a serie called F.R.I.N.D.S. in english during my highschool. On the other hand in french we never watched a movie and the lessons were quite dry. We did a lot of grammair and reading which we all hated. But amazingly even if i absolutly hated french with the barbarian methode of my teacher but with a excellent knowledge of her subject i am now significantly better in french than in english. 
For sure I understand that we all love to have lessons where we don't need to do a lot and where we can chill out. Especially as a stundet. But I think that the success i have now in french gives me a much bigger satisfaction than the time I "wasted" during my easy going english class. 

in conclusion personally i prefer the teacher with an excellent knowledge and which can not realte well with students but you really learn something over a teacher which values the relationships with stundents more than  excellent knowledge.
