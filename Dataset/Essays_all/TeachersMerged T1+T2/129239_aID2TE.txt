The relationship a teacher has with his students does not matter as long as they respect him.

In the classroom, the teacher is not your friend and he should not be. The teacher needs to have authority. It does not matter how he earns the respect of his students, be it with strict rules or by relating to your students. School does not work if the students do not respect the teacher. The best teachers i ever had were very strict. By keeping authority with strict rules, the classroom was quiet and students could concentrate. Students would listen to these strict teachers because they could not do anything else and profit from the knowledge thaught. The students could not at all relate to the teacher and they still learned alot. But learning what the teacher says does not matter much if he does not know what he is talking about. In the grown-up world, people expect exact knowledge.
