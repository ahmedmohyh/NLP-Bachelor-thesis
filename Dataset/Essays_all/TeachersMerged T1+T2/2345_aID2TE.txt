It's important to know the subject because we are at school to learn something. When the teacher is only nice to you and can't explain the subject to you then it's very bad. When you write the test and the teacher didn't explained the subject really good then you will fail the test. Also the teacher could be not nice and then it's not very funny and you don't like them. When you don't like them you will ignore them most of the time or maybe you are afraid of the teacher.
But it's also good when the teacher relate well with the students. Maybe the teacher gives you a better grade because he is nice. The teacher gives you less homework than other teachers. Sometimes he can't explain the subject but you can have fun with your teacher. Maybe the class decide to make an exhibition and then they will ask the nicest teacher to come with them.
I think both is important. The teacher should relate well with the students and should know most of the subject. It's not bad if the teacher don't know anything because that's impossible. But the teacher shouldn't do only good things because the students need to learn something. But when the teacher only teach you the things that doesn't make fun then it's very boring. You only learn the things and after you wrote the test you will forget the most of it. So I think the teacher  should have both.
