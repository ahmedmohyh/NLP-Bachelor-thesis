Teachers are humans too!

To start off with the topic lets actually think about what school is all about. Its a place to educate people and prepare them for life. Of course teachers play a major role in that system. Those are the people that actually teach and educate and give inheritate their informations and knowledge to others, that arent on there level.

Basically that means that your teacher obviously needs to have reached a higher level of education than you have and therefore; the better the knowledge the more convenient is your situation at school. However as in many other jobs the human aspects of a person need to be taken in consideration. This results in a desicion where one has to ask them whats more important. 

In my opinion it depends on much more factors. E.G. the subject that the person teaches, the certain characteristics of the students, the academic level of the school, etc. For instance if you teach the youngest children in an average primary school it isnt really that important if you have excellent knowledge. I mean basically anybody knows whats one plus two. Thus if youre a professor at the ETH you have speeches in front of dozens of people everyday and you hardly interact with any of those.

I think in life there are much more situations than just your job where you got to relate to other people. And it should be clear for anybody that if you want to become a profesor of an university you need to know more than whats one plus two. 

Knowledge is one of the most important things for us human beings, its the thing that made us dominant amongst other species. Knowledge is what makes us strong. Having said that, probably no one did ever come together with the love of his life with only knowledge. Therefore its important to find a mix between knowledge and the ability to relate and interact with people. And I think those are the factors that make a good teacher.
