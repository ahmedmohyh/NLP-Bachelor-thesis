Yes i think it is more important that a teacher has a good ability to relate  with his students, even his knowledge about  the subjects he taughts is not perfect. 
Today humans have a great knowledge about nearly every subject. And a lot of teachers have that too. 
But today it is not so important to know everything in a subject, than the way to give the knowledge to the students. 
For example a teacher with a very big knowledge about his subject explains it maybe more confusional as a teacher who has not the most knowledge but a good ability to relate tho his students. If students does not understand what the teacher tries to teach them, they do not listen or interrupt the lesson.
Sometimes teacher with a big knowledge have a very boring way to teach so that many students were bored and does not listen to the things the teacher taughts. 
Maybe the teacher with a good ability to relate to his students  explaines the stuff in a more modern or interesting way, with modern, more interesting examples, that fit in the life of the students. 
If a teacher does not know everything in his subject it is not a problem today. In the internet or other books he can research topics for his next lesson and find a way to explain it to the students even he does it the first time. 
You can collect your knowledge and is most easier to collect your knowledge than to train your way to teach your students better. 
You see i think a good relate and a good way of teaching is more important than the knowledge of the teacher.
