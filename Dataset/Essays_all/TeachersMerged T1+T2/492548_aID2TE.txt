There is no right or wrong answer to the question "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". But there are some points that supports this statement and some points that are against this statement. 
First it's true that you have to learn in a good atmosphere. You have to feel confident and maybe also have fun in school. But if you feel inconfident all the time and have problems with the teacher you won't learn very well and it's sure that you won't have  fun in school. And you will have so much to learn and you are so much time in school and that's why it's important that you can enjoy it. If not, this years will be horror for you. One idea is that the teacher maybe teaches you something with a game or a play. This would be a good idea, because if you really see or maybe touch something, you will remember better than if you just read it on a paper or in a book. 
But there are also points against this statement. It's true that you go to school to learn something. You won't be in school if you hadn't a better education at the end of the school as before. The next point is that you are not there to be friends or something with your teacher. He's still your teacher and you have to behave respectfuly. And if your teacher is maybe not the nicest person of the world you still have to get over it and go to school. Everyone has that time in life where you have a bad boss or an angry teacher. That's normal. And maybe you even learn more things from this "angry" teacher than from the nice one and that's good because if I said before: you go to school to learn something!
In my opinion there has to be a way between this two sides. I think it's important that you feel confident in school, so you can learn more and better. But the job of the teacher is to teach you something so that you have an good knowledge of the subject at the end of school.
