I think both are important. When a teacher doesn't have any knowledge of the subject he teaches, the students don't learn anything. The teacher can be nice or relate well with the students, if he doesen't know the subject very good it matters not. The students are going to school because they want to learn, not because they want a nice teacher.
 
But I think as well, that a teacher who can't explain he things, or have difficulties to speak with his students isn't a good teacher. My opinion is that the way we learn is very important. The teacher does a lots.
For exemple lots of students doesen't like a subject (maths, physics for example) because of the teacher. I had once a teacher who was very nice and had a very good knowledge of the subject which was economy, but he couldn't explain very well. He couldn't look at us in the eyes, and every time he was speaking, we were having the impression that he was having a disscussion with the wall or with what was outside of the windows. A lot of the my classmates didn't like economy because of this, and they had difficulties to understand the subject and to learn about it. 

That's why I think that to be a good teacher, you need a good knowledge of what you teach, but also you have to be interessant. Your students have to find that what you are saying is interessant and useful. Because we cannot learn anything when we find that the subject is boring, or that the teacher can't explain good, or that he doesn't know anything about the subject. 

I think too that it matters not if you are or not a specialist of the subject. For teaching you have to know many things but you can't know everything. And a good teacher is one who can say that he doesn't know but that he will inform himself.
