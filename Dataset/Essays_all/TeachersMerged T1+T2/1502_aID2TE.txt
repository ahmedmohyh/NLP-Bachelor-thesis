A teacher needs to relate well with students but it's not the most important thing when you have to teach students something.
Of course you need to understand your students and their problems and it's nessecary to relate well with them for them to have fun in class.
For example when students like their teacher and he doesn't behave like he's only there to teach them and doesn't care about his students problems then the students might look foward to the lessons with that teacher. Maybe they would concentrate more and would listen to the teacher more carefully. 
Because of that it could be that the students get better in that subject and have more fun in learning.
But it is not nessecary to relate well with your teacher. He could come into class and teach the students something and then leave the classroom again without caring about his students. The students would learn something and it would be their fault if they don't listen to their teacher.
A teacher who knows less about the subject but can relate well with students doesn't have an advantage in that. Of course it would be easier to teach the students but the fact that maybe he wouldn't teach the students an excellent knowledge of the specific subject makes that less important. *
All in all it would be great for the teacher and the students if he can relate well with them but it isn't more important than an ecxellent knowledge of the subject, to be a good teacher you would need a bit of both, knowledge and a good relationship with your students.

*Students need the knowledge for their further education and their job but they also need to know how to relate to future colleages with a higher stand, so both is nessecary for their future.
