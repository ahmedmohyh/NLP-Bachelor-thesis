Which is more likely the most important for teachers? To be able to relate well with the students or to teach them an excellent knowledge of their subject? Or maybe both or neither of them? That's what I'm going to find out. 
Firstly, there has to be respect from the teacher's side towards the students as well as from the students side towards the teacher. They have to form an atmosphere where they can teach and learn comfortably and easily. This effort has to be made on both sides. Even though, there should be a quite strict teacher-student relationship if the student wants to learn something from the teacher. If they just become buddies and talk about private matters the whole lesson, that is not called learning or studying, that's just the same, when you hang out with your friends. In the school, students should be friends with other students and teachers with other teachers. Everyone with their own generation. The teachers are here to teach and the students are here to study, that's also the reason why they are called like that. So students and teachers should do their responsibility during a school lesson. In recreation time or after school, teacher and student can be friends or even hang out together but school is school and private life is private life. 
My opinion based on these arguments for and against the upper statement and the questions of mine is that the ability to be able to relate well with students is an important part on being a teacher but first priority should be definitely that they teach the students excellent knowledge and make them more intelligent. That is what
