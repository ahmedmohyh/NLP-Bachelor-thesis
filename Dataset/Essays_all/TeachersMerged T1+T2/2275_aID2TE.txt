A teacher's job is not only to know their subject so well they can answer most questions about it, they are supposed to teach as well. If a teacher can not handle the students, they might lower their motivation and therefore the learning effect is less. So to teach effectively, they have to relate with the students, but is that more important than knowing their topic?

I do think it is, because information can mostly be researched (also by the teacher), but to get the students to understand it correctly, it takes more than that. Of course this has to be set into relation, and a teacher that knows just as much about the subject as the pupils is misplaced. And if they can not answer every single question, but make the pupils have fun and make progression, it is better for both attitude and learning effect of the students.
An on the one hand, there is no way even a teacher with "excellent" knowledge can answer every random question they are asked, meaning that at a specific point the knowledge makes no significant difference anymore. On the other hand, a "better teaching ability", or the contact to the students always makes a difference, for example with special students in class who require more attention. Empathy is always paying off in a job where one has to deal with people. 

Concluding, I strongly agree with the statement, but of course it still is the teacher's job to know their subject, although the teaching part is the more important part in my opinion.
