Teachers are the basic for our education system. They teach students every day so that these young people get good job and ahead in life. It is the most important ability of teachers that they relate well with students. In the following discussion I will argue about this claim.

The first argument that supports my claim is social based. Teachers have to be role models for their students. The first step to this stage is the relationship between both. Taechers have to be accepted by the students. This works only with the teacher´s ability to relate well.

A counter argument to my claim is connected with the knowledge. A teacher has to teach his knowlege. Without knowledge lessons in school are not usefull.

The next argument is realted on the relationship. Students and teachers do not have to be on one level, but it is easier to learn in school,when there is a calm atmosphere in class. This is the reasen why a good relationship supports the aspect.

The last argument underlines my claim. When there is a good atmophere an relationship between the teacher and the student in class. it makes it easier for the studens to reach good marks.

After summing up the pros and the cons, I can draw the conclusion that the ability to relate well with students is the most important one, but without knowledge this skill is worthless. To put it in a nutshell a teacher needs both abilities in school to theach his students well. Relationship and knowledge are dependent to eachother so that the mixture of both are the qualification for a good teacher.
