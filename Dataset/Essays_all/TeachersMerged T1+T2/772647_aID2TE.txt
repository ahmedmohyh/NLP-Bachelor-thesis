A teacher has an important profession. He has to lead students and is the main subject in our school system. Not every student likes every teacher. But what makes a teacher a good one? What is more important, his ability to relate well with students or his excellent knowledge?

First, a teacher has to know something. Without knowledge, he can't teach a subject very well and he has to answer the questions of the studens, also the critical ones. A history teacher who doesn't understand relations between countries or has to search every year number of an important war can't be a good one. Also students don't have respect of a teacher without enough knowledge.  

But the ability to relate well with students is also very important. A teacher who knows everything and is excellent in his subject has the base to be a good one, but if the students don't pay attention and the lesson isn't interessting, he can't be a teacher. If this problem exist, the students don't learn something. And learning is the main point in school. So a teacher has to have the ability to relate with students. 

In the end my opinion is, that a good teacher has to be both: a person with a big knowledge and also one who can relate with his students. He doesn't have to know everything, today we can search difficult questions in the internet, also between the lessons, but he has to be interested on his subject and he has to have a base knowledge. In summary a teacher have to be a person with passion, knowledge and the ability to relate with young people, because the most important thing is, that the students learn something and not the teacher.
