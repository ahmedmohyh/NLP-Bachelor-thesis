I agree only partly with the statement. On one hand, it's important for students to get on well with their teacher, but on the other hand it doesn't help anybody if the teacher doesn't have any knowledge of the subject.
 It's something basic, that children in primary school prefer to go to school, if there is a teacher who understands to communicate and relate with them. Teachers shouldn't be too strict and it's also proofed, that if children like to go to school, they may produce better work, better exams and marks. But all of this doesn't help if the teacher doesn't possess a well knowledge. Maybe in primary school this might work better, but the further upwards you go, up to secondary school or college, it's absolutely essential that a teacher has an excellent knowledge if he is a good teacher. But with only this ability, you can't be called a Superteacher. It's the ability to explain, to see the demands of students, to be able to answer questions understandable and as short as possible. And it would be also helpful if the teacher got on well with his students. But since the question is, which of these abilities is the better one, I would go for the second one. There may be an absolutely unsympathic teacher, where students hate to join his lessons, but he might teach those students better than somebody who only understands to relate well with those students. At universities, for example, there's almost no interaction at all. And although it works, students learn loads of things without communicating with the professor. After all I still think, that students would prefer to have a teacher they get on well with. I conclude that for a teacher in higher grades it's by far the more important ability to have a good knowledge than relating well with students. But in lower grades, if you see it from the question of motivation, it might be the more important ability.
