I agree.
I have to admit that I rather have fun during the lessons but just as long as Istill learn something. The lessons are more fun if the teacher can relate well with students but as long as the teacher doesn't know what he/she is teaching about they don't learn something and the reason why students are going to school is because they have to learn some stuff. But if the teacher can't relate with his/her students they don't like going to school and they don't want to learn something about that subject anymore. Further teaching isn't the right job for someone if he/she can't relate with students because as a teacher you have to do that almost every singel day (except during the holidays and weekends...). But teaching is also the wrong job, when your knowledge isn't good enough. If you don't understand the subject that you are teaching; how should your students do?
In the statement, if I understand it correctley, they are talking about a teacher who can relate well with his students and his knowledg is good but not excellent. In my eyes that's enough for teaching. If your knowledge is excellent and you don't really like working with kids/teenagers you probabley can use your knowledge better than teaching because when the chemistry between students and theacher is horrible the hole subjects starts to become horrible. From my own experiences I konw that the teacher influences the popularity of a subject a lot and if your favourite subject is teached by a mean teacher it kind of destroys the subject and with it the fun you used to have in it. And if I think about it I realise that my favourite subjects are mostly teached by my favourite teachers and some subjects that I actually hate but the teachers are great have become sort of fun.
