A teacher which has an excellent knowledge of the subject that he explains is very helpfull so the students can learn a lot of the thema and get an personal view of it. The more the sudents learn about an important and moving thema the more interested they are and the more they'll research at home about it. 

On the other side a teacher which can good interact with his student is also very important One can only learn if one has a good "learning climate". If the students doesn`t feel good and comfortable it is really difficult to learn new things. 

A person that has a very good knowledge of something isn't automatically a good explainer too. Some pepole are so into their "own world" world that they have difficulties to explain their thema to others and can't accept when somebody doesn't understand things or aren't interested in the subject. 

When a teacher is good in communicating with his students and also is interested in the opinions and feeligs of them then he also is able to know when one of his students has a problem at home or at school and searches the contact and tries to help.

Teachers that have an excellent knowledge of their "materia" are good when the students have to learn a subeject very exact. It's not that important to have an "all inclusive service" in school and it's also important for students to learn how to come along with people - in this event teachers - which have different view and interests and to search "integration" to the  unliked thema and teacher.

My own opion is that it needs both: The teacher's ability to relate well with his students and also an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. A good teacher doesn't alwasays has to be kind and polite, he can also say when it's enough and give an feedback to his students - also when not everything is going perfect.And then there has also to be a good atmosphere in the class and between the individual students.
