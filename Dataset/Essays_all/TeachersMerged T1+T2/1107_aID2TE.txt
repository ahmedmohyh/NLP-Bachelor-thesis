In our student life -that is of course a really long time and also a time that kind of gives us the way to our future- we meet teachers that we like and also teachers that we don´t like. Sometimes we feel like we prefer teachers that are like friends with their students and maybe watch films, make fun in class or are just not like all the other teachers. And sometimes we prefer teachers that are strict and organisated.
But is it better for us to have a teacher that relates with us well or is his knowledge of the subject more important?
In the past I mostly had teachers that always concentrated on the subject and that the students always do the best for their subject. And of course this is a good thing to learn a lot and to be able to get better and better.
And it is important to give the teacher a little bit of respect, because they are always a person you have to look up to. But in some time we like to talk with the teacher or have the feeling that they like us and are more like a friend than a teacher. But this can also be a problem, if teacher and student are too friendly with each other.
Not only because it maybe influences the teachers when he has to give notes, because he always have to be objective and this is not possible if he´s too friendly with his students. It is also problematic if the student maybe has more feelings than it should be.
I think that a mix between a teacher that sometimes connects with students and gives them kind of friendly feelings and a teacher that works hard with the stundents that they are able to reach their goals, is good for both sides. I don´t think that a teacher can only be a good teacher if he´s always correct and is just strict. A good teacher is someone who gives the students the chance to learn and get great in what they want to reach, and also make school a place where they want to learn with fun, because this always helps to be motivated and to think back of school as a nice place.
