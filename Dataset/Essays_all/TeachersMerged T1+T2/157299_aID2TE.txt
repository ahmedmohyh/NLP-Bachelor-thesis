Students' achievements in school can either be seen by the relationship the students have with their teachers or if the teacher has the ability to teach the students the subject well, so all of them understand it. In this essay these two topics and their advantages and disadvatages will be dicussed.

A lot of students struggle with a specific subject often due to a bad relationship with their teacher. The students do not feel as if the teachers are capable of teaching the subject and thus do not understand the topic. The following consequences are that students or pupils are not motivated and study poorly for the subject leading to failure of their exams. However when teachers and students have a good communication their achievements are much higher; the teachers are happy to have a motivated class, the students want to understand what their learning and pay more attention.

However if a teacher has a great communication with his students but is not capable of teaching them the subject, what is the whole point of going to school?  A teacher should teach students a topic and should have an excellent knowledge of the subject. This can sometimes lead to some students not understanding and thus not liking the teacher. Sometimes there should be options for teachers to learn how to communicate with students if the problems get to severe. 

I think that students should go to school because they want to learn and not for having a good relationship with their teachers, having this obviously motivates the students and so it is a plus. However in the future when they go to for example university, or life in general there will not always be teachers that they like and they still have to try and make the best out of it.
