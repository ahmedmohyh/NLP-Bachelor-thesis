The excellent knowledge of the subject is very important, because if you dont know anything about for example maths you cant teach the students the information for the life after school. Also important is the relationship betwenn student and teacher, because the grades are important for your exam in grade 12. Every teacher has students who like he more than others. This is a normal situation, because nobody can improve everybody the same way. In this point its a good thing to teach subjects the best way for the students to get them fit for the life after school. Teachers also need to motivate the students for subjects which they dont like, because the students didnt learn something if they are dont interested in the subject. Sports is a special subject for students because you can run around and play games like football or volleyball, but fat students dont have fun with this, because they cant run around and play games like others. So its very hard to find a balanced game for everyone or a subject with a task who everybody liked it. In this situation the teacher can help this people who cant do the task or the game to motivate them or to help them with their problems. i dont agree with them because teachers can destroy the career of a stundent if he dont like him. This force is not fair for a student, so i think its important to teach the subject the best way and get the grades neutral as possible.
