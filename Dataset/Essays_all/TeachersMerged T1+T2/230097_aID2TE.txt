Teacher's job is to educate students and to archieve that, teachers must be able to explain the topic. A teacher speaking in front of the class, without errors relating to the subject, may seem like a good method of teaching. The problem here is, that students quickly won't pay much attention anymore. So even though the teacher tell everything perfectly fine, when students don't listen everything was absolutely useless.
Teachers, who know and understand their students, are able to explain difficult matters in a way that makes it plausible and understandable for the student. Such teachers can also see much better when a student is having problems. No matter if at school or at home. They aren't reliant on students to tell them, but can confront the students directly, when they see it. Since many students keep their problems with themselfs and don't tell anyone, especially wouldn't they  tell a teacher. So in this case a teacher can assist a student to solve problems, while teachers who can't relate well with student can't.

The ability of relating well with students is especially crucial to schools which teach basics, such as primary schools. Primary schools teach things on which the students can build on and relie on in their future. As the education becomes more and more advanced and specific, a teacher's knowledge gets more and more important.
