"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught"
It is difficult to learn things on your own when you have not heard about it before. Teachers are in school to solve this problem, they have to bring theyr knowledge to the students and help them learning. But can they bring knowledge to the students if they do not like them? 
On the first look it is not important if students have a good relatotionship to theyr teacher, because it is only the learning of new knowledge that matters. 
But maybe if you take a closer look it is also important that the teachers and students like eachother. If you do not like your teacher you stop listening in the lessons. You will start doing other things, like drawing something or talking to your neighbour. It is verry important that students are listening to the teachers in the lessons. Of course you could say that they can read the informations from the papers that the teachers give to te students but how could you understand something that is not explained to you, and in this case why would it be necessary to have teachers at all? It is often a problem that students have bad grades because they have not listening well, Another problem is, that if you do not have fun while learning something, you wont learn it as good as if you like doing it. 
A teacher has to make learning fun, and again, if the relationship between the students and the teacher is not good, it can not be funny at all. I mean would you hang out with some friends you acually do not like? It is kind of the same thing. That are only two reasons why I absolutely agree with the statement. I think there are many people how disagree, and maybe that is the reason why there are so many students with bad grades.
