What is more important to have as a teacher. To relate well with students or having the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? 

First of all, the job of a teacher is to give the students informations of the subject in a way they understand it. If, for example, a math teacher is brilliant with numbers, but can`t show the way he got to the result, he is useless as a teacher and should get another job. But if you are a teacher, who can relate very well with students but have very less knowledge, you may be a good primary school teacher, but should not be teacher on a higher level school. A good teacher needs both of it. In case a student has problems with learning or has problems at home, a teacher who relates well with him is much more effective than a teacher with high knowledge. On the other side, if you think of the final exams, for example the ``matura``, a teacher with high knowledge can prepare you much better on your way to the exam.

To sum up, a good teacher has the knowledge he needs to have and on the same time he can relate with students very well. During the school years, a teacher who can relate well with you can help you  passing the years at your school. Final exams and other tests, where only knowledge matters, the brilliant knowledged teacher can help you more during your preparations and give you better advices than a teacher who `only` can relate well with students.
