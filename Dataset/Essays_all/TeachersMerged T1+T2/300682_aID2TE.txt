A teacher who can relate well with students is very hard to find but it's very important to have such a teacher for students because it gives a good climat and more students will unterstand the things to learn better. The students go to class with a better feeling an maybe they are happy to choin class by a teacher like that.
But a teacher with an excellent knowledge is also very important for the knowledge that can be give away. Maybe the lessons of a teacher like that are more difficult to understand and maybe some students will be annoeyd because of that. An other bad thing is that many teacher who have a big knowledge can't teach this to students clear so they can't follow the things which has been said and can't understand these things or a subject which has been taught. So it's very diffiucult follow the lesson.

I think a teacher that everybody would love to have is a mixed form from both of these forms. A teacher who knows his subject very very good and also can teach his knowledge the way that students can follow him and understand what he says, that would be a perfect teacher. He would give a good climat, a good knowledge and he can treat every singel student individually. Such a teacher would be very great but I think this is just dreamthinking. None of the teachers I know have both of these abilitys and that's very sad. But they are also just human. They can't be everything at the same time. But it would be very helpfull for us students.
