The essay is about the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important then excellent knowledge of the subject being taght.".

On the one hand the students should learn something in the subjekt and the should not just sitting in the classroom and have fun. It´s also very important that the relationship between the students and the teacher is not too close because then the students have no respect anymore to the teacher. 
On the other hand the students doesn´t want to learn things if the lesson is very dry and the teacher doesn´t relate to them. The students could start to play jokes on the techer and then the teacher trys to punish the students with more homeworks and the students hate the teacher. A other important point is that the students can remember the facts about the topic better because the teacher can connect it with some funny things. The result of it is that the students have fun at the lesson and say more important things and everybody is involved in the lesson. The next positiv argument for the thesis is that the teacher can say bad things better to them becasue he knows how the every single student reacts and can change his words to the best way. According to that the organisation of events like a party are better because everyone is doing something. Because A lot of hands, fast end.  

All in all is the thesis "A teacher´s ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." true. In my opinion is this thesis also true because I am a students and I want to have fun during the lesson.
