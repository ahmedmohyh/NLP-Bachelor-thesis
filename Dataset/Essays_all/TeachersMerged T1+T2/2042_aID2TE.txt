I agree with the statement because school isn't a place that only exists for education but also for social interaction. Students also learn a lot for their future for example how to get along with others and several other social skills and a good teacher can support them to learn these features at school.
If the knowledge of a teacher would be more important than his ability to relate with students, classes could also be taught by computers or other machines. Moreover I think that a teacher that works well with his students can evoke their interest for his subject, because students often don't like to learn and prefer trying to be rebellious due to their age and puberty issues. But if they do like the teacher, they will make an effort to follow his class and the learning process will be more efficient. So the students prefer learning with a teacher that is sympathic and it's easier if the teacher and the class cooperate instead of dicussing and fighting each other.
Furthermore a teacher that understands his students can help them better with problems and knows where to support them in the learning process and in school in general.
But on the other hand, it is also important that the teacher knows well what he teaches and students can only learn as much and as good as they are taught that means that his knowledge also plays a big role. 
Of course the teacher should be well educated, but to become a teacher a certain level of knowledge is a basis.
All in one I come to the conclusion, that being a good teacher bases on being a human that interacts well with his class.
