Teacher is a job who need two diffrent abilities. It is a social job but you have also to know the subjects. This statement says that the social abiltity is more important than the knowledge about there subject.

Firstly I think that is bullshit. If you don't know well about the subjects the teachers have learn it isn't usefull you are in the social ability good. For example, you have a teacher with a good identity and is able to work and speak with the students well. He is teaching english but he can't excellent english. Then he could be the nicest teacher of the world but it is not worth because you can not learn from his knowledge about english. 

On the opposite, I think that a teacher who have not a good special ability but he has the best knowledge it is not usefull either. For example, you have a teacher in maths who studied excellent math at ETH Zurich., but he can not explain things to the class. It is the same thing the students can not learn the new stuff.

In conclusion there is no good option to chose between which thing is more important. To be a good teacher you need both abilities. And I think that is a very huge problem that there are a lot of teachers who have not both abilities because they did not want be teacher but they did not know what to do after studying
