The aim of a school is to teach the students precious things about different school subjects and also life.
Teachers need to be able to teach children new things. The question is, what is more important, that the teachers know the things they want to teach or that they know how to teach them. In the following Paragraphs I try to show why I find which one more important.

In my opinion a teacher needs to know the things he teaches well, so the students don't learn something which isn't true. They need to be sure about their knowledge, or otherwise they will fail in the advanced studies, for example at university.
I think also a teacher who knows his subject the best can really make interesting lessons. If he always needs to check the facts he loses precious time and can't present a subject enthusiasticly. 
A teacher who is too good with his students, tends to go easy with them, for instance making easy lessons and to chit chat the whole time.
On the other hand, the teacher has to be able to relate well enough with the students so they pay him enough respect and are willing to learn new things about something.

All in all, it is important that teachers have both abilities, a mix of knowledge and social skills. These are the key to interesting and educational lessons.
