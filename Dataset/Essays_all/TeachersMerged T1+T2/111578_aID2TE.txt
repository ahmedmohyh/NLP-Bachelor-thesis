In this essay I want to give a view about the topic given.

In some cases I agree. Firstly, it is important that the teacher builds an atmosphere where learning is possible for everyone. Also the student with the lowest marks should have a chance to make a profit out of the lessons. Secondly, the teacher has to react and help on the students problem. It is important that this happen immediately so the students can learn faster and get not stucked at one point of learning.

But in some cases I have to disagree. Firstly, it is a must that the teacher has an excellent knowledge because you will have students in a class who want to know more about a topic or more specific informations. The goal of a teacher should be that all students are in the area of the level of his or her knowledge. But the teacher has to know more also from other areas of history for example where you can combine new ideas with your topic. Secondly, the kids for example in primary school need to have a idol or something similar where they can look up to them and want to be like them. 

To sum up we can say that a teacher needs to have a few character types to be a good teacher. At one hand they need a huge knowledge. But at the other hand they should also have psychological abilitiys to relate well with students.
In my opionen both is really important and a healthy mix is the way to success. This should also be clear for our gouvernement members.
