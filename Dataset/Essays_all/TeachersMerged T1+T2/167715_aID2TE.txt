The ability of a teacher to relate well with students is very important. But so is his knowledge about the subject he teaches. But is the ability to relate well with students  for sure more important?

On the one hand a teacher's great knowledge is very important for students in order for them to learn a lot, get excited about different aspects of a particular subject and to positively influece students with joy about the subject one teaches.The most important thing for a school is that their students get educated in the most efficient way possible. But how is that achieved? Through a teacher's great knowledge. The importance of a teacher's knowledge is also very important for the students to get inspired by the know-how of a teacher. 

On the other hand a teacher's good relationship to his students is a key measure for a good atmosphere among the students in class. It is a must for teachers to have the ability to relate with students in order to assure that students like to go to the teacher's classes. If the realtionship of a teacher to his students is only slightly there, students aren't motivated to go to classes and study for that particular subject. 

Especially in our school, I personally prefer a good balance of both characteristics in a teacher. For me, it is very important for a teacher to have great knowledge but also for a teacher to be able build up a relationship with students
