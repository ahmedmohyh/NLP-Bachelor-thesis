Especially students know it: All teachers are different, some are better than others. Some teachers know how to relate with their students, they understand them and their students like them. Others are a geniuses in their subject. Some are both kinds, others are only one, others none.
The question I will discuss in the following is if teachers who are loved by their students and know how to relate with them are better than teachers who know everything about their subject.
Both kinds of teachers have positive and negative sides.
Teachers who have a grand knowldge of their subject can share it with the students they teach. Furthermore they can support their students better if it comes to questions about their subject. They can answer these questions better and more precisely than other teacher who are not that much into their subject.
But what if they can not share the wisdom they have because they can not, for example, calm down the class?
Isn´t the knowledge about how to calm down the class, how to relate with the students more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject? 
There are teachers who know much about their students, who talk to them, who know how to get their attention, how to calm them down.
In my opinion these teachers are, if I have to decide on one kind, much better than those who only know everything about their subject but nothing about how to relate with the students because if a teacher can not get attention it does not matter how excellent their knowledge about their subject is. In that case I am more pleased with a teacher who can relate with the students, even if he or she is not as excellent in the subject as the other teacher.
