If you`ve been going to school for many years like I have, you will have noticed a difference in the way teachers behave toward their students. Some are stricter while others like to be on the same level as their students. But which is better? Would it be true to say that the ability to relate to students is more important than having exellent knowledge of the subject they`re teaching? 

Let`s imagine we have two English teachers; teacher A and teacher B. Teacher A likes to talk to his students after lessons, is a very open person and generally likes to talk. He understands his students very well, however he isn`t a native speaker and has an accent when speaking English. Teacher B is strict and nobody likes going to his lessons, because he doesn`t tolerate students that have a problem undersanding him. He is a native speaker and can speak English perfectly; He knows all of the advanced English grammar and vocabulary. 
We could argue that students in teacher A`s class like going to his lessons, therefore they have a lot of motivation. Teacher B`s classes are boring and he doesn`t know how to answer questions sothat people can understand them, so the students never feel like going. This would result in students learning more in Teacher A`s class than in Teacher B`s class since nobody is paying attention in what students consider to be the "boring" class of Teacher B.
We could also say that in teacher B`s class, the students learn a proper British English, and have a bigger vocabulary thanks to the way complicated way Teacher B talks, even if his classses are boring. 

I whole-heartedly believe that the statement is true. A teacher who can`t relate to his or her students probably shouldn`t have become a teacher. The ability to work with others is very important and should not be underestimated.
