A teacher with bad knowledge or without the ability to relate well with students is not a good teacher. It is important that he knows what he is teaching. Otherwise it's hard for the students to understand what he's teaching. It's not important that he has an excellent knowledge over all but especially at higher schools like the gymnasium were education is so important a teacher can't teach if he don't know what he's doing. I think that the two arguments have nothing in common with each other. Both things are so important. The knowledge as I said and a good relationship with the students. If a Teacher comes along with the kids they are more motivatet to show what they can. They listen to him as he's the leading person. I made this expirience to. In subjects were I come along with the teacher or were I have a good relationship to them im better. Such a teacher is going to motivate you and give you the possibility to show the things you're able to do and don't want to blame you with things that you can't do. I also think that oral marks should set more often. There are many students like me who aren't good in theoretical english but are wery strong by using the english practical like in disscussions. A good teacher (like our englishteacher) gives you the chance to show how your use of practical english is. As a result i have to say that both things are wery important. But neither absolut knowledge or the fact that you have a good realtionship with your students say that you are a good teacher. So I won't agree or disagree because both things are as I said several times so important.
