Imagine sitting in a classroom. The teacher talks something, but you have now idea of what he want to explain. There are formels written on the blackboard but you don't understand the conextion whit the subject. You don't ask, because you know, he can't explain it to you, even thought he would understand it. A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than an ecellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because if he could not explain if well and lead the students to the subject, it does not help them much.

It's important that a teacher is able to help you understanding the subject. It's true, a teacher can just explain you, if he had also understood what he was talking from. But normally, a question of a student is a question based on a disunderstanding on a low level. If a question is realy outstanding and difficult, the teacher can write down the question and can searching for an answer until the next lesson. More important is that he take your question and find an unswer that is based on your level. That can only be the case, when the teacher tries to understand you and you know that it's important for him that you understand it.

A teacher have to motivate you for a new subject. Otherwise, a student does not follow the lesson. If a teacher have much knowledge, it's mostly more exciting because he can explain you everything. But, he have to know how to explain and to give fire to the students. For this, he have to be able to relate well with students. If he can show his motivation for the subject and to learn things to, it's even more exciting for the students.

It make now diffrents how much nowledge a teacher has. The importants is, that he can motivate the student and that he can explain and help students to understand the subject.
