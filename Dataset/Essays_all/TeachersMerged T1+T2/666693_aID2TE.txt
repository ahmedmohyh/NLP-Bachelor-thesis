"We dont have enough people who know how to educate our children!" This commun saying contain that many people are not happy with the teachers. Obviously it is not enough to just know everything about the subject you teach because it is also very important how you teach and how the students like you. So what is more important? Should you be a good teacher or should you know everything about the subject you teach?

First of all many teachers are professionals in the subjects they teach. However they forget how difficult it is to be good in that subject because they already know everything and forget about the students whos never heard of that before. Just because they are good, it doesn't mean others are good too. So they have to find a way to teach them because even if you know everything, if you can't teach noone will learn something from you. 

Secondly, I want to mention that noone is perfect. You cant know everything about the subject you teach and also be able to teach that everybody knows waht is going on. There are many children who won't be good at school even if you educate brilliantly because noone is able to be good at everything. Some are good in math others are good in Englisch andneither in math nor in Englisch.

Last but no least, it is important to know that it is not easy to be a teacher. Some students are not enough motivated so it is even harder to teach them something. Obviously this students are not good in the lessons because they are not paying enough attention. Aa a result the parents think it is a mistake from the teacher which is not correct at all.

To sum up I have to say that  on one hand we have teachers educating brilliantly and on the other hand we have teachers knowing everthing about the subject they teach. In my oppinion we need both. A teacher who knows many things should learn how to educate better, so that the children are able to learn and a teacher who can teach should get more knowledge about the subject he is teaching.
