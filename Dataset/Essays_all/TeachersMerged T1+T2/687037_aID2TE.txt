Who do not know the feeling going in a lesson taught by a terrible teacher? It isn't a really great feeling. You feel depressed, unmotivated and bored. How can you avoid it? Is it your fault or the teacher's ?

The work of a teacher is being a idol and to motivate the students for his or her subject. The subject can be interessting, but if the teacher is a coward, you can't concentrate on it. The only thing you think, before visit the subject is "oh no". A teacher can destroy your interests in a subject.If he or her can't handle with other human it's going to become difficult. For example a teacher, who doesn't accept another opinion isn't a good teacher. You will never say anything and you don't feel be respected. Like this more and more your favorite subject would become to the subject you hates most.
A teacher has to make a line between being a teacher and speak with the students pivately. They should know their students and understand them. If your teacher doesn't care about you, you don't like his or her lessons and his or her subject, too.
