One advantage for the ability to relate well with students is that the students really like to go to school. They like to have this subject because they like their teacher. About this it makes them more fun at school and they feeling well. So they have courage to put up the hand at the lesson and they are engaged. The students like more to learn and they are intressted when they have a good relationship with each other. On the other hand it's bad when the teacher hadn't a verry well knowledge of the subject which he teachs. It's not good when the students learning false things. For example when a student like to study this specifice subject which this teacher had teached him he would have  an complet false invention. This student will surly fale at the exam at the university and his future will be ruined. 

If the teacher have an excellent knowledge he can make good and right examples to explain a problem. The students are learned more from right things. I think that a teacher whow knows a lot would be have much fun at teaching because if he is good at his subject he would also like it. The students know when the teacher likes the subject so there more intressted. 

My opinion is that it will be the best from a mix of booth abilitys, but it's more important to have a great knowledge. Because the teacher have a little bite the responsiblity of the future from the students.
