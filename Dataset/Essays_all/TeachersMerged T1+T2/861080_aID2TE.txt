Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

One may say, that for example a student which has a good relationship with a teacher is more motivated to learn for that particular subject and is generally more interested. This could lead to better examen results and therefore grades. (This also works vice versa; if the student has a bad relationship, he is less motivated to learn, which leads to worse grades.)

However, if the student is not able to learn anything from the teacher, he/she might lose interest in that class and the once good relationship is going to turn bad quickly. The potentially bored student may be unattentive, or even worse, interrupt the class by throwing paperballs and other things.

If the teacher has excellent knowledge of his/her subject but is not able to establish a good relationship with a student, the student may be uninterested in the subject from the start and therefore not learn as well as he/she should, which leads to bad grades.

To conclude I'd say that the statement is not or only partially true. To really motivate the students and get them to write good grades, a teacher need to have both an ability to relate well with students and at least very good knowledge of his/her subject. If the teacher lacks one of those two, the students won't be as interested or not even able to learn for his/her subject.
