I think everyone was in his life at the point, when you think about, why there could not just be another teacher. Maybe it's because they have no knowledge about the topics or they just write some nonsense on the blackboard while nobody of the class can follow. As I had many teachers in my schoolcareer I was yet in both situations. 
A teacher who has a excellent knowledge  about the topics, for example a math teacher. He likes to solve very difficult problems and so he connects those problems with the lessons so the lessons are also intresting for him. But while he begins to solve problems he starts to drown in his own memorys and forgets about the class and just sees his way to solve a math problem. Of course nobody of the class can follow and they will all fail at the exam for sure. 
The opposit of this type of teachers are the teachers who have lituarally no knowledge about their subject. They begin the lesson talking with the students about things, that don't have anything to do with the subject. The things he talks about really don't match the subjets in school. Most of the class likes him because his lessons are very relaxed and they have a good relationship to each other. But in the end the students also have no clue of the topic and so they all going to fail the exam to.
I think both are very important to be a good teacher. You have to combine your huge knowledge about the subject and communicate with the class a lot. The teacher has also to be sure, that everybody can follow his explanations. If you can match those to things with your lessons than you will be a good teacher and everybody of the class will pass the exam.
