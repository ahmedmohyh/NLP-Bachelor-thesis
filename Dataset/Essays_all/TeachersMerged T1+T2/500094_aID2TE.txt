I think this statement had true aspects in it. Children attended school to learn things in their life. This includes not only the facts we learn in school also the ability to relate with the people around us. In Kindergarten we starts to leear this. Then the teachers teach us to behave but they give us also a little knowledge. But the knowledge stays in the background. For the students it is more important to learn to deal with other students. When a student has a huge knowledge but socially he is not very good developed he had difficults to deal with other people. But when his knowledge is not as good as others but his ability to deal with others I think his live would be better. In school students learn things and forgot them easily. So the excellent knowlege would also be lost in a few years. But the ability to relate with others people will not forget. An other point is that students prefer teachers who had the skill to relate well with them instead of a teacher who tell them lots of facts. 
On the other hand it depends on if a teacher knows lots. In my opinion it is important to have a teacher who is good at both of them.
