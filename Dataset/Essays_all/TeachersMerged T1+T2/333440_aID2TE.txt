No, I don't agree fully with this statement. Both, the ability to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge of the subject are important. We can't overweigh one criteria and make the other's importance inferior. Because both qualities matter and are equally essential for the learning process of a stundent.
The two worst cases there can be are: 

We have a teacher, whose ability to get on well with his students is splendid. But his knowledge is very short and poor.
Or we have a teacher, with great experience in his area but doesn't have the abilty to teach young students. 

We see that in both cases, the students will have to pass through more difficulties in order to get the appropriate eduaction they need. And that's exactly the point, why I think it's nonsense to think, that empathy is more important than knowledge or knowledge is more important than empathy. Yes, there will always be some teacher who have the tendencies to get well with students but have shorter knowledge and those who have the tendencies to have a strong knowledge but lack of empathy for students. But the main goal is to raise the level of both qualities. Every teacher should have both qualities. And if so, the better education the students can get.

If we do so, we can offer the best conditions for a healthy and effective way of passing through knowledge. And that should be the main goal for a succsessfull education in every parts of the world.
