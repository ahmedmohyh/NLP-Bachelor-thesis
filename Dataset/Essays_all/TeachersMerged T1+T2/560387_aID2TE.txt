A teachers ability to relate well with the students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Not every person is made to be a teacher. Teachers do not only need to have much knowledge about the subject they teach, they also have to build a good relationship between them and the students.

Student, kids, nearly everybody can lern better and faster, if the learning progress is connected with emotions. Our brain connects the emotions with the things we need to learn and we can easyly recreate the things by remembering the emotions. In general, we can learn better if when we connect the subjects and the facts with something. An example for this are short sentence we can remember easy, n wich we pack all the things we need to know or a word with all the first capitals of the important words.
As a student you realy need to know with whicht method you can learn the best. Teachers we do not like can take us the joy for a subject. We do not want to go to class and so we do not want to lern the things he taught us. But a teacher we like, and looking foreward to his lessons we normaly are more willing to know more about the subject and are more willing to learn. So we connect our fascination with the sympathy for the teacher. 
Teachers also need to explain things well. Maybe they have the excellent knowledge, but if he cannot explain and does not catch the students attention, the students are more likely to give up on working on the subject to really understand it. Another thing is that teachers really neeed to be patient, to give the the students time to understand the things they probably hear for the first time.

I totally agree with the Statement and think this iis important
