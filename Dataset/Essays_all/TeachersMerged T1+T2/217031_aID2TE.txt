The individual spends several years in school. This number can vary between nine to even thirteen years of school, which makes up most of our youth. We are daily around different teachers, preparing us for our future professions and being a role model and listener. But what actually is most important to be or become a good teacher? Is a teacher`s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

A lot of teenagers experience struggles during puberty. Unfortunately Mobbing is still a well-known subject and a high procentage of students get involved in such conflicts. Those ,who suffer from other people mocking them, often prefer to talk to another adult rather to their parents. The respectable role of a teacher should be such a person, one who takes time to make sure his students are okay. Here, we also talk about mental-illness or family conflicts, things a student might feel awkward about if a teacher can`t relate well with him. To create a enjoyable environment in the classroom, the teacher must try to have healthy relationships  to his studens. If a teacher knows his subject well, the students receive brilliant education. This can help the individual for further professions and will clearly also show an advantage in university. But for example an physician teacher can have excellent knowlege about a certain topic and is sometimes still not able to explain it in a way the students would understand. It takes other charismatic and language abilities.

Personally, I experience it as more valuable if a teacher can relate well with students, supporting the person behind the schoolbook. Good education is the key to a better future, but so is staying healthy and happy in mind.
