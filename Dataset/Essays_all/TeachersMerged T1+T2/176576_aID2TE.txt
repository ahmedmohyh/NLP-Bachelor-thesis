The relation between a teacher and a student is a very special one. And it is essencial , that his relation is good, or you can't learn anything. 
As example, I always hated Physics in our school. But after 2 years with the same teacher, which hated me and I hated him, he went to Australia for half a year. Then we got another teacher, and I realised that Physics can be fun, even though it's still Physics. I'm much more motivated to learn, if the teacher is good.
In my point of view, motivation is one of the most important things on high school / college level. And the motivation correlates with the teacher, and the way he teaches things. You can teach some subjects completely different, even tough they are the same. As example Biology. We could look all day at a picture of heart, and I would never understand it. But then the teacher decided, that we will cut up an actual heart of a pig, which helped a lot of us to better understand it. And doing such things with students, really can change the relationship to them. 
Another good example of a good realtion between students and teachers are our Chemistry and History teachers. Theynboth went with us to sa one week school trip to Copenhagen, there we made some projets and stuff, but nothing really serious. And we all had a great time, and later, back in school, everything in History or Chemistry lessons was a lot more easier to learn, because the teacher knew us better. 
But the second part of the sentence is because of that not wrong. Some teachers really need to know their stuff, foremost our Chemistry teacher, because if he messes up with a dangerous experiment, he or all of our class might die, as exapmle, when he made an ark of lightning in our classroom. It really helped a lot of us to understand how electricity works, and that it doesn't really is able to "jump" far distances.
But to finish it all of, I totally agree with this statement, but the knowledge of the subject is also very important.
