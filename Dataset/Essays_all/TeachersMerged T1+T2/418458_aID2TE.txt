A good teacher should be able to relate with his students. It makes it much more easier for the students to follow the lessons and to understand what they are being taught. When they sympathize with their teachers, the process of understanding takes less time and they also enjoy learning. On the other side, it is very important that the teacher knows what he is talking about. Otherwise the students are being taught things that are only halfway true. 
But a teacher that knows every single fact and wants his students to know these as well isn`t a good teacher either. For example when the lessons consist of a teacher standing in front of them and telling them everything he knows about a specific subject. The chance that the students are getting bored and can`t motivate themselves because they are feeling stupid, is very big. Or when a teacheer has an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching, but he can`t make his students understand it and he can`t answer questions. Their knowledge is useless when they aren`t able to relate well with students. Answering questions, helping students to understand better and faster and making them feel good are very important abilities a teacher should have. 
In my opinion, the statement is not wrong neither true. A good teacher has to be both, an expert with a great knowledge of what he is talking about and the ability to relate well with students. It makes the learning so much easier for the students when they have a teacher with a big knowledge and the ability to  relate well with them.
