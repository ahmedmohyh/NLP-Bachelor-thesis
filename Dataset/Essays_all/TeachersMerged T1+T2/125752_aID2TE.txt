I don't agree with this statement, but I also don't completely disagree with it. 

Of course, a teacher has to have a good knowledge of what he's teaching. Does it have to be excellent knowledge? Maybe. It depends on the grade the students are in. Up to fourth grade, teachers should have a quite good ability to relate to their students. Because they are kids. They require more attention than teens or young adults. That doesn't mean that kids don't need to be thaught stuff, but at that age they are only scratching the surface of the subjects they will learn throughout their education. This "scratching" doesn't require the teachers to have perfect knowledge of their subjects. What use is complicated Algebra to a second grade teacher, that teaches the kids about addition and subtraction? 

After the students have reached fifth grade, the focus should slowly shift over to the accumulation of knowledge. At this age they can be more foucused and are   more able to remember what they were thaught. They might also become more curious, start to dive into the subjects. This is where the teacher has to have an excellent knowledge. To make an analogy with the "diving" metaphore: After fourth grade, teachers should dive about twenty metres deeper in the subjects than their students, to tell them what is down there, if they ask. Their thirst for knowledge should be quenched. 

To sum it up: If that statement is true or false, depends on the grade the teacher is teaching. Up to (and including) fourth grade it is true. From fifth grade and above it is rather false.
