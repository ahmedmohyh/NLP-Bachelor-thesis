To start of I would like to say that I completly agree with the statement. 

If a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subjet but does not know how to relate with the students what is the point in teaching. In my opinion a teacher should allways relate with the students so he or she can understand the students problems. If a teacher does not relate with the students they do not feel comfortable asking the teacher their questions or telling the teacher their problems which is a huge problem. Going to the excellent knowledge teacher can be very interesting but it can get pretty boring, a crucial thing a teacher should be able to do is to see when the students are getting bored in other words the teacher should be able to read the students, which in my opinion a teacher with an excellent knowledge can not do. A teacher should be able to comprehend the students, to have fun with the students and to motivate the students. The excellent knowledge teacher does not have these abbilities, he only talks and talks about the subjet. If the subject is not of your interest attending that subject is like going to hell. Students are not motivated with the teacher with an execellent knowledge's class which leads to bad grades. 
Having a teacher that knows how to relate and how to understand the students even if the subject is not of your interest is much more fun than being taught by a teacher that has an excellent knowledge and is teaching a subject that is of your interest, but those teachers a very hard to find.
