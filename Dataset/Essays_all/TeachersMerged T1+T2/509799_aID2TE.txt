Everyone of us goes to school and knows the feeling that the lesson is so boaring. But the reason is not that the teacher isn't good enough. I mean the lesson could be also interessting without learning something. So it's the kind of art to relate well with students.

My opinion is that this statement is completely correct. I mean the important thing is that student understand what the teacher trys to teach them. So the best way that you can do it ist, that you build a realationship with him. This relationship leads that the student is more focused in the lesson because he has some fun and alternativy in the lesson. So in general, it helps the students to reach their goals.
But building a relationship could also have negative influences to the students. The fact is that not every student can understand this relationship. The result is that you will have a part of students that are unconcentraded and thinks that the teacher is also not interessted to be presented in the lesson.

In conclusion, the only thing that I can say is, that I hate a lesson that teacher just teach us something and the lesson is also boaring because we have no relationship with him. So I prefer it if we could have a class that we could communivate with the teachers like good friends. It would help us to do or learn with fun and ot the feeling that we are obligated to learn.
