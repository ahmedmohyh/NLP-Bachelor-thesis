In this essay I will compare arguments, which agree or disagree with the question.
If the teacher has a good ability to relate well with students, the mood in the lessons would be better and the students have more fun in the lessons.
One argument for an excellent knowledge teacher is that he knows very much about his lessons, that he can answer all questions from his students about this topic.
In our school some teachers dont know how to relate well with students, in those lessons the grades are normally not as good as in lessons with a teacher, which has a really good relation to his class. An other argument for the more social teacher is, that you learn more from a person that is nice to you and helps you if you have problems with some topics. If the teacher has a good relationship with his class he knows all the different students in his class, their strenghts and their weak sides, which is very important for creating individual lessons and tasks for each class.
It is really important to feel comftable in school, beacause you are there the half of the day and for a long time of your life, so if you have any problems with classmates or very hard topics. Talking about your problems with your well related teacher can solve the problems. 
A teacher, which has an excellent knowledge of his subject, but does not have any social conections to his class cant solve the problems from his students.
