Everyone knows the feeling when a student hates or loves a teacher depending on the notes. It is important that a teacher creates a good atmosphere in the classroom to support the students. Yet, the school subjects and the support for he follwing life are good points. School is for learning and teachers have to understand this.

Firstly, it is important for students to have a good relationship with their teachers. They feel more comfortable at school and they have a person to talk to when they have problems. It helps in learning new topics when they have support from their teachers. Additionally, there are benefits for students when the teacher can help them with difficult things. 
On the other hand, a teacher should not forget to teach his subjects. In the end, the students have to know everything in the test and for their following life.
Finally, the students have to know everything for studying. However, when they move to an university a lot changes. The teachers there have not enough time to help every single student. Moreover, there are so much students that nobody cares about a person. So it is important to learn about being alone with problems in the familiar school. Yet, in a familiar school the students interact with their teachers. Teachers can hardly stop this. 

In my opinion a teacher should teach the topics as well as he can. After the lessons he could talk with his students to create a good atmophere. Furthermore, friendship with friends in the same age is more important.
