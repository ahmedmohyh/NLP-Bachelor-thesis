We all know or knew the one teacher, who always wanted to be funny with us. And he wasn't, but he had an excellent knowledge of his subject. But other teachers were funny and had a good relation with us students. I wondered if a goo relation or the knowledge is more important.
On one side, there are subjects in which an excellent knowledge is more useful than a good relation between the teacher and the stundents, as well as the opposite exists. So I have to make a difference between the different subjects.
In science lessons like physics I think it is most important that the teacher has a great knowledge. You don't have to discuss with him, the aim of these lessons is that you get his knowledge as well. You don't need a relation that great between students and teachers to achieve this.
Another point is that students often have to solve problems in scientific subjects, therefore they don't have to spend much time talking to their teacher. So I think it isn't possible anyway to have an awesome relation with your physics teacher for example.
On the opposite, teachers who teach languages and philosophical subjects must be able to relate well with students. The aim of these lessons is to discuss with each other. Students mostly don't solve anything on their own, they often work all together with the teacher. As example discussing a book in German is a work in which the whole class, including the teacher, is envolved.
To end, I don't think it is possible to say which one is more important. But in my opinion, we can make the difference between scientific subjects in which knowledge is more useful and language or philosophical ones in which the relationship takes a bigger part.
