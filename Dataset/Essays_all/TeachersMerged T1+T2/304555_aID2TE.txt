A teacher has to be more than a teacher in our days. He or she has to be a friend, a mentor, a boss and far more. It is very important that the teacher is accepted by a class, because if not, he has no chance to educate them well. To be accepted, a teacher must relate really well with his or her students. A teacher must find the small point of being on the same level as his or her students and on the other hand, be a respected person for them. That is not easy and can't be ignored.
First of all, it is clear, that a teacher who don't know his subject well, can't be good teacher. On that sight, it is more important to knwo a subject really well and have no relation with the students. A teacher can lead his class with fear and hate and the may turn out better than others, because of the good knowledge from the teacher. The only question that remains here is: How do the students feel with such a teacher?
Another point of view is, that a beloved and happy teacher may teach more to his students than the teacher descriped above. It is scientifical proved, that students can learn more easily and faster in a good atmossphaire, than in a bad one. If a teacher can create a space around him or her, where the students feel well, they will learn a lot better from him, than from a hated teacher. And so, it isn't so much important for that type of a teacher to know his subject really, really well, if he or she has a better access to the students than another teacher.
My concluding view on that topic is, that teachers should be in a good relation with their students. If they are not, their only choice to teach them something is to create a spaceof fear, hate and danger, so that the students have no other chocie than to learn fast and good. A good teacher must find this specific point in his or her class, where he is respected and accepted at the same time. In fact, that is very hard and should be teached at the teachers schools or in specific courses for teachers.
