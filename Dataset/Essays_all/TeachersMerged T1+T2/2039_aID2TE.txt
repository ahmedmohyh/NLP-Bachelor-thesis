In school there are always students, who don't like their teachers or who can't keep up with topics and learning. But is it better to have teachers who can relate well with their students or is it better to have teachers who are just perfect in the subject they teach? 
First of all students with teachers, who are excellent in their topic, have an advantage over other students in terms of pure knowledge. And even if they still can't quite keep up, the students have the perfect teacher to ask, which will probably help them alot aswell, especially in maths, where you have to learn it no matter if one understands it or not. Someone who can teach it to the smallest detail sure is very helpful.
However students may not even have those problems, if the teacher can relate with is students and see what their problems are. Thus they might not even get into trouble in the first place. The students may also like their teacher more and are more open-minded in lessons and there's just a nicer learning atmosphere. Students might even have fun while learing, which will significantly increase their process of learning. Maths is always a good example, so if you struggle in a topic, you'll lose interest, but if the teacher feels you, he can help and make it fun again to help with the learning process.
All in all I would say, that it is way more important as a teacher to relate with the students and have a nice atmosphere in class than having the best knowledge, but the students are not interested and struggle to keep up.
