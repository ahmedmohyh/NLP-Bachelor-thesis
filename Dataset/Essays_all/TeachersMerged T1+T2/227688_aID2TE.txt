Following various discussions in Swiss society concerninig money savings in public schools, the teachers abilities are now in the foreground. Their importance to the future of the following generations is not be diminished. However, there are some questions being raised that have to be considered whenever talking about teachers. 
Should a teacher be able to relate well with his students what may lead to a lack of specific knowledge of the matter or should there be an excellent understanding of the subject being taught what may result in unsatisfying abilities of teaching? 

First to be considered is that one would have to make a distingution between the levels that is being taught on. A primary school teacher of maths does not have to have the same mathematical skills and abilities as a secondary school teacher. The ability of getting someone to understand a subject is more important when working with smaller children than it is while working with older people that are able to make broader connections between different subjects and are capable of thinking freely on their own. 

Furthermore, is it important to keep especialey young people such as teenagers interested in many different subjects. The profound knowledge of the teacher will not guarantee the interest of teenagers, so the teacher has to be able to make the young people 

Therefore, it is best to have a deep and good understanding of the subject but at the same time being able to relate well with the students so both sides can take the best out of every lesson.
