Nice teacher or wise teacher?
Students often argue if a teacher is good or bad, some say a good teacher is very nice and other say a good teacher has to be well informed about the stuff he teaches.
At first it is important to say that if a teacher is nice to his students, the students have more trust in the teacher and they take him more serious. So it is eadier for the teacher to get the students interested in the topic.

On the other hand the teacher should be well informed about the topic so he can teach all the important information to the students. But if his class is boring its hard for the teacher to get the students interested in the topic so they may even learn nothing. If the teacher fails to motivate the students they wont learn anything.

But if the teacher is too nice it may happen that the students gain too much trust and they see the teacher more as a friend and start to not take him serious anymore the same can happen that they wont learn anything.

I think that a teacher should relate well with the students but he should be strict at the same time the keep up the moral of his students. Even though he may not be an expert in that topic the students are able to learn everything, that he teaches, without any problems.
