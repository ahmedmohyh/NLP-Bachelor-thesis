The satement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent konowledge of the subject being taugt have for me not a clear opinion at the beginning. When I think about it I become a result.

Then for me it's important that the relation between students and teachers should be good, but not in a fiendly way. When the teacher is very very discret the students haven't fun in the lessons. And for that reason the students learn not so well, because their view of the lessons are not very good. 
But I think also, that the teacher should has execellent knowledge of the subjet. Then thats the important point. When the taecher has not a good knowledge he can not teach the students on a hight level. An other important thing about this is that a teacher will be not consequent when he has a very good relation to the students. In the lower levels, for example the children primary school, their ability to relate well with students is in fact more imortant than the knowledge. But in a hight school the knowledge is clearly more important and in the focus as the good relation between students and teachers. A teacher is not your friend. He cans help you when you have a problem or something in such way, but he must not has the ability to relate well with you.   

 In a conclusion, I think that a teacher should has a realation to the students, that is okei. The knowledge of a teacher is so important, than without the students do not learn the thinks correctly. I disagree this statement. I opinion is, that the knowledge of a subject is more important than the ability to relate well with students.
