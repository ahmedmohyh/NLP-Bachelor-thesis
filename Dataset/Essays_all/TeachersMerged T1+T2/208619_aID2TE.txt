A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Of course, teachers have to come along with their students which talk the biggest part of their day only with the people in school. But on the other hand they are at a school for a reason - the reason to teach us in a specific subject. Finally, family is there to support the students and teachers - as the name already says - to teach. Teachers have to have excellent knowledge of their subject.

A students day is actually really boring. Beside school, they don't do very much. So a good connection to the people which are with us most of the time is important. Teachers are the example for an adult in his working life. They do not only teach the students knowledge, but also what working is like.
To see more from this life, schools do internships. So the students can do their own experiences with working. Teachers studied a specific subjet and to teach this subject, they work at schools. 
Teachers are not educated to hold the students hands. They are not there to love them and give them courage, for that everyone has friends, family or in the worst case a teacher of trust, like a psychologist.

I agree with the statement in the first line. Sure, students need support just like everyone, but this support should come from friends or family and not a person who is getting payed to teach us the function of the blood. That the teachers have to relate well with students will help them to reach the students, but it isn't the most important thing.
