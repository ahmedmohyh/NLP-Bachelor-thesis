This question is actually discussed in many situations.
On one side, the students are more interested in a subject, if they like the teacher. i made this experience too. They are more motivated and the students want to be good. the teacher has to respect all people and has to treat his students fair. As a result of this, the atmosphere in class is for every person confortable. if the teacher doesn't know something special, he can go online and search it or look it up in a book, but a good relationship with his students he couldn't get so easily. The score, a teacher should reach, is that the students are learning as much as they could, not for school and tests but for life. If the teacher relates well, the students learn much, and even if the teacher is excellent in one subject and has a hudge knowlegde, it's useless if the students don't learn anything. 

One the other side, a teacher's hired for teaching his students and make them great in a specific subject. He has to konw nearly everything about a topic. the students are in school, to learn for themselves, to get a job later and can stand in our society... The teacher isn't responsible, that the students learn something, it's up to them on their own if they make progresses and learn something or not. A teacher needs authority, and to have this, he has to make strict rules - even if  the students don't like them- and also mustn't be afraid of making consequenzes.

In my opinion, a teacher should be an expert on his subject, he mustn't act like a colleague, he still needs authority and he doesn't get that with being friendly and making all the students want him to do, then he won't be respected at all. Nevertheless, a fair treatment is really important.
