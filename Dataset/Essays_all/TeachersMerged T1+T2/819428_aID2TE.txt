A teacher doesn`t have an easy job. They have to be well teached in their subject, shall have the quality to explain understandable and they also should motivate the students for learning "difficult", "boring" or "uninteresting" themes. But which thing is more important for a teacher: relating well with the students or excellent knowledge of the subject?

First, I think that an exellent knowledge of the subject is very important. Whithout knowing anything about the themes of the subject a teacher can`t explain them to others. It is a kind of basis which a teacher shall have. Imagine when the teacher doesn`t know anything about his subject: What about shall he speak to the students?

Secondly, for me it is very important too that a teacher has a good relationship to his students. If this relationship is given the students want to listen to the teacher. They are kind of catched from the teachers kind of explaining rules or showing possible solutions for an exercise. They really want to go to the teacher`s class because it is like an adventure for them. It is also very important for the teacher to have a good relationship to the students because then she or he feels it too when the students like to listen her or him.

To conclude, a teacher has to know much about his subject but it is necessary too to have a good climate or atmosphere in the classroom. The easiest way for this is to have a good relationship to the students. All in all, knowledge is important but the basis when you work with people is to have a good teamwork between students and teacher.
