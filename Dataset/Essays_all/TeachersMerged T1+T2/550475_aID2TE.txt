I agree with this statement, although there are also aspects which point out why one could disagree. 
A thecher who can relate well with students is important because of several reasons: One one side, he is more likely to create an agreeable atmosphere in the classroom since he should be able to motivate his students. Motivation has a high significance concerning the ability of understanding things. A teacher that can relate well with his students is probably also rather able to solve social problems like bullying in a class than a teacher who cannot personally deal with his students. But of course, it doesn't help the students if they have a really good relationship to a teacher that doesn't have a good knowledge of the subject being taught, because than, they aren't likely to take profit from the lessons either.  
Obviously, excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught is one of a teacher's most important qualities. Still, a teacher who knows very much, but who isn't able to teach or explain this to his students is more likely to confuse them with detailed facts than to actually help them understand the topic dealt with. Further more, an excellent knowledge isn't really necessary in a normal school since it's not a university where you really have to go into details. Of course, the teacher needs to understand his subject very well and the more he knows, the better for the class. Never the less, the excellent knowledge of a teacher  doesn't help his students if he isn't able to interact and relate with them. 
In my opinion, a combination of both qualities would be the ideal case. If I had to decide, I'd choose the excellent knowledge, because, after all, a teacher is supposed to teach his students the contents of a subject and not to be their best friend or something similar.
