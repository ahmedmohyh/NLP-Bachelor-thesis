Teachers are some of the most influencial people in a childs life, because of that it is important to face the fact that not everyone is suitable to be a teacher. Two of the most important factors are the knowledge of the subject beeing taught and of course the ability to interact with the students.
Teachers should be able to listen closely to a students needs, to help them into succesful learning. Teachers should create a space in which students feel like their wishes and hopes are beeing respected. 
Knowledge is the base of every lesson. The most important point in a teacher-student relationship. A teacher should have specific knowledge and he or she should e able to answer questions.
We've all had that one very intelligent teacher, who was unable to built up a trustful atmosphere in a classroom. Did we learn anything in his lessons? I don't think so! For me personnaly it is very important for a teacher to be able to relate well with students and to  build up a relationship.
