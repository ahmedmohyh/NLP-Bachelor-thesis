A teacher's ability to relate well with students is in my opinion not important as an excellent knowledge of the subject he or she taughts. 
When your teacher does not know their subject well they can not really teach it. When you got a question how could they answer it when they do not know their subject well? The ability to communicate with students is also important but not as important as the other point. 
That does not mean that it is unnecessary to have the ability to communicate with the students well, because it is necessary to explain something to a student again, because he or she for example has a problem with the new topic and he or she needs it more detailed this time or in an easier way. But to do that you need a background knowledge of your topic as a teacher.
Very important is it when it is about learning new languages. If a English teacher can not speak english well, how could he or she ever teach you something good. You would copy his mistakes of pronunciation or he would explain you things in a wrong way. 
Even if some teachers are very unfriendly or even mean sometimes, I would rather accept it than having a teacher who could not answer my questions or teach me something. Because that are also reasons why you are in school. You want to learn something. In the fact of the final exams it is also really important to have a knowledge teacher. Because you will write an exam which is constructed by the ministerium and you should have to do it even if you do not have the whole background knowledge, because of your teacher. 
To put it in a nutshell I would say that a teacher with an excellent knowledge is more important than a teacher who could relate well with students because it will affect your own knowledge and your grades later in your final exam.
