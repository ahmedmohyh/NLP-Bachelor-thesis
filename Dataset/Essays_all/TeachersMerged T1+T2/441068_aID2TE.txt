A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I totally agree with this statement. The teacher must relate well with his students, because if he doesn't, the students won't listen and won't have the same interests to take part of the lession. Also the teacher may not be happy about his job, because if the students aren't interested to learn something from the teacher, the teacher won't be interested to teach the students. If the teacher relates to the students, the students might even have fun and if the students have fun, they will learn even bether than if they don't have fun, but get taught a bigger amount and a bether knowledge of the subject. The students might even forget most about what the teacher with the bether knowledge just said or they just won't get it, because the teacher doesn't relate to them and can't explain it in a kind, the students are able to learn it. On the other hand, the teacher has to know the subject much bether, as the students will have to, as they write an exam. because if he doesn't, he won't be able to teach them anything, even if his relating well to the students. But however at  primary school, the ability to relate to the students is much more important, as later on, to older studets, but the chance, that the teacher has less knowledge than his students at primary school, is low. But the best teacher, logically has both. The ability to relate tho his students, and excellent knowledge.
