A teachers ability to relate with the students is very important, which I know first hand. You can have a teacher with excellent knowledge, the best degree there is and you might still not understand a thing he says. It is essential to try to understand the students to be able to help and teach them, because they all have a different way of thinking and may not comprehend yours.
Though I wouldn't say that it's the most important thing, because if you don't know the basics yourself, you can hardly teach them to someone else. So first, the teacher has to make sure he understands the subject in every way there is and has great knowledge about it. Because explaining something you don't quite understand yourself can be very hard.
For example, I have a biology problem and ask my friend for help. He read the details, thinks he understands it, but while explaining to me he realizes he doesn't get every aspect of the homework.So he can't explain it to me, because he might not have the best knowledge about it himself. 
But lets say he does have great knowledge of it a day later, after studying. I ask him again, and while now he might now everyhing about the subject there is to know, I still don't understand it. Why? Because I might not understand the way he thinks and his way of explaining. So he has the knowledge, but not the ability to comprehend the students and to relate with them. 
Thus, I disagree with the statement.Neither the ability to relate nor the knowledge is most important. I believe that both qualities are equally important in a teacher, because they go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other, and to succeed as a teacher you need both.
