I don´t feel able to answer this question seriously. 
Different abilities and types of students lead to an individual way of being taught best.
Learners with lower ambitions when it comes to their own education or marks are probably in a better position if the teacher is able to motivate him.
In this case, the knowledge of the subject isn´t relevant because, in my opinion, school isn´t about getting a big knowledge of specific subjects, but about the ability of learning. The lessons should inspire the students to educate themselves while teaching them the tools they need for studying. 
A teacher with bad relations to a student is reduced as a person who taughts  pieces of informations which are relevant for a test, not as someone being a teacher out of passion, to help children in life.
On the other hand, students should be prepared for their time after school, they will come in situations which need to corporate with people they can´t realete well with.
On the other hand, a teacher with isn´t educated well himself is maybe not motivated, don´t have the tools or the motivation which he should teach himself.
In conclusion, my agreement on the statement depends on the student, his theme-specific knowledge, his age and his personal type of learning. We also have to differentiate different types of teachers, with and without excellent knowledge.
