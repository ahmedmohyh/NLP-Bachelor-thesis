Being a teacher is not always easy. Some people expect teachers to have an excellent knowledge about the subjetct they are teaching. Others think that it is more importatnt that the teacher has the ability to relate with students.

Having a teacher who has an excellent knowledge of a subject is very important. If they do not understand the things they should be teaching they are not able to explain the subject. Furthermore are those teachers, who have an excellent knowledge of their subject, often more motivated to teach the subject and they invest very much time in preparing their lesson. Additionally the sutdents are often more motivated when they know that the teacher has fun doing his or her job and is very passionate about it.
But what if the teacher is not able to relate with his or her students? In that case the atmosphere in the lesson is mostly hindering the students from leraning new things. It is also very difficult to understand a problem because the teacher  won't be able to understand where the problem is and how to explain it that the student will get it. The most excellent knowledge of a subject does not mean that this person will be a good teacher beacause you need relate to your students in order to know how to teach the subject in a way the students will get it.

I think that it is very important that a teacher can relate with students otherwise they won't learn  as much as they could. No matter how excellent the knowledge of the teacher is. Being able to relate to students means being able to adapt the lesson at the students needs. This creates an atmosphere that is perfect for learning. And if the teacher has a relatively good knowledge of the subject there shouldn't be any problem.
