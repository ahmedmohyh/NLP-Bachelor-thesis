Many people think it is pretty important that teachers have a good relationship to the students they teach but is that more worth than a good knowledge of the subject they teach?
It is true that the students feel more comfortable going to school when they like their teachers. For example there are many teenagers who are afraid of going to school because of their teachers. They are often strict and that's the reason why there were many students who suicided in the past only because of the pressure they got from them. But school shouldn't be your favourite place to be. School schould prepare you for your life as an adult with a job.
Another point is that students often don't like their teachers but are good in school anyway. You don't have to like them to be successful in school. For sure it is nicer to have a teacher who you like and with who you have a good relationship but you always have to keep in  mind that teachers can change because of different reasons like illness or pregnancy and then you have to deal with a totally different person. It could become a problem if you get used to always have the same teacher if he or she is very close to you and then suddenly another person teaches you. 
In my opinion it is more important to have an excellente knowledge of the subject because if you want to pass your exams you really have to understand what they want to teach you in school. In your later life you will also have to deal with persons you don't like but you have to accept that and not surrender just because of that.
