Teachers are supposed to teach students well. So they must have excellent knowledge of the subject they're teaching. But it's also important that they communicate and care for their students. It can be very important in some situations that students can talk to their teacher on a personal level, because if the student has a problem and he/she doesn't want to talk to their parents, siblings, friends or classmates it is helpfull if the teaches listens to he/she. I think that sometimes students don't want a teacher who does not care about them at all and just teaches the subject. So in a conversation with a student the teacher can listen to the problem, can help and discuss a good solution. But the teacher should also concentrate on his teaching because who needs a good relationship with a teacher if you don't learn anything important in school?                                   It's okay if the relationship to a teacher is good, but it shouldn't get further so that the teacher is your friend. That would be too much, because they are teachers and not friends. Especially young children or teens in puberty could need the opinion from an adult. The teachers study one, two or even three subjects in university, but they also get taught how to communicate with students. So it's part of their job to have an open ear. But they need to stay on the teacher level. Many NEWS reported, especially in the United States of America, that teachers have an affair with their students. And in my opinion the reason of this is because the teachers are too close to their students, there needs to be some kind of distance between them. I think that teachers must find the middle way: They need the ability to relate with students, I mean they were in school too so they know how it feels, but it's also important that they are doing their job which is teaching the students something. So they need an excellent knowledge of their subject because that it their main job. 
  
So all in all I agree with the statement in some kind of way that teachers need to have a relationship with their students, but not on a friend basis. They also need to know much about what their teaching. I disagree with the statement because I think the relationship between students and teachers shouldn't be more important than the stuff they're teaching. You as a student can have a good relationship with a teacher but he/she should focus on the subject. It's important that you can talk to him/her but you are in school because you should or want to learn something, and not to build a friendship with your teacher. So I disagree with the statement, I believe that the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than a teacher's ability to relate well with students.
