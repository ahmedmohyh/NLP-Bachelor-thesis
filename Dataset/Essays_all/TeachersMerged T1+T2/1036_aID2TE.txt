Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? This topic divides the education-society - some students are in school to actually learn something and do not care about others. On the orther hand are students, who should get the majority, who are in school to learn something and are also trying to have fun there. In this case a good relationship between teacher and students is absolutely important because students grades also depend on their social aspects. However a teacher can not really help you with your final exams if he also does not know what he is talking about. For example a math teacher is in a great relationship with his class, is giving them good grades and everything seems fine, but the teacher does not really know what he is talking about or even worse he explains new topics wrong which would be fatal for his students' final exams. So the teacher's ability to relate with students is not more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. However it is still important for teachers to have an adequate relationship with their classes. So here is another example: The teacher has excellent knowledge about his topic explains everything greatly, but the class hates him because his lessons are absolutely boring and his personality is also not that great. So the students' motivation before and in the lessons is at a minimum. If this happens less students will learn something because no one is listening to the teacher anymore. So it is important for teachers to be able to have a good relationship to his students however they should still know what they are talking about and how they can present their contents to their students to get their attention.
