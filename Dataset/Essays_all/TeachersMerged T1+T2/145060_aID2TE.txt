The statement of today is '' A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught ''. In the essay I will list the pro an contra of this statement.

The excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught is more important because in the school the students should learn a lot of things that's the reason why an excellent knowledge is better than a teacher's ability to relate well with students. When a teacher has well with students they perhaps forget the main thing, the important thing the knowledge of the subject. It's very imporrant that the students have a base for later. It's also important that the students have the same base.

A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important because then a teacher and a student can understand eachother better. A stuendt like than a subject more when they have a good conversation with the teacher.

My opinion is that both is important. When both is given than it's a good mix.
