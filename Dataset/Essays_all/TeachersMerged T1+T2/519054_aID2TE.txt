On the one hand you have great teachers in the teaching kind of manners. Teachers with the ability to teach, with a great pool of knowledge where they can pullaout a rabbit out of nowhere. All of a sudden, the subject is clear to the one asking because of the unbelievable power of knowledge they have. But overall their character is bad and they are just cunts. They are possibly taking the piss out of everyone in the room whenever they can. But sometimes they also give you that little extra, that kick up the arse which you might need to go on giving your all and treying your hardest. On the other hand you have teachers who are nice to you and they try their hardest to explain you what you want to know. It maybe isn't always clear and you have to ask another person in the classroom who has understood the subject to get more knowledge or more wisdom. These teachers are sometimes the ones who tend to let things take their own path. They don't want you to fail on the next exam but that's what they are risking. Exams are important and very decisive in your own life. Teachers have their graduation and theirjobss. Young people don't. They have to fight for good grades. That's why I think a teacher who does give you that extra pressure is better than the a teacher who says well at least you tried. At the end you won't buy anything with saying I get on well with the teacher I had in 7th grade. Grades are what will be counting.
