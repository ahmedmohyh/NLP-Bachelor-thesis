Teaching is a very difficult thing. There is not the perfect way to do it. But what is more important, the knowledge or the ability to empathize with the students?

First of all there is the need to say that if you want to teach something you need to know what you are talking about. It is necessary to be able to answer questions and explain difficult relations. If you have studied german you shouldn´t teach biology - and you probably can´t because you don´t know how the breathing of a cell works exactly.
But otherwise you need to be able to relate to your students struggles with a subject. It is very important to stay on your pupils niveau and that is something you can´t do with pure knowldege. It´s not a simple explaining things but it is understanding your students niveau and trying to relate to his knowledge to be able to make the explanation understandable. Furthermore a joke or two in class and a good relation with the pupils will make them much more motivated to listen and to care about what you say.

I think it´s very difficult to judge the statement because in my eyes the whole thing depends very much on the subject. If you teach e.g. in a language class it´s more important to relate with the students than to have the perfect knowledge. Of course, the basics should be there, but especially with the older students you mainly discuss texts and than it´s very important to understand your students and to relate with them to be able to understand everything. The other way round, in a biololgy class you need to be able to explain everything very exact and here the knowledge is very important.
So all in all I think even though there are slightly differences between different subjects a teachers knowledge and his realtion with the students is equally important.
