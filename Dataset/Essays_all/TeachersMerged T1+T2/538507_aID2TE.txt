Good teachers are rare. There are many teachers who seem to understand their subject, but they aren't able to explain it easy enough that a less talented students can follow him. Another kind of teacher is also excelent in his subject and can also explain it very easy to understand. His or her problem is to make the lesson attractive and interessting. Then he can explain as good as hewants but it is useless if no one is listening. This tis may also happen if a teacher hasn't got any autority.

Teachers who always have the students attention aren't always better. If his or her joes are the reason for them to listn to the teacher it isn't very useful but if he is just very strict and scares the students it isn't an improvement either.
For me a good teacher has a mixture of all these points: He is very good at his subject and has the competence to even answer to more difficult questions. Furthermore he is able to explain easy enough for the slower students but fast enough for the more talented students. If the stundents like to listen to what the teacher sais without  threatenings of punishement he has a milestone behind him. This makes a comfortable learning atmosphere not only for the teacher but also for the students. Of corse I dont want to say that a teacher shouldn't make any jokes,no,it is all a question of how many.

But to come back to the question: I think it is more important that a teacher can relate to his students than that having an excellent knowledge because all his knowledge is useless if he can't share it properly to his students.
