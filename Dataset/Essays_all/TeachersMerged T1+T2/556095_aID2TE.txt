It is well known that students prefer teachers they have a good relationship with. Therefore the motivation rises even though it's not their favourite subject that they are being thaught. At this point I need to emphasize that motivation is such an important factor when it's about learning. If you don't want to learn anything, then how could you even understand or remember what you are thaught? A lack of effort in school would lead to a lack of knowledge which is obviously not what school is meant for. It is rather the opposite.
Anyway, if there is motivation to learn something, then what you learn should be of a high quality. Otherwise you could skip school and have the same knowledge as if you went to school and would learn things that aren't true. It is important to consider that not only the knowledge of a subjects makes a good teacher but also how they teach the students. This leads us again to the ability to relate well with the students which comes from the ability to create an interesting and versatile lesson. 
In my opinion the knowledge of the subject is an essential and cannot be replaced by the good harmony between teacher and students. Whether they have a good relationship or not, in the end it is a decision that the students make for themselves. It depends on them if they are wiling to be active and pay attention during the lessons. Students learn for nobody else but themselves and it is important to know well about certain subjects in order to be able to get a good job later. 
So in conclusion I do not support what the statement is saying. The excellent knowledge of the subject is way more important than a well-working relationship between the students and their teacher.
