Teachers

This question do not come up so often but in fact it is a really good thing to ask. Do teachers have to know everything about their subject or do the students learn more if they get on well with their teachers?

I agree with this statement because in this job you work with humans and so you should treat them like.

Firstly it is true that teachers must have a goog knowledge of what they teach. Without a good education you cannot tell others how something works that would be unlogical. In addition to that, you must have studied the subject to teach it on a gymnasium and that means that teachers have to have a good knowledge. For many schools it is really important to have teachers with well grades in their subjects, even if they are kind of strange.

From a students perspective it is more important to understand what the teacher says than to understand what he teaches. That sounds a bit weird but in fact you have to know what your teachers mean when they say it. Thats no as simple as it sounds. There are so many teachers who are very intelligent but cannot teach their students what they have to know even if it is an easy theme. Additionally it is true that children learn better in primary because the teachers have a pedagogical education. They can teach things better to childrens because they know how to talk with their students.

In conclusion to that, my opinion is that teachers have to get on better with their students to be a succesful teacher.
