There are different kind of teachers in this world. Some have great knowledge when it comes to every single detail of there subject. Others have great comunication skills torelate very well with their students. A few teachers may also have both abilities on a high level. But what is more important? What separates teachers from good teachers and excellent teachers?

It's very important to have a big amount of knowledge concerning the subject that's taught. If you don't know a lot more then you're students, lessons get very boring and unefficient. Everyone has had at least one teacher in their school career that clearly appeared incompetent when it comes to their acutal knowledge. Most of the times those lessons end up being very boring and not beneficial at all.
But even if you know a lot you can't teach things to your pupils if you don't have well developped comunication skills. Students don't listen to teachers that seem to be very strange and unpolite or disrespectful. I once had one of those teachers in my history class and even though he knew a ton about history and it might have been very interesting I just didn't listen very much because I always felt like he was the biggest douchebag in the world.
When you're teaching young kids, you might come away with a lack of knowledge because you can make it up with a great way to relate to the children. In our age this isn't possible anymore because if we see some content issues the teacher immediatly lose some respect. This results in a lack of attention in every lesson to come.

In the end it all comes down to a great mix of the two skills mentionned above. As a teacher you absolutely need to be well educated about your subject but at the same time you have to be able to comunicate with young people and build a comfortable learning situation. Only with this mix you can end up being a good teacher.
