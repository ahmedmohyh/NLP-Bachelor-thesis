I think the knowledge of a teacher is very important because if a student has a question, the teacher should be able to answer it. That's what a teacher is there for obviously. Particularly at highschools(Gymnasium) or universitys.  I suppose that the ability to relate with students gets less important the higher the level is. But especially at primary school a teacher should be able to relate well with kids and understand them if they make a mistake. But also at the secondary school a teacher should have got much empathy for his student because it's a very difficult age. Very Often they behave reckless and wild and a teacher should be able to handle and understand that. Because in that kind of age the kids just want to go outside and have fun with each other and experience new stuff. Obviously it's a very difficult age because they want to try unknown stuff. They make the first experiences with drugs, sex and stuff so it's a great deal more important to talk with the student about these topics than being a strict teacher.
