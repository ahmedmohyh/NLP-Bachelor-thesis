A math teacher is very nice, but does not know how to solve the problems. A german teacher who does not know what the right verbform ist, but she brings cake all the time. Is it important that teachers have a good relationship with students, but in return they do not have a deeper knowledge of the topic?

Firstly we are going to school to learn things, to widen our horizon, and not to have a lovely day with nice people. But this is only guaranteed if the teachers have a knowledge which goes deeper into their subject than just some basic skills. And that they can answer questions wich are beyond their main subject.

On the other hand, it is important that students have a good learning atmosphere and not just a place where they are forced to do things by people they hate.
So the relation with not only teachers but also students is mandatory for young adults.

In contrary to the upper argument, is that you can not choose you teachers. For example if you have teachers that are not fair and love some students more than others it can be quite frustraiting for those students who are not getting along aso good as those who do.

In the end I think, that the student teacher relationship is very important not only because they prepare you for adult life but also because they are role models.
But the most important skill of a teacher is to have a deep understanding of his topic and open a new world for a stundent. So it is very important that teachers are well prepared for their important task wether it is their social education or the subject one.
