Today in our society teachers have a very important role. They can influence the entire development of students, especially of children. Many people ask the question: What is more important, a good relationship between the students and the teacher or an excellent knowledge of the subject?

Well like i just mentioned, a teacher has to educate a new generation and if he/she has a god relationship to the students he can help them to develop in the right direction. That becomes more and more important if some children have a lack of education. So its possible that the teacher can undo a fault of the parents. 

Its also important to mention that the students are often complaining about school. Especially because a lot of leesons are "boring". A teacher who really understands the students can create interesting and enjoyable lessons to deny those problems. 

On the other hand there is a big problem. If the teachers doesnt know their subject well, he cant offer the entire knowledge to his students. Its undeniable that a teacher whith a lack of knowledge is not able to teach his subject well. And this is unexpectable because the function in school is to teach an entire generation.

To conclude i can say that I disagree with the statement. I know that the teachers have an educate role but I cant tolerate a lack of knowledge which can influence an entire live of a student.
