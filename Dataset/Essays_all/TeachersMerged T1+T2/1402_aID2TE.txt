Does the teacher´s ability tpo relate well with the students be more important than an excellent knowledge of the subjet being taught? 
This depends on the view you´re looking through. An argument that the ability to relate well with the students is that the teacher would understand her/ his studens´ the opinions and views. Also the teacher has to come along with young people for nearly 50 years and if she/ he doesn´t, it isn´t quite the right job. Furthermore the students are more motivated on going to school and studying, if they like the teacher and she/he is understanding. This point leads to the other view. If the teacher doesn´t know that much about what she/he has to teach her/his students, she/he can not prepare them well for exams or in particular for the finals. This would disappoint this students, in particular the elder ones, who put more importance on the teacher´s competentions for teaching than on the ones for being a nice person. Also could you ask yourself why a person who doesn´t know about a subject could make it through the university and become a teacher? The person wouldn´t.
In conclusion we can say that the teacher might have both abilitys. It´s important that she/he can prepare the students for everything they have to know to have good marks but it´s also necessary that she/ he doesn´t scare the students and that she/he isn´t unfriendly so that the students get disappointed.
In my opinion it depends on the person whether you like the teacher or not. Of course she/ he has to be social competent so that the relationship can be a good one but what´s really important for my is that the teacher prepares me the best as possible so that I´m not failing my exams and finals.
