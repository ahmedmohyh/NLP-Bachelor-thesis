For me, the ability to relate well with the students is very important, but I wouln't say that it's more important than the knowledge of the subject being taught. With less knowledge, a teacher can't animate his class because the lessons aren't very interesting. Otherwise, without any relation to the students, the teacher wouldn't be heard of his class. So I think, a good teacher has to be friendly, sometimes funny, but also consequent. When this points exist, a good relation between the teacher and the students is possible. It shouldn't be a relation too closely, that can annoying the students and than all the knowledge woulnd't help - the class don't take the teacher serious. 

My experience showed me that I prefere the distance to teachers; our French teacher speakes with us like we were his friends. That I can't stood! Although she has done her disertation in her subject, I have the feelings that I haven't learned really much in the last two years. Probably that's my fault because I don't give all the attention in this lessons because she makes me a bit angry with her apperance.

The other example was a Math teacher earlier. He was really nice and we all liked him, but unfortunately he was too unsure about what he said. In many lessons he was thinking for himself what he has to do and for us as students was that also annoying. I've seen that I haven't trust him in all things and for that I din't like him really.
