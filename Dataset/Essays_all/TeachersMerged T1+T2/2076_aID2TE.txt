For years teachers have only been important to share their knowledge in their subjects but nowadays many people say that a teachers ability to relate with the students is ways more important than that.

On the one hand side a teacher should know what he is talking about in his lessons. He should be able to answer on questions from his students and to get the students interested in the topics. For sure not everyone is interested in everything or motivated to learn for stuff he or she doesn't need for their future but it's in the teachers hand not to get demotivated aswell. And this already is one reason why a teachers ability to realte with the students is very important.
A teacher is not only a person who is standing in front of a class trying to teach stuff to children and youths that aren't even interested in what he is talking about. A teacher is much more than that. He isn't only a teacher in his subject but also in way of thinking, acting and living.
While the world is getting faster and faster the pressure on the students grows and with that their need of a person showing them how to deal with it. And who would be better for that role than a person that is no family member and is in the same system in which the students are? With a teacher there is an adult who shares their problems but sometimes has a very different point of view on them because of their experiences.

In my opinion a teacher should be good in his subject but he shouldn't forget that he is also a person students look up to. They will reflect their behaviour and thoughts and that is why teachers should know about the influence they have.
