The whole class g4i failed the matura in mathemathics. Probably because of bad teaching. 
Teachers should have an excellent knowledge of what they are teaching for the class' sake or a whole class can fail an important test as it happend with the class g4i. They should have a high level in their subject to be able to teach it, especially in schools, which are graduatintg with the Matura. So teachers should be highly educated at least in the subject they are teaching about. Of course a theacher is a better teacher when he can relate with students, but this is an ability which is not as important as the knowledge. If a teacher can relate with students, he is probably more popular than a teacher who cannot. But popularity does not play a big role in our education system. And every teacher knows that having homeworks is not the favourite thing of a student, and if a teacher gives no homeworks, because he can relate very well wit his students, then the knowledge of students stays at the same level, which is not very good.  What happens when a student asks a question and the teacher does not know the answer, because of bad education? I mean answering questions is the Job of a teacher. So I disagree with following the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.", because to bring the class to an accepteble knowledge the theacher must have an excellent knowledge.
