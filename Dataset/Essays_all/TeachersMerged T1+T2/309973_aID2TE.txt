Firstly I want to say that both options aren't really that  what I understand as a good teacher, because a teacher who has a good relationship with his students is of course nice to have but if he can't well explain his knowledge the good relationship is for nothing. In this case he doesn't do a good job because his job is to bring over his knowledge to the students to prepare them for their exams. But on the other side it can be very borring or complicate(or both) if you have a teacher who doesn't really care if you understood what he said or if he tells his stuff always in the same borring way and continous alltough the half of the class isn't able to understand. In this case the class often starts to talk much and that's  not good for the whole class and the teachers often don't like these classes what doesn't make better the relatioship between the teacher and the class. And if the teacher kows that the class doesn't like him it is clear that he doesn't spend that much work to prepare a good lesson for this class. On that follows that the realtionship between teacher and class pushs himself to the worser und worser. But an other argument for teachers who are more serious and have maintance on the knowledge is that teachers who have too good realtioships with their students can come over like a camerad and don't seem like serious teachers. in the end I think that a teacher woh have a good balance between realtionship and knowledge is tha best option to teach students.
