The statment that "A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is a discussed topic whitch has a lot of agreeing and a lot of disagreeing people. For example you could say that its better to have a teacher who relates well with the students, because they will have more fun in lerning and have a better motivation to try as hard as they can than having someone who isnt able to create a comfortable learning atmosphere and isnt able to help the individual student with personal learning problems. But the diffence is that the teacher with well subject knowledge is able to teach way harder stuff than the other one. Maybe its not that good to teach at an elemantary school for that one but its better for him at for example an university. The well relating teacher should better teach at an elematary school than on higher efforded ones. Maybe if you combline them it would be the best teacher of all time, because it isnt good to only relate well with the students and it isnt good to only have the subject knowlegde. I would say that its the best to have a combination of those two but if i had to decide i would probaply choose the one with excellent knowledge at his subject. But a few years ago it wouldnt be like this but all in all i disagree.
