Education is on of the most important aspects in the life of children and teenagers. The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is controversial because there are and will be always discussions about what is the best way to educate children.

On the one hand it is unreliable that a teacher should always have a good connection with their students because a nice atmosphare is very important for education. A student who is, for exemple, feared by his teacher would not learn as good and as concentrated as an other student who has a good relationship with their teacher. 
But on the other hand a great student-teacher relationship is fairly useless when the teacher has no knowledge of his subject. The most important part of being a teacher is educating children! A teacher who is more a friend than a teacher is a bad teacher because he is more likley to accept the children faults than to teach them because he wants the children to like him. 
Furthermore the children should be focused on the subject and not on the teacher. This is very difficult when the teacher is not focused on his subject either but more interested in his connection with the class. The learning progress would be much slower then.

To draw a conclusion, a teacher should be balanced. He should have a good relationship with his students to help them with problems and to create a good atmosphare for learning. But he should be aware of the fact that he is a teacher to educate children and for that reason it should be more important that he has an exellent knowledge of his subject than being a friend for the students. Even though he could be both but the education has to be the central aspect in his relationship with students.
