When a teacher relate well with students, he has a better relationship to the students. The Students feel better, because they know when they have a problem, that the teacher understand each other. Is the relationship between the students and the teacher good, it's automaticelly a better climax. There are teachers, who's always angry. By these teachers, we know, that nobody can say any words in the classroom. It's always silence. When the teacher relate well with students, the students don't have fear to say something in the class, they have more interessting to the subject. 
When a teachers only speaks about his subject and didn't know something else, it's boring for us students.It plays an important role, what the teacher know's about his subject, but when he can't bring it to the students, it's really bad. The teacher must bring the subject in the student's head. Students are tired, because they can't smile about the subject, because the teacher speaks 45 Minutes about the same things.
In my opinion, the relationship between the studens and the teachers are more important. We also have teacher, who know all the things about his subject, but we didn't learn anything there, because they have no idea, which way is the best to bring it in de student's head. It's more important for a teacher to find a way to teach as the knowledge of the subject. The knowledge is also very important for us,because we have a matura, but the way to teach and relate well with students is more important.
