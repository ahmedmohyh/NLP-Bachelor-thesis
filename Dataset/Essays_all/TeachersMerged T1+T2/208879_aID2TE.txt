Is a teacher who knows nothing better than a teacher who doesn't have a good relationship to his students? This is not a easy but an important question. 

Both teachers have advantages and disadventages. On one side it is very important that a teacher have a good realationship to his students because then he can speak to them and they will listen to him. When he don't have the ability to realte well then they wouldn't do the things he says to them. One example is from my own. I was in a class with a teacher who had a realy bad relationship to us. We didn't listen to him and we were loud in his lessons. And at the end of the year we didn't know more than befor. Another important thing is that a good mood in a classroom is really important to learn. 

On the other side we have to see that is really important that the teacher has a good education and a good knowledge of his subject. When he doesn't know anything than he can't teach something to his students. I think a teacher is paid to give his knowledge to his students and that is why he has to know something. I my school now there are many teachers who know very much but they don't have the ability to relate well with students. We have to sit in the classroom and we have to listen to this teachers but they don't speak to us they only present their knowledge. Important to see is that students can learn very much of teachers with a excellent knowledge. 

My opinion to this topic is that a teacher can be both. He has an excellent knowledge because he has to teach us students something but in some cases it is more important to have an ability to relate well with students. A teacher in the middle of both extrems would be the best but I think it isn't so easy to find this middle as a teacher.
