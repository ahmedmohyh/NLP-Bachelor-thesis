Beeing a teacher is a very important job. Children couldn't learn about the world how everything works without teachers.
Its very important that teacher like theire job and relate well with students.When a teacher is looking forward to give lessons and love explaining his subject than the students reconize his feelings and the teachers behavior. The most important point ist that a teacher can explain so that the students learn every lesson something new and go out the door with a feeling : "today i learnd something". A teacher who loves to work with students can make an interessting lesson and that's the moste important thing. There are a lot of teachers who have an excellent knowledge about theire subject but they can't explaine it. Than is every excellent knowledge worthless(wertlos). But it's clear that every teacher needs a minimum of knowledge about theire subject. Otherwise they can't give lesson. And if a teacher studied his subject that should be enough for giving lessons.
In my opinion a mix of bothe would be perfect. But all in all i agree with this statement because for me it's more important that a teacher like to relate with students. In my experience i learned more from a teacher who could motivate me but maybe couldn't answer all my question than from a teacher with perfekt knowledge who stand in front of the table and present his knowledge with less on motivation.
