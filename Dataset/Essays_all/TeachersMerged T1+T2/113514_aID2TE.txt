Essay: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.


What is more important? Excellent knowledge of the teacher of the subject he taughts or his ability to relate with the student? In this essay I try to answer this question.

Which of those two points is more important. First thing is, excellent knowledge from the teacher is nothing, if he can`t teach it to the students or relate with them well. Because he must be able to teach the stuff in a way the student are able to understand it. Without this ability, excellent knowledge won't help the students to learn it. Second point to mention is that the students need a good relationship with their teacher. Because if they relate better togheter it is much easier for both sides to teach or to learn. Because it is another way they communicate with each other if they relate better or worse. And because of this it is really important that the teacher has a ability to relate well with his student. 

But a teacher without good knowledge about the subject he teaches is useless. Because without knoledge he can have the best ability to relate with his students but they won't learn anything when he isn't able to teach because he hasn't enough or good enough knowledge. 

In my opinion it needs a mixture of both. Because both abilitys are useless without the other one. But I think the teacher's ability to relate well with his students is a bit more important than excellent knowledge. I guess a teacher with just good knowledge but with a great ability to relate well with students will be more usefule than the opposit. The students will learn better the stuff they have to if they relate better so I think it is clear. So I would say the good mixture of those two points is what we need and what makes the difference from a good teacher to an excellent teacher.
