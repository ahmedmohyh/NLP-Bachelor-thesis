It is necessary that the teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. The lessons have to be structured in order not to confuse the students. 
Also, the teacher has to have general knowledge to convince the students of his own ability and to earn respect. In case he ever wants to teach at a university rather than at school, he has to possess a larger amount of skills and knowledge.
Further, it is easier for teachers to help students and answer their questions when a deeper understanding is given.
Though teachers might get along with students better, it is more important to provide information than to have a flawless character.
It is the teacher's job to teach students general knowledge and more efficient ways of studying.
Of course, the teacher will have less effort keeping the students quiet if they get along well. But this is not what a teacher's main occupance is supposed to be.
One should regard the age or grade being taught, since elementary school students need a more caring character as a teacher than high school students.
Students socialize enough with their own kind, they don't necessarily have to have a person they trust besides.
I consider the art of perfoming well in front of a class a part of knowledge that should be given in any case.
That's why I think that knowledge is the key to a good learning athmosphere and successfull students.
A ''teacher'' is called a teacher because his job is to teach people and not to be a second mother to them.
