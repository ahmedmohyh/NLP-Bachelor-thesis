Of course both is important. A teacher can`t teach his knowledge well if he doesn^t know how to bring his topic to the students. It also works the other way round. If the teacher is beloved by all of his students it`s nota big use because the students go to school in order to learn something. 
But you can try to bring those teacher abilities in a certain order. I mean that it`s easier for the class to handle a teacher they can relate well to than otherwise. But they also learn less than with a teacher with better knowledge.
From a psycological point of view it`s much easier to learn something at school or a certain topic than learn how to change his habits in handling with students. So it`s clearly easier for the first step as a teacher to have the ability to relate well with students. But also this is relative to the teacher we are talking about.
So generally I would agree with the given statement. Further I wolud add that it depends on the school where the teacher should teach. There we see a nice shift in priorities: At grammar school it`s more important that a teaher relates well with the students than have an excellent knowledgeof the subject. But the older the students get the less important gets how well the teacher relates to his students. At a university for example it doesn`t matter much how well the professor relates to his students. So the older the students get and the higher school they go to it`s more important how well the things are being taight by the teachers.
So generally I would support the given statement with the addition that the higher schools we are talking about the more true the statement get`s the other way round.
