In the following I will answer the question wether knowledge of the subject or the relation to the students is more important for a teacher.

First of all, of course it is totally necessary for a teacher to know, what he or she wants to teach, but I do not think, that further information or knowledge to a certain topic is such important than the ability to relate well to the students. Of course it is very good to really well know what you are talking about, but I personally have teachers that do not know everything they are asked without looking it up, but that is fine, because they can explain really well, what are actually the things we are supposed to know.

Imagine this the other way round. A teacher knows everything interested students want to know besides the "usual", but (s)he simply is not able to transfer this knowledge to the students and explain them what they want to know. Actually this happened to my mother, when she was in school. There were not enough teachers so biology was taught by a professor who was not used to children and had no pedagogic education. i am sure, he knew a lot and was good in his subject, but my mother told me that nobody really understood, what he told the students.

And I think that is actually everything you can say about this. No question, a teacher must know what (s)he teaches, but (s)he also must explain that to children. Therefor (s)he is a teacher. Extra information you can always look up. Especially in this times where you have the internet.

So in conclusion I definetly agree with the statement.
