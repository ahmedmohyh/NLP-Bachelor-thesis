In this essay i will give some arguments and my own opinion to the statement "A teacher s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject"
At first you can say if the teacher don t have an excellent knowledge about the theme he couldn t support students that are very well in school. Another point could be that if the teacher don t have a perfect knowledge about the theme he could do some faults. The students may think that their teacher is stupid and so the Students don t listen to him because he have a bad knowledge about the theme.

On the other side the students would have a lot more fun in the lesson because they like the teacher because of his humor. Son if u have mor fun in the lesson you would work harder in school and get a better mark in oral . So if you work harder in school u don t have that much stress as a student wich is very important because if you have the new school system G8 u have a lot more hours and homework,but when you have a nice teacher who is very sympahtie to you and your class it s maybe not a problem to do something for schoo lbecaue it makes fun.
As long as the teacher knows the main part of the subject everything is alright because he could explain better to you becasue he is not the best  in that theme and so he maybe don t think so complicated about it. 

So in my opinion having a teacher that s abillity to relate well with students is much better than a teacher who have an excellent knowledge about the subject. Becasue the students are much more interested and more positiv in the lesson.
