"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important then excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".

You cannot learn the ability to relate. It's something you're born with so if you can relate to students you just have to learn the knowledge but otherwise it's more difficult. If a teacher can relate there will be more students who understand it or at least try it. The students are more motivated and that's important. Maybe a student thought that he will never do something with maths but the math teacher is so related to him that the student recognise that he could do something with maths. 

But otherwise if you don't have the knowledge for your maternity you cannot be teacher. The word of the job is self-explaining. A TEACHer is someone who TEACHs other people things. There are also more teacher in the wolrd who have a good knowledge but cannot relate so the student shuould be prepared for teacher like this. Otherwise it will be really difficlut in real life. 

In my opinion it's more important to have the knowledge than beeing relate to the students, so I disagree with the statement.It's important that students find out what they really like and if the teacher is related to you it could be happen that the interest of the student is just because of the teacher and not for the maternity. But if a student like a maternity without the teacher beeing related it's more clear i suppose. 

But at the end of the day it would be perfect if you have both.
