A Teacher is one of the most related persons in a life of a student. He creates an efficient learning atmosphere and therefore students learn in an easy way. But how important is a teacher's ability to relate well with the students and how does that influence the way of learning of a student?

Firstly, the relationship with the students is most important in primary and secundary school level, because there the teacher is a role model and encourages the children to learn. If that case fails, then a student is in no way motivated to go to school anymore. If a teacher can not relate well with his students, it is really hard to make the children learn something.

Secondly, if the teacher has not a broad knowledge and his explanation is hard to understand, the students are also in a gap between learning and being bored. So without a teacher knowing a lot about his subject, the whole school system would collapse. But not only with lacking skills but also with the teacher's disability to interact with the students our schools would not work.  

On the other hand at university a tutor plays only a minor role. There his excellent knowledge creates a good learning atmosphere and the relation to the tutor just helps the students to understand the skills.  

To sum up in the first years of school the teachers should relate well with the students and therefore set a good starting point for a further school career. But if that fails, a student will not learn anymore. In my point of view, I am less motivated with a teacher that I can't stand. But in university it's not so important and the excellent knowledge of the teacher plays a major role. But all in all a teacher's abiltiy to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the sucject being taught. Anyways both factors should be considered to create an efficient and friendly learning atmosphere.
