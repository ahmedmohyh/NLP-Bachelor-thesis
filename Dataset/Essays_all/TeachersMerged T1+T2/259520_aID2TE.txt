Information or Communication?
In school teachers are trying to teach certain informations to their students. To do so they have to communicate with their students. Their goal is, to teach important knowledge to their students. So the question comes up; What is more important, the teacher's ability to relate well with students or their knowledge of the subject being taught?

If a teacher doesn't know the detailled subject, he wants to teach his students, teaching fundamental content is impossible. On the other side if a teacher knows his subject well, but doesn't know how to interact with his students, an productive learning atmosphere can't be created which leads to missing knowledge from the students. But which is more important? The communication skills or the excellent knowledge from teachers?

To answer this question, we have to take a look at the reality. Because for example in our school I don't know a teacher who has neither acceptable communication skills or an at least basic knowledge of their subject. At least here in Switzerland, it's impossible to become a teacher without any of these two basic things. But certain teachers have less or more ability in these to aspects. 

In my opinion it's worse if teachers don't know what their teaching than if they don't know how to communicate with the students. Because I want to learn something in the school. And if the teachers aren't aware of what they're theaching, it's impossible to learn. But if a teacher knows what he wants us to learn, but can't teach it that well, it's hard but possible to learn important things.
