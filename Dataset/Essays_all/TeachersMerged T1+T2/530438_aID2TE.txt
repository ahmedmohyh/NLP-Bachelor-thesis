I do think, that it is very important, that teachers have some form of connection to the students. The teacher is then able to interact with the students which in general forms a better environement for learning. The student on the other hand can learn better, if the teacher is able to design the methods of learning for the students which fit him best. Of course it is also important, that the teacher knows what he or she is talking about. If the subject is being taught complicated or boring, then the interest won't be big on the side of the student. If you look at big schools with aroung 1000 students, then you will notice, that there is less talking about personalities or free time of students. The talks are mostly subject related and the relation between teachher and student mostly is just about learning the subject. If it is a smaller school on the other hand, then you will notice, the opposite. Students will greet teachers on hallways and there are also talks on a much more personal level.

If you take a student, that has a hard time learning something, and you have a teachher, that is only employed for educating the students, then you will see, that that kid will suffer from it and won't be able to learn it properly. But if the teacher teaches on a much more personal level, then the student also has a much greater chance of understanding the subject, simply because the student will be more interested in the subject.

Generaly you can say, that if you have also some sort of personal bond to the teacher, then you also are able to learn better.
