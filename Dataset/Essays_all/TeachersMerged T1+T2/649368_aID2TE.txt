Teachers: One likes, the other one hates them. Some look at them as inspiration, others have a sense of detest for them. Today in the time of different teaching theories and many studies going on, schools always want to have the perfect teacher. But is it possible? And how does the perfect teacher look like?
Well, actually this is wrong. No one is perfect. So let's talk about good teachers. How does a good teacher look like? Is he wise and well-educated or is he a less academic person but more a sociable person?

The fact is a techer has to be suited for his subject. He must have a decent diploma in the materia he teaches. So the better the knowledge he has in the subject the more he can teach. But even the best-informed, the most intelligent person can be annoying. Does he success if the students have an imaginary wall between each other?  Definitely not with the highest efficiency. Motivation plays a strikingly important role. When there is no motivation, neither there is progress.

On the other hand there is also the ,,hey-that-guy's-crazy-funny" teacher. Everybody has had one. but what if this teacher can relate excellently with students but does not have a clue of what he teaches? Obviously it is not this extreme, but still, will the students learn more efficient? I think they will definitely be far more opened to be ABLE to make progress. But how can a river be wide if there is not enough water in the lake? I can relate with my own experiences that it is frustrating to have a teacher with poor abilities.

Thus my conclusion is that neither of them is better. The good aknowledged person can teach more but the students are closed. The sociable person experiences the contrary. That is why I am convinced: There has to be found an equilibrium between the academic and psychologic way. The success to beeing a good teacher is beeing an all-rounder.
