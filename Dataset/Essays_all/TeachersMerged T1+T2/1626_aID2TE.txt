In my opinion the statement that "a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is true, because I think that even a person with the best knowledge could be a teacher and despite of this the pupils won`t learn anything if the teacher is unable to communicate with them. Sure, you can say that the quality of the lessons is also very important, but I think learning less is better than learning nothing. In addition to that the atmosphere in school plays also an important role. If the teacher and the students are able to communicate with each other well maybe the grades of the students will become better. On the other hand it is also important that the students learn enough so that their knowledge is good for their education. 
Another argument for the statement is that stundents spend nearly half a day in school everyday so it is pretty important that they are with people they like and can communicate with especially if they have problems. Naturally, you can say that they can also talk to their parents about problems but many parents are working the whole day and don`t always have time for their children. All in all I agree with the statement as long as it is safe that the students learn at least enough for their education.
