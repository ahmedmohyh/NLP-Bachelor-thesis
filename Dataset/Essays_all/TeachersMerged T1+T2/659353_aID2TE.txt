The two main competences a teacher has to posess are good social skills and a great knowledge of his subject.
Teacher are here to teach. This is their job and if they don't have an excellent knowledge of their subject school get very ridiculous and loses his importance.

But the ability to relate well with the students is very important too because the students have to go to school every day and if they don't like their teacher they wont like the subject eighter. The consequent will be that they won't be motivated to learn to get good grades.
On one hand we can say that even though there are students who are able to get good grads while his teacher is beeing unfriendly and unfair to them. But there are others who really need the support and the confidence of the teacher to learn new things. 

Specially in elementary school the empathy of the teacher for the children is not unimortant because there the children are still very young and they don't have many experiences in life. So it is very important that the teacher has a kind of the role of the parents and looks for a proper education. A teacher has to teach them how to behave und how to treat the other student. This isn't possible if the teacher himself mostrates no interest in the mental and social understanding of his students.

In my opinion the aspect of the ability to relate well with the students is more important because children will have a whole life to learn things like sciences and history but the social skills the have to learn them in their young ages.
