Does teacher have to have a good realationship or an exellent knowledge? For me as a student, i know this situation very well. We have to have a knowlede for our final exam. But if the theacher is realy unfriendly none like his lessons. It is also diffrent at diffrent ages. I think, it need a good mix of both.

First of all, if the theacher only like to have a good realtionship and he does really horrible theach and we do not learn anything, it is not usefull. At the high school, we will learn and study and we have also to prepaire us for the final exam. It is also special, if he only tell us things of his life.

But if the teacher is not friendly, we do not like the lessons. We also do not much for his class. And if the teacher doesn't know, how much his student can study or not, because they have also other lessons and other homework and a privat life, it is horrible.

Finaly, it is diffrent at diffrent age, for exampel at the primary school, you see your teacher every day. If there is not a good realtionship, it is really difficult to learn anything for children. At the hight school, we do not see your teachers more than three times a week for some hours. And we want learn. It is diffrent, the knowledge is a bit more important.

So I say, that we need teacher with much knowledge for the final exam at the high school who know, how much homework theirs students can do and how they can teach it. And at primary school, we need teachers, who can also have a good realtionsship with their students. The best is a good mix of both.
