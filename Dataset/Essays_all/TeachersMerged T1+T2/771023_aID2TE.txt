Nice teacher or clever teacher

I think it is great if a teacher relate well with his students. The students would work much better if they like their teacher. Also they had a lot more fun to go to school when the teacher can interact with them on an more "friend" level. He is probably better in finding solution if for example an student and another have an argument and they would follow his idears more than a teacher who hadn't this ability.
But it is really hard to see the border in that case, I think it's worse when the teacher havn't any control over his students. Especially if his students are in the 5-6 Secondary or 1-3 Sek. A teacher with less knowledge maybe teach the some things that aren't right or not total. Also if a student wants to learn more about that subject this teacher isn't usefull at all. 

To sum i disagree because it's more important that a teacher have eccellent knwoledge about the subject being taught. It's nice if a teacher is friendly and relate well with them but that should stand behinde the knowledge.
