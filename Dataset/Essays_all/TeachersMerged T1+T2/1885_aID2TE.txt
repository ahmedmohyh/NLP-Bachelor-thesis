On the one hand site a lack of knowledge might confuse the students. If he or she has a question and expects it to be anwered by the teacher and notices that the techer is not able to give him or her a qualificated answer he might lose the respect.
It also leads to problems in the final exams like the "Abitur" if the students got something totally wrong or were not told these fact at all.
On the other hand site it is also important for the teacher to know how to treat students rightly to make them want to learn. For that he need skills like keeping students concentrating and quiete for example. 
It would be also useful beeing near the students´ interests which might make it easier for them to follow the conversations in lesson and to keep them interested.
In my opionin more information and facts get stuck in their minds if they have a good relation. For example, recently our class got a new teacher most of the students are afraid of, me included. That is why I lost the fun at learning for this class. I am afraid of raising my hand when I am not 100 percent sure of the answer as well.
In my opinion both is important. If teacher do not know everything it is completelly fine but he or she should be able to answer most of the questions which are asked during the lesson especially if these are basic ones. Having a good relation is in my piont of view is even more important for keeping them learning.
