In the following text i am going to explain my position towards the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." I am going to give arguments and support them with exampes.

I think that an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than the teacher's ability to relate well with students. When the teacher relates well with students he will be more popular but without an excellent knowledge about the subject his students will not understand the subject and get bad grades. For example when a maths teacher relates well with the students they will like him but might not understand why they need to use the formula they just learned.
But if the teacher has a really good knowledge about the subject his students will understand the subject and get good grades but the teacher will not be that popular because he can not relate well with his students. For example when a maths teacher has an excellent knowledge about the subject the students will understand it but they will not like him that much because his explanations are too complicated at first.
Depending on the subject the teacher's ability to relate well with students might be more important, for example in art the students do not need to be taught everything as everyone has his own style. So the teacher has to relate well with the students in order to fully understand the choices of the szudents. That way it is easier for the students to get good grades.

In the end i think that depending on the subject the statement can be right or wrong. On that matter everyone has to decide for himself as everyone has his own preferences.
