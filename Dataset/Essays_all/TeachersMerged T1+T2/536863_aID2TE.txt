When a teacher has good relations with students then are the students more motivated for that what they are doing. For example when a student don't like math, he will not be interessed to learn for this subject. So teachers good relation can help him to get the motivation he need. For sure a teacher needs knowledge. Without knowledge he couldn't teach the students. He needs some experience for this job. But the knowledge isn't so important like relation with students. This is similar in other jobs. When workers have a good relation with the boss, then they will work better and more efficient. Fun and Learn, that's the best combination for students to make progress. Only fun in school isn't possible. That would be funny for the students, but after a time they will learn something too. they can Playing and making jokes at home. But also to learn the whole day without fun, without a teacher with good relation isn't efficient. Students need the good relation with the teacher so they can make progress in school.    


A good relation with teacher is the best way to be motivated for learning.
