The first argument is teachter will lern school things, but he need the ability to lern things. That is the problems, lost of students can´t lern because the teacher is really bad and he can´t teaching. But if you have student they wont lern then you can´t teach something. On the one hand teacher´s lern things about be well with students,on the other hand lots of teacher´s are not born for this job, because they will earn a lots of money and dont want to teach students.For examble one teachter like his subject,but cant work with student, he will lose his job, because ist not easy to work with student. The other Teacher work really well with student, but he are not good in his subject, he get a job because students like him and he cant lern this subject thing later if he need it.

I think teacher´s need both of them. A little bit about his subject and a little bit of work well with students. If one teacher has this he will be the greatest teachter of the world, but this are dreams you cant find this teacher. There are a great teachter they love his subject. If he love it, he can teach this things really well.
