There are stereotypical images of teacher: Boring, very old, dressing weird and so on. But nowadays, the atmosphere in the classroom has changed during 50 years. Teacher are younger, more modern and some of them have a rather tight relationship with their own students. Of course there are some exceptions who still hold on their older traditions but all in all, students relate more differently to their teachers.

But is this relationship more important than the actual knowledge of the teacher?
If the students don't like the teacher, a sensible lesson is not always possible especially when the teacher does not vary with their own teaching method and don't relate much with the students.
A friendly class atmosphere supports the learning process which the students gain during their longterm schooltime. What's more, students might store some information better when they combine it with a pleasureful school lesson. 

Nevertheless, teachers should still focus on their ability of teaching. A teacher can be funny but he or she does not help the students much, if there is no knowledge. Students don't visit the school for nothing and if there is no information provided by the teacher, a funny school lesson does not carry a lot of usage. 

As far as I'm concerned, it should not be either the ability to relate with students or the knowledge but rather a combination of both. I don't believe that a teacher is successful if he only carries one of these capabilities. Students just feel better when the teacher treats them not just like people who sit down and listen to everything they say. 
However, this should not affect the actual knowledge of the teacher since students also want to learn something not only for good marks but also for their overall knowledge.
