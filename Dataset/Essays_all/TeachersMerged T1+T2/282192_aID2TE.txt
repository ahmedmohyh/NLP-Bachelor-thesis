It`s important to have a well relation with your teacher. If you have a good relation with your teacher, you will like most of the lessons. It will give you a sense of pleasure. During the lessons you give the teacher a lot of attention. In addition to this you will also participate. As a teacher it`s also important to understand the students and to know, what their problems are. But on the other hand he should be a teacher and not friend. So I think there is also a difficulty to have a well relation with the teacher but also to win the respect of them. But if he has not enough knowledge of his subject, it doesn`t matter how good the relation to him is, the lessons will be annoying. 

The excellent knowledge of a teacher is also very important. He has to know a lot about his subject. Otherwise he can`t give the teacher something new. If the teacher has a lot of knowledge of the subject it can be also very interresting. You can go into a specific topic and not only to learn something about the most important of the topic. He should have a answer to more or less every question about his subject. But also here, it doesn`t matter how excellent his knowledge about the topic is. If he has a bad relation to the students, he and the students will never have success together. The students will not participate during the lessons.

So in my opinion it's important to have a mixture of the relation between the students and the teacher and of the knowledge of the subject being taught. If those factors are given, the teacher and the students will enjoy the atmosphere and both of them will reach success together.
