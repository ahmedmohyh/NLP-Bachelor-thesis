The question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught is a very interesting one. It is the greatest aim of a teacher to help the students he is responsible for to learn as much as possible and in my opinion, it is clear that a teacher who has a better relationship with the students has a huge advadtage when it comes to reaching this aim. 
First of all, I believe that everyone who wants someone to listen to him must earn the right to be heared at. Only if the teacher has earned the right to teach through growing respect or realization that everything he is doing is to help the students he will be listened to. 
Also, the students need to trust the teacher, the authority they spend a lot of time with. If this is not the case there is not motivation to study. In my opinion, it is more important to students that a teacher relates to them in a nice way in order to build up trust than that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches that he won't even have to use. 
Of course it might be an disadvatage if the students have the impression that the teacher is not that well educated and might have to look up more complicated questions. But if we are honest, we all know that students are more impressed of a teacher's ability to relate with the students.
These are the reasons why I totally agree with the statement.
