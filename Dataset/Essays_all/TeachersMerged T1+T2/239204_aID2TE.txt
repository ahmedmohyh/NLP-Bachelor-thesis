To be a good teacher it needs a lot, there are various factors which decide wether you're a good or a bad teacher and you need to have the right balance. It depends also on the students you're teaching and how you connect with them.

For a student it is very important to have a good connection with the Student and the subject being taught. if you are able to feel self-confident in the classroom it makes it much easier to do self-reflection on a theme and you can create your own oppinion and how secure you feel in the classroom often has something to do with how the teachertreats his students. As  a teacher it very importan that you create a progressiv climate of working and respecting each other. And no matter how difficult or advanced the subject may be, it is very likely that you will  get on more easily with a teacher with whom you have a good relation.

On the other hand, there are theachers that may have a great connection to their students but don't manage to feed them with knowledge. The most important thing for the students is to understand the subject and to get more educated and even with teachers you hate it is possible to become smarter. And if a teacher isn't enough competent with the subject he can have a good relation with the students as long as he wants it wont help them very much.

As a whole you can say that the author of this quote has a point as long as the students still get the main idea of the topic well. And of course you need to have a certain relationship with the students to make them feel comfortable. But there have been enough teachers to prove that even without being very kind or having a special relation with the students they managed to educate them very well.
