First, what abilities does a teacher need, to relate well with students? Does he have to be kind, friendly, funny or even friends with the students?And does a teacher`s ability influence his knowledge of the subject being taught? I mean at the gym I`m also friendly and kind to my kids and I don`t think that I`m a worse teacher because of that. But to be honest, as a student, I would prefere a teacher whos abilities relate well with us students, but I`m also supposed to say that it`s very important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the suject being taught. There are good reasons to disagree with the statement but there are also quite a few good reasons to agree.

The students might be more motivated, but if a teachers knowledge isn`t good enough the students won`t be able to profit something, even if they are very motivated. Also, the students are in the university for being taught and absolutly not for beig friends with 

If I`m in class with a teacher who's abilities doesn`t relate well with students, I`m surely less motivated. I think I would be clearly more motivated with a teacher who`s abilities relate well with students. I think also the students would learn more and would be more interested in the subject being taught, because it`s a more comfortable atmosphere. My last point, which is also on the positive side, is that I think that the relationship between a teacher and a student supoosed to be good. If a teacher`s abilities are bad, he wouldn`t relate well with students, and he wouldn`t be a good teacher, because it`s pretta hard to learn something from a person you can`t stand.
