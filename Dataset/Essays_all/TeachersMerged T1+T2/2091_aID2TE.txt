A thesis says, that: "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.". 

Well, i would say that you can´t easily say yes or no because it doesn´t help when the teacher is funny and actually like a friend to you and teaches the subject as a hobby e.g. when the teacher talks 30 minutes in his 45 subject´s hour about his private life and makes fun of something or tells some jokes, well it is funny in that moment but not after all. 

So the students have to learn this at home by themselves and that´s not the original plan how a school schould work. A school was made for young people to learn something so they can later do some good jobs and push their knowledge and to success in life so they can do whatever they want and not to be friend with the teachers.

The students need to understand the subjects for their final exams and especially for their future. So the teacher has also to be sometimes a bit more disciplined so the students have respect and do their homework and really learn these subjects with or without their permission. But a teacher also can`t be too hard and just know the subjects excellent. 

The students need a good base with the teacher so they can talk to the teacher if they doesn´t understand something. And so the teacher has to explain the not-understanding thing maybe twice and/or in another way. 
So you have to combine the teacher´s ability to relate well with stundents AND excellent knowledge of the subject.
