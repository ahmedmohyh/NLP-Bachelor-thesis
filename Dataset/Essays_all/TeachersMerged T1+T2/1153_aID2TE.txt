The question weither it is more important to have a teacher, who correspondendts well with his students or a teacher, who has a great knowledge of the subject being taught is very difficult to answer, because a teacher needs both of these abilitys to teach the students well. 
When a teacher knows his subject well he knows what he's talking about and can answer any question relating to the subject. That way he knows many things he can teach the children, but if he can't relate well with the students, the children won't listen to him that thouroughly and by that won't understand what the teacher tries to tell them.
On the other hand, if the teacher doesn't know his topic that well, but gets along great with his students, they will respect him and want to be nice to him, so they try to give their best in class and have fun while doing it. This doesn't only lead to better results of the students, but it makes the job for the teacher much easier, because they have a good time teaching. Also if the teacher relates well with the students, he has a better understanding of what they need to understand the topic and by that can improve his teaching-skills. 
Anyway, it still is really important for a teacher to have a great knowledge of their topic, but knowledge is something you can gain, understanding how to relate well with your students is more complicated and an ability you either have or don't have. 
That's why I think, in the end, it's more important to have the ability to relate with students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but the perfect teacher is of course someone who combines both abilitys in him or her, so that he knows what he's talking about, but is also able to make the students understand it and have fun while learning, to make them have the motivation to learn.
