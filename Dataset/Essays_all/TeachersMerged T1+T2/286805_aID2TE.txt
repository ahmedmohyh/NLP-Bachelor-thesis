If you have to go to school, what would you like more, a teacher who knows everthing but he/she can't empathise with his/her students or a teacher who doesn't know every answer but you like his/her personality?

If a teacher konws very much but he/she is overwhellmed with a question of a student he/she might come on sidetracks and would not be able to teach you all he/she would know. A good teacher should be able to speak in front of a class and he/she should be able to answer questions even if he/she can't really prepear what he/she sais. It needs a bit of flexibility. If a teacher, who may not know all, loves to do his job and loves the work with the students the students will realise or feel that. And if there is a good ''classroomatmosphere'' the children like the lessons by this teacher better and so they are more awake and because of this they will learn more just by listening. If stundents have no motivation to go in a certain schoolsubject, they have to do more at home because they weren't listening and if they have more homework they like the subject even less. And if there is a all-knowing teacher he/she might want that all his/her students know all he/she knows at an exam too. And if that's not possible the students will become frustrarted.

I think, it's better to have a teacher how knows not everthing or has to look up certain things is still better to have a teacher who isn't really interessted in his stundents or isn't able to empathise but knows everything. Because i think if people like to go to school they'll learn much more than otherwise. And it's quiet important that everybody knows so much as possible in our society.
