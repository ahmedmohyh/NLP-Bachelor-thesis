It seems to be clear, that students who like their teachers are more motivated to participate in class and to learn in general. But the question is if being able to relate with students being liked by them is really all a good teacher needs. Is such a teacher really better than one who is less sympathical to his students but actually has a better knowledge of the subject he teaches?
Students like it when their teacher has a good humour and makes a lot of jokes during the lessons but this can probably also lead to students taking school too relaxed and unserious and because of that they will learn and profit less. On the other hand, students with a teacher that has a very profound knowledge of his subject but isn`t really liked by them will also loose their motivation to learn and participate. But it is definitely clear that a teacher really has to understand the subject he teaches, because just being a nice guy and having a good humour doesn`t make a good teacher. 
I think as it is often the case with questions wether something is more important or not, the best solution would probably be to keep a good balance and find a kind of a middle-way. A teacher has to have good knowledge of his subject, but he also has to have the ability to communicate it to his students in a way that they understand it and remain motivated.
