Everone nows the question:" What is importent for a good teacher?". In this essay we want to think about it and show the arguments. What is more important the teacher's ability to relat well with students or the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
Important to learn much from a teacher is that the class is silent and doesn't interrupt the lesson. This is one part of the job from the teachers job. The teacher have to have a good conection to the students without this conection he or she can't make a good job and if nowone lisen to the teacher nobody can something. In the other part if the teacher doesn't know of the subject he or she taught the student could learn wrong or unimprotant things. Also the stundents have less respect of a teacher who are not in the subject he teach. And if a class has now respect of the teacher he can't make good lessons.

At my oppinnion the teacher has to have both a good ability to relate well and good knowledge of the subject being taught. If i have to those one I would say the ability to relate well with the students is more important. Because if nowbody listen to the teacher and the teacher can make the lesson interesting it's very hard to listen cearful to him and then you learn nothing.
