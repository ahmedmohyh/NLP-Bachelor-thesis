í´m agree with this statement and i think a good ability with students is more important than excellent knowledge. 

The chemie between the teacher and the student must be there. When the students dont like the teacher it´s more difficult to teach a good lesson and the students dont give everything. The school lessons have to be good with many informations, excellent jobs (teacher & student) and it has to be a little bit fun for both sides. The student has to go home and learned a lot and be good prepared for the next exam or test. 

The knowledge of the subject is important too but only a good knowledge doesn´t make a good lessons when the teacher can´t explain the schoolstuff for example. The knowledge is nearly unimportant when the teacher can´t explain, never give homeworks or exercises and doensn´t be well with the students.      I think both sides like to have good marks in school and for this reason both sides have to give everything. 

And for this reasons i´m agree with the statement and i have the same (Meinung)!
