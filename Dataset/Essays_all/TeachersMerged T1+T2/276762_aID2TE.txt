On one hand it is very important to students to have a teacher who will understand them and someone is able to relate well with students in order to help them to be more motivated. When a student does not like a teacher because he or she does not understand the situation and the feelings of him then it is much more difficult to actually focus on the lessons and to stay motivated especially for those students who do not like this particular subject.

On the other hand a good teacher should be able to answer questions of a curious student even if it is more high level knowledge. Students can not take their teacher seriously when he or she does not have a fair knowledge of the subject they are teaching. For example when a stundent is a genius at mathematics and asks the teacher very difficult questions but he tells him to focus on the topic of the lessons instead of thinking further, just because he can not really answer the students' question, it is very frustrating for the student. He eventually can not take the teacher seriously anymore.Therefore, an excellent knowledge of the subject would be very helpful and motivating for students.

I think that it is important to have a good balance of both abilities, because you cannot teach students something when you have little knowledge about your subject but you can also not motivate them to learn something when you are totally unable to communicate with them and understand their perspective as a student. Still, there may be some special cases where a student doesn't need to have a teacher who can relate well to them, because those students may be already very interested in this subject and do not care about having a good relationship with the teacher. But in my opinion those are the exeption and not the rule. It's essential for many people to socialise and to feel at ease with their teacher to stay enthusiastic through the learning process.
