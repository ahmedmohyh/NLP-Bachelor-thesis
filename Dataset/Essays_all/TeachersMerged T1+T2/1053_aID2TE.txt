I can't agree in general with the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". 
In my following essay I want to check if I agree or disagree with this statement.

I think the atmosphere in the lessons would be very good if the teacher relate well with the students. But if the teacher hasn't a good knowledge, the students wouldn't learn anything. so when they will write their "Abitur" this Students wouldn't get the same results like students with a teacher wo has a good knowledge. 
Another reason why I agree with this statement is that Students would have much more fun with a teacher who can realte well with them. 
Also the lessons would be not so boring. For example a math teacher who has a good knowledge about his subject, can't explain math to students who would be not on his level. In the this case the students have no fun with math and will get bad results in math.

Finally I think you need both of this abilities if you would be a good teacher for your students. But another ability is also important. The best knowledge doesn't help you if you couldn't explain about what you are talking.
