To be a good teacher it's important to have a good knowledge aubout the subject, because if you don't it's very difficult to teach it to another person. But it needs a lot more than having an excellent knowledge of the subject. There are many very intelligent teachers who aren't very good at explaining. This is because they are very intelligent so to them what they say all makes sense but for the students it's very hard to understand. If a teacher doesn't have a good relationship with their students they won't be looking forward to go to their class. Students who enjoy their classes work a lot more during classes so they will learn more. Also a good teacher should do different things because if you always do the same it gets boring and  the students will listen less. A teacher should be an authorityperson that you can take serious and not a person that can't handle anything. Because if a class realizes that the teacher doesn't do anything and they can do what they want, then they will. But they shouldn't be too strict too because if they are the students may be too afraid to ask questions so they don't lerarn as much as if they would ask questions. It has to be a healthy mix between being strict and being friendly.To be a good teacher it's not enough to onlyhave excellent knowledge or to only relate well with your students. There are many things that make a good teache, but only having one of those things doesn't make youa good teacher.
