In the following I will discuss how important a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than how excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

It is important for young students to feel comfortable and they need someone who's taking care of them in school. Usually that is the task of the teachers. In some cases though, for example in higher classes like 10th grade, the students have almost a completly developed personality. If they are at this point of development, the teachers can concentrate their lessons on knowledge and not on the relationship between them and their students. 

In my opinion, the teachers have to find a way to do both in a good mix. They have to know almost everything about their subject but they also have to help their students to develop in the right way. Many students are in school almost all day long and they see their parents not as often as their teachers. 

In conclusion the teachers are there for the students to get them to learn something. It does not have to be stuff for a subject, it can also be some kind of special abilities, like "how do I threat my friends?" or "how can I get well in reading someone's behaviour like a book and get to know what they want without speaking to them?". Teachers have to concentrate their lessons on both and should not just teach the stuff they know.
