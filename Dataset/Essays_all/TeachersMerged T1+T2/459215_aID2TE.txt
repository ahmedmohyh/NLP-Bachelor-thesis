The question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, is interssting. But the age of the students is really important to write about this question, I will explane this later. Teachers have the future of their students in their hands. 

If a teacher is well with students and can help them to learn things better, it's a grate ability. But this ability is more important for kids in primary school due to fact that in this age kids don't know yet what their interestes are. If a teacher can motivate these kids to enjoy a sertain subject, this is a big achievement. When kids see studying and learning as something positiv they while have a easy going time in school. Due to the fact that they really enjoy what they are doing and they can stay postivie in any subject.

In our age a teacher's ability to realte well with students is also really important because it can motivate you as a student if you know that the following lesson will be a interesting one and the teacher is really nice. If you can teach things easily it's for students easy to writte good exames.

In our age a teacher has to have excellent knowledge of the subject because we're getting ready for universite and if the things we're getting taught aren't correct it can be a huge disadvertage for us. 

In my opinion my favorite subject are also have a conectio the the teachers. Eventhoug I'm really interessted in Spanish I don't enjoy the lessons or it makes fun to study it due to fact that our Spanish teacher is angry with you if you make a fault. The vibes in the classroom aren't positive and I think this has a big influence on my results. I think it has to be a combination of the two facts, a dismiss of one of them can be negative for the whole future of a student.
