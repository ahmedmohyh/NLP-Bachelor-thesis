I think that it is very important that a teacher can relate well with his students but when the teachers don't have the knowledge about their subject it's not very intellegent. Of course they have to be nice with the students and when the students like theire teacher it's a better atmospheare but it's also very important to have a good limit of strength in this "relationship" because when you as a teacher can't get the students to work or listen to you it's not the best idea. If you are a teacher I think you are pleased to have an excellent knowledge about the subject being taught because when students have question and you can't answer them it's not very helpful. If you tell them everything you know about the subject or not is an other point because you have to control if the student can get everything you tell them or if you are maybe to fast with the informations. It's much more important that the students understand everything you teach them in the school than telling everything so fast and strictly that they don't know anything about it later and even can't tell it theire parents at home because they can't listen to the stuff the teacher went through. I think the most important point in the relationship between students and teachers is a mix of strength, fun and understanding what each other feels at the moment. So if a student has a bad day the teacher should react well and maybe don't ask him any questions about a difficult thema. And also the students have to understand if the teacher has a bad day and then they have to be quite and work nice.
