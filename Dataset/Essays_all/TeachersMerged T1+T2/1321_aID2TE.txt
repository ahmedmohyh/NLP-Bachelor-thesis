The question if teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than having excellent knowledge of the subject is an often discussing question.
I thinks this statement isn't right and i disagree to this statement.
Although I think that the relationship between teacher and student is very important because they should work and learn together every day. I agree if somebody would say that his progress of learning is much better with a teacher who understands students and who is smart to the students. This is an easier learning atmosphere for students.
But in my view any teacher should have an excellent knowledge in his subject. One reason is that he can be the smartest teacher in school but haven't got an excellent knowledge he isn't a good teacher. The reason we are here in school is that we want to learn something and we want to make our finals.
That's the important argument because i think the ability isn't more important than the excellent knowledge.
All in all i think that also knowledge isn't more important than the ability to relate with students. 
In my opinion they are on the same level because without an excellent knowledge by the teacher the students didn't have any oppurtunity to learn the right things and without good relationship between a teacher and his students, student doesn't have any opportunity to ask somebody if they had any problemes.

So I disagree with the statement that teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge in the their subjects. But i would say that both qualification are the same important becauce only with both the perfect learning atmosphere is given.
