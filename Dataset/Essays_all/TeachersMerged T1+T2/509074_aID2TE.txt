Teachers

We all go to school or went to school. We all have teachers we love and teachers we don't like that much. Now we have to find out why we feel like that. Of course in every part of our life we meet people who we like very much and people who we don't have to see ever again. But it could be interesting to find out which facts influence our feeling about a teacher. Does it play a role if teachers are gently with us? Is it more important that teachers have the ability to relate well with students or is it more important that the teachers have an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach.

A good knowledge of a teacher is important. Teachers have to know their subject. Otherwise, the students don't learn enough.
When the teacher doesn't have an excellent knowledge, it's important that he doesn't show it because otherwise the students don't take him serious.

But i think the teacher's ability too relate well with his students is even more important than the excellent knowledge. Students will like this sort of teacher more than the other one. So they begin to listen what the teacher says and the subject gets more interesting. Because when we don't like the teacher we often also don't like the subject he teaches and we don't pay attention.
Students also feel much more comfortable when they notice that the teacher likes his students. As a result, they ask more and also learn more.
At school we learn about so many things. But at one point it's just too much. When we have only teachers with an excellent knowledge they also want that at the end we have an excellent knowledge. But that isn't possible.

I agree with the statement that it's more important that the teacher has the ability to relate with his students than an excellent knowledge. We learn more and better when we like the teacher. The subject gets more interesting.
And after all, we don't have to be experts in every single subject.
