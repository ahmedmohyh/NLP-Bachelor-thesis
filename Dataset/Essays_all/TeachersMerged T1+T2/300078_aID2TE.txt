There is no doubt that having a broad area of knowledge is esencial for any teacher, but the question is, if this will be enough for teaching a good class. Social competences, communication and appeareance of a teacher can also be an enormous factor for the learning progress of a student. But what is more importan, having an excellent knowledge of the subject being tought or a theacher's ability to relate well with students ?
Firstly, a student goes to school for learining something and not for just having fun. It is very important for the future and for the individuum that the informations in school given are based on evidence and true in any point of view. On one hand, a teacher is like a transmitter of informations but on the other hand, the way how this transmition takes place plays a big role in the process of education. Additionaly, students who are not listening to the informations because they do not like the way how the school stuff is teached or because they do not like the teacher's personality can be a blockade fot the learning process. Hanving a good relation is ecencial.
To sum up, having a excellent knowledge of the subject being thought is not as important as the ability to relate well with students because if the the students are not listening, any kind of knowledge is useless.
