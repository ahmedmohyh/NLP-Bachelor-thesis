Teachers

Every student or class has his favorit teacher. But what does this depend on? Is one teacher better than the other just because he knows what he is talking about? Or is the favorite teacher the one with whom the class laughts the most? I thing it's the thing between it. When there's a teacher who knows everything and just talks in a monoton voice the students will say: "He is boring and with him I can't really learn something." But why will the student say he can't learn something from him? He sais it because you can't focus the whole hour when he isn't interessted in teaching you. He could know everything, but when he isn't very kneen in making you learning and teaching you, you won't learn something. So mostpart of the student's favorites teachers have the ability of making the students interessted in the subject or the things they are talking about. Then there are some teachers with whom it is funny, but you don't learn something from.
Now i'm talking with experience, cause I got a teacher like this. When a student gets a teacher like this, he will say:"Hey, we don't do anything in his class. it is very funny and I like his lessons.", but after a few months the student won't like this teaching (or don't-teaching) structure anymore. For the student it is boring to sit in class and don't do anything, because the students want to learn something. The best techers are those, with whom the can laugh, but also do exercises or theorie. The teacher should also be able to give you answers about upcomming questions about the topic, but I think there aren't teachers who don't know nothing about those toppics, because they already had it in school and otherwise the would't have become teacher.

In my opinion you can't answer this question with yes or no, because it has to be a mix between it.
