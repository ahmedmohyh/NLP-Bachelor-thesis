The purpose of this essay is to outline my opinion wether a teacher ability to relate well with students is of more importance than knowledge of the subject being taught.

A good  relationship  is the key to success for both the students and the teacher. Understanding and relating to the students problems and concers is the teachers most important task. In addition to that, friendliness fairness but also being strict motivates the students to attend their class and thus be attentive and interested, which for the teacher is of great interest. 

Not only the ability to relate with students, but also the teachers knowledge shared with the class plays a desicive role. The wide range of knowledege teachers have on their subjects csn raise motivation for stundets to even learn more and thus have a higher willingness to attend a class and particiate in the lecon, which for the teacher is the greastet success.

By looking at the above mentioned arguments, not only a wide range of knowledge but also the teachers ability to relate is importat for a successul relationship. Since, without a teachers abilitzy to relate well with students, less motivstion of the students  accurs and the interest and willingness to learn is at a lower level. It should be every teachers greatest interest to get into a good relationship with their stundents.
