As we all kwon there are differtent typs of teacher. Some of them we like more than others. But is it better when a teacher has the ability to relate well with the studants than excellent knowledge of the subject they teach.

Every student would agree when I say that you have more motivation to learn when you have a teacher you like. The teachers we like more are the ones whow can relate with us. Because those tescher are the ones whow ask how many homework we have and give less homework when we allready have a lot to do.
 
Sometimes teacher with a great knowledge arent the best teacher because their lesons are way to difficult. This kind of teacher has a hard time to explain the topics in a easy way so that the studants can follow what he or she is talking about. And often students stop listenig when it is to difficult because the think the would never understand this.

Teachers with the ability to relate with their students also see where the difficulties and problems of the students are and they can help them to solve those problems. when you understand the topic in classe you dont have to learn so much at home for a test which is positive thing.

It is important that a teacher teach you the rigth stuff other whise you have a problem when you go to unuversity. because of that it is important that a teacher has a good knowledge.

 A teacher whow has a great knowledge can answer a lot of questions which can lead to disscusion in classe and this can make a leson very interesting. 

I agree with the statement " A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important then excellent knowledge of the susbject being taught". As i said You are more motivatet for a subject when you like the teacher an in my opinion students like teacher with the ability to relate more.
