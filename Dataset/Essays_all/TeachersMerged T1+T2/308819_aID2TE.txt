"Is a teacher’s ability to relate well with students  more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?" This question has definitely already been,in any kind of way, in all our heads. We all were students once or still are, so everybody knows the struggle of an evil teacher or the joys of a kind-hearted one. But is the good realtionship between teacher and pupils really more important than knowledge?

First of all, shouldn't students be taught by person, who don't know a lot about the subject he is teaching. Because students also have to think by them self and question things, so whom should they question about unknown things,if their teacher can't. I for example, got a history teacher, who really knows a lot about everything. We can ask her anything we want and if she hasn't a fullanswer, which happens extremely rarely,she will definitely know it the next time you see her.
The only problem here is, that it might end up in interesting and big discussions, talking the whole lesson and finally you might have learned something about the earth and life, but not actually what you need to know for the exam.

But of course, if your teacher is fun, and can tell you things very good and you understand it very well it is so much more fun to learn. It makes it so much more interesting if you bear more relatlatio nto your students, because the lessons get you motivated and you will probably learn better. Because if you got that really evil teacher, which seemed almost terrorizing you, you might know the struggle of loosing every motivation, interest and joy for the subject. 

In the end a good teacher has to keep you motivated but also have a excellent knowledge.
