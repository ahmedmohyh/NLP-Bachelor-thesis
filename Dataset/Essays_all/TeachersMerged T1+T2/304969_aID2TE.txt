Every students has a teacher which he prefers the most because he likes the kind of how the teacher educates, but being a good teacher is not alwasy that easy, that it looks like. Some teacher are very strict and have an excellent knowledge of the subject and others  are more funny and not very strict but do not know the subject very well.

Firstly, the kind of how teacher educates the students is very important. If a teacher speaks very quiet and you do not understands what he says or explains, it is not possible to learn something from him. In addition it is important that a teacher does not speak boring so that the students are interested in the subject the teacher is talking about. The teacher has to catch the interesting of the students and if it works it is more easy for them to learn new things.

On the other side, it does not make sense if a teacher can relate well with the students but does not know what he has to explain to the students. So it is important that the teacher has the knowledge of the things he explains to the children. 

In my opinion it is more important that a teacher can relate well with the students and is able to catch their interesting than have the excellent knowledge of the subject. Because if he is able to relate well with the students, they will learn the things more easy and faster. Nevertheless the teacher should also know what he is talking about and should be able to answer to the questions of the students.
