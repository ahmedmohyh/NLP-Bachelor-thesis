Teachers

On one side a teacher needs some knowledge to teach you. If he has no knowledge at all he can do what he wants but you never learn anything.
On the other side he also nees the ability to teach elsewhere he isnt able to transsfer the information to the students.
But which of these abilities is more important?
This question is dificult to answer because both of the abilities are needed to be a good teacher.
On one hand some people say that you could also learn the stuff by yourself so you only need the knowledge to do that.
On the other side some people say that you have to learn how to learn and you haven`t to learn the information by heart.
I personally agree with the second oppinion that the ability to relate well with students is more important than the knowledge, especially in our time whem we can search every thing on Google, etc.. I have this opinion becuse in life you`re oposed to new problems every day and therefore mostly the stuff you learned by heart won`t help, but your experiences of solving problems will. In the ideal case a teacher should have both abilities so he can teach the students how to learn with good examples(irony). To say it short: I agree with the statement that a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught, even if this is very important aswell.
