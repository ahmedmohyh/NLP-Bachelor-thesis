The main role a teacher plays in class is to actually teach the student erverything they need to know about the subject being taught by him his ability to actually do that strongly depends on his ability to relate the topics.If the students are unmotivated an bored during class it is likely that they spent less attention on topic being taught.
A techer can only really teach on asubject in his own field of expertise otherwise the risk of him not properly educating his students are high even if all students are constantly on full attention during his explanations the explanations would still be incomplete in the students would lack the informations that an actual expert on the topic could have taught.
If the students are really engaged in the topic due to the abilities of the teacher they could be motivated to look for further information into the topic and that way find theoratical missing pieces from the lessons that are caused by incomplete lessons.
While it is definatly possible for students to fill holes in there knowledge they are unlikely to read up on topics already intensly featured in the lessons proper
and thus are unlikely to correct any mistakes that were actually made by the teacher also since they are likely to develop a slight confirmation bias towards the engaging way that the teacher would probably use recount the information they wouldn`t actualy want to know the proper information.
While I think that a teacher who is capable of really connecting to his students would be great I wolud say that he actually nedds to have a good understanding of any and all topics that he requires to teach to avoid propegating misinformation which could be fatal for the chances of his students. because of that I would say that extensive knowledge narrowly eclipses relatabillity for me.
