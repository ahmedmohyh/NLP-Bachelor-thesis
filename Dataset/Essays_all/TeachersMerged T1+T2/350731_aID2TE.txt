Some teachers likes to teach you and relate well with the students, but have a worse knowledge of their subject. Other teachers have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but you do not like them because they are not really nice to you. Now there is the question what is more important. Being a friendly teacher or knowing more?

Some teachers relate better with the students than others. It is always nice if a teacher is friendly and you can laugh with him. The lessons are much more fun and suddendly you like to go to school. In the mornings you look forward to the subjects, which the friendly teacher teaches. It is important that you like to go to school and you are not scared of the teachers. When you go happy to school it is easier to learn new things, than when you are sad and angry because you do not like the teacher.

On the other hand if the teacher only relates good with the students, but has not a big knowledge of the subject he teaches, it leads you to nothing. You like to go to ths subject, but you do not learn anything. The teachers have to have an excellent knowledge because they get payed for teaching you. If you do not learn something you could also stay at home. It leads to the same point. It is really important that you learn the things you have to, so you can go to university. Furthermore learning something is one of the reason why you go to school.

In my opinion both is important. The teachers should relate well with the students and have a good knowlege of their subject, but I think it is a bit more important that they know the stuff they have to teach, because you can learn things by your own, if the teacher gives you good sheets and books, even if you do not like the teacher. But if the teacher is nice and funny and does not give you things to learn you can not learn it, even if you want to.
