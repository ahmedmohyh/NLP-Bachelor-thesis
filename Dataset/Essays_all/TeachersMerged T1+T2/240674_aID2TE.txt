Teachers are very different. Some of them are more focused on teaching the subject fast and clear, others focus more on the individual students. Both of these variations have advantages and disadvantages. Let's see wich direction is better in my opinion.
If you are a student, for exemple in the mathclass, and your not really good at it, I think it really helps you when the teacher can help individually and is nice and slow so that you are able to understand. But in your class ther are many other students who are maybe not as bad in the subject as you are. It's quit impossible for the teacher to relate to everyones wishes and problems. If they just focus on the bad students, the others are bored really quick. Like this, nobody is served. Besides that I think you learn much more if you have some distance to your teacher and it's importat to keep it on a formal level. School is not suppose to be a place where you have nice conversations and can go along well with every teacher. It's a place where you only have to learn something, wether you like your teacher or not. 
If you want to be a good teacher you certainly need to have passion for your subject that you're able to teach it well. But also you need to unterstand what it means to be a student. The best way to do that is obiously to relate to the students as a hole class. If you see most of them are tired because they had a hard week, turn the speed down a little bit. Or if you see that they are super stressed because they have so many tests in diffrent subjects, take it a bit slower. But none or less you have to teach your stuff. You have to know a lot about it so that you can give them as much of it as possible. 
So my advice is to be something inbetween.
