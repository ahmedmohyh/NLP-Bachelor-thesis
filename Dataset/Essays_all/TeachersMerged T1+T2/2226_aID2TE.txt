First of all in terms of the question if a teachers ability to relate to a student is more important than a excellent or flawless knowledge of the subject i want to clarify that in my argumentation i assume with "excellent knowledge" is meant that the teacher has more info on the subject than necessary becouse otherwise an argument wouldn't make sense as the teacher wouldn't be able to perform his task as a tutor.
Teachers have to know their subject in detail in order to actually bring it to the students, a lack in knowledge or details could result in the students having a false sense of security on a subject they did not fully grasp.
Otherwise ofcourse a teacher is not just a profesor giving his lecture, he/she is also an authority for the pupils and in way influences them past the teaching and also past a "common human interaction". Me, as a student, has to spend mutiple hours a day with my teachers-They are more than just strangers and certainly people i should do my best to get along with. That is my a teacher being able to relate to students is increasing his overall effectiveness; math for example is complicated subject that not every person understands imedieatly or in the same way.I'd like to refer to a famous story or info about the mathmetician ´Pythagoras, he didn't see numbers as symbols like most others did but saw them as charakters and thought about math in a way how these charakter would react with each other.
While this is strange we can not deny that he was one of the greatest mathmaticians of all time, certainly if he was tought like every other he would have had a hard time to understand maths. A teacher that can relate and understand a pupil better can also adjust his methods of teaching and thus result in a better teaching exsperience.
My comparison here being Math and geographics...math needs logic thinking, and geographics only a good memory, in that case a teacher with more knowdledge would be better as most if not all the information has to be digested by the student.

To sumarize that and give my personal opinion i would say that a teachers ability to relate to students is not something that is more important than knowing his subject but a rather a requierement for a successful class enviourment when it comes to more abstract and complex problems that need understanding more than raw information.
