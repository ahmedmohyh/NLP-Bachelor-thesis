The question if knowledge of a subject or the relation to the students is more important to define a teachers ability to teach is a hard one. There are good examples which could state that either can be seen as the correct answer. 
First of all it is obviously somewhat important that the teacher is partially nice to the students. He doesn't have to act like Jesus but he shouldn't play a nazi cunt either. Meaning he shouldn't scream and shout at the students in order to get their attention. Being nice and relatable to the students will probably help them in quickly learning what ever it is the teacher is preaching. 
It is arguably even more important that the teacher is not only able to teach something, but to teach the correct facts. It will affect your knowledge more negatively if you learn a lot of wrong facts in contrary to not learning that many facts. For example if your first grade teacher tells you that peanuts are a kind of creamy cheese you will have a harder time forgetting that and relearning the facts, than if your teacher would have screamed in your face that peanuts are nuts.
In conclusion i'd say that obviously having a good relation to the students can help them in learning in many ways. Although the negative impact of not knowing what it is you are talking about is much more grave than that of simply being an asshole.
