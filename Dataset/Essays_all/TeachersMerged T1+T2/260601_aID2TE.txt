A teacher's knowledge is not useful if he doesn't own the ability to share his knowledge with his students. A teacher has to relate with students to get their  specific problems, if he's not able to communicate and to understand the students, students won't get the chance to profit from one's teacher's knowledge. To know their students and have the ability to relate with them, can also give an idea how to present a subject interesting. In fact motivated people work harder, ask more and will know things they learned with enthusiasiam for a lifetime. Isn't this the way to go? To build a teachers-students-relation can wake up a lot of interests. A lesson is here to get more knowledge, this means, that knowledge has to be shared. But what can do a student with a teacher without excellent knowledge? The excellent knowledge is the diffrence between a normal person and a teacher, but the ability to relate is the diffrence between a teacher and a good teacher. My mother always told me to be perfect in something is good, but to be good in diffrent aspects is better.
