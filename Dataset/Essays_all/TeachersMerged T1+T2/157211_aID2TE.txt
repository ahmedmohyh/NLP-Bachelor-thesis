I don't agree with this statement. The ability of a teacher is to teach hes knowledge to the students. So he should know many things of the subject he teach. It wouldn't make sense if the students go to school and the teacher don't know what he should to teach. But it wouldn't be bad when the teacher relates well with his students because it would be more comfortable for the students and the teacher. It's better for learning and teaching when you get well with the other person. The students would be more happy when they have a teacher that can be friendly and funny sometimes. 

So my oppinion is that a teacher should have an excellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching but also to relate well with the students. It needn't to be a very great relationship it just need to be good so that the teacher get respect of the student and the students get respect of the teacher. In my case i like the subjects more in which the teacher make jokes sometimes and we can laugh together and after that we can go on whit learning and being serious. So it should be that the teacher can teach well and also can bbe related well with the students.
