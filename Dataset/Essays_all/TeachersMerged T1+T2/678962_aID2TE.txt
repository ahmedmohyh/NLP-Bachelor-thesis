Sometimes it's more important how something gets thaught rather than how accurate something gets thaught. With the teacher relating well with the students they are more likely to follow the class rather than when they dislike the teacher even if what he teaches is more accurate. But what is better: Learning something that's not a hundred percent true whilst enjoying it or learning something very accurate but not liking to study that subject at all because of the teacher?

On one hand it's very important to know and understand something as good as possible if one wants to achive good grades even if that means sitting through nearly painfuly boring lessons, listening to someone one can't stand at all. But on the other hand I think the better way to learn something efficiently is by getting it thaught by someone one gets along with because this way one is more willing to follow the classes and discuss the topics. This way one remembers the learnt subjects a lot longer than if one gets them taught really accurately but without any fun.

In conclusion I figure that it's better to have a teacher one gets along with and to whose lessons one looks forward to but there should still be some niveau or standards during the lessons otherwise there wont be any learning anymore.
