Now I show you my opinion to the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". 
First it is very important, that a teacher has got a friendly personality. So he is friendly to the students too and everybody likes, how he teaches. In cause of that you understand the subject, which is being thought of him. A next piont is, that for me knowlegde isn't so much important. Of cause you have to know something about the subjecht, when a teacher want, that his students learn something about it. But if you don't like your teacher, you won't concentrate on him, when he talks to the class. So it is a conflict between these two aspects. 
In my opinion a mix of these two aspcts is the best way to teach the students. So the teacher has got a friendly personality and has excellent knowledge of the subject. For me this is the best way to teach the students.
