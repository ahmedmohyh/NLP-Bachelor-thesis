For a teacher is very important to have a excellent knowledged of a subject he or she is being taught. But it is also important to have the ability to relate well with the students. But which of them both is more important? The ability or the knowlegde?

Every teacher has to have a excellent knowledge about the subject he is being taught. The teacher has to answer every question the students ask. He has to be passionated about the subject because he has to do it every single day. And to explain something to someone else needs a good knowlegde because only this can help you to explain it in diffrent way. For an exampel when you are a teacher in a language you have to know a big vocabbulary otherwise you can not explain everything to the students. 

But the ability to relate well with the students is also very important. Because that helps to taught the subject better. When you know you students and you know where their problems is in the subject it is easier to help them. So you can chose the right way to taught them. Also the students do not want a teacher who can not understand them. When the teacher is always shauting at the students because they do not understand what he is talking about, then it is a mistake by the teacher and not by the students. 

So on my opinion both are very important. There is not something that is more important than the other one. Because as a student i want a teacher who is passionated about his job and who has a excellent knowlegde in it. But i also want that he can relate to me. So when i dont understand something he should be patient and he should try to explaint it in diffrent ways. So for me a good teacher should have a very good knowlegde about the subject and should relater well with students.
