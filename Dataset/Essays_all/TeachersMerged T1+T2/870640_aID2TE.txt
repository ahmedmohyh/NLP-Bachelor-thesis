I think it depends how someone is looking at it. It's important to relate well with students, because they are more interested at the subject. They also know the teacher better, so they can understand him better in the way he means some points and they know exactly how to write these things on a examination which the teacher is looking for. It also helps to have active lessons so that the students improve their subject more. On the other hand I think it's quiet tough to say that it isn't important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject because that is one of the important things a teacher has to have. A teacher has to know the subject he's teaching about very good so that he can teach them a lot. There is always a point where somebody can't say what a teacher has to know and what he doesn't have to know.To that somebody can't say when a teacher is getting too close to students. In my opinion a teacher has to be seen as a teacher, not as a friend or something else. You have to have enough respect for teachers because some students think that the teacher is too friendly for them so they think that they can do everything and the teacher would say anything. To finish my text I can say that I like when a teacher gets-on well with our class but to that we learn more about the subject. Those teachers are the best because we like them a lot but have respect them enough and we like to go to their lessons because there is always something interesting.
