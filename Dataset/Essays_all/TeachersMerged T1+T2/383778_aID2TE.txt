I think if you studied and pas the exam you can't be bad in this subject. And if you are able to handle people it is much better. Of course you have to know something about the thing you try to tell your students. But if you can't tell them what you want to say, than you have no chance to be a good teacher. You have to be able to feel the children. You have to know where they have problems or what the can. If your just a pro in your subject but you can't promit your subject then you are a bad teacher. The main goal of a teacher is, to tell the students everything you know, so they are as intelligent as you are. But if you aren't able to bring the stuff to the childrens, they know nothing about the subject you know much. 
So I would say, you have to know something about your subject but if you relate well with students you are a better teacher, than one how can't handle childrens.
