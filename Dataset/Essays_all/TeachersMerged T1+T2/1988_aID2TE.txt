A question which is often disscussed in school is what is more important the relations between teacher and the students or the teacher`s knowledge of the subject being taught.
The relation between the teacher and the students is importent for the hearing of the students and if the students like the teacher they will learn much better than students how do not like there theachers. But if the teacher to not have a good knowledge of the topic he told the students, than he can not explain it good enought to the students so they will not understand the main information of the topic.
Because of this is the sentence "A teacher`s ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowlege of the subject" is mostly wrong.
In my oppion bouth of it is really important as the relatoin between students between the teacher and the stundents as the knowledge a teacher needs to presentr a topic which the stundents should learn. The argumennts against this oppinion might be that a theacher could have the best knowledge in the world of his topic but it does not metter is nobody lissen to him. But it will be also no suggestion have if a teacher does not know about his topic and the students were lissen to him.
So all in all I disagree with sentence because you will need a symbiose of the relation and the knowlege to have the best possible learnig.
