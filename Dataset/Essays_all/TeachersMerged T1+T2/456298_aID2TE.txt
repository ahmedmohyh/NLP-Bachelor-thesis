It's easier for a teacher to understand how his students learn the best if he has the ability to relate well with them. It also allows for a better atmosphere in the classroom. It generally leads to less conflicts between class and teacher which can lower the students willingless to activley participate.If the teacher can relate to his students he can shape the lessons in such a way that the students not only learn something but also have fun at the same time. This way they are more willing to participate and they learn more and way easier than with a teacher who has an excellent knowledge but simply writes everything on the blackboard. 

On the contrary this teacher with excellent knowledge could answer all the questions the students might have and could ensure a better education if he can bring his knowledge across. The main focus of education doesn't lie on having fun but learing as much as possible. The content that the students are tought should go deeper than just the surface. A teacher with excellent knowledge doesnt' just copy Wikipedia as other teacher might do.So with this teacher the students aren't given any wrong facts. A relatable teacher might be good to have fun but what if you want to go deeper in the subject? 

A good teacher has the ability to relate to his students as this ability is more important. But an excellent teacher has both, the ability to relate well with his students and has excellent knowledge so he can answer all the questions the students might have.
