The teacher is explaining something but it´s too boring to pay attention. Why can´t he understand that it´s not interesting?, everyone is asking his/ herself. But is it important that a teacher can relate with his students? The question will be duscus 
If the teacher is able to relate well with students,the students pay more attention to the lesson´s topic. Because the teacher can explain it in an interesting way e.g. the physics teacher could not just say "this was invented by Newton" but he could tell his students who Newton was in a little story. 
This may work with younger students but for older ones it´s just important what they learn. When they go to university they must have knowledge and not interesting stories. That´s why the teacher has to teach them as much as he can.  
Knowledge is important but if the teacher is not able teach in a proper way altough he knows everything about his subject , the students cannot understand or remember the topics being taught. Maybe the teacher explains it too theoretically and no one understands what he want to tell and teach them.
If the teacher explains it in an easy and nice way the students may understand it well but when they face the "real" life no one cares if they need an easier explanation. They have to learn that it is important to understand the topics even when it is difficult. 

In my opinion teachers must have knowledge of their subject but if they cannot explain it in a way the students understand no one will learn anything. It´s good when the lesson is interesting, too, but that is not a necessity.
