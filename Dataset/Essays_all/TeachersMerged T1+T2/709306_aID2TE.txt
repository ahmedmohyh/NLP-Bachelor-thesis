People say, that the teachers ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Firstly, for sure it is important that the teacher understands the student. The teacher should be able to understand what the difficulites of the student are and when it is getting to easy. Otherwise there won't be an increase of learning success.

However, it is important that the teacher is well educated, he or she should be able to explain the subject properly. I figure, that it is insufficient, if the teacher only knows the basics of a subject. If a student raises further questions on a topic, the teacher should be able to answer it.

It doesn't matter how excellent the knowledge of a teacher is, when he can't explain it to the students. The main job of a teacher is to make the students understand the topic. Therefore it is essential, that the teacher can relate well with the students to elaborate whether they need more explanation or if he or she can proceed to the next topic.

Nevertheless, students won't take the teacher serious, if he lacks of knowledge. Especially in higher grades, the students will start to question the reliability of the teacher.

Where it all boils down to is, that both abilities are important. A teacher who doesn't understand the students can't teach, but neither can a teacher with poor knowledge. So, the bottom line is that a teacher needs to be able to do both for an overall good qualification.
