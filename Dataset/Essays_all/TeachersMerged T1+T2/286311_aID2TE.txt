In my opinion this statement is just in a few points of view right. First of all the relationship between teacher and students is very important.Just like that the teacher is able to teach and the students are able to learn. If you don't understand you well with the teacher, you can't get the message he's trying to give you, even if his knowledge is the best you could get. My second statement is as a teacher you can have all the knowledge of your subject but if you don't know how to teach it the best way you can to your students, then your knowledge will get lost. Each class is different so as teacher you have to know yourself which class needs more seriousness and which class you can be nice and calm. 
On the other hand if the teacher is too nice, you will probably have a great time in class. The problem is if he can't teach you well, you maybe will have problems in tests that compare each class, for example in our case: the mature tests. Or even worse you will struggle in your later career. Also the students wouldn't take the teacher at some point serious and he couldn't handle his class anymore. Students need to be told what they have to do and learn to be quiet and to pay attention what the teacher is saying. But if the teacher hasn't anything to say so the students won't be able to learn.

My final statement is that as a teacher you need a balance between a good relationship with your students and a good knowledge of the subject. In the end I don't fully agree and don't fully disagree with this statement. As a student it is important to have fun in class, learn with different methods and take your teacher serious. As a teacher you have to try to teach well and also have fun with students, because you are responsible for their education and it's your job so you should like to do what you do.
