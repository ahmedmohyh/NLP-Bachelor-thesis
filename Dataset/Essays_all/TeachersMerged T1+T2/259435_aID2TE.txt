Is it in need to have teachers with excellent knowledge or is it more important that he could relate well with students? This is what this text is about. The question of good education is an allday problem. Do you need full knowledge to master you after school life or is it at preference that you are teached well and have a good relation to the teacher? 

So first the counter thesis about this subject. You need good knowledge to get further in life. It impossible to work on something you just know half of it. You should be always be well educated and this means that you know as much as you can. You obviously need to know everything about everything, if you aint know all you'll going to make decisions or build opinions on things you only see a part of. So it in need that you get to know as much as you can. 

But on the other hand you have to hae a nice relation to the teacher you get teached from. Because if you don't have a teacher you have it nice with, you wouldn't appreciate learning as much as you can if you had one. If you have a teacher with better teaching skills you instantly would learn better in this atmosphere rather you can if you just learn as much as you can. 

So in my point of view it should be more important to have a great teacher then an excellent knowledge teacher. I'd learn better with a good teacher then a Excellent knowledge student book. If I want to look something detailed up, I have the internet or some books. For exact facts about something special i want to know for my self, i can informate myself.
