We all go to school to learn something, in this case I think it's more important to have a teacher with excellent knowledge of the subject. Not that it's unimportant to have a good relation to your teacher/students. Within a good realtion it's not just having a good time in class, it's also about how we get the subject thought, in a way every single one understands, which is, in my eyes, even more important. I would even say, transvering knowledge properly to your students is a essential or nessecary capability. To get back to the knowledge it self, it should be a common skill to learn on your own, at least in our age(18), what means to be independend from your teacher when it's about to learn. Also we, or at least our motivation for learning, should not get too much affected by the way our teacher treats us, even though we do sometimes. 
But when talking about elemantary I'd say the whole thing is different. As we make our first experiences with school and studing we should be well treated so we can behave properly, because at this time it's about to learn how to learn. Of course the basics, which get thought should be wright, but that shoulden't be to difficult for a professional teacher.
So my finally opinion on that would be, that a good teacher combines both,when in first years of school the relation counts more in the later years the knowledge may be more important.
