In the planning of educational purposes, it is necessary that we answer the question of whether beeing able to relate with students, or an excellent 
knowledge of the subject beeing taught is of higher importance overall. As we surely can all agree, both these things are of exeptional value when it 
comes to education. One could say that the relationship and beeing able to relate with those who are to adopt knowledge is more importatant than 
the actual knowledge itself, because as we all know, we all are more likely to remember things when we have fun while learning. Although, this view stands in opposition to the belief that the best relationship and rememberance of things does not lead to anything, should the knowledge itself be of lesser quality. Personally, speaking about the goal of education, i do in fact value the learning climate more than the actual content because the primary purpose of education for me is to evolve not only in the process of thinking but also in the gaining of social skills which can only be achieved in a good relationship among the learning group, involving the teacher, therefore the teachers ability to relate well with students must be prioritized.
