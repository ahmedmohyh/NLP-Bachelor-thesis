Of course the ability of a teacher to relate well with students is really important, but you could say the very same about the importance of precise knowledge of the taught subject. Being able to relate well with students improves the quality of the taught classes extremly. You need the ability to lead the students through a lesson, keeping them interested in the subject, having them cooperate with you as a teacher. There is no denying that the organizing and the discipline during the lesson is important to keep an athmosphere where students feel confortable and are able to study with joy and concentration. Students should also be able to communicate with the teacher easily and without doubts they will be heared and supported by him. The teacher as a figure of trust and competence is one of the most productive aspects in school. On the other hand a teacher who isn't able to teach his subject at all is a giant annoyance for anyone. For example if it becomes quite usual for a teacher to have things explained to him by the students, this is a shame and besmirches the dignity those should have who bear the burden of teaching on their shoulders. As I explained, my opinion is that knowledge of the taught subject is also very important and as I think, a bigger shame not to have as the ability to relate well with ones students. But if I have to define a good teacher, I would say that he should have both abilities alike; I don't think one is much more important than the other, because if a teacher is lacking one of them, it is a real pain.
This means, in the end I disagree with the statement and I would say both qualities share an equal importance.
