Teachers are the ones who are supposed to help us gain knowledge. In order to do that they have to know what they are teaching and they have to be able to explain it in a way that students can understand. But what if they don`t have the required kowlege? 
In order to teach something to someone you need excellent kowledge in the area you are currently teaching. If not, how are you supposed to explain something to an ambitionous student if you don`t have a clue yourself? There are plenty of students who question certain things, if they are interested in a subject and a teacher needs to be able to explain things in detail.

On the other hand if a teacher is more reletabe, students tend to like him more and that has an effect on how the students learn. If they like the teacher they may like the subject being thaught more to, and that can lead to students spending more time on said subject and that equals better grades. 
Also if a teacher is more relatable he will understand the students needs and can meet them better.
Further more, a relatable teacher will most likely not give a lot of homework because he kows that students often don`t do it if it is a lot.

Personally I think that a mixture of both is needed. A teacher needs to know what he is teaching but he does not need to be excellent. Just so that he will be able to answer questions that go a little deeper than the usual stuff that is required for normal school lessons. Also he needs to be able to relate to students, to a certain point because a teacher who is not able to relate may not be able to meet the students needs and is often not liked by the class he is teaching.
