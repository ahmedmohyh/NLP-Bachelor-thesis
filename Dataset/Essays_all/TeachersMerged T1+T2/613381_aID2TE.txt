I have more negativ points to say about this statement than positiv ones. I disagree with this statement.

Yes it is important that the teacher has a good relationship with his students but it is not necessary at all because the main point of his job is to teach students so they can make their diploma. The students can also pass the class with an unfriendly teacher they do not like at all but it is more difficult to pass a class where the teacher is nice but he does not teach serious enough. Some students are more motivated to study when the teacher has a nice personality. They raise their hand often and join discussions etc.

But at the other side it is not a teacher's job to have good relationships with his students and to make himself popular. He doesn't need to be loved by the students. He just has to teach them so they maybe pass the class. A teacher did not study to be loved by his students but he studied because he wants to teach and to work with young people and to prepare them for the future. He wants to share his knowledge with people who does not know yet. Teach who jus

In general I do not agree at all with this statement because I know by myself that it is better to have a teacher who can share his knowledge good than a teacher who just wants to be loved by his students because you learn less at these teachers.
