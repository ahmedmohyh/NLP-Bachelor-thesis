Teachers are a very important part of a lesson. They are the ones who prepare us for the next coming years as like for the university. Most of them have an excellent knowledge of their subject and some can relate with students very well. But what is more helpful for a student's future?

Being able to relate with students can be helpful for them but it doesn't really prepare them for the future. They only build up a good relationship between the teacher and the learner and makes them grow in character and personality. It might help in personal situations or for how to work as a team. But definitely doesn't aid them in understanding the subject better. For example if they had a question, the teacher wouldn't know how to answer it or they would use the same complicated sentence which has been said before. So therefore being able to relate doesn't make a significant change in a student's knowledge.

Whereas a person who knows his subject he's teaching well can make the youth grow in knowledge and wisdom. They are able to teach them the right way to do it or how to understand it. If students have a question to a certain chapter they can answer it right away in short understandable phrases. It is easy for them to rephrase or reword a sentence that hasn't been very clear for some of the class.

Finally I find it more important that teachers can show us how a subject works and also make us understand it better. Because I wouldn't learn much if the person stands in front of us and can't make us understand it or isn't able to make it clear enough. They have to make it clearly understandable and easy for us to use it or learn it for our future. But if a teacher only knows how to emphasize with students, it doesn't make them smarter or wiser. It might make us grow in person but not in knowledge.
