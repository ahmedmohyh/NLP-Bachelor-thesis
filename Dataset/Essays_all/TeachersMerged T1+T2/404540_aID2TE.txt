There are a lot of differend types of teachers everywhere in the world. In school the students always have different opinions of their teachers. Also the students' parents have their own opionion of what a good teacher is and what qualities he should have to be good in his job. But is it more important for a teacher to get along well with his students or is it better to have the excellent knowledge of the subject?


Everywhere the profession "teacher" is different. There are different levels for example primary teacher. Also there is another school system in every country and even inside the country itself.
If a teacher can relate well with his students, he gets on a more personal base with them. They understand each other and can relate to each other and maybe even have cooperations during the calss that can make life easyier for both of them. It's always good to get on with the people in your area especially the ones you work with.

As in every job it's helpful for you to be good in what you're doing. For the profession as a teacher, you have to know your subject very well and have the ability to make other people understand. Knowledge is important, otherwise you can't learn students the right things and something new and important for their future life.


A teacher is a normal person like other humans too. Everyone has other qualities and skills. As ateacher it's important that you're good in socializing and human contact  but you also have to have the essential knowledge to even teach something as the profession sais itself. If you can't tell someone what you mean, because you don't get along well with each other, there's a problem too.
In my opinion, both qualities are nessesary. These twoo skills depend on each other to be a good teacher. You can have only one of them, but getting along with your students and teaching accurate things is the key to the perfect teacher.
