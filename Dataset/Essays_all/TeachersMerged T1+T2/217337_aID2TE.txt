So first to the facts which are supporting the teacher's ability.
It is is very important to have ability to communicate with the students. Maybe if the teacher has to explain certain complicated things to the students the teacher should be able to think their way. Also if there are personal problems with a student or things who are akward, the teacher has to deal with this and therefore the teacher should have be able to relate well with the students.Or from the students side of view, it is that if the students want to learn something they have to understand the teacher and what he is saying.
So now to the key facts of the ability of excellent knowledge of a teacher.
Of course it is important to have an excellent knowledge in the subject because you have to explain it to other persons so that they can understand the topic.
Also in an university the teacher has to have an excellent knowledge of his core subject because the level there is so high that you nearly have to be a "nerd" to teach in that subject. Also at secondary level it is sufficient to be well versed with your subject because you have to prepare the students for university.
So in my opinion it is like that that until secondary level it is more important to be well related with the students and afterwards like in a university it is better to be well versed with knowledge of your teaching subject. I think so because because until the end of the secondary level your are a teenager who doesn't know what to do and afterward at an university you already decided what you want to be as a profession.
But overall i must say that I think that the teachers ability to be well relate is more important than to be well versed with knowledge. But that doesn't mean that it is unimportant to be excellent known in your teaching subject.
