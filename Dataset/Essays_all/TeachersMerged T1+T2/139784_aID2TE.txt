What is the most important ability a teacher should have? This is not a question, which we can just answer with one single answer. On one side to have the knowledge of the subject you´re teaching is one of the most important ability. But on the other hand having a good relationship to your students is also not fogetable. I mean if you relate well with students but you have no clue, what you´re talking about, then it becomes rather difficult and this is not how you should be like as a teacher. You can teach your subject just with more enthusiasm if you know all the important things about it. But the other extreme is also not optimal, I mean if you know everything for example about phisics, but you don´t know anything about how to behave with children. This is also kind of a very sad situation. 
The ability to relate well with your students is something, which you have or you have not, but to have the knowledge of a subject is something you can learn. 
In my oppinion it matters, which class and level you´re teaching. In a highschool you should have more knowledge in your subject than relate the students well, but in the primary school I think there´s more important to relate your children well than to know everything in detail. But in my oppinion the mixture of both abilities is, what you should have as a perfect teacher. I think you cannot say this is important and this is not important and that´s why this discussion is very subjectiv, because everyone has an other oppinion about this theme.
