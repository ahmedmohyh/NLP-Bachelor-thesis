There are two kinds of teachers you probably know. The first on has a good relation to his student but don`t know exactly what he want to teach you. And the opposite one, the techer who exactly knows all about the topic and subject he want to teach but he has no good relation to his students. 
But which one is the better teacher? Is it more important to have the abilitys to get a good relation to his students or to have an excellent knowledge of the topics and subjects he taught?

I think it`s difficult to answer it in general. There are this subject where you have to study a lot, for example maths or biology. Here it is important to have a teacher who knew all about the subject so you could ask all your questions so you can understand the topics. Mostly the relation can be okay when the teacher is friendly and answers all questions as good as possible so the students can understand all. 
And then there are other subject like PE or Art where you don`t need to learn so much and where it will be okay when the teacher can`t answer all questions. Of course he need a basic knowledge but he will not be a teacher when he don`t have these knowledge. So in these subjects the teacher can focus a little bit more at the good relation between him and his students. 

To summarize all that: Both can be really important it depend on the subject the teacher taught. When the subject and the topics are difficult but really important and all students have to learn a lot for these, it is more important that the teacher have a good knowledgeand can answer all questions. But when the students don`t need to study so much then it is more important that the teacher have a good relation with his students. 
So it can be both really important and i think the best teacher is a teacher who have both, the ability to relate well with his students and the excellent knowledge of the subject he taught.
