On the one hand, a teacher's ability to relate well with his students is necessary for a good learning atmosphere. When a student has problems to undestand a topic, the teacher has to understand first why the student does not understand it. The moment he has achieved it by relating with his student and trying to understand how his mind is working, he can start to help. If he knows his students well, he can figure the best way out to explain the topic and the students will understand it faster. Moreover if the students notice that the teacher understands or tries to understands them, they wll appreciate it, and they are willing to give the subject a chance.

On the other hand, if a teacher relates well with his students and knows how to get to them, knows exactly what the problem is, but he does not know the answer to the question, it will not help anything. It is important that the teacher is an expert in his subject, so he can give his knowledge to the students. The students will take him more seriously because they see that he knows what he is talking about and that he can really help them.

In my opinion it is more important, that the teacher relates well with the students, because I have made experiences that the teacher knew a lot about the subject but he could not really explain it to us. So we could not profit from his wide knowledge, and it would have been better if he just had tried to relate with us.
