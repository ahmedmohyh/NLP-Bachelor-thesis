When one thinks of skills that are important for teachers to have, one of the first aspects that comes to mind, is that they ought to really know everything about their subject. To know the things they have to teach like their back of their hand. But what about being able to understand their students? Isn't that just as important? Or even more important?
I guess you can say, that the priority has to be knowledge. Because there can't be teachers around, who teach wrong things to their students. This will only lead to confusion and students will be on their own, having to learn everything themselves. Eventually they will lose trust in school and the whole system.
But it is so important, that teachers are able to relate to their pupils! When the teacher gets their students, she or he understands in what way it's best to bring certain things to them. One class will learn more through graphics and another one more through an animation. Teachers ought to find out such things and adapt their strategies. 
It is also very helpful if the teacher actually notices, when his/her students are at their limits. Maybe this week is a really stressing one with a lot of exams. The teacher has to notice an anxious and tense student so he can act the right way. There is nothing worse than a student getting told off for not having done some homework when he or she is already in a mentally critical condition. 
There's also the way teachers handle test-results and test-preparations - there's allways a sensible and a harsh way to that. Students will be much more confortable in their school environment, if teachers chose the sensible way. And if students are confortable they are more willing and more capable to learn.
So in conclusion we can see, that the knowledge of a teacher is a key factor and the basis to good teaching. But the aspect of the ability to relate to their students has to get a lot of attention and weight as well, because it improves the whole school-system vastly.
