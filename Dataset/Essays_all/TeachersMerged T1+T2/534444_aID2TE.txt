To answer this question it is very important to define what kind of school we are talking about. 

If we talk about an elementary school teacher, I am convinced that his teaching skills are more important than his knowledge. The older the kids get, the more important becomes his knowledge. In middle school, the teacher definitely needs both. Here, the kids usually go through puberty and start disliking school. The same counts for the teacher. While the teacher often is a hero in elementary school, he becomes just another adult who sets boundaries in middle school. So the students start to rebell against the teacher and the teacher is very challenged. At this point, it is crucial that he has a good knowledge of the subject. Because as soon as the kids notice that their teacher isn't competent, they won't take him seriously anymore and make fun of him. If the kids decide to go to a "Gymnasium" after middle school, it usually shows that they have an interest in at least some subjects. So it is extreamly important that the teacher can "satisfy" this need of knowledge. While his competence gets more important, the need of good teaching skills decrease. The reason for that is the age of the students. In the "Gymnasium" they usually went through puberty and the young adults often respect the teachers again.



In conlusion I think it needs both. On the one hand, a teacher's ability to relate with students is very important. If he is not able to connect with the students, his knowledge is worthless because they will not listen to him.
On the other hand especially knowledge is a big help to catch the attention of the students. The more the teacher knows, the more interesting are his lessons.
