i am beginning with the positiv aspects of this statement. i think a teacher must be a good and helpful human. when a teacher is not able to that he can not motivate his students. the lecons are becoming borring and the students do not listen any more time. so the his knowledge is unusefull. on the other hand, when a teacher only is ability to relate well and he know nothing, that is also unusefull. so the student are maybe motivated by this teacher but they lear nothing. so that is out of sence. in my opinion a teacher as to be on the one hand a good humand and on the other hand he have to know a lot. only in this way he can teach students well. and only in this way the students are motivated and listen to his lessons.
