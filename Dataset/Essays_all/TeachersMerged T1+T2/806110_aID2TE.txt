Everybody knows the kind of teachers that don't have motivation for teaching. If you want to become a teacher you should have the ability, bring motivation towards the students and some knowledge. In my opinion, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is the most important thing in school.

First of all, a teacher should have a look at his abilities. Everybody has diffrent ways to teach a topic successfully. Good abilities are for example clear structure during the lessons, a lound and comprehensible voice, solve problems of the students or sometimes being cool. Furthermore, If you do these things, the stundents are pretty grateful. Moreover, I have met a lot of teachers with those abilities and I was able to learn much faster.

Secondly, you rase the motivation of the stundents. When there is a teacher who is interessted in the topic himself it is likely that you get motivated. So, if you come to a lesson with a good teacher you're more interessted in the topic than if there would be a bad teacher.

Last but not least, we need to consider that the school books do have a better knowledge than a big amount of teacher. The teachers know things too, but not as good as the books. 

In a nutshell, I have to say that I prefer a teacher with good abilities, but there has to be a minimum of knowledge about the topic.
