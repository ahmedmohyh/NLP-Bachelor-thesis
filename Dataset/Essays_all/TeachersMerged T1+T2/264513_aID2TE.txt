At first, I think every teacher has to know well about his subject. I think it's hard to teach if you don't know what your talking about.I mean you can't even answer the students If you can't teach it the way you should it's twice as hard for students to understand than it already is. The first difficulty for a student is that he doesn't understand what the teacher is talking about because it's the first time he hears it or he isn't interessted in this subject. And when even the teacher doesn't know what he wants to says it nearly impossible for a student to understand. But I think it's as important that the teacher has an interessting way of teaching. If a teacher just lays out some sheats and the students have to read it, the lesson is going to be very boring. That's what one of my earlier teachers did. She just gave us a text, told us to read it and after that we should answer some questions and check them on our own. She often left and went to the teachers room. Nobody did what she told us to do. I know that this is a fault from us students but I also think that she has to do her job right and that she can't leave just because she's in a bad mood. An other problem is that the students are getting noisy if they are bored. That's why those students who would like to learn something can't really focus on what they want to learn. As a student you don't like boring lessons. Often students don't appear to the lessons if they don't like the subject or espassially the teachers way of couloring his lesson. For me, both is very important. For students who can't concentrate well, it's better if the teacher doesn't know his subject perfect than a bad way of teaching. I'm a person who can listen even when it's boring. That's way I don't mind if the lessons aren't that coulorful. But every teacher has to decide for himself and for sure for his class.
