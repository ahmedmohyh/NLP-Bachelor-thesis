Many students have problems in school, especially when it comes to the relation between the student and his teacher. A lot of students blame their teachers for bad marks and boring lessons. Most of them think that a good teacher has to be able to relate well with his students. But is it really that important to understand students opionions? Isn't it more important to know well about a subject. These questions are going to be covered in the following paragraph.

Firstly, just to relate well with students isn't that important when it is being considered that students have to work independently. They have to learn that there is not always a person who may help them. They need to solve their own problems. When teachers consider this, they help their students a lot in improving their certain skills. 
Furthermore, a teacher who is good in relating with students and has no knwolededge of the subject he is teaching, is not really a teacher. The teacher's job is to inform us about certain subjects and nothing more. So just being able to relate well with others is not enough.

In my opinion, knowledge is the most important feature in school considering that a teacher has to teach us the subject. It is of less use just to knwo how people feel. Knowledge is the ability to getting better, to improve our skills and to widen our horizon. Knowledge is power.
