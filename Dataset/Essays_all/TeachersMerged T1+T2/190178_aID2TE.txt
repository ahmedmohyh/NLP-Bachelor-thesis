Well, I agree, absolutely.
I think a teacher should be open with the piuples and have conacte and including all in the class, though sometimes it can be really difficulte.
To be a teacher it don't mean when you have a bachelor or went to the university you will be a good teacher. I think if you want to teach you must have also the character. A teacher can't be shy or introverse. 

I experienced that a guy did a practicum in our class in the subject Italian. He knew all the grammar, all the rules, everything but he wasn't motivate at all. I thought at his first day that he was just a little nervous or I don't now what but it continued every da, every day it was the same. So at the end my Italian teacher had to tell him that he was't able for this job, that he should search an other job-direction. The worst was he did a master in Italian and Spanish too. 

Ok, as teacher you surly have to be good in your subject and know what you are telling, but isn't it normal that the teacher are excellent in his subject?
Because as teacher you have to go to the university and I think people how goes to the university aren't stupid at all. 

To make it short my oppinion is that I agree. I think teacher should relate with students. They have to know what they are doing.
