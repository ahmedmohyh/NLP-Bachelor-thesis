It is a controverse question, whether teachers have to be able to relate well with students or if it is more important that they are experts in the subject they are teaching.
On first sight you would think knoledge was the more important factor because it is very important that a teacher knows his subject very well to be able to teach it to others.

In this way especially good students get bored and fastly do not pay attention to the lesson any more, which means they are going to absorb less of the information the teacher wants to give them.
On the other hand, not only knowledge, but also the relationship between teacher and students matters a lot. When students like their teacher, they are much more eager to listen and to learn whatever is thaught. Additionally, a teacher has to know the children to some extend, to be able to help them whenever possible and to give fair grades. Often, when the relationship between student and teacher is good and the student trusts him or her, he will aks questions, when he does not understand something, that he might not dare asking in a less friendly relationship. And through asking more questions he will understand things he would not have understood otherwise. That means, that a better relationship leads to students getting better
