I think its really important, that the relation between the teacher and the student is good and they understand each other. But I think its also important, that the student understand the subject. When the teacher knows his students better than he can learn the students something is probably their relation better. So the teacher can treat every student as the same and no one could say, that the teachers don't like them or give this student a worser grade than the other students. There is equality in the classroom. On the other hand it is very important, that at the end of the year the teacher had done with his students what he wanted to do and also what he have to do with them. Because after the year the students have to know that. But I think there are a lot of teachers who can fix it, that they have a good relationship to the students and the students know the subject excellent. Those teachers the students really like and they like to go to this subject. But I think there are to many teachers which are only focused on the subject and aren't interested in what the students think about him. Also there are teachers, who think that is more important that he has a good relation to the students than the students knows more about the subject. Then its also hard for the students, that they like to go to this lesson.
In my opinion it would be good, when the teacher has a good relation to the students and could also lern the students what they have to know. I think its good, when they have a good balance between this two points.
