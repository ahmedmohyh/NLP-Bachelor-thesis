A teachers job is slways hard. Teachers have to have a good relationship with their students but they also have to teach the right stuff and they must look that the students learn enough. As a teacher it is always a compromise between being friendly and supportive and being strict and telling the students what to do. Because of that a teacher should not only know his subject, he should also like children and he should know how to handle children related problems.

Children are often annoyed by school and therefore they are not very concentrated. It is important for a teacher to know how to attract the attention of the children. For example they do a short break and than the children can move around for a couple of minutes and after the break they are motivated again. But when the students get older it is more important for them that the subject is explained well. It is iomportant for older students that they can follow the teacher so that they can improve themselves. But for older students it is necessary that they have a connection to the teacher otherwise they will look out of the window and won't motivate themselves to be concentrated. In my opinion the teachers ability to be relatet with students is as important as his knowledge of the subjekt being thaugt. If a teacher is not capable to build a relationship I am easily distracted by other things but the subject. But a relationship can also be built when a teacher knows a lot about the subject so he can explain me everything I want to know.

All in all it is difficult for me to disagree or agree with the statement. A good teacher should have a lot of positive aspects and I thnk that you can't be trained being a good teacher either qou are good or not.
