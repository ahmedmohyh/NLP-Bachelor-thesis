Many people discuss wether it's more important for a teacher to relate well with students or if it's more impotant that he has excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
First one can say that it's most important that the teacher has a good relationship to his stundents because students in generall like the classes of their favorite teachers the most. It's easier for them to listen properly and they can memorise more of the things being taught. Another reason is that a teacher is automatically seen as a polite person when he talks friendly to his students and if he also talks about some other things than what he has to tell because that's what makes a good realationship between stundents and teachers. The students will behave a lot better and they won't try to trick these kinds of teachers as much as teachers they don't like.
On the other hand it's really important that the teachers are able to teach everything that's necessary because the students need to have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught if they want to graduate. They also need to be well prepared for their future because that's what school's for. And if they wouldn't be well prepared they could probably end up being unhappy with their lives. Nowadays the students mostly have the best chances to earn enough money and have a great family after school but their chances could easily be taken away if the teacher wouldn't focuss on teaching the best he can. 
In my opinion there should be he healthy mixture because the teachers I like the most teach very well nand make me listen without being rude and if I had a teacher who wouldn't be serious teaching his excellent knowledge, I personally wouldn't care much about the subject and it would be a lot easier to fail in exams. I also want to learn everything that's possible because learning for free is one of the best possibilities ever given.
