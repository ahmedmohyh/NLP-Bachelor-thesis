The given statement wheter a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is in my opinion mostly correct.
In the following I will answer this question and give certain aspects.
Teachers should have a well relation to their students because this is the base of teaching.
The better the conenction between student and teacher is or the better they relate together the better results the students will get. 
Studying in a good and well atmosphere where the students feel comfortable in is necessary and nearly the best and only way of getting good results and having the possibilty to teach a subject.
Teachers who just have an excellent knowledge are able to teach the subject and could bring its knowledge to the students but if the students and the teachers relation is miserable this will not work , the students mood and attitude towards the teachers lesson and towards himself is really bad so that the students are not motivated of learning and studying.
This effect of having no motivation and a bad attidude could or probablz effects the teaching of a certain subject and its results.
Because of the fact that every teacher needs to have a certain knowledge in a subject at least in the subejct he teaches the students would defently learn more during a lesson with a teacher who has a good but maybe not excellent knowledge on his subject but he realtes well with his students so that the atmosphere and the conversation between the students and himself helps teaching a subject.
To summarize my given opinion : I think that the ability to relate well with students defetly the most important point is and the excellent knowledge of a teacher is more 'unimportant'.
