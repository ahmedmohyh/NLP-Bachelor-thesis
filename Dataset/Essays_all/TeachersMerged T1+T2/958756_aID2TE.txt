There are teachers, who are very intelligent and there are teachers, who's relations to the students are very good. But is there a teacher, who has both?
Intelligence and good relations with the students? And if not, what would be better? 

There are lots of teachers. Some of them are mean and some of them are nice and friendly. What happens very often is that students like the nice and friendly teacher more than the mean one, but this is not always right. Because when a teacher isnt friendly, it does not mean his a bad teacher. Mostly, friendly teachers are worse than teachers who arent friendly. Sure, if a teacher has a good realationship between him and his students, they trust him more, but its not good, when the students "love" their teacher, but he cant even tell them about the 1x1, the napoleonic wars, the electricity or the past perfect.
But this doesnt mean that a teacher has to be mean and his lessons have to be boring. Not at all. Cause when a teacher just talks about the stuff, which is writed down in every school book


So for me its important, that the teacher has both; knowledege and relations. Because when he cant connect these two abilities, he will probably fail at his job.
