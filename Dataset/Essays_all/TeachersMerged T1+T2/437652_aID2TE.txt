I think it's importent to have the ability to relate well with students for a teacher. I mean if you can't relate well with dthe students, they won't listen to you or do not respect you. But it is also important that teachers have the knowledge of the subject being taught. The students won't learn the things thes have to, when the teachers don't know anything about it at all. Per example in the subject history, if the teachers don't know what's the first worldwar about, how should they explain the students how it all begon? Without the knowledge of the subject they are taught they can't give the students a chance to know something about that. So, as a teacher you have to know something about you subject. I think it's allright if a teacher don't know all about their subject. It's ok to say if you don't know something that's not really necessary. If you as a teacher go on well with the students, they will understand you and you don't have to worry about. If the students like you as a teacher, they will also make you proud on tests and learn more or just with more fun. They are more interest in your subject. That is the best thing for all the people in the class. As a * do more and better work with a motivated class instead of a lazy class.** 
So I would say that I agree with this statement. It's more important to relate well with students than excellent knowledge of the subjegt being taught, as long as the teacher know the important things of the subject. If you go on well with your students, it's ok to make mistakes, no one will care about that if they like you. 

*teacher you can
** It's more fun to teach students you like when you know they like you too.
