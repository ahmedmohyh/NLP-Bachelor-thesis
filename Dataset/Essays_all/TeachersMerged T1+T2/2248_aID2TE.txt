On the one hand it is profitable when the teacher is able to have niece communications with the pupil, sice the students wil be engaged when it comes to the selfdiscipline and learningmotivation. Furthermore it would help to create a cofortable feeling in the class as well as a good bondage between teacher and students. Consequently the pupil will particupate more and with a higher motivation.
  
But on the other hand the pupil went to school to learn as much as possible. This does not work when the teacher has not a lot of knownledge, because when there are questions from the pupil he is not able to answer. In Addition pupil are rather impressed from a teacher who knows a lot and appears respectfully. Maybe a well prepared teacher could become a role model. An nother point is that students might be boared from a theacher, who can not tell a lot of stuff so consequently they will lose the respect and a good student teacher relation does not work anymore.

In my opinion a teacher has to relate well with the students as well as having a good knownlede, because the pupil will learn cofortable an good stuff only with a teacher who can be both. Furthermore good knownlede is a bit more important than a nice relationship between the teacher and the students because the reason for going to school is to learn and not to have small talk whith the teacher.
