To have a job as a teatcher means you have to interact with other people. There are not only other teatchers with whom you have to work with the students have also a big role in youre everyday life.
In every school there are students who are in a phase where they think they are to cool to have respect ore act not appropriate to their teachers. 
On the one hand the ability to relate good with youre students is mostly in this time important to really conect with the students and to build a connection of respect. A teatcher who is not  respecting their students or is not trying to help them is mostly a teatcher where students do not want to invest power. 
Also important to mention is that a students teacher spends often more time with them then the students parents do. A techer can help with problems a teenager might have and with whom the student dont want to talk with familiar persons. I case of bulling should a student always feel free to ask a teacher for help because there is often nobody else to help them.
On the other hand without knowledge you can not teach. To be a teacher you have to have a certain amount of knowledge because if you do not have enough you can maby not answer every question your stdents have or in the worst case you are not teaching the right things. Teaching things makes someone a teacher this is what he should do so if he has the ability to make students learn something new he has done his job. 
To sum it up I think that a good teacher should have bouth characteristics. He has to have this amount of knowledge that he really knows what he is talking about and that there is no doubt that everything he says is right. But Also the ability to connect right with youre students and be maybe more than just the teacher is important because teacher are spending much time with their students and can see problems often bevore the students parents can.
