Teachers need to relate with students.
It is good for the students, if the teacher understands their problems and their struggle.
The students feel comforted and can trust the teacher, but the ability to relate to students should not weigh more than the knowledge of the subject which needs to be taught.
The teacher needs to teach the students, they will need the knowledge for their future.
For example for their jobs or if they want to go to university.
A teacher who understands the students and does not teach them the right way, is not helpful for their life after school.
For Example, a teacher who understands the big problems with maths in one class needs to understand them, but also needs to teach them his knowledge.
If students feel safe and helped, they can learn with more fun and interest.
Some students need more help, some students less.
But  most important is, that most of the students understand the topic of the lesson.
The teacher needs to take care and needs to help students.
It is not helpful, if the teacher just teaches without taking care of his students.
In my opinion, teachers with a good ability to relate well with students are very helpful for teaching and for the students, but the students need also the knowledge.
A teacher should relate to the students and should make them feel understood.
Furthermore he needs to combine his knowledge and the ability to relate.
