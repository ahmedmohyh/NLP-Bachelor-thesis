Teaching at schools is a huge discussed point in our society. Of course it is important that a teacher has a huge knowledge in what he's teaching. But the ability to how he teaches his students has a significance too. If a teacher needs knowledge or a good relation with the students depends upon the age of the students.
If students relate well with the teacher they are automatically more motivatet to visit a lesson of the subejct the teacher is giving. They are looking forward to attend the lesson because they like the teacher, it doesn't matter that much if they don't like the subject. The students get to love the subject and get better in it because they are motivated to learn with a teacher tehy like.
Of course does the knowledge of the teacher matter too. If the teacher just doesn't know what he's talking aboout the students won't think that the subject is significant and interesting. The students will not take the subject serious anymore and they start not learning for the subject because they aren't interested in it. The knowledge of the teaching person has an impact o how well students do in a certain subject.
The good relation is much more important for students in the younger age. For them it doesn't matter if a teacher knows much about the subject he's teachiing. They just want to have fun in the classes. For older students such as gymnasiasts it is much more importent that the teacher has a huge knowledge rather than being a nice person. They are motivated to learn something no matter if they have a good relation with the teacher.
As a conclusion I want to say that it depends upon the age of the students if the knowledge or the good relation with the class has a bigger significence in teaching. Of course if a teachers has both of these abilities he is a very good teacher.
