In this essay I will discuss the question whether the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

Teachers and public education in general are a large part of upbringing a human. Bringing a child up doesn't pause when it steps out the door going to school making teachers an important factor in raising a child. So in order to successfully raise a child teachers need to be in some aspects as good as the child's parents. This means that they also have to relate well with their students.
As school isn't merely an institution of education but a factor in the students' socialization teachers also assume the position of a counselor. In secondary school teenagers face a lot of potential problems such as drugs, discovering their sexuality and finding their own identity. For teachers to react adequately they need to relate well.
However, merely understanding their students isn't enough. School teaches its students a lot of crucial abilities and prepares them for their life as an adult. Children often don't know which path they'll take after school which means that they have to be educated in all general subjects, making the teachers knowledge of their subject inexpendable. 

Finally I think that due to the ideas and arguments I've elaborated upon earlier in this text I can say that there is no clear answer to this question. I believe that this question is in fact flawed as it assumes a false dichotomy between relating and teaching. In my opinion both abilities presuppose each other as both are an integral part of educating and upbringing a child. So my answer would be that a teacher needs to relate well with students while showing excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
