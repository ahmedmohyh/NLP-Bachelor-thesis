First of all I think it's very important for teachers to have a good connection to their students so the relationship between them is at least OK. Even more important is this good relationship in the earlier stages of school, like in primary school because first of all you have less different teachers than in higher stages, so if the teacher hasn't a good relationship with the students the whole 'school' is 'bad' for them because they can't just go to the next subject and have an other teacher. Second, I think with a younger age the teachers have more influence on the students and it's even more important for them to have a teacher who is a good example for them which is also important for the students motivation in higher stages of school.

But I think you can't just have a teacher who is extra 'cool' and funny but has not an idea what he's talking about in the lessons. Here you can use a similar argument like in the text above. It's important for the students to have a good base of knowledge if they come, for example, from primary school to a higher stage like high school to be able to gratuate.

The problem with this argument is, if a teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject but has no connection to the students, he can't bring the important things in the students head. Often there is a problem, that schools has just the extreme types oa f teacher. One teacher has a really good relation to the students and can go well with them, but doesn't know a thing about his subject. And another one knows absolutly anything but can't find a connection to the students, so they just don't listen to him or don't understand what he's talking about.

So in my opinion a good teacher is a teacher who knows what he's talking about in the lessen AND is capable to have an OK relationship with his students.
