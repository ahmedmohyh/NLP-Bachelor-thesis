Relationship between students and teacher

In this essay we will discuss an important statement about relationship between teacher and student. The question is if teacher's ability to relate well with students more important is than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. If I could answer the question in a short sentence I would agree with it but not in every case.

Because of the reason that I am still a student it is easier to argument with it. I know how difficult it is to get well marks if you have a miserable connection to your teacher. In my opinion every teacher should try to relate well with his students. In fact, every student would have probably more fun at school. Most of students would get better marks or learn more than even before. 

Other reason is that teacher and student would come closer to each other. If a student is afraid of something or has problems in his private life he could talk to his lovely teacher aboout it. A good harmony between them very important. 

Otherwise it is very important as a teacher to have the excellent knowledge. If the teacher does not have the excellent knowledge to teach his student, the student would fail every exam in future. It is important to give them the right information and they should being teached right. 

It is not just about the future exams, it is aswell important for life experiences. In every case it could be useful to know the right informations. It does not matter if someone get a automechanicman or a businessman. 

Finally I would say it is important to relate well with students but it is not just about to have a good realtionship. Every teacher should teach his students with right informations. In my opinion I could not agree in every case with this argument. It is important to create a balance. That means every teacher should try to relate well with his student but otherwise he should give his best to teach them as good as he can with the right informations.
