What is more important in school? To have a good relationship  to your teacher and fun in the lessons, but the way of learning isn´t good and the skills of the teacher also not. Or is it more important to learn well and having a clear structure of the lesson and the teachers ability with students isn´t good.

A teacher is a person, who you can tell about your problems in school, if you´ve got some. In this case I think it would be good to have a good relationship to the teacher. But on the other side I can say; there are many possibilities for getting help from other persons, when you´re feeling bad. For example the parents, friends or other persons, you can trust.
It´s also not important to have a funny lesson at school. I think it´s okay to create a lesson funny or  not that straight, but when you can not learn anything it´s not the right method. 

I think, it´s better to have straight and good lessons, where the teacher differences between school and his private life and person. In school it´s important to learn the things, you need in your life after school. It´s not important to know, where your teacher was in his holidays or which his favourite colour is. I know from my own experiences, that my best lessons were the one, in which everybody was respectful and calm, because everybody thought he would be killed by the teacher, if he´s doing something wrong. Of course it don´t have to be so extremly straight, but I´m not lying: It was the best maths lessons i´ve ever had.
