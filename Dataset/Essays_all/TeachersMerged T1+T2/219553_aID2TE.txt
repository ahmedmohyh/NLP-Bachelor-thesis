It's monday morning and Marie is on her way to school. As soon as she gets there her teacher starts yelling at her for wearing something unappropriate. Now Marie thinks of Mrs.Odermann as a bad teacher because she feels like the grownup can't relate with her. 
Is the ability to relate with a student more important than the knowlege of the subject being taught?
On the one hand if a teacher can't relate with the students, he or she probably can't create a lesson that's very interesting for the pupils and that way they'll stop paying attention in class which may have negativ consequences on their testresults. 
On the other hand if a teacher has no knowlege what so ever of the subject he's teaching, the pupils won't be properly educated after the course.
A teacher that knows how to his students think can make you interested in a subject that you used to dislike and can better help you if you may have your problems because he understands you. 
Yet a teacher that has great knowlege of his subject can awnser every question you have in that area and can explain every detail.
All in all I personally think it's equally important for a teacher to be able to relate to his studens as it is to have an excellent knowwlege of the subject being taught.
