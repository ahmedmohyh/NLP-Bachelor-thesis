English Essay
The questin about what abilytis are requested from teachers is isn't an easy one because if a teacher is able to relate with his students but he has only a small knoledge of subjekt, he obviusli isn't able to teach the them what they need toknow about it. But on the other Hand if he's a agenius and knows all about the subjekt but he's not able to teach it/get the students to be interested in what the subjekt is about, he can't teach anything eather. I personaly think that this depends on what grade you're in becose in primary school, I think, it is more imprtant to have a teacher you can talk to and who's ableto help you build your personality and grow up. As long as a mathteacher is able to teach you that one plus one equals two and three multiplied with four equals twelve (and mabey a little bit about geometry) you know enough to have a solid base for later in sekondary level ore even allready middleschool in when you start to learn extended knolledge about te important subjekts. From hear on I think that it's more important tohave a teacher who knows his subjekt as good as possible and who is able to awnser toy our questions. But still, both is import for a teacher to teachhis students what they need to learn per example: my older sister has a chemestry professor who's great in chemistry but totaly miserable in teaching her students what she knows so it is very diffikult to keep up with what they haveto learn becose my sister has to look itthrough again at home to understand whather professor was talking aboutall tay and if you dont get someting it's way more difficult to keep it
