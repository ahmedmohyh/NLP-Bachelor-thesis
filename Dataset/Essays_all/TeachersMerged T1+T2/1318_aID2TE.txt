A lot of students don´t like to go to schoo, because of their teachers, but would it be better, when the teacher´s relate well with the sudents, but haven´t the excellent knowledge of their subject? This point has many advantages and disadvantages, which I will explain in the following text.

 One important fact is ,that the students have more fun in the lessons and when they must learn something, because they know that the teacher isn´t angry, when they forgot it or when it isn´t so good. A lot of students don´t like to go to school, because of the teachers and the high level in school, so it is really good, when you can enjoy lessons, because the teacher is nice to everybody, but is that important for your future? It isn´t, so it doesn´t help you, if the teacher likes erveryone and makes jokes. At school you should learn something for the future and you should get prepared for the life you will have, because you can only get a job, when you good enough in maths for example and when you had a teacher, who hasn´t the excellent knowledge of his subject, you´re aren´t so good like the others, who like to have the job. A lot of students would prefer it, when the teacher has, instead of an nice personality, the excellent knowledge of his subject, because they have it easier.

At all I can say, that there are more disadvantages and this is also my oppinion, because it doesn´t help you for your life. For the job you will do, you must have the knowledge like the others and besides your future boss wouldn´t be so nice too, so it´s better for everybody, when the teachers have the excellent knowledge of their subjects.
