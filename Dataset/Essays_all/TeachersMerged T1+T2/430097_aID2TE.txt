I think it's really important that a teacher has a big knowledge about his subject so that he can also answer all the questions from the students and don't have to give answers like 'I'm sorry but I'm not able to answer this question for you!'. Answers like this aren't really helpful to make sure that the students take you serious and pay attention in your lessons.
On the other hand is it really important as a teacher to think sometimes like a student or throw back as he/she was when he was a student. When a teacher thinks like this students feel understand and have fun about the lessons and show it with taking part and asking questions.
If a teacher teachs a subject about which he didn't have a big knowledge it isn't quite useful because most of the time the teacher also didn't know how to teach this a specific theme so that the students check it. For example if a teacher have to teach us maths but didn't know very much about it and just have a script in which is written how it works he have no idea how to teach it that the students get it after.
Another argument is that if a teacher relates well with his students it's much easier to explain them something which isn't that easy because students try to understand it when they know that the teacher gives his best to explain it as easy as possible. If there is a complicated theme in biology for example and the teacher tries to explain it with models or animations or something like that students have more motivation to get than if you just have to read in your book and with of some pictures you have to understand it.
I agree with this statement! Because if I'm having well relationship with a teacher I'm much more motivated to give my best and make a good mark in this subject also if I'm not that interested in the subject.It's also quite important that a teacher have a big knowledge about what he is talking because most of the time you recognise if a teacher knows about what he is talking or not.
