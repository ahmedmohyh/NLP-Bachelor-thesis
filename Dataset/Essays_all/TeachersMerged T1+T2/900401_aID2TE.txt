It is true that the ability to relate well with students is important. Who does not know those types of teachers. They stand in front of you and talk and talk and you have absolutely no idea what he or she want to tell you. In the worst case they have a voice like spongebob. A teacher who is able to tell you something so clear that you understand it after hearing it once is much more useful than a teacher who knows his subject like a boss but does not know how to tell it right.

However, to know the subject you are talking about is important. But where is the goal of it when you do not know how to explain it. Everyone would like a less qualified teacher who is able to explain the things to you. The most important thing for a teacher is to see that his students understand what he is telling and not to show off with the speed he is going in the sections although the students understand nothing.
Furthermore, a student who knows there is a teacher who wants to explain it to you and the most important point, one who knows how to explain it to you, is much more willed to learn in class then one who just sits there and cannot wait till the class is over because the teacher talks permantly for 45 minutes. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the school - direction, to see which teacher does it good and who not. 
Probably, a teacher who permantly speaks also can have a good impact on the students. The students are challenged to get the stuff in their head and are forced to learn the subject outside of the school. But is this the right way?

In my opinion, the ability to relate well with students is much more important than a teacher who knows his subject like the ABC. Where is the profit for me when a teacher is good at his subject but me not? I think I speak for the most with my opinion.
