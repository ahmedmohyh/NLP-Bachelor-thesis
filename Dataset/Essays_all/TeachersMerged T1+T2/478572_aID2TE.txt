I think it is very important, that the relationship between a teacher and a student base on a good atmosphere. If i enter my classroom, and i know that i have an argue with the teacher, i am not as good as in a subject where i like the teacher. There are also marks wich depends on the teacher, for example the oral marks. I think I have a better mark in a subject when my relationship to the teacher is good, than in a subject, we hate eachother. It also makes more fun to lern a subject, the teacher relate well with the students. I can't manage these teachers wich just enter the classromm, make their lesson and left the room again. It is even much better, when the teacher talks and discuss with the students. Like this there can be create a good relationship.
On the other side, it is also very important to have good marks in a subject, doesn't matter if you like or hate the teacher. Even when you can't manage the personality of the teacher you should be calm and just concentrate on yourself and get good marks. Your life depends on the marks you have made in school. It souldnt depend on a bad teacher you have had. You can concentrade on these subjects you know the teachers are friendly and human. there you can try to manage a good mark. With this mark you maybe can compensate a bad mark in another subject you do not like teh teacher. Now it is the question, on which side you lay more weight. On good marks, but bad relationships with teachers, or good relationships and bad marks. Is it possible to have good marks and good relationships? I think it is possible.
