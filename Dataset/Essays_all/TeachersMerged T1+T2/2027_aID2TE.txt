Many people argue whether it is more important for a teacher to be able to relate well with students or to have excellent knowledge of his subject.
First, one can say that the most important thing of all is that the students learn enough to be well prepared for their later life.
To guarantee that, there must be a good student-teacher relation, since students learn more if they like the subject. Of course it also plays a role that the teacher knows enough about the subject he teaches, to be able to answer students' questions. It doesn't matter if the teacher does not know everything he knew while studying, as he is supposed to teach the subject on a relatively low level at school compared to university. Furthermore, a variation in how he does his lessons is most significant. There are many teachers, who are just at the front explaining something on the board. Students need varying methods, partner- and group work, for instance. If students do not feel comfortable with their teacher, chances are that they will not participate as good as they would in a lesson with their favorite teacher. Considering a teacher to be unfriendly, students may not dare to ask questions. 
In my opinion, excellent knowledge is not required for a teacher, though he must know enough to teach his students. Essential is their relation to the students and the variation in teaching, to guarantee that the students learn anything.
