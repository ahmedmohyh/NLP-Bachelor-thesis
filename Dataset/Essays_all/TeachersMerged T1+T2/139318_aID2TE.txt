An argument for this statement is that if teachers relate well with studetents, they like teachers more and as simply they like the subject automatically more. Teachers can teach students better if the like the subject because then they want to know something about it. If teachers have a good relation to students they like coming to your lessons. To have a teacher which is nice to students is import for interesst for the subject of the students. 
An argument not for the statement is when the teacher does not have exellent knowledge of the subject they must learn the knowledge. An exemple if somebody ask you something about the theme of the subject which you teach at the moment but you don't know more as you said then you feel eventually a bit embarrassing that you don't know the answer and an other student knows it. 
Personally I think it's really important to relate well with students as a teacher because it makes it easier but I think it is not more important than the exellent knowledge. Both things are really important. I think a good relation to students is more important in primari school as in high school because in hight school the most students doesn't like something at the teacher, it doesen't matter if it's the best teacher. I think in hight school it's more important to have an exellent knowledge. In primari school the teacher should have a good relation to the students because there is the knowledge not really important.
