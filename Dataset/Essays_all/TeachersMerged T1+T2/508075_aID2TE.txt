How has a perfect teacher to be? That is a very interesting question and it is not so easy to answer it, because teachers are not robots who every time decide the right thing and every time react in the same way. The aim of a teacher is that students learn more about the subject and can use their knowledge in the world out the school. So what is more important, a teacher who has a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or his ability to relate well with students?
An argument for his ability to relate well with students is that the students learn the basic things and because of the good relationship to the teacher they will ask if they have question. Even if they are shy, it is more likely that hey will ask. A good teacher makes his lessons interesting. It is known that learning things will become easier when you relate the things with emotions.
An argument that the knowledge of a teacher is more important that his ability to relate well with students is that he or she can answer every question and can offer his students a huge knowledge. He can answer all questions.
In my opinion it is more important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with his students. When the teacher doesn't have the knowledge anymore to answer a students's question, they can look it up together. I think a teacher with a big knowledge is also able to realte well with students. When they are really interested in the subject they teach, the lesson will be more interesting and the students have a better feeling when they go to class. So both factors are important, but in my opinion it is more important that a teacher is able to relate well with students. But if the ability to relate well with students would be more important than an excellent knowledge, I think people should also discuss about how it is possible to a teacher to relate well with his students. The interest of learning things and have a good relationship to the teacher has to come also from the students.
