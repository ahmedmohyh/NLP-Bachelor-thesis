Let us say you have a teacher and you like him very much and his lessons are very interesting because he is so funny and you think you could talk to him like to another student with no harm and he is nearly a friend to the whole class. But actually you do not learn anything in his lessons. It is interesting, but not because of the subject but because of him. Now let us say you have another teacher and you literally hate him. Every lesson you think you are in hell and he is just I do not know if I should write this here but I will do it now: he is an asshole. The only thing is that in no other lesson you learn as much as in his lesson. He knows so much of the topic and after every lesson your brain is filled with information.

Now the big question:

To which teacher would most students rather like to go? 

Most people would say the first. I think they are wright. Most students would of course say the first. But if you asked them a half year later again, there were probably many students who would say give us the second. I think it is good to have a nice teacher but it is more important that you learn something. The task of a teacher is to teach and not have a good relationship to his students. Of course it is nice if there is a good relationship between the two parties but the main task should not suffer under this: "looking for a good relationship to my students" thinking of the teacher. So I have to disagree with the statement on the top. It is important to have a good ability to relate with students but it is not more important than the knowledge.
