When a teacher relates well with students, the students are feeling comfortable and they like it to come to school and to learn something for their live. But Its also very important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge because he has to teach the class in math or something and for the teaching he must have a good knowledge. Without the knowledge our teacher cant make a good class with us. Perhaps he can shows us a film and we can take some news out of the film or can gives us a book to read but not more. The teacher cant give us the knowledge for our live if he hasnt the knowledge himself. If the teacher isnt very friendly to the class its for me not a big problem because we dont need his friendship for our live. The class has a lot of friends. They dont need the teacher as a friend. But if the teacher hasnt a good knowledge and cant expline something its a big problem i think because we have to know a lot of staff for our live. When we want to make money, we had to studying and for the studying we need a knowledge of our teacher. And this knowledge we get only if the teacher can expline the staff and not when our teacher is also our friend. With our teacher as our friend we cant make exames on the university. For that we need a good knowledge which the teacher should gives us.
So i am realy disagree with the statement that the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Thats my own opinion of the statement we get.
