According to the lecturer no memoir is a hundred percent accurate yet the memoir of Chevalier is a reliable source. In the lecture she addresses the concerns of the critics, one of them being that Chevalier,despite claiming to be considerably rich, aquired several loans from a Swiss merchant. However as mentioned in the lecture, it is argueable that,since wealth can be measured in more ways than solely cash, he borrowed money to buy himself time until he was able to liquidate his assets.
Another critic that the lecturer tries to debunk is the fact that Chevaliers description of the conversations he had with Voltaire were to accurate, especially considering that he wrote the memoir years later. In the lecture she argues that it's been documented that Chevalier was notorious for documenting his conversations in journals and he consulted them during the writing of the memoir.
The last event that is critizied in the memoir is the fact that Chevalier claims to have escaped from the prison in Venice by digging a hole in the ceiling and escaping through it. Critics believe that this event did not take place, instead they insist that he must have bribed his jailers in order to be let out. The lecturer however doubts this conspiracy since there were more powerful prisoners who were not able to bribe their way to freedom. Instead she insist that Chevalier did indeed escape through the roof and evidence for this event exsist since according to the prison logs they had to repair the ceiling shortly after Chevalier's alleged escape.
