First, you need to say that no memoir can be possibly correct. But in the case of the memoir from the Chevalier de Seingal are some indicators for the proof that the things actually really could happen the way he wrote it in his memoirs.
So the first statement, that he only needed to borrow money if he wasn`t rich, doesn`t need to be true. We know, that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling in Switzerland. So when he borrowed that money, it is also possible that he was just waiting for his own money to be transfered to Switzerland.
Critics also say that it is impossible, that the memoir captures the Chevalier`s conversations with Voltaire so accurately. But there had been witnesses who told, that he wrote down every night, what happened when he talked to Voltaire and what exactly the have talked about.
Critics also questionded the Chevalier`s escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. They say that it was more likely that the Chevalier`s jailers were bribed to free him, because the Chevaler had many powerful friends in Venice. But they forget, that there were other prisoners in there, who had even more powerful friends than Chevalier did. And there is even a proof, that after his escape, they had to repair the prison, so the statement in the memoir, that he espaced by making a hole in the ceiling, gets even more believable.
