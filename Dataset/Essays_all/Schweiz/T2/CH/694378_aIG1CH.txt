First of all the lecture states that no memoir can be correct, but that Chevaliers memoir can be seen as a reliable historical source. This statement is confirmed in the text above. It mentiones that the Chevaliers memoir has become a valuable historical source, because of this meetings with many famous people such as kings and writers.

The first point mentioned in the lecture is the Chevalier's loan from a Swiss merchant during his time in Switzerland. The article states that Chevalier was in fact poor and not rich at all, because of all of his borrowing of considerable amounts of money. The lecture does not back this argument brought up by critics. The lecture states that the reason for the borrowing actually lies where Chevalier happens to have this assets. The conversion of his assets took considerable amount of time, during which he then had to opt for loans to get by.

The second point that is brought up in the lecture is the conversations with Voltaire. Both sources agree that such conversation did in fact occur, though the article above argues that such capture of their conversation could not have had occured. In the lecture this argument is counterargued with the the fact that there are sources mentioning that Chevaliers referred to notes in his journal, which he took right after those conversations with Voltaire occured.

The third and last point mentioned in the lecture is Chevaliers escape from prison in Italy. The article argues that such escape could never have happened and it is in the memoir for pure enjoyment of the reader. In contrary the lecture argues that Chevalier did not have possibilities for bribery, as the article states. The lecturer believes that such escape did in fact happen and backs her opinion on evidence of a reparation of a ceiling in that same Venetian prison in Italy.
