The written text isprobably written by a critic or someone who hates this Chevalier because he tried to let Chevalier look bad with his statements. The first point is the wealth of Chevalier. In the presentation they said that he was wealthy but often had to wait for his money to arrive while the writer writes that Chevalier has to be poor if he lends money. The person in the presentation stated that Chevalier was wealthy and while he waited for his money he lend money to go to a party or something. The second point is the discussion with Voltaire. The writer says that this discussion is lost and that they had a conversation but that we nowcan't know about what. The speaker in the record said that Chevalier took notes of the whole discussion and hence we know pretty much the exact discussion. The thrid point is about the prison in which Chevalier was. He escaped through a self-made hole in the ceiling the legend says. Now the more critical text says that it was probably bribary that let him escaped which is  probable because of his wealth. On the other side the speaker said that there were people that had more money than Chevalier and they couldn't escape. And also there was a actually a hole in the ceiling which had to be repaired. These two points indicate that the story is true.
