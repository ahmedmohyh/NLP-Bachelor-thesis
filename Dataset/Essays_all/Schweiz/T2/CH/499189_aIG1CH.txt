There are many reasons, why it should be claimed as a invented story and not as the truth. That Chevalier had a great life with lots of exciting and glamorous moments could of course be true. But there are a fiew phrases which could be seen as a lie. That Chevalier lived in Switzerland and borrowed money is something you could look up, but why he borrowed money could have many reasons. Chevalier should be rich, but the text claims it as a lie with the argument that, when he would be rich, he wouldn't have to borrow money. In the presentation they are more sceptical with this argument. They explain why it could be true, that Chevalier was rich. The Swiss merchant has other funktions, so even though you are rich, you still could borrow money. There are no rules of not borrowing money from the bank when you are rich. So obiesly it could be true. There are also doupts about the story which is written with alot of details. The text claims that the whole story is a lie, because it supposed to happen in the past. But in the presentation they are explaining that a lot actions are written then. So its wright tthat not everything could be true, but there is a possibility, that some actions are ture which are claimed to be actualy wrong.
