Chevalier de Seingalt wasn't a poor man during his time in Switzerland. Even if he had borrowed money from a merchant, it only was because of his job. He often spent money and after that he had to wait a few days to get even more back. During this time periode, he borrowed money from the merchant to get over the time having no money. He spent a lot of money in Switzerland and a poor man couldn't do that.
Chevalier and Voltaire often spoke together, and after every conversation Chevalier sat down and wrote the exact conversation or a summary in his notebook. Because of that, he could write exact memoires whith exact phrases from the conversations. The critics don't believe that, but it's a fact, that he used diarys and notebooks to write his memoires.
The fact that there were other prisonniers which had even higher political friends in venice, says that he had to break out. The other fact, that the had to repair the ceiling of his cell just after he broke out, proves that. Critics have no facts to prove that he didn't break out, they just think it's not likely. Why should they repair the ceiling if he got out just because someone offered a bribe?
