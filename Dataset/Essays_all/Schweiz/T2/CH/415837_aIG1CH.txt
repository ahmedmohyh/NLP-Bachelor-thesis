The reliability and accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier is discussed. That book is very valuable because it has insight on the society in the historic Europe. The lecturer says that his memoir is pretty accurate and that you can rely on it, while the text doubts that. It comments on his wealth: They doubt him being rich because it is known that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But in the lecture it is explained that he had owned a lot of propriety, that had to be sold first in order to have physical money. So while Chevalier was waiting for his money he had to borrow some. So in fact he was not at all poor. Another critical point is the detailed conversation with Voltaire. It is claimed that it cannot be accurate regarding the precise details. But the expert explains that Chevalier wrote down every part of the conversation he could remember right after it happened. He kept those notes in order to use them in his memoir. He also collected newspapers so hecould remember all the significant events. Critics also doubt the legendary escape from a prison in Venice. But Chevaliers reliability can be supported by old government documents. It is proven that the prison had to get their ceiling fixed shortly after Chevalier escaped through the roof. All in all, detailed research can turn those critical doubts down.
