The text tells us the story and memoris of the Chevalier. IN the text is also written that some critics claim about his memoris. They critic all his memoris becaus they can't be true. In the presentation the woman shows us the opposit. She tells aout why his memoris can be true and how you can ceap a lot of memoris in your mind. The first point she tells us is that a Chevalier does have a lot of money. The problem is that at the begining he needs to borrow some befor he can make/get  money. That he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant doesn't mean he is poor he just needed some money for the start. The seconde point she told us about was the conversation whit the famous writer Voltaire. The critics are skeptial about how he could remeber all the phrases of the conversation, because it was written many years after the conversation occurred. The woman said that he wrote down some notes of the conversation every evening. After some years he used this notes to write the conversation exactly. The theert thing the woman said was that it could be that he escaped the Venetian prison by using a piec of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. She said that after the Chevealier escaped they hat to repare the ceiling, so that means that it has been destroied befor.
