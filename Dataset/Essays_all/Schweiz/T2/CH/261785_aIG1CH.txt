Accuracy of memories

Chevalier de Seingalt had a very full and interesting, at least he claimed to have had in the book he wrote shortly before his death in 1798. Many historians doubt many facts Chevalier wrote down. 

For example he wrote that while he was living in Switzerland he had a lot of money and was very wealthy. Critics oppose this claim because they recently found evidence that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss mergant which he wouldn't have needed to if he was that wealthy. In the presentation with the woman talking, which was secure about his accuracy said that this didn't mean that he lied but that he sold property to gain money and get wealth. She claims that at this particular moment Chevalier had to wait for money and borrow some from the mergant. 

In another point the Chevalier wrote that he escaped from prison in Venice, Italy. By using of a piece of metal he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped into freedom by climbing through that hole in the roof. The critics claim that this isn't the truth, that he had high friends in a political position and came free by the help of these connections. The opposition said that there were many others in prison who had also friends in a political position and they would have done the same. Another evidence is that the roof had to be repaid
