The big question that comes up is: Are the memoires of Chevalier correct?
The text claims it isn't, in first place with the passage about Chevaliers richdom in switzerland, but in real he rented money. The lecturer says on the other hand he borrowed just money in the begingin to make his memoirs famous. So he was rich in the end. 
An other point which is critisised by the text are the conversations with Voltaire. The text claims they were written down years later, the women in the presentation said on the other hand he made notes just afterwards. Which of them is correct you don't know, but you can't say they are completly lies. But as you hear in the presentation memoirs are never 100% accurate. So some little things in the talks may be invented. 
The third point is the escape from the notorious prison in Venice. Critics in the text make the point that a prison escape is interesting and enjoys the reader what was the only reason he wrote it. The presentator on the other hand claims that in the venician council books you can read that they had to repair a roof at this time in the notorius prison. Which can be a proof for the escape but it could also have been something else to damage the roof like natural destruction. So it is not clear from both sides if it is accurate or not.
