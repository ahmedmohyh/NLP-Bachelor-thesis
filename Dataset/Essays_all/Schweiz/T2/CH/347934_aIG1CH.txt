In the presentation of Chevalier, we get to know, that Chevaliers memoir is based on reliable notes he had taken of those conversations and experiences, he tells us about. So we can rely on what he writes, unless he has faked his notes too. In the particualar example of his lifestyle in Switzerland, the text says, that Chevalier wasn't as wealthy as he told us, because of some loans he's taken, whereas in the presentation it's said, that he was wealthy and that he just sometimes hadn't got direct access to cash. Furthermore the text says that Chevalier couldn't remember every phrase of the conversations he had with voltaire, whereas the girl of the presentation assures us, that Chevalier always took notes of his conversations, which he later used to write his memoir.
About the prsion escape, the text says, that the way Chevalier escaped from prison wasn't as dramatic as he wrote it. They say that he probably just bribed the guards to get out of prison and invented the story, where he breaks out of the ceiling, just to make his escape more exciting and heoric. However in the presentation it's said, that shortly after Chevaliers escape, the prison had to repair the ceiling of Chevaliers cell. The girl presenting asks herself, why they would repair the ceiling if it wasn't for his escape out of it. Moreover she says that no one ever got out of this prison by bribing the guards.
