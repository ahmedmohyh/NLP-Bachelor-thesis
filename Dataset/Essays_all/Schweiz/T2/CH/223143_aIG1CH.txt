The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life. Like in many memoirs there are maybe some invented events to make his life seem more exciting.
The first event critics claim about is the fact that he was rich. The say that borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant and that he wasn't that rich, as he wrote in his memoir. An reason why he could have borrowed money is, that he spend a great amount of money on parites and gambling. In the audiofile they explained that the reason why could have borrowed the money was not because he was poor. It was because he made some deals and he had to wait for his money because it took quite long untill he received it. In this time he had to borrow some money untill his own money arrived. But this does not mean that he was poor.
The second point critics are skeptical about is the accuracy of the conversations the Chevalier and the famous writer Volaire had and that he impossibly could remember the exact phrases. The reason why he could have remembered those conversation is, that he made many notes and read them many times before he wrote his memoir.
The last point that is questioned by critics is the fact that he escaped from a prison in Venice. They say that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. In the audiofile was mentioned that after the escape of the Chevalier they had to repair the room where he was held. And if nothing was broken in there, why would they have had to repair it?
