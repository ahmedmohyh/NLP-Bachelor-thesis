The text talks about why the memoir writtene by the Chevalier cannot be correct. It mentions three reasons:
Firstly, the Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he was rich and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, but we know today that he often borrowed money from a Swiss merchand. If he was so rich, why did he have to borrow money?
Secondly, he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. Critics say that he could not possibly remember what exactly he or Voltaire said several years ago.
And lastly, The chevalier claimed to have escaped prison by piercing a hole in the ceiling using a piece of metal. However, since he had a lot of politically well-connected friends, it would be more likely that he just bribed the jailers.
The presentation admits that memoirs can't possibly be entirely accurate, yet it talks about why the memoire of the Chevalier is still somewhat correct.
It is said that even though the Chevalier borrows money, he can still be rich. His wealth is not just money, but rather property which he has to sell first. So when he sells his property, it will take a few days until he recieves the money, and since he spspent so much money on parties, it makes sense that he has to borrow money now and then while waiting for his payment to arrive.
About the conversation with Voltaire, we know today that he would write about their conversations in the evening and, of course, kept what he had written. Today it is confirmed that he later used those notes for writing his memoire.
For his imprisonment, we know that other jailed persons never managed to bribe their jailers, even if they had more powerful friends. Another rather convincing piece of information is that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he escaped prison, which was of course likely to happen if he pierced it.
