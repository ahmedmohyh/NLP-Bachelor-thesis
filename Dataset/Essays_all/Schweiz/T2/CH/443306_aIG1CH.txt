Both sources, the text and the audio, actually share the same opinion of Chevalier's memoir being a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. But in one point, they don't have the same opinion: Is Chevalier's memoir reliable?

The text says the memoir isn't pretty reliable during the the audio tells us that it's pretty detailed, accurate and therefore reliable. The critics in the text mentioned three unreliable facts about Chevalier and the audio explained for all of them, that they actually have to be true:

Chevalier wasn't poor just because he borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant. He had to sell first to get money. As soon as he ran out of money, he borrowed some more waiting for his own money to arrive.
The audio also mentions Chevalier's conversations with Voltaire. Each night after he talked to Voltaire, he wrote everything as good as possible down. He kept those notes for many years and could therefore refer to them while writing his memoir. Other people, who lived with him, could confirm that.
Also his escape from prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling has to be true. Other prisoners had even stronger friends than Chevalier and weren't able to escape. It also could be confirmed from old government notes that the ceiling had to be repared.
