At the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his adventures life. But now some critics have raised doubt about the accuracy of the memoir. In this text I will discuss some of these crtics and also what is sayed in order to defend the memoir of the Chevalier.

The first critic is about his life in Switzerland which according to his memoir was very glamourus because he was very rich. However, recently one has found out that he had to borrow huge amounts of money. According to the listening this fact is not true. The Chevalier was not poor, he just had that kind of property you first have to sell.

Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of his conversation with Voltaire. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember such exact phrases from a past conversation. But also for this fact there is a explenation. The Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember on the next day. These notes he used later for his memoir.

Another critic is also that the Chevalier claimed in his memoir that he have escaped the prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. According to critics it is much more propable that a friend of him offered him a bribe. However, in the listening is mentioned that other prisoners had even more influenceful friends and soon after his esape a ceiling had to be repaired.
