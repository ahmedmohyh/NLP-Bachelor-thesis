In the listening before I heard that Mr. Chevalier escaped alone without his jailers. I think that is nearly impossible. Some of the colleagues in prison had to influent him on the desicion to leave the  prison. In both parts, the reading and the listening, it was ment that Chevalier had a great time in Switzerland. But in the reading I can read that he was wealty and in the Listening the woman said that he always hat to borrow money because his own money wasn't arriving. The problem in this text is that I don't know what the word "memoir" is. In the Listening I heard that Mr. Chevalier always wrote down his conversations he had the day after. In the text are  doubters who think that his news aren't relieable because he worte the conversations many years after. This two facts confuse me.
I am asking myself why this guy was in prison. Did he rob sth or what was the reason. The argument that Chevallier invented alternative facts to make his life more exiting make me smile. If I lived in this century I would have also invited alternative fact just to confuse the following generations. haha :) How many policeofficers does it need to change a lightbulb? 10, one is changing the bulb and the others nine are shooting at the darkness because it's black. I just want to make my reader laugh. (Sorry for this bad joke)
Btw do you think this "MEWS"-thing is usefule? I have some doubts about that...
