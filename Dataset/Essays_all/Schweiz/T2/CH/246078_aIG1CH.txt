The Chevalier is a very significant figure for historians. He lived in the 18th century and wrote a memoire about his life and adventures. There were three topics disussed in the text and presentation: his time in Switzerland, a converation with Voltaire and a prison escape in Venice. The text mainly disagrees with chevalier's credibility. In his memoir, Chevalier mentioned his richness in Switzerland, though historians have proven that he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. The lady speaking in the presentation explained that Chevalier was rich in deed but he had to borrow money while he was waiting to receive the money from his sold properties. Another event discussed was a conversation with Voltaire. A lot of people doubt that a human is able to write down a conversation that he has had several years ago. The presentator though said that Chevalier noted down the conversation the same night. Friends of chevalier have also mentioned that he always used notes while writing his memoir. The last event mentioned was an escape from a prison in Venice. Many believe that CHevalier's jailer was bribed, so that CHevalier could leave the prison but the presentator thinks that this is not true because a document found in the archives of Venice prove that the roof had to be repared after Chevalier had left the prison.
