The presentation responds to the critics made in the text about the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir. The speaker defends three main parts of his story.

Firstly, other than in the text she claims that Chevalier certainly wasn't poor. He just spent his money on parties and gambling. Only in order to convert assets into money he had to borrow money from merchants.
Secondly, the speaker defends the writings about the conversations with Voltaire. It is said that Chevailier took notes of the conversations on the very same day, so he could remember everything. When he wrote his memoir he often consulted his notes, which means the conversations in the book are very accurate.
Finally, critics don't believe his escape from the prison was real. They think bribery was involved. However the speaker says that other prisoner had friends with more influence than Chevalier's friends and they still weren't bribed free. Additionally, it is said that the ceiling had to be repaired shortly after his escape.


To conclude the speaker thinks the memoir is pretty accurate, especially compared to other memoirs. The critics in the text believe many stories are invented, but she tries to prove them wrong with her presentation.
