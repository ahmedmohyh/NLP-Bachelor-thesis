Chevalier was a very controversal person. While some critics say, that important parts of his memoir are just made up, others say everything is true. There are some key arguments that are discussed in the text and the lecture.

First, the text says that Chevalier wasn't that rich because he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. However the  woman giving the lecture explains, that Chevalier had to borrow money for short periods of time to stay liquid. Most of his money was bound to objects and he had to sell them first to be liquid. That took time and during that time he took some loans.

Second, the text states, that it is impossible for Chevalier to remember exact phrases from conversations held with Voltaire several years earlier. But the woman says, that Chevalier just simply took notes in the evening after the conversation and kept these notes for all the years until he wrote his memoirs.

The last arguement from the text was, that it is more likely for Chevalier to bribe the jailers to free him instead of making a hole in the ceiling using a piece of metal. On the other hand the woman saw some documents that proof, that the ceiling of the cell from Chevalier had to be repaired. Furthermore there were more powerful people imprisoned during the time of Chevalier and none of these people were able to bribe their way out of the prison.
