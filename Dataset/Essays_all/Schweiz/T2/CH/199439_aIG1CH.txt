In this short essay I will talk about the accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt. Who wrote a memoir recouting his life and adventures. In the follwing parts. I will pick up the arguments the text and the audio file talked about.

The first topic is the overall accuracy of his texts.Critics say that Chevailer made himself look better in his storys. The others who fully believe in his storys say that his text are accurate and reliable.

So after this first little indtroduction point we get to a first really controversial discussed point of his recountning. He wrote that he was rich and wealthy. However today we know that as he lived in switzerland he had to borrow money for his lifestyle (gambling...). Thats exactly the argument critics have to think that his explanaintions of this way of life are a lie. Somehow the critics forgot that Chevailer had his money invested in things that need their time to get sold.

Chevailer met many rich and famous people in his life like Voltair. Chevailer wrote about a conversation he had with this mister. But he wrote it down sevral years after this conversation. This lets us think twice about the truthness  level hiss tory has. People who believehim said that he made notes a the day of this particullar conversation and with the help of those he wrote about it.

Last but not least we have his explanaition about his pirsion break. He wrotethat he escaped his prison in a very interesting way. Critic think that  this is clearly a lie because hee had many important frinds that have helped him get out.
