Chevalier de Saingalts memoires are probably one of the most known but also one of the most doubted of the whole 18th century.

First of all, his memoires are full with glamour and luxury. There are splitted views wether he was was poor or rich. Of course he gambled for a long time in Switzerland and had a life full of parties, while he was a person, who first had to sell something, until the money came in cash. So it is not wondering, that he first had to take credits from others while he waited. But right this point leds the author of the text to a doubt of his wealth.

Another thing the text tries to figure out are Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire. Of course it is easy to say, that it is absolutely impossible to write down the exact words of the conversation many years after, but as heard in the audio, vitnesses confirmed, that he had written down every word every single night.

The last point was his escpae out of the venetian prison. Although his memoires tell about an escpape through a grabbed hole in the ceiling and the fact, that the ceiling had to be repaired after his flee, criticer like the author of the text believe in fake and saw the larger possibility in getting bribed out by some influencable politicians. 

In conclusion, this two views show absolutely different situations about the life of Chavelier - and we would probably never know the truth.
