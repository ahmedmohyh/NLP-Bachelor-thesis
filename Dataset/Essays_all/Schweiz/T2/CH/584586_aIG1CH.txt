It's actually true what the chevalier told, he was very rich and very bold
he doesn't just talk shit, so listen to my explanation and take a sit
He had to borrow money when he went to switzerland, because he didn't have that amount of money in his hand
It actually takes time to deliver it, but Chevie's still rich and immensively rich
He also talked to the writer Voltaire, that's true, the prove is that he wrote notes in books that were blue
The prison escape was also a real story, Chevie escaped through the roof and didn't even worry
Chevie wasn't afraid and had muscles out of steel, the stories abot him are actually real.
