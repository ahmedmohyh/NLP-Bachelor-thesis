Both the text and the lecture talk about Chevaliers memoire, which until today still acts as a important source for understanding European society in the eighteenth century. While the text focuses more on the inaccuracy one might find in the document, the lecture tries to unravel the "misunderstandings" and speaks against the claims and accusations in the text.

For example about Chevaliers wealth while living in Switzerland: Chevalier was believed to be wealthy but it is historically proven that he borrowed huge amounts of money from a Swiss merchant. It was known though that he came to his fortune due to gambling. Therefore he often had to invest money in order to multiply it in the end, which might have lead to temporare poverty, before becoming wealthy again.

The other part of Chevaliers story the text claims to be inaccurate is the conversation between him and the famous writer Voltaire. The writer of the text mentiones that details of conversations can never quite be kept in memory one hundre precent accurate and since the memoire was written years later many elements might simply be made up. Again it is proven though that Chevalier wrote down the conversation just the night after it happened. He often refered and consulted notes while writing anyway.

Another point the writer of the text makes is about the story of Chevaliers epic escape through the ceiling. It simply seems impossible and overexagerated. From documents it is known though that the ceiling of that exact prison had to be repaired shortly after. Also the statement that he might have used brivary to make his escape is highly unlikely. Brivary hardly ever worked back then and therefore is even more unlikely than his unique way to escape.

Whether the memoire strives accuracy or not will probably never be proven with certainty. It lies in the eye of the beholder to decide whether they believe it's true or not.
