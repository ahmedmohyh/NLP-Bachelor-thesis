In the text it is said that the Chevalier was poor, although he mentioned in his memoir that he was quite wealthy. In the presentation they speak about the same point. But they say he wasn't poor, he just had to wait for his money to arrive.
Another point they refer to in the presentation was the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire. They mentioned that the Chevalier took notes while he had these conversations with Voltaire and he used them while writing his memoir. The presentator said that this conversations are quite accurate. On the other hand the text said the narrated conversations aren't accurate, because the memoir was written years after the real conversations.
The next point which was criticised in the text, was his escape from the prison in Venice. From the view of the text, such a story is really interesting to read, but it wouldn't happen in real life. The presentator said, they had to repair the ceiling afterwards. And why should they repair the ceiling if he hadn't escaped through the ceiling.
In conclusion, you can say that the text is full of criticism, while the presentator defended the Chevalier and said that the memoir is quite accurate.
