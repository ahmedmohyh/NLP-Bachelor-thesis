First of all, when the Chevalier claimed to be wealthy in Switzerland, he wasn't lying. But since his wealth was in form of properties which he had to sell first, it took a few days for the money to arrive. So he did take loans, but he paied them back just a few days later with his own money. When he ran put of money he had to borrow it so he could get it immediately, but he possessed a lot of things with a high worth as well. 

Second, his conversations with Voltaire might not be 100% accurate, but they sure aren't just made up as well. Witnesses who knew the Chevalier confirmed that he often used notes, some of which he took every night, after every conversation with Voltaire. So even if not every word may be correct, the conversations also aren't just a thing he imagined. 

Lastly the escape from the Venetian prison. There are records that in that exact prison, there were other criminals with way more powerful friends than the Chevalier, but none of them were ever able to bribe the authorities, so why should the Chevalier have been? Additionally, there exists an old Venetian document which says that shortly after the Chevaliers escape, the ceiling of his room had to be repaired. This indicates that he really escaped through a hole in the ceiling. 

These three points should be enough evidence to prove that the Chevaliers memoir isn't just a fake, but very much real and a reliable historical source for European society in the 18th century.
