The Chevalier de Seingalt was a figure living in the 18th century who knew many influential people and polititians. In his last years he wrote a memoir about his life which got many critics about the reliability, especially because some of the stories told were quite unrealistic.
Chandelier wrote he was a very wealthy person and lived in switzerland but nowadays we know he has spent great deals of money in gambling and parties. Today we know he had to borrow a lot of money. That means he could not have been rich. The argument against it is that he actually was very wealthy, but not money-wise but he owned many things he could sell. Since selling his belongings takes a while he had to borrow the money first.
Critics also do not believe the chevalier could have remembered every conversation with the famous writer voltaire word by word many years later when writing the book. Chevalier though was known making a lot of notes every evening. The saame he did with the conversations with voltaire. He wrote down all the conversations they had together every night.
His prison escape in venice also is a controversial topic. Critics do not believe that he escaped the prison in venice just by using a metal bar and making a hole in the ceiling. They say he could have been offered a bride by one of his influential friends. But in that prison there were prisoners with much higher friends and they could not break free eighter. Also records say that after the escape the ceiling of his room had to be fixed.
