The first argument the lecturer pointed out was that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt are a reliable historical source with what she confirms the text at the top. 

Secondly what is told by the woman in the audio as well as written in the text is the fact that de Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. But in contrast to the text according to her opinion the reason that Chevalier had borrowed money was not his lack of it but that he had to wait until he would get his own, so he should not be considered as poor.

Whereas critics are skeptical about the fact that the conversations of Chevalier and Voltaire being accurate, the lecturer is sure about it as she claims that there is evidence that every evening Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember of conversations he lead and that he made use of this notes while composing his memoir. 

As a last argument the speaker makes clear that it could not have been bribery of what Chevalier made use to escape the prison in venice. She is so sure about that because in the same prison there should have been other men with much more connections and they could not escape and additionally the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired and this fact she takes as a evidence that Chevalier has left the prison through it.
