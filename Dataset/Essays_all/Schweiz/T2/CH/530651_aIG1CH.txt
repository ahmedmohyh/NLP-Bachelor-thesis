The presentation says, that no memoir is perfect. But the speaker has arguments why the critics are wrong. 
The first one is about the loan of money. The text says, that rhich people do not have to borrow money. But the speaker says, theat at this time, you needed money to invest, so you could earn even more money. And that does not mean that the Chevalier was poor. 
Another argument was about the conversations with Voltaire. The speaker told us, that Chavalier always wrote everything down, after he talked to Voltaire. But the text says, that he wrote it down years later, when he made his memoir recounting his life and adventures. 
The speaker's last argument was about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. She says that it is true that he has had some politically well- connected friends in Venice, but she also says that there were other prisoners which had more powerfull friends outthere. Another point is the fact, that they had to repair the roof after his escape and why would they have had to do so, if the story about the Chavallier's escape was not true?
