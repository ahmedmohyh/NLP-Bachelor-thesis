The presentation talks about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt. He wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. It says, that this text is one of the most importan historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. But no memoir can be correct, they have to be some faults in it. 
After reading the text about him we knew that Chevalier spent much money on parties and gambling in Switzerland. But after he lost his fortune, he had to borrow money from others. Many people says that he was poor, but the real fact is, that he lived a life which depended on the much money he once had. 
The second part of the presentation talks about the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. In the memoir from Chevalier he wrote about everything he knew about this converstation. In the presentation we learn that Chevalier could remember many things about this conversation many weeks after it. So it could be true, that this part of his memoir really happend.
The last point of the presentation was about the escape from the Venetian prison. The text above says that he had a number of politically well-connected friends who helped him. But actually we learned that he had a few good and powerful friends, but other ones from the prison had much more powerful help. The fact that he could escape the prison has onely one true storie behind. After he broke out, they had to repair the ceiling of his room. So maybethe escape really happend. The presentation tells us another truth as the text above. We will never know if the first one or the second one is true.
