The lecturer claims that the Chevalier indeed had a life as exciting and glamorous as he described. The first controversy comes up when the passage writes about how he was not as wealthy as he wrote. The lecturer on the other hand is convinced that the Chevalier actually was very rich. She said he did in fact spend so much money and explained that earning as much money as he needs does take its time. To get that money fast enough in order to be able to many parties it is not that unusual to borrow some. Just because he borrowed money he is by far not poor yet. 

The second controversy occurs when talking about his escape from the prison. The lecturer said that other prisoners had far more well-connected friends than the Chevalier had and that they still were not able to escape. Another proof for him really escaping prison was that the sealing of his prison cell needed to be repaired. If he did not escape prison, there would be no need to repair it.
