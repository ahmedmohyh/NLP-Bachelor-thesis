The memoir of the Chevaier de Seingalt is actually a pretty reliable one. 
It sais that the Cevalier was very rich and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, but then it also sais he had to borrow money. At first this seems odd but when one thinks about it one realises that he could have had to wait for his money to arrive and until then he needed some money, so he borrowed it. 
The next thing that seems to be a lie in the memoir is that the Chevalier met Voltaire and had exactly the conversations the Chevalier claimed they had. Critics say that the discussions were written down many years after Voltaire and the Chevalier have had the discussion , so it can't be true because no person remembers a discussion from many years that well. Right? Well in the presentation is said that after every meet with Voltaire, the Chevalier wrote notes about the things they discussed, so it would actually be logical that he could have looked those notes years after he met Voltaire and write the discussion down more carefully. 
The third and last example, from the critics, that the memoir of the Chevalier has some false facts in it, is that the Chevalier claims he escaped the prison in Venice by using a piece of metal and making a hole in the ceiling and then climbing up on the roof. Critis say that this is very unlikely and it would make more sense that powerful friend of the Chevalier organized a bribe to get him free. In the presentation i said that maybe the escape story wasn't a lie because facts show that other inmates of the prison had way more powerful friend than the Chevalier and could't get free. Also in the presentation it said that after the Chevalier escaped the prison the ceiling in his cell had to be repared, so the story would actually make sense.
