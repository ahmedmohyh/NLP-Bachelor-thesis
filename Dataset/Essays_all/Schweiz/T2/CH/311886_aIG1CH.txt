The text says that there are several inaccuracies in the memoir, however, the presentation proves that these inaccuracies are indeed true. For example, the text says that the Chevalier had to borrow money and therefore he couldn't have been rich while the lecturer says that this doesn't necessarily imply that he was poor.
The critics mentioned in the text also don't believe that the conversations between him and Voltaire are accurately represented in his memoir because it was written after a long time had passed since the conversations. However, the lecturer says that the Chevalier wrote a lot of notes and journals throughout his life in which he also documented the converations. 
Another exapmle is the fact that he escaped from a prison in Venice, Italy. The critics think that it was rather unlikely and that he probably bribed with one of his politically well-connected friends, but the lecturer says that there were many other prisoners with even more connections than hm who couldn't get out of there with a bribe and that this wasn't a possibility. Instead, she says that they were repairing the ceiling at the time in the prison which explains how he could have escaped.
