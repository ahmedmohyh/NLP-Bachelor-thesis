The memoirs of the controversial Chevalier de Seingault are a frequent topic of history buffs and historians. Not just because they reveal a great amount of society and life in the 18th century, but also because their accuracy is questioned and debated about.
The first point treats the claimed wealth of the Chevalier. Some argue that he could not have been wealthy, because he frequently loaned substantual amounts of money. Others say that the Chevaliers profession was dealing with assets, and that he had to wait for their conversion into money. Meanwhile, he would loan money.

The second point is about is relationship with the writer Voltaire. Critics say that after years, a cnoversation can not be fully reproduced, not even by the Chevalier, but said man wrote down in his memoirs whole conversations with his friend Voltaire. Apparently though after every chat, the chevalier would have written down every detail he could remember, or so witnesses confirmed.

The last controversial point is about the Chevaliers' famous escape from a Venetian prison. Critics claim that he did not escape all by himself but bribed his way out of prison. Others say that even more influential people in said prison could not bribe their way into freedom, so the Chevailer could not have done it. The existence of a document that indicates the reparation of the ceiling after his escape is coherent with his story, in which he describes breaking out by making a hole in the ceiling and then climbing on the roof into freedom.
