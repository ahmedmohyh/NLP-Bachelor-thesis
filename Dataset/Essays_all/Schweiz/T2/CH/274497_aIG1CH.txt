The woman said that many people say that there is no memory which is correct in every detail. Although his memoir, like given in the text, is a valuable historical source about European society. She says that there are some points to disagree in each of the 3 paragraphs.

About the first paragraph she announces that Chevalier was working to earn the sums of money he spent for parties and his wealthy life in Switzerland and that he did not borrow it.

About the second paragraph she says that these  are memories from a long time ago but, not as it is written in the text, he made notes while having or after having the conversations. So in the end he could summarise all the points he wrote down in his memoir.

About the third paragraph she is asking herself why exactly Chevalier should have escaped the prison even though there were many people in the prison with much stronger friends. So the chances of them to escape seem bigger than them of him. Also she explains that the ceiling had been repaired after his escape. So she asks why the ceiling was only repaired although he escaped.
