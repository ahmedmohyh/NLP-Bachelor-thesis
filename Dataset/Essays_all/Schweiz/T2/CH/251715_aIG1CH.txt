Both the text passage and the lecture are about the accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalts memoir. But while the text passage is more critical of the memoir the lecturer seems very convinced that the events Chevalier recounts took place ecxactly how he describes them. 
It says in the text that since Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant he could not have been as wealthy as he claimed. The lecturer on the other hand says that he could have had to borrow money not because he lost it all but because he had to wait for his money to arrive from his assets. 
The text also doubts that Chevalier could have remembered all his talks he had with Voltaire since he wrote the memoir years after the encounters. The lecturer explains that Chevalier was known for writing down every conversation he had with Voltaire the day it hapenend and so he did not have to remember every single detail. 
The last event the text is crtical about is Chevaliers escape from prison. It says in the text that it is much more likely that Chevalier bribed someone rather than escaped the adventurous way he claims he did. The lecturer also takes up that point and says that it is very unlikely that he bribed someone since there were prisoners with a lot more connections than him who did not manage to escape either. She also recalls that shortly after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling in his former cell had to be fixed and the only logical explanation would be that he actually did manage to make a hole in the ceiling.
