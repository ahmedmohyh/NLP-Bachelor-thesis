Many critics today question the accuracy of the memoires of the Chevalier de Seingalt. They say that he may have met all these famous people but at the moment when he wrote his memoires he won't have known about those conversations so accurately. But the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote in his memoires that he wrote everything of a conversation down at home. He also says that he used those notes and newspapers very frequently when writing his memoires. 

According to critics, the Chevalier made his life a lot more exciting than it really was. They for example say that the Chevalier wasn't really wealthy when he lived in Switzerland because he borrowed some money from a swiss merchant. But actually, the Chevalier just borrowed some money when he was waiting for his own to come in again. 

The third point critics mention is that the Chevalier escaped from prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. They think this isn't realistic because the Chevalier knew lots of people who had much influence in Venice and it would make more sence if he just has been freed by them. The point is that there were lots of other people in this prison which knew even more people with more influence but they weren't freed neither. Aditionally, there is proof that the ceiling of the cell of the Chevalier was to be repaired after the Chevalier had left.
