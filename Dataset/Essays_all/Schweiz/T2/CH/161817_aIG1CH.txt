Some critics say that in the memoir of the Chevalier there are inventions to make his life seem more exciting and glamourous. For example that he were not rich because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, or thant the conversations were so detailed even if the conversations took place many years ago. An other critic point is that he have had to escape from the prison instead of using his well-connected friends to get out.
In the listening it was mentioned that to borrow money from merchants was really normal in the eighteenth century. It has not the mean that only poor people have borrowed money because also the rich people have done it. The reason is that they have done really enormous party that were obviously very expensive after that he has to wait about that the money he earned cam in, so the most people borrowd money. 
The secnd argument is that that the Chevalier has writted down everything he had know after having the conversations. But not only after the conversations but also after some other event and important things he had pass, he made some notes of it and keept it for really long time. This notes helped him to write his memoir so exactlly.
The other point is that he had to escape from the prison. In the prison there were even persons which were more important and have had more influence than the Chevalier. And tey were not able to get out with theit well-connected friends. And as the Chevalier escaped the prison have had to repair the hole that the Chevalier have done to escape from the prison.
