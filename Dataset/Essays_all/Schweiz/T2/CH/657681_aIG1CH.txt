The Chevalier wrote a memoir recounting his life. Many critics had doubts about the accuracy of this memoir. It is true that no memoir can be 100% correct, but there are a lot of evidences that this one is reliable. 

The first aspect that was critisized was, that the Chevalier was not wealthy in Switzerland because he borrowed a lot of money. But it did not mean that he was poor, he just needed money when he had to wait of his own. 

The second point was that he could not have remembered exact phrases of the conversation between Voltaire and himself, because this would be to long ago to capture everything in his memoir. But the Chevalier wrote some notes, which he kept until his death. 

The last aspect was, that they said, that the Chevalier could not be escaped out of the prison in Venice without the help of some well-connected friends. But other people who were captured in the prison had more famous friends and could not escape. The real reason why he could escape written in the Venice documents. It was because the sailings had to be repared.
