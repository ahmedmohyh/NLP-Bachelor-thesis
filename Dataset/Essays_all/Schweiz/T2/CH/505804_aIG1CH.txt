Chevalier claimed to be rather wealthy while living in Switzerland. Many critcis have their doubts since he borrowed huge amounts of money from a Swiss merchant. This fact doesn't mean that Chevalier was poor though. He was very wealthy in terms of assets and properties. Since he had to pay back his debts he borrowed money while waiting for these assets to be liquified into cash. 
Another point made by critics, is the fact that his memoirs about the conversations with Voltaire couldn't be really accurate since Chevalier wrote his memoirs years after they had conversed. In fact, he took notes after their talk writing down everything he could remember from their meeting. Those notes were a big help and his main source while writing his memoirs. 
Last but not least the critics questioned the story about the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. They claim that he didn't really escape from the prison by making a hole and climbing through the ceiling but bribing his way out of there. While Chevalier had some friends which were politically well-connected other prisoners were far more influential than him. Since none of them were able to get out of prison the story about the escape through the ceiling is more credible especially since the roof of his cell needed to be fixed after he left.
