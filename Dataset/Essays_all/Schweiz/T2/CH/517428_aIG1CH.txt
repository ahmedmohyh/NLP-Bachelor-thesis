The Chevalier who lived from 1725 to 1798 was asomewhat controversal figure. So we don't know if the things he claims are really true. There are a few critics who doubt about some things th Chevalier de Seingalt claims. He was very rich but he also needed to borrow money and that's why some critics doubted if he really was rich. Because if he was rich why would he have to borrow money. He was gambling so he could have been rich and borrowing money. Critics also doubt about his prison escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. It is a fact that he was in Venice because there were a lot of prisoners who were in Prison while the Chevalier was in prison. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics claim that while such a daring escape makes for a enjoyable readin, it is more likley that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him.
