Chevalier is thought as someone who just came up with some stories so his life seems more excitingb, but that is what some critics may think. His memoir is occasionally accurate. There are three claimings about Chevalier's memoir.

First, there is proof of Chevalier living for a time in Switzerland. In his memoir is written that he was very wealthy, but evidence has shown that he had borrowed some Money there. But this can easily be explained. He just had to wait for his money to come, so he borrowed some in the meantime.

The second claiming was about his meeting with Voltaire. He wrote the conversations with Voltaire one year after they happened in his memoir. The reason why it is still accurate is because of the notes Chevalier wrote during the meetings.

Lastly, many think that Chevalier could only escape from the italien prison in Venice with bribery and not the way he wrote. But it is proven that bribery is out of question.

To sum up, Chevalier's memoir is pretty accurate.
