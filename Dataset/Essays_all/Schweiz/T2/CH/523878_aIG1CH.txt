Differences between the text and the lecture

In the lecture there was the first point that mentioned the fact about the Chevalier loving parties and gambling. But then they made a critical point about the question where the Chevalier should have had his money from and that he must have been boworing it and not spend it all the time for parties and gambling. That makes the thesis in his memoire unbelivable because there is no way that he had that amount of money to spend for parties and gambling.

The second point which was discussed in the lecture was the difficulty of finding evidence for the real conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire. In the lecture there is thesis that there is clear evidence for the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire.

The third and last point in the lecture was about the escape from a notorious prison in Venice and how realistic his memoire is in this contend. In the lecture there is the thesis that the Chevalier didn't have well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. So that would say that he must have taken an other way to escape from the prison.
