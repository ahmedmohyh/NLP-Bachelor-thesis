Chevalier is an important person for us, because he wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures and with this he bacame a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century.
He met a lot of famous people, for example kings and writers, but not everyone believe what he`s talking. A lot of people say his memoir is not realiable as a source. Chevalier says about himself that he was a rich and wealthy man. But there are people who know that he borrowed money sometimes and if he was wealthy for real he shouldn't need to borrow money. In contrast the lady in the audio said, that you don`nt need to be poor only if you borrow money. And the parties underlined that he had money.
An other cricical point is, that he wrote about a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. But he wrote it down many years later. How can he remember every single word if he met him years ago? In the audion they are convinced that he wrote it down the evening after they met, that`s why he could remember exact phrases.
The escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy is another strange story. He talks about using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Almost everyone knows that he had some powerfull friends, which helped him with his escape. This daring escape was only made for enjoyable reading.
In general both, the text and the audio have some critic on chevaliers memoir.
