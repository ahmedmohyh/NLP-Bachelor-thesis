Chevalier's memoir
The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures, in which he writes about his meetings with famous people, including kings and writers. However critics say that the Chevalier disorted or invented many events of the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous.
The Chevaliers wealth while in Switzerland is a controversial subject, whereas critics point out that it would not make sense, to borrow money from a Swiss merchant if he was very wealthy himself. But in the presentation about the Chevalier, they explain that alot of his wealth was through expensive property, which he could not turn in to cash fast enough, so he borrowed money from the Swiss merchant to party and gamble, untill his properties were sold.
Even though many of the Chevaliers collegues say he was making notes or writing in a diary alot of the time during conversations, critics say that it is impossible for him to capture the conversation between him and the Voltaire accuratley years later.
Critics also assume that the Chevalier did not escape from a notorious prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing thourgh the roof, but bribed jailers to free him, since he had a number of politically well-connectd friends in Venice. There is although proof that after his escape from prison the ceiling of his cell had to be fixed and why else would the ceiling of a prison have to be fixed.
