The Chevalier de Seintgalt is a very controversial person in the eighteenth century. There are many critics about his life and adventures which he wrote in a memoir and it became one of the biggest sources of the European society because he met many kings  and writers. The critics say that he invent stuff to let his life look more interesting than it actually was. For example he claims to be a wealthy person in Switzerland but he had to borrow money because he gambled and made parties. But there are actually people who think that the critics aren't faithful. They say that he had many properties and he could take his money whenever he wants. Another story is that he could break out of a prison. The critics say that he had connections to politically well-connected people in Venice. But on the other side there were prisoners who had better connections who could afford a bribe but they could't escape.
In my opinion you have to believe what you think is the most logic one because nobody can now give an evidence what really happened. And there will be an endless discussion about it.
