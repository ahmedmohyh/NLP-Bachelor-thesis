Generally, Chevalier de Seingalts popular memoirs are known to be filled with a lot of criticism. There must be some doubts about his prosperity, his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire and his friends helping him to escape from prison.

The audio recorder tells us, that the text only is partly true. In fact, as the woman explains, there is the following thing to say about his money: It might be true that Chevalier de Seingalt did not as much money as he claimed to have, but actually he was not really poor. To become rich, he first had to sell his property.

To the conversation with Voltaire the woman on the recording states that Seingalt simply wrote everything down he could remember. There is no evidence that this is a lie. So, as we see, the woman does not really agree with the text in this point.

But there is still one point left, in which she agrees with the text that Seingalt is lying. She precises that the roof through which he escaped must have been damaged, she sais that it were not his friends who helped him.
