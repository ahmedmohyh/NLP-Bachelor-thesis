There are a lot of critics about the memoir from Chevalier de Seingalt. Critics says that there are a few things which can't be true. One of this passages of the memoir is his life in switzerland. Chevalier wrote that he was very  rich these days, but it has surfaced, that he  borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. But if he was wealthy, he should't need to borrow money.

The second problem are the conversations with Voltaire. Chevalier says, that the conversations are exactly copied, but this isn't possible. These conversations were a lot of years ealier than the memoir. How can he imagine every single word from this conversation a few years ago?

The third problem is the break out from the prison in Venice. He said that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing trough the roof. But his cell hasn't change and there's no hole in the ceiling. So this story is completely wrong. It's more possible that a political friend of Chevalier offered a bribe.
