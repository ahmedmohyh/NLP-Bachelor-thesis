The text and the listening is about a chevalier, who wrote a memoir. He wrote down his life and he described his life as glamorous. But he hadn't so much many as he told. He borrowed a lot of many from a Swiss merchant. The text is telling us that he wasn't rich but poor. And the listnening tells us that he wasn't poor because he had money although it wasn't his. For this reason we can't say that he was poor. The Chevalier spent a lot of his money for partys and gamblings in the Switzerland. The Chevalier also espace from a prison in Venice but how he escaped is not sure. it's also not sure if he really escaped. Perhaps is's only invented, so the reader of his memoir think that he had a very interessting life.
