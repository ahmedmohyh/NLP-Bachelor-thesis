There are many different opinions on the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt but this particular lady was rather convinved that many adventures he documented were actually true. This is what she said:
While the Chevalier was living in switzerland he spent his money quite freely and generously on parties and gambling. It was discoverd that while living there he had taken grand loans from a swiss merchant. Nonetheless this doesnt mean he wasnt wealthy. His wealth just fluctuaded a bit as it takes time for assets to turn into money. So while he was waiting for his money he had to loan some from a swiss merchant to be able to continue partying and gambling through a dry period. 
While some claim that it is impossible for the conversations between Voltaire and Chevalier to be exact, as he wrote them many years later, some claim they could actually be authentic. Apperantly the Chevaliere kept a journal and noted down everything that  they had discussed after every meeting. Of course he had stored these and used them when he was writing down his memoir. This way he still knew important details and could document them in his memoir. 

The third sceptical point is the story about his escape from a venetian prison. It is true that he had many well-connected friends in Venice which might have been able to help him but documents say that he wasnt the only one with such friends and none of the other prisoners were able to escape. Another clue that the story is true is the documentaion of a restoration of his cells ceiling shortly after his escape. Why else would they fix it?
