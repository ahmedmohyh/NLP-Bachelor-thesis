The critics say that Chevalier wasn't rich and had to borrow money, but that does not mean that he is poor. He had many assets, which he sold to get money to spend on parties and gambling, but he could not sell them immediately and had to wait for some days to get it. So he had to borrow some money , because he has not got any in that moment. So that means he was not actually poor as critics say.
The critics also argue that the Chevalier could not be able to remember the conversation and exact phrases which he had with Voltaire. But people who knew Chevalier said that he wrote everything down after every conversation. So he didn't really remembered the whole conversation after years, he just did not release them immediately.
And in the end, the critics say that he did not escaped through the venice prison, but just bribed himself out. But back then, other prisonners had better connections with the jailors and other political friends and could not bribe their way out. Also the prison had to repair the ceiling of Chevaliers cell, what would make if he escped through the ceiling.
