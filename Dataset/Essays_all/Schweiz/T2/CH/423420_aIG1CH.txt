In the audio it says that not everything can be correct, but the historical source is still pretty accurate, logic and most of the time real
The first argument against the critics who say that he was poor, even though he claimed that he was a wealthy man, because he borrowed money from people, is, that it's true; he borrowed money, but that didn't mean that he was poor. In Switzerland, he often spent money on something, maybe too much for what he had at the moment. It took some days for the money to arrive, so he had to borrow it. 
Chevalier claimed to have had some interesting conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. That he remembers the conversation in the form of the exact phrases is criticized, because people say this would have been nearly impossible. However Chevalier said, that every night after he talked with Voltaire, he wrote everything down, so it would be possible for him to remember all the details. 
The last thing where people say he lied about, is the story of the escape out of the Venetian prison. Critics really ask themselfes how that could have been possible and blame the escape on his good relationships. They say jailers were bribed to free him. But isn't it pretty accurate that he tells this fake story, and after his escape people had to repair the roof, because it was broken? Also other prisoners had way more powerful friends and connections than Chevalier had and they didn't try or didn't find a way to escape; so why should Chevalier have found one?
