Chevalier was a man who wrote some notes of the european society. As he had met a few kings and some important persons, the notes became historical valuable. But there is no proof to it, that all, what he had written down is accurate. There is always no proof to it, because it was in the past and now we are in the present, and we have no idea what happend before and nobody could ever correct such papers. The critics are sceptical, they dont't want to relie on his memories. He once met the famous Voltaire and consequently wrote down everything he could remember of this meeting. Whereas the impossible point is, that this special record of the conversation with Voltaire was written down many years late after the actual talk occured.
The historicans can't be sure neither of the fact that he had a large amount of money nor that it is true, that he escaped the prison in Venice (Italy) where he was. There stayed many prisoners, who were even more powerful than Chevalier, but he was the only one who managed to get free through a hole in the ceiling, which he had made with a piece of metal.
