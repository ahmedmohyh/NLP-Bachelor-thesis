Many people claim, that many things the Chevalier said, did not happen like this. They are critical, due to the accuracy of the Chevaliers stories. Critics do not think, that anyone could remember the things the Chevalier had wirtten down, with such an accuracy.
The Chevalier's memoir has become a historical source, due to the fact that he had met many famous people, including kings. 
One example is his time in Switzerland. The Chevalier claims that he was very wealthy while living in Switzerland, but on the other hand, there is evidence that the Chevalier needed to borrow money during his time in Switzerland. If he was that rich, why did he need to borrow money? Was he just unable to handle that much money?
As I mentioned before, one controversial point of the Chevalier's memoir is it's accuracy. For instant his records about his conversations with famous people like Voltaire. He surely has met him, but could he possibly capture that much details of their conversation, eventhough the record was written several years after the conversation?
Some critcs also claim that the Chevalier invented some events, to make his story sound more interesting. Such as his escape from a prison in Venice. It was not possible for any prisoner to escape from that prison, although some of them had very powerful friends. Nevertheless did the Chevalier manage to escape from the prison in Venice, according to him with a little metal piece, that he used to make a hole in his cell. This does sound more like a movie, than something that actually happened, on the other hand, the sealing in his cell had to be indeed repaired.
