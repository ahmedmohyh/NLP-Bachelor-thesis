Chevalier de Seingalt (1725−1798) was a controversial person. He wrote a memoir about his life but critics question the correctness of the information given in his memoir. Some claim he was very wealthy and spent lots of his own money in switzerland. Others claim he just borrowed money all the time so he could pay for his expensive lifestyle.

His memoir ist considered as a very important piece of history. He also had a conversation with the big writer Voltaire. Critics claim he never could have worte down any exact information after a period of several years about this conversations. But there are also experts who claim that Cheavlier always took notes about his conversations and could have easily written it down exact even many years later. 

He also speaks about his escape from the Venetian prison. It could be possible that he bribed the chailers to free him, but even more politically involved prisoners couldn't do that according to some experts. He wrote about his escape through the ceiling and just after he escaped the prison the prison had to repair the ceiling in his cell. There is evidence in the papers of the prison. 

Chevalier might be a good and adventurous writer but there is evidence that most of the memoir is accurate and true.
