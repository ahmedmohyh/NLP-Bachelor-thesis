The speech and the essay mainly disagree in one point, the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir. They each bring up the same three points, but they explain them out of their point of view. The author of the essay thinks the memoir is not very accurate,the opinion of the women in the speech is that the memoir is a very reliable historical source. 
The first point is about Chevaliers gambling in Switzerland. He always needed to borrow money, so the essay says he coudln't have been rich. But the women in speech explains that his wealth was not just money. Most of it were for example houses and they first needed to be converted to money.
The second point they bring up is about the conversations with the writer Voltaire Chevalier wrote about. There the essay says that it is impossible for Chevalier to remember the conversation with Voltaire so exact, but in the speech we get told that Chevalier wrote down notes after each conversation he had with Voltaire, so it is possible, that he remembers them.
The last point which they not agree on is his escape from a prison in Venice. The text tells us that it is more likely that his well-connected friends helped him escape, but in the speech we hear, that there were people in the prison with connections who had even more influence and they didn't come out either. Further we know from the prison that the ceiling where Chevalier was had to be repared, so it would make sense that the chevalier broke out through the ceiling. Why else would they have needed to repare a ceiling.
