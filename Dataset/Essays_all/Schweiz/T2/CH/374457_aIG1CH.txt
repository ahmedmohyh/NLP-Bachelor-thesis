At the presantion about the text the women tries to defend the "Chevalier de Seingalt" and his memoir. She believes that a memoir can not be a hundert per cent accurate and always gets influenced by the writer. The women also claims that the memoir is "pretty accurate" compared with similar ones. For exapmle when people claim that he can not be  as wealthy as he says because he would often loan hugh amounts of money from swiss merchants. Her response to that claim is that at that time money from assets often needed time to get to the receiver so to survive the time waitng he was forced to borrow money.They thinkt that because when he wrote his memoir it was impossible to remember excat phrases from the extended conversation he held many years earlier. But she argues that he had taken notes immedatly after his discusions and aswell that friends from the Chevalier had seen him using his notes for his memoir. The last argument that critics have is that he propably did not escape the prison in Venice rather he his jailers were bribed to let him free but she thinks that there are wrong. For exaplme theire are other powerful people with even powerful friends could not ever bribed them free. Also there is a old reported that states that after the Chevalier his time in prison his ceilling got repaired.
