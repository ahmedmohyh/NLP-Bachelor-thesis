Chevalier wrote a long memoir at the end of his life. In it he wrote of all his adventures and memories he had. To write this he used his notes, which he wrote during his whole life. 
The text sais that Chevalier is said to have been a wealthy man. But it also doubts this because of the large amounts of money he had to borrow during his time in Switzerland. But we know that the wealth Chevalier is said to have had, is wealth in form of property and not in form of chash. So he had to sell this property first to get money out of it. To have money in the time he waitet for his arriving money from his sold properties, he borrowed money from banks. 
In the text we also see, that Chevalier couldn't have been able to recover his conversations with Voltair word to word. But we know from sources that knew him, that each evening after the conversations with Voltaire he wrote down everything he remembered and that he used those notes to write his memoir.
The text also mentions the unbelieveble escape out of a prison in Venice, Italy. He wrote that he was able to break a hole into the roof with a piece of metal. Critics sai that this is much overdramatic and that he probably bribed the guards to set him free. But in this prison were even mightier and wealthier prisoners than Chevalier and none of them could bribe the guards to get out. And from the notes of the prison we know for a fact, that the roof of this very cell Chevalier was prisoned in had to be raplaced after he was held in it.
