Contrary to the essay given, the lecture states clearly that the achievements the Chevalier arguably did actually did take place. While the essay strongly doubts the reliability of this memoir as a historical source due to several factors that imply the Chevalier tried to make a good read of his adventures rather than recounting dry facts, the lecture implores a variety of other pieces of historical evidence to support the Chevaliers' mentioned adventures. 
For example, the Chevalier claims in his book to have met Voltaire and he recorded the conversations he had had with him in his memoir. While the essay corretly states it is impossible to remember entire conversations that occured years before the memoir was actually written, the lecture implies the Chevalier had taken notes on the very evenings the conversations occured and referred to them when writing his memoir. This assumption is supported by various historical sources of friends of the Chevalier which all claim to have seen these notes. 
The same phenomenon occurs with the Chevaliers' escape from a prison in Venice. On one hand, the spectacular escape through a hole in the ceiling which had been created by a simple piece of metal does seem incredible. On the other hand, the archives of Venice clearly state the ceiling had to be replaced after the escape of the Chevalier, which does contribute positively to the trustworthiness of the famous memoir.
