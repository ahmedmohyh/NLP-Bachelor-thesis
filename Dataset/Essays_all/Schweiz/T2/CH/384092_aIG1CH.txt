Of course no memoires can be one-hundred percent right, but the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) are accially pretty accurate. While some critics claim, tha he couldn`t do such accurat memoires, lets take a look at the three episodes mentioned. First, we know that Chevalier spend lots of money on partys, so he miust have been very rich. On the other hand, it is also known, that he had to borrow money from a Swissman. But there might be an explanation for this. Due to the fact that he had most of his money not in cash but in other thinks like immobiles, it took him always a few days to get this money. In between he had to borrow money, so he could pay the bills for partys and his gambling. Another thing, that critics are sceptic about is, that his records of conversations between him and the famous writer Voltaire mention whole scentences, which is impossible that Chevalier could remember them after many years. An explanation for this might be, that he had written down everything he remembered about the conversation right after he had it. Then he just had to keep the notes till the time he wrote down his memoires. The third controversial fact is, that Chevalier wrotes, that he had escaped a prison in Venice by crushing a hole in the ceiling of his cell. Critics say he just imagined this to make zhe story more glamorous and just used his connections to rich and powerful venice men, who then rescued him. But right after he escaped from prison, they had to repair the ceiling of his cell, so he might get through there. And second, there were many prisoners who had connections to much more powerful men and never could escape. So why should the less powerful friends of Chevalier help him and the more powerful never helped anyone? But I guess, that we never know the answer and the whole story of Chevalier de Seingalt.
