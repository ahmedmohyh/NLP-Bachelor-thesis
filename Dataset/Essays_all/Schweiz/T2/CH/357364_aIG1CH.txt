At the beginning of the lecture the lecturer says that the memoirs of the Chevalier are correct and claims that he has proves, which confirm the accuracy of the memoirs.

First the lecturer states that the Chevalier was rich while he lived in Switzerland, not as said in the textthat he was very poor. The lecture says that the chevalier only had to borrow money because he hadn't made all of his belongings into cash, while there i a lot of doubt about the Chevaliers wealth in the text.

Secondly the lecturer comes to the part in Chevaliers memoirs where he wrote down some conversations he had with Voltaire. As told in the text many people don't believe that these conversations are accurate because no one can remember a conversation that happend such a long time ago. As for the lecturer it is clear that the Chevalier has written down some notes shortly after the talk with voltaire and that he refers to them in his memoirs.

The last point, which is being said is about the Chevaliers escape out of the notorious prison in Venice. In the text is written that the Chevalier only invented this escape to sound more intresting and that he didn't escape but was bribed by some influencal friends. The lecturer on the other hand claims that there is written proof that the ceiling had to be repaired after the Chevalier got out of prison and that in there, in this prison were people with a lot more influencal friends than the Chevalier.

So in the end no one can ask the Chevalier what's true and what isn't. There will always be the ones who believe him and the ones how think he's a lier.
