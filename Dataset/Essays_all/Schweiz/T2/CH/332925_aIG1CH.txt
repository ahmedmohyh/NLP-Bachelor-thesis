In the lecture, it is explained, why the three main arguments mentioned in the text are not necessarely true.
The first argument was, that although Chevalier said he had a lot of money during his time in Switzerland, and also spend quite a lot of it on parties and gambling, he had to borrow quite some sums of money from a merchant. In the lecture it is mentionned that he had to wait untill the new loads of his own money arrived, and while that, he had to borrow the money, which doesn't necessarely mean he was poor and lied in his memoir.
 The second argument is, that Chevalier mentions accurate phrases about the conversations he had whith Voltaire, which is not possible, because he couln't have remembered them this accurate after all the years. But it is said that Chevalier made notes after every conversation whith Voltaire and kept those for years, so he could refer to them in his memoirs.
 The last argument mentionned in the text was that Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, although he had powerfull friends who could have easily offered a bribe. But there were also other prisoners whith even more powerfull friends who weren't able to get free, and there even exists a document which confirms, thet the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape of Chevalier.
 Therefor although there are quite some critical points in the memoirs it still is possible that they are all true.
