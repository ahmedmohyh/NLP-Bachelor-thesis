The Chevalier was a controversial person and critics claim that not everything he's written in his memoir recounting his life was correct. But still the memoir is a important historical source about the eighteeth century.
In his memoir he has written about his conversations with Voltaire and very detailed and with exact phrases. Critics doubt that this conversations are accurat because it's impossible to remember exact phrases years after the conversations. Whereas others claim that he had written every night after the conversation with Voltaire down what they had talked about and later when he wrote his memoir he consulted his notes. So his memoir is accurat. 
The Chevalier was also captured in prison but he could escape. The critics argue that this isn't true because there were many of his friends in prison who had more powerful connections and they aren't escaped. But then there are belivers of the Chevaliers story and they say that everything written in this memoir is true. He was escaped because after his escape the prison needed to repaire the celling. And that wouldn't have been necessaire if he hadn't escaped.
There critcs and those who belive what the Chevalier has written. And nobody knows what really happend. But nevertheless the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is a consulted as a important historical source about the European society.
