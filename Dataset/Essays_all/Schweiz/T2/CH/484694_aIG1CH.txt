In the presentation, we heard many different arguments to prove the correctness of the Chevaliers memoires. I will summarize them in the following. 
First, the Chevalier spent a lot on partys and gambling, while he lived in switzerland. There is a high chance he spent too much and had to borrow money. The presentator also mentionned that the Chevalier took down notes from his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. So it's likely that his memoires about this conversation are based on these notes, which would prove the correctness of it. 
The third and last topic was about his Break-out of a Venetian Prison. In his memoires, he wrote that he was able to escape, because he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. The woman in the presentation told us, that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape.
There are many critics against the accuracy in the Chevaliers memoire. The critics take exactly the opposite arguments, to prove their oppinion. Because there was an evidence, that the Chevalier had to borrow some money, they say he have never ever been wealthy, because otherwise he would not have borrowed money. 
Also in the second topic about the conversation with Voltaire, critics say that his memoires can not be completely correct, because he wrote these down several years after and it's not likely that he's still able to memorize the whole conversation with the writer.
Critics even consist on their oppinion, that the story about the Prison Break was told wrong, and he came out of prison by some well connections to political friends, which would prove, that there was corrupcy involved.
