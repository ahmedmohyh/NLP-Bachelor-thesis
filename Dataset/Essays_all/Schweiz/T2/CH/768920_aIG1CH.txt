You don't need to be poor even if you borrow some money. The speech described the richness of the Chevalier as something that comes and goes. He was trying to expand his saved money by placing hat somewhere else. And in this time where all is money was fixes he wasn't alble to use it. So he borrowed some, which he was giving back later.


Every night after the Chevalier and Voltaire met oneanoher the Chevalier wrote down what they were talking about to come back to some arguments. He kept this valueble sources for many years and only took them again to write his memoir. This is not the same as the critics say because it could be possible that he really wrote down their conversation every single time. 

It's not possible that some jailers of the Chevalier helped him to escape because he had only few powerful well-connected friends in Venice who could be able to offer him some help. And after his escape the chamber where he was imprisoned got restored and fixed again. So why should the prison do this in the case that an old friend helped the Chevalier to escape?
