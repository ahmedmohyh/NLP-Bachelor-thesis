Chevalier de Seingaltwrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. Some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was.
For example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, and it is known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. It is claimed that Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.

Critics have also questioned Chevalier’s escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics claim that the Chevalier’s jailers were bribed to free him. 

There are two points where the text and the speach, are not the same opignion. So in the text it is said that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. In the speec the moderator claimed the opposite, she said that he firstly had to spend his money and borrowed money and after that he get his own money. So the text sais he was a poor guy and the speech sais that he was a rich guy.

The second point with different opignion is the point where he escapes fron the prison in Venice. The text claimes that some jailers were bribed to free him. In the speach it's clearli declarated, that Chevalier escaped through the ceiling, because the prison owner had to repair the ceiling of the cell where Chevalier was in it.
