It was pointed out that taking loans does not necessarily mean that one is poor. The chevalier's wealth apparently mostly consisted of assets which usually took a few days to be made money with. This would explain why he would take loans, as he may very well have simply needed money right then and there and knew he could afford to pay the loans once he received his wealth in form of currency.
 
Regarding his conversations with Voltaire, it is sadi that the chevalier always took notes of everything he could remember of the conversatinos immediately after them. People who knew the chevalier have confirmed that while writing his memoirs he consulted a great deal of notes, including those. This would explain why he was able to record their conversations in such details, even years after they had taken place.
 
As to his escape from prison in Venice, there are two main points to be made. Firstly, the chevalier was not the most well-connected person in the prison by far. There was no shortage of people with more powerful friends than his and they never managed to bribe themselves free. The second point is the fact that, shortly after him reacquiring his freedom, repairs to the ceiling of his cell were ordered, which supports the chevalier's claims as to how his escape transpired.
