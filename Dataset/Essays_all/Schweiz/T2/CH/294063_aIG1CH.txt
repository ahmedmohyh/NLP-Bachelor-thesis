Chevalier de Seingalt had made an high accurately memoir. All his Storys have got some critics, because they are not very believable. Because of that the truth of his storys have to be proofed. In his memoir Chevalier had been in switzerland and its known that he spent a lot of money on gambling and parties. In addition to that, he also had to borrow some money.So the critic is: If Cheavlie rhad been rich, why he would have to borrow money?  The reason is that he was wealthy, but he had some propertys to sell. In the meantime he had to wait to sell his propertys. So thats why he had to borrow some money to get trough. the second critc is that his conversation with volatire can not be accuracy, but that is also not true. After Voltaire and Chevalier had a conversation, he wrote everything down in the night. Also the esacpae from the vencian prsion is not believable, that he esdaped with a piece of metal. But the prison reported some damage on his cell, so it have to be also true.
