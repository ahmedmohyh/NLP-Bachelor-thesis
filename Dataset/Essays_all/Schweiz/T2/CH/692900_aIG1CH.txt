First of all the text claims that Chevalier made up some events to show in the memoir a more adventurous life than he actually had. On the other hand the audio source claims that even though no memoir is totally correct Chevalier's is reliable. This can be seen as Chevalier referred to diary entries and his own notes to confirm the accuracy.
However, there are three events listed in the text which are said to be doubtful that they occurred as Chevalier described them to be. Firstly, the text mentions that he had to borrow money in Switzerland and this leady the text to the conclusion that he wasn't as rich as he claimed to be. However, the audio file mentioned that Chevalier spent a lot of his money in Switzerland while partying. Therefore, to access new money he had to sell some of his properties first and this could take days. Thus, during these days he wasn't liquid and had to borrow money. Secondly, the article doubts that Chevalier wrote down the accurate and exact conversations between him and Voltaire. This text argues that the memoir was written years after his encounters with Voltaire and thus, Chevalier couldn't possibly remember every conversation accurately. On the other hand, the audio file reasons that Chevalier made notes of his conversations and that this is said in the memoir to confirm the accuracy. Last but not least, there was the prison breakout. The text above claims that it was only possible for Chevalier to breakout because he bribed some politically well-connected friends. However, the audio file gives reason to believe Chevalier's story in the memoir, because other prisoners were even more connected and couldn't escape. Furthermore, after the breakout the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired which can be confirmed by the city council of Venice and this backs the story of Chevalier. In conclusion, some events can sound rather adventurous, but if they are investigated further proof can be found in favor of Chevalier.
