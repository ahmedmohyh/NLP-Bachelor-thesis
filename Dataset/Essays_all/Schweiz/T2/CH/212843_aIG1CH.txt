When his life was going to find an end, the Chevalier de Seingalt(1725-1798) wrote a meomoir of his adventures and life. In history he was a controversial figure, because no one knows what he really did and if his memoire contains lies. But in fact in an other way his memoire has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. 
In his writing, you can find three adventures, wich happened in his life. A first,while he was living in Switzerland, he had organised lot of parties. Everyone said, that he was a poor man, so how could he organised such expensive parties? People mumble, that he sold his property to afford such a life. 
Nobody is sure about the story of his meetings with Voltaire. Many people claim that he nerver met him, while others are claiming, that he worte down everything, they had spoken about in every single night.
In the text he talks about, that he had escaped from the prison through a hole in the ceiling, but in fact, they had not torepaired the ceiling after his break out.
