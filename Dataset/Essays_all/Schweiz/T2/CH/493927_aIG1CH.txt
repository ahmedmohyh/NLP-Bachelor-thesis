In this essay I'm going to write about the Chevalier. He wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. His memoir is a very historical source about European society in the eighteenth society. Now I want to mention the different  arguments. 

First of all, I will write about the Text I've read before. In the text we see that the critics are very skeptical. In additon they think that the Chevalier invented many events in his life to make it more exciting. An example is that the reader thinnks that the Chavelier is verry rich but in contrast he was in Switzerland and he had to borrow money. The critics think that when he really was rich he didn't not have to borrow money. THe critics are also sceptical about the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. They think that Chevalier had fotgot many things about the conversation because he wrote many years after that in his memoir about it. An other example is the question about the Chevalier's escape in the prison.

Last but not least. I want to say some things about the presentation  from the woman. She can give all the solutions about this critical theme. For example she says that he want't poor but at the beginning of his carrer it took a few days to get money. But the Chevalier wasn't pooor. The lady also mention that he always wrote down what happens so that he couldn't forget the details. So he could remember all the details in the conversat¨sation with Voltaire.

To come to an end, we can see that therer all always critics when someone writes something. It is possible that he didn't wrote all his experiences in his life. But it's more interesting to read the highlight of the Chevalier.
