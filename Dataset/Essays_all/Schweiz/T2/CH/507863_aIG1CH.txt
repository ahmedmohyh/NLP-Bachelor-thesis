The Chevalier wrote memoir with his adventures he had in his life. He met many famous people during his life. Critics say that the stories he wrote about arent true. They say that when they were in Switzerland he spent a lot of money ,so their life looks more glamourous, and had to borrow money so he wasn,t rich. In the passage we heard they said that he hand to borrow money because he had to wait for his money sometimes. They also argue about the conversation he is suposed to had with Voltair. And that you can't memorise everything an other person said. In the tape they said that he wrote everything down that he could remember after his cinversations. Friend of him also proved that he often wrote after he had conversations. The third thing which is mentioned is the escape form a prison in Venice.He said that he escaped throw a hole in his veling which he mad by using a piece of metal. Critis say that this story isnt true. In the tape they said that the celling in his "room" needed a renovation afert he left or escaped from the prison and this is an evidence thta is probably true what he wrote in his memoir. At the beging of the tape it saiys that memoir arent a 100 per cent ture but the one from the Chevalier valuable historical source about European society in the eigtheeth century.
