Chevalier de Seingalt (1725 - 1798)was an author who wrote a memoir about his life and adveture. Historical his memoir is a practical source for analysing the eighteenth century in Europa. But a lot of people do not believe his stories. They shall be half true, half invented, to make a bigger adventure of his life. They are some points who are paradox. As example he escaped the notorious prison in Venic, Italy. The critic is, that other prisoners had stronger friends than Chevalier, but did not escaped. In his story, he made a hole in the ceiling and climbed throught the roof. But they never repaired a cell, or a ceiling, so, where is the hole gone? Probably his friends gave him his freedom back. He had a lot politically well-connected freinds in Venici, so he came free because of them.
An other story is, that he lived in Swizzerland. He was very wealthy and spend a lot of money for parties and gambling. He donated money and lend it to organisations. But, in the eighteenth century, nobody lend a lot of money to people he did not know. And the last and less strangest thing in his stories is his conversation with Voltaire. Voltaire is or was also an author. They met and had a long and interesting conversation. After this conversation Chevalier wrote everything down he could remember. Now you ask yourself, and where is the mistake? Chevalier wrot it years after the conversation with Voltaire down. He could not remember all things he wrote down.
But his biggest secret he took with him in his grave. How true are the whole memoir? No body knows, expect him.
