The presenter told us that she disagrees with most of the points made in the text. It seemed not trustworthy for her, because the text rather relates to suspicions than facts. Witch bleleveable facts the showed that the text is just hot air.
In the first episode she metioned that just the fact that the Chevalier had borrowed money does not mean that he is poor, but the making of his assets like land to money would take some time and for the friction in between it was just necessary to borrow money.
For the second episode she claimes that it is proven that the Chevalier took notes after every dialogue he had with Voltaire. With the help of the notes, she claims, is it easily possible for the Chavalier to be accurate in witing down the conversations. 
Concerning the last episode, she has two arguments. One goes in the same direction as the ones from the text as it is just a suspicion. The Chevalier had many well-conected friends with could have freed him. The presenter claims that other imprisoned had much better connected friends, and they were not freed. The other Argument is that it can be read in old Venician documents that the ceiling of the Chevaliers cell had to bee repaired shortly after this escape. The presenter asks why it was necessary to just repar his ceiling and not the ones from the others, when he Chevaler fleed through the door.
All in all, she is against the suspicion of the Chevalier beeing lieing, but the never says somethig about him exaggurating his adventures.
