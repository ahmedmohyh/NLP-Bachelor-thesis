The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt has many critics. But in the presentation, there are arguments, which can expalain or answer the questions from the critics.
The first argument beeing discussed, was the issue with him borrowing money in Switzerland, when he was as rich as he tells. This has a very plausible explenation: he wasn't poor, he just ran out of cash sometimes, but then he sell something to get cash. All his value was in his things, and this was very much. But selling these things took some days, and because he wanted to play, he borrowed some. But afterwards he payed everything back.
The next question was how he could remember all these conversations with Voltaire. The critics say that this is impossible, and so do the others. It is impossibe to remember a whole dicussion for years, but after each one, he wrote it down in the evening, and remembering a discussion for a day is very possible. After all those years, he just wrote down what he has written earlier.
The last point was the thing with his escape from prison. The critics say that this makes an enjoyable reading, but isn't true. In the presentation, it is mentioned, that there is an venecian document which says, that after his break-out, his ceiling had to be repaired, so why should it be a lie.
