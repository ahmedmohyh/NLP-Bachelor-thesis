Chevailier 

Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. His memoir is an important historical source about European society. But there are people who critic the memoir. They say that Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. For exemple Chevalier always said that he was very rich and had a lot of money to spend on parties and gambling but at the same time he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But that is no problem because sometimes you are rich and have a lot of money but not at the moment so you need a little bit of time to get your money. So while waiting for your money you need to borrow some to survive.
Another point is his dialogue with Voltaire. Critcs say that it is not possible to remember everything they talked about. But in fact, Chevalier wrote down everything they said and when he talks about his conversaition with Voltaire he is consulting his notes. 
The third point is his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. He said that he escaped the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in ceiling and climning trough the roof. Critics said that he had some powerful friends who bribed him free. But this is not the reason for his escape. Because a few days after he escaped from the prison they had to repair the ceiling which shows that Chevalier escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
