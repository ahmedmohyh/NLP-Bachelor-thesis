It is scientifically proven, that no one remembers every detail of a conversation or an event, that had happened in the past. 

But the memoir of the Chevalier is still accurate, because there is some evidence that proves it.
It could be possible, that he was rich and wealthy in Switzerland, because before he got rich, he had to borrow some money, to make it to more money, like we do today with our credits. It is totally possible to borrow money to organise big parties or events, like he did, and make more money at the parties and events.

The Chevalier took a lot notes during his hole life, which makes it possible for him to actually have said the truth about the conversation he had with Voltaire. And even though he could not remember every detail of the conversation he surely memorized the really important stuff.

To the argument that the Chevalier had some well-connected friends outside, that helped him to escape the prison,could be true but other prisonners had much more friends than he had and those did not escape. He said, that he had used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling to climb out the prison. Evidence says that soon after his escape, the ceiling had to be repared. Obviously it was because of the hole he had made in the ceiling, because if not, for what other reason then?
