The human memoir can't remember every deatil. The Chevaliers memoir was very good, but there were still some information that slicked through. He could remember certain details for years but after time his memoir he was forgetting the things. There is to much Information for a brain to keep. He wrote some conversation on a paper that is why he could keep it for a couple of years. You only remember details of things that really interested you or that traumatized you in a certain way.

I really had to go on the toilet, because I drank a lot of water and that is why i couldn't pay attention at the english presentation. My concentration wasn't here. So I wrote down things that the woman could possibly have said. Sorry :(
