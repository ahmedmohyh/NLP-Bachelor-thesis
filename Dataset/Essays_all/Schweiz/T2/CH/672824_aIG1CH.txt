The first argument in the speach was that he arrived in switzerland and that he has to wait a few days until his money came. In the text they said that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. That's true but he gives him the money back and have a lot of more. The second point was that he had a conversation with Voltaire. In the text it sais that it is impossible to remember in detail what he said after all these years but in the speach they said that  it's very good possible that the Chevalier makes after the conversation notes and put these away for a later point. The third state was in the text that he was escape from the prision in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. In the text they said that this is impossible and that he came out during well-connected friends in venice who could have offered a bribe. In the speach they argument agains that beacause nobody came out during a bribe from a friend. They said that the prision was getting repaired after the escaption and that the prison have to repaire this beacause of the Chevalier.
