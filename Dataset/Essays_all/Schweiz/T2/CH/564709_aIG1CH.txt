The text mentions 3 episodes of Chevalier's life, which many critics believe to be inventet. But there are some arguments that proof the accuracy of this memoir. In the first episode critics point out that even if he seemed to be a rich person because of his fame and his glamorous life, he was not. The critics think that the fact that the Chevalier had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant is the proof for his faked wealthy life. But in te presentation it is mentioned that he invested alot of money to make even more money. And because he spend all the money at once he had to wait a couple of days before his new earned money was in his hands.
Other stories he wrote about in the memoir were discussions with kings and famous people. Critics do not believe that it is possible to remember exact words or phrases of a conversation held years ago. But actually family and friends of te Chevalier have confirmed that he made notes every time something interesting came up and that he kept them for a long time.
The third episode of the text tells us about the escape of the Chevalier out of an italian Prison. Critics believe that he did not really escape by himself. They think he was offered a bribe. In the presentation it is discussed that there is evidence for his real escape-story. The roof which he made a hole in when he escaped, had to be repaired after he left prison. So that is another argument for the reality of the Chevalier's memoir.
