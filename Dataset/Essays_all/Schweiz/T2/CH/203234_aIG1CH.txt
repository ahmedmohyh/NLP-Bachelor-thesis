Chevalier has been hardy critisised for his memoirs. It is said that they are not doubtable. The mentioned examples were talking about his wealth, a discussion with the famous Voltaire and a prison escape.
Although he had to borrow money from other men, this doesn't mean he was poor. Because especially in the early days of a buisness, it is important to have a source to work with. He just used the borrowed money to make more of his own.
Then there's the talk he had with Voltaire. Critics claim, that one can't remember exact phrases of a discussion he had years ago. However, the answer to this complaint is a very simple one, he used to have a notebook.
The last argument against his relatability was the prison escape. Here it is a simple question of wether the escape did or did not happen. Happily notes of the Venetian government have recorded repairworks after his break-out. Apparently a roof had to be repaired. This could proove his escape.
