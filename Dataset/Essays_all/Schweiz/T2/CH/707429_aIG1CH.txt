The memoire of the writer Chevalier de Seingalt is used to show the European Society in the 18th century. But not all historicans and people who are interested in this theme are sure if all the facts in the memoire are rigt. They don't doubt in the basic of the memoire but in the details. For example, Chevalier wrote down a conversation beteewn him and the famous writer Voltaire. In the memoire their are very exact discussions, but the memoire had been written a few years later than the discussion has taken place. So how Chevalier could have remember the dialogue exactly? Nobody doubts about the dicussion between the two writers. For sure, it has taken place, but their exist criticers, who doubt about the accuracy of the conversations. On the other side, people who are sure that the memoire is written right and exactly, they mean, that Chevalier de Seingalt has taken notes every day about what he has done, so he could have just copied the phrases.
We will never know who is right, but is this so important? The memoire gives us a fundamental overview of this century and the basis of this is surely right.
