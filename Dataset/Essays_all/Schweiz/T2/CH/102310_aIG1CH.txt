The lecturer mentioned that most of the memoirs can't be 100% correct but Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir is a reliable and accurate historic source, what's also mentioned in the text. The lecturer doesn't agree with the fact that he made some of the stories up justto make reading more enjoyable. She also mentioned that when we look at his stay in Switzrland we'll see that he wasn't as poor as described in the text. He had wealth and luxury but it was in the form of property so he was waiting for his money while he borrowed the merchant's money but that doesn't mean that he was poor. Now let's look at the second point. According to witnesses, Chevalier de Seingalt wrote down his conversations with Voltaire every night after they happened, so that's why they he could capture these conversations so authentically and accurately. Moving on to the third example, the lecturer claimed that there were a lot of people with even more politically well-connected friends and they weren't able to get out with bribery, so why could he have gotten out with it? In the text it is pointed out that he had used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling to climb through the roof. While critics claim that it was more likely for him to get out with bribery, the lecturer claims that after he had escaped the ceiling had to be repaired and that's a clear indicator, that his ceiling was damaged, probably from his hole where he had climbed through.
