Chevalier de Seingalt was a very controversial figure and he still is. As he wrote his memoir, which has become a precious historical source, some people from then on critizied the accuracy of his documentation.

Despite spending a lot of many on parties and gambling in Switzerland, the Chevalier reports having been very wealthy. But evidence recently proofed that the Chevalier has been lent a considerable amount of money. However others say that it is obvious having to borrow money if you wait for the money you have won by gambliing. The win first has to convert in money before receiving it.£
Another aspect of his memoire that is very controversial discussed is his conversion with Voltaire. They say that it is not possible to remember such exact phrases of it as they are written. In spite of this possible fact, witness say the know that the Chevalier often used notes which he had taken, as in this case a night after.
In addition the prison escape from the Chevalier is also said not to having happened in this way. Critics claim that this story was invented for entertaining purposes. Anyway there are also some people how give an explanation for this choice of breaking out of the prison instead of a bribery. Furthermore venecian documents say the the ceiling had to be repared after his escape.

Wether you believe it or not, everyone has to admit that both points of view in each case contain some aspects that can easily explain the special circumstances.
