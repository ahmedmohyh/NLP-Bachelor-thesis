Critics say that the Chevalier was not very rich otherwise he had not had to borrow moeny. But in the presentation it is said that The Chevalier was not poor. It would be true, sometimes he had to borrow moeny but just because first he had to sell things and sometimes he had to wait till the money is here. 
Critics also claim that the Chevaliers records of the conversations he had with Voltaire are not as accurated as he claims they are. They say that he wrote the memoir many years after the coversations occured so they easyly mitht be wrong noted, because nobody can remember the exact phrases from conversations that were held many years earlier. But the woman who held the presentation says that the Chavalier made notes right after the conversations and that his memoire is based on these notes.
Critics are skeptical if it is true that the Chevalier really escaped the prison in Venice by destroying the ceiling and climbing trough the roof. They rather think that they let him free because of his number of well-connected friends he had. In the presentation it is said that he really had well-connected friends, but that he fleed alone through the roof. In jail there were men who had even better connections and they were although in prison. And there are notes that the city had to renovate the ceiling above the Chevaliers cell.
