Some people think that some of the things, Chevalier de Seingalt said he did, aren't true. But they actually are. Let's look at three points:

Chevalier went to Switzerland and spend a lot of money for partys and gambling and was known as a rich man. But critics say that Chevalier always had to borrow money and therefore he couldn't be rich. 
Chevalier had to borrow money, that is true. But not because he was poor, but because he had to wait for the money to arrive which he earned. During this time he needed to borrow money yes, but not because he was poor.

Critics also say that Chevalier never spoke to Voltaire because it was written many years after the conversation and Chevalier was never able to remember everything that exactly. This is also false, because these two did met and had a conversation. Just after the conversation Chevalier wrote everything down he rememberd about the conversation, but he kept it for a verly long time. Years later he decided to publish it.

Another point critics say cannot be true is the fact, that Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venetian. But thi is also true because after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. Why would they have to repair the ceiling of his cell, if it didn't was because of his escape?
