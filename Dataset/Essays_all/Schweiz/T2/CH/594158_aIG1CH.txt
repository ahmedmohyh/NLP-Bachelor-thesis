The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about his life and advetures. But because of his conroversial figure there are a lot of critics about his memoir. The critics are skeptical about his life in Switzerland, his conversations with Voltaire and his escape from the prison in Venice. 
In Switzerland the Chevalier claims that he had huge of money and had a wealthy life. But the critics thus argue about that the Chevalier borrowed money. If he would have been so rich, why did he have to borrow money? For the Chevalier it wasn't easy to handle his money, so he had to borrow it. But he didn't borrow it because he was poor, he just needed money for the beginning of his life in Switzerland. 
Also the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himselfe and the famous writer Voltaire is criticied. The critics mean that it would not be possibly to write down everythink many years after the conversations. But it is really impossilbe? Witnesses can prove that these conversations were real.
