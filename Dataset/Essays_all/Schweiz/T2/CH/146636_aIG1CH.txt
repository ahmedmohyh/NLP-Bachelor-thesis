The woman was certainly against the critics of the Chevalier. She claims that no memoir can be 100 percent accurate. Yet, she thinks that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt still is quite full of truth. 
Firstly, she tries to explain why the incident with the merchant does not have to mean that he is poor. Her solution would be the Chevalier having to borrow some money in order to wait for his great amounts of money to arrive. She reasons this possible solution with the fact that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and that would be the reason why he had not very much money. Although the text says that the Chevalier borrowed consiberable sums of money. Therefore the text and the woman don't agree.
The next point in the text which seems unrealistic to the critics are his conversations with Voltaire. They claim that he wouldn't be able to remember the exact words of those conversations years later when the memoir was written. On the other side, the woman explains that it is possible that the Chevalier took notes at night after every conversation about what they said. Therefore, he was able to write down the conversations quite precisely.
The last invented event according to critics was his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. They say that he probably escaped because of bribing. The woman claims that even though there were other human beings in the same prison had stronger friends than the Chevalier, there was never any kind of bribing. In addition, old Venecian state documents describe that after the Chevaliers escape, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, which would be another thing which shows that he described the events like they happened.
