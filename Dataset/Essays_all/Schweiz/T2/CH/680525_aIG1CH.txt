The Chevalier de Seingalt is an important historical source about European society in the eighteenth century as he wrote a memoir towards the end of his life. However, the accuracy of his memoir is a heavily discussed matter. The presentation states that even though no memoir is entirely correct we can assume that this particular one is a rather reliable source.
Regarding the criticism that the Chevalier borrowed large amounts of money the presentation argues that his wealth consisted mainly of practical matter which he had to sell first to gain money. Whilest waiting for the goods to be sold he had to borrow money. This concludes that even though he did not have money at all time, he had other riches which made him wealthy. 
Critics argue that he could not possibly have remembered every detail of conversations with Voltaire. Nevertheless other sources state that every night he wrote down everything he remembered about the conversation meaning he did have the possibility to consult notes and journals while writing his memoir.
To the claim that he probably did not escape the prison through the rough, the lady states that firstly more powerful people were also in the prison so he could not have escaped through bribing. Secondly, after he left the prison the rough had to be repaired which also leads to believe that the broke the rough during his escape.
Lastly it is clear that even though some criticism han be proved to be inappropriate not every detail in the memoir can be correct. There is no way of knowing how the Chevalier de Seingalt acutally spent his life.
