The arguments in the lecture were seperated into the same points as the text was. So lets begin with the first point. Even though it is written in the memoir that he was rich, he had to borrow money from merchants. That doesnt mean he was actually poor, because in that time, most money was stored in the value of bought things, so he had to sell thinghs in the first place to actually get the money he needed. And this proces, converting valuable things into money took quite some time, so he had to borrow the money because he didnt have it at the time he needed it. And like that there is a reasonable fact for his actual wealth. In point two there is criticised, that one couldnt remember everything of a conversation years later. That is true, but people said, that the Chevalier actually wrote down everything he remembered in the evenings after his conversations with Voltaire. Like that he could use his notes later on to write his mmoir. In point three was criticised, that he probably didn't escape with some nice action, but with bribing. Now that could be true, but we know, that many other people in that prison had powerful friends too, mostly their friends were even more powerful than the Chevaliers. And they didn't get out of prison with bribing. An other clue is, that after the Chevaliers escape, the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired. Why would they do that, not if to fill the hole he made to escape? All of this sounds quite reliable and as everyone took it as a reliable book, it was proven that its acuracy is astonishing.
