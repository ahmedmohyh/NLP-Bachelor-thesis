The conrtoversial issue of the text and the audio is the Chevalier and his memoir. 

The text shows the point of view from critics, whereas the audio want to show the reality of chevaliers memoir

 The critics claim that the Chevalier wrote down wrong thins to make his life semm more glamorous than it really was. The text clams that the Chevalier wasn not rich because he needed to borrow money. 
In the audio the women explains that the Chevalier is rich and he had to borrow money because he waited until he get some from someone, who bring him the money. 

In the audio we learn that the Chevalier has taken the notes from the conversation directly after the conversation and then he captured his notes for years. Because the Chevalier pubished the conversation many years later, critcs claim that it's impossible to know after such a long period of time the exact phrases from the conversation and therefore they think the Chevalier wrote anything he wanted and which has the potential to become famous.

In the text it's written that he Chevalier is not escaped by using a metal peice from prison, critics pretend that he has wrote about this thngs because it's enjoyable to read. According to the audio he really escaped with the peace of metal because after his escape the sealing of his cell had to be repaired.

The text portrays the Chevalier as a person, who just wnated to be famous whereas the audio pretend all the Chevalier has written accords to the reality.
