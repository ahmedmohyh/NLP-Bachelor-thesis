As a first point it is doubted that the Chevalier, during his time in Switzerland, lived as a rich man, since he had to borrow money from a merchant. Althought borrwoing money seems as if one was poor, the Chevalier only borrowed money because he had to wait for some of his invested money to arrive.

As a second point, critics are sceptical about the accuract of the conversations that the Chavalier records in his memoire between himself and the famous writer Voltaire, since the capuring of these conversations for a period of may years seems impossible. It can althought be confirmed by witnesses that the Chevalier kept notes of the conversations and could thus write down exact phrases in his memoire.

Lastly, the escape out of the Venetian prison through the seeling by making a hole, using a metal piece only, is said to be very unlikly to have happened, even though and old Venetian government states the urgance of the reparation of the seeling in the prison room of the Chavalier some time after he broke out.
