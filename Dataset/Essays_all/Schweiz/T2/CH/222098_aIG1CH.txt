In the lecture are three arguements mentioned: Firstly it is prooven that Chevalier had spent a great deal of money  in Switzerland on parties and gambling. But to earn money it needs time. So he borrowed in these period some money from a Swiss merchant. But he was not poor as the critics would argue because he could spend money. And a poor one could not spend so much money even if the borrowed some by a bank. Secondly he took his whole life, every night, notes in a journal. So when he came to write  his memoir he used these informations. So in other words he could, with the help of the notes, remeber the conversation between him an the famous writer Voltaire.  And finally the third accusation from the critics is also usless. Because in the prison where he was there were also other prisoners who had more influence and more contacts as Chevalier had. So someone would have also offered a bride for theme. But non of theme ever escaped. And it is also prooven that the room in wich Chevalier stayed  needed to be repared after the leaving of  Chevalier. With this information we can assume that he coudl have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
