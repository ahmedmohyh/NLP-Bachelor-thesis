The first controversial point is the loan that he supposedly took from a swiss merchant. The text states that that is a sign of being poor while the lecture says that the humongous loan doesn't state anything like that at all. The lecturer even tells us that the Chevalier was indeed a rich man. 

The text states that there was no way Chevalier could have remembered every detail from his conversations with Voltaire many years ago. Obviously he can't have remembered the size of Voltaire's big black Johnson or smelled what the Rock was cooking that day but he could have remembered the important parts. The feminist lecturer also says that he wrote every conversation he had with Voltaire down and used those notes while writing his memoir.

The last disagreement is if the Chevalier escaped through the prison roof or not. The text says, that he probably bribed someone to get out. But in the lecture we learn that even people who's bank account would have easily raped the Chevalier's weren't able to bribe the guards. So considering these facts, the Chevalier made a smooth escape out the ceiling and then probably got a taxi home or something.
