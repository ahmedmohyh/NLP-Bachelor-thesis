Chevalier lived form 1725 to 1798 and he met various historicaly important persons as kings and writers. The text that I have read and the presentation I have heard were both talking about him. 
The presentations was talking about how Chevalier had wealth in switzerland and explaines why he had to borrow money. It was not because he was not rich but because it took some time to convert form his Materials into money. So when he run out of cash he borrowed money. The text said that if he needed to borrow money he was not rich. But that was not the case.
The Text also mentiones that conversations can not be writen down as detailed as Chevalier did years after beeing hold. But the presentations reveals that he took notes the same night as the conversations were hold. And friends of him proved that he was looking up his notes a lot.
"The Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him." is writen in the text. But the presentation however said that olthough he had politically well-connected friends in Venice other prisoners had even more and they were not freed. But old documents show that the ceiling had to be repaired right after he escaped. As a result you could think that the escaping thoroug the roof may be the truth.
As a conclusion the presentation whiped out all the arguments of the text.
