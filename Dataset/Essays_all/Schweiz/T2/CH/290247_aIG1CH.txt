In the lecture, many arguments in favor of the accuracy of the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt were made. Arguments against the reliability of the memoirs in the text were refferenced. 

Firstly, the story of borrowing money in switzerland was mentioned. In the text, it is argued that the Chevalier can not have been rich, as there is evidence of him borroing money. In the lecture, it is argued that his wealth was not consistent of large amount of liquid assets. Thus, he needed to borrow money while wating for this assets to be sold and converted to cash, after which he could repay his debts swiftly. 

Secondly, the conversations with Voltaire are discussed. While the text argues that the conversations can not have been accurate, as the memoires were written years after the Chevalier and Voltaire conversed, the lecture, in contrast, mentiones notes, which the Chevalier took every night right after the conversations had happended, writing down everything he could remember. And while writing his memoires he frequently refferenced his notes, in order for his memoires to be as accurate as possible. 

Lastly, the escape from a Venetian prison is mentioned. The text argues that it is more likely that the Chevalier bribed his way out of prison, instead of escaping it cunningly. The text uses the fact that the Chevalier was well connected in Venice as foundation for the criticism. However, in the lecutre it is argued that richer and more well connected people never escaped from Venetain prisons through bribes. And additionally, there are government documents that indicate the repair of the roof of the cell the Chevalier was kept in, shortly after he had supposedly escaped the prison.
