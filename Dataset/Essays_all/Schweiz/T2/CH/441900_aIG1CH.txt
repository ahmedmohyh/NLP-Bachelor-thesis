In the interview, we learn about the accuracy of the chevaliers life and his memoir he wrote.
The tesx I've read about the chevalier said many things which proof thet the memoir written by the chavalier isn't a very accurate source of information about the history of European society.
The interview explains why the chavalier's memouir can be accurate.
The first argument which is brought up is, that even if the Chevalier gambeled and partied a lot, it isn't a signt that he was a poor man. We learn that when he spends money on gambling, he had to borrow cash which isn't something that proofs his poorness.
With the second Argument they explain that even if the Chevalier wwrote his memoir years after he met Voltaire, it doesn't mean that the coversations he describes are wrong. In the Time, when he met Voltaire, the Chevalier wrote many journals and made notes which is a very good source. Whith the help of his NOtes it was possible for him to recover the Conversations he had with Voltaire.
Last but not least we heard that the prison in Venice from which the Chevalier escaped had to repair the ceiling of the room he was trapped in. This is an argumet that soemone distroyed the ceiling proofs that the Chevalier tond the truth.
In the end, we're not sure if the CHevaliers memor is a hundret percent accurate but be can be sure thar
