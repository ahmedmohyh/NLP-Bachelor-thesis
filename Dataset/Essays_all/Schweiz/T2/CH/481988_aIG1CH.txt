First the woman had explained that our memoire generally cannot save thing exactly from the whole life. The talk between the Chevalier de Seingalt and Voltaire for example was written down years after the conversation. She said that it is possible that he could have known thing from the talk to Voltaire, but truely not everything. About the thing that the Chevalier was in Switzerland i couldn't save a lot. But if he wanted to get money, he had to sell his things first. That needs a lot of time and like this it's not really relistic that he could make parties etc. in this short time. 
What I also could save was the story with the escape in Venice. In the prison, there were other prisonned guys and they had friends with better know-how to come out of the prison. Even this guys could not escape from it. That means it's nearly impossible that the Chevalier could have been escaped from the prison, because he only had a piece of metal. Now it's also impotant to say that the ceiling didn't have to be repared. So how should the Chevalier could have been come out of his cellar?
