The woman who told us about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt said that his memoir was not entierly correct but there are many pretty accurate things in it. Chevalier was a wealthy man who liked to spend much money. He had a house here in Switzeland. If you wanted to sell the house you would have to wait for a few days to get your money and because of that he had borrowed some. In the text they say that Chevalier was spending to much money on parties and gambling so he had to borrow money to finace his lifestile. Chevalier wrote in his memoir also about his conversation with Voltaire. The text claims that these converstation were long before he wrote his memoir and it isn't possible to remember so many details about it after such a long time. But Chevalier wrote the conversation down right after he had talked with Voltaire and while writing his memoir he had a look on these notes. Chevalier claims to have escape the prison through a hole in the ceilling and climbing out on the roof. The text belives that Chevalier wrote that to make his life seem more interesting and in reality he had some politically well connected freinds in Venice. So they would have brought Chevalier out. But there were many other people in this prison who had more powerful connections and friends so it wouldn't make any sense if Chevalier came out and the other didn't. Antother pont is that right after Chevaliers escape the ceilling had to be repaired. And why would the prison repair a ceilling if there weren't any problems with it?
