The arguing follows 3 point.

1. In the text it is said that the Chevalier wasn't rich as he had to borrow money, the woman holding the lecture says that he had to wait for his money to arrive in Switzerland and that's the rason he had to borrow the money first, which doesn't make him poor.

2. The text states that even though there is no doubt that the Chevalier and Voltaire met, he could not have been able to capture the conversation in the detail they appear in his memoir. The lecture woman argues that the Chevalier took notes after every conversation and just wrote them into his memoir many years later. 

3. Critics mentioned in the text claim that the Chevalier never escaped from prison as he noted in his memoir. It is said that he bribed himself out. An argument against this point is that firstly even more influencel prisoners weren't able to bribe themself out of prison and secondly the cell the Chevalier was held captive had to be repaired after him being out.
