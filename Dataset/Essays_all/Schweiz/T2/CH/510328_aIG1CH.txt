The lecturer claims that Chevalier's memoir is a reliable  historical source.

She says that taking loan from merchants does not mean that Chevalier had been not wealthy. He throw many great parties and was also famous for gambling. And he might have borrowed money for cash and not because he had been in a poor economic situation.

Also his conversation with Voltaire does not have to be necessarly fake. It's said that Chevalier wrote notes and diaries in the time he met Voltaire and that he wrote down all the important issues of their conversation the very same day. Years after, when he wrote his memoir, he referd to his notes he had made back then.

His prison break is also a controversial issue in arguments. In the time Chevalier was in prison, there were many people in jail, who were more influencial than Chevalier himself. Even though they were politically more important and whealthier, they had no chance to bribe their way to freedom. And furthermore, sources claim that after the prison break of Chevalier they had to repair the sealing. Why should they have had to repair the roof if Chevalier had not escaped in the very same way as he wrote down in his memoir?
