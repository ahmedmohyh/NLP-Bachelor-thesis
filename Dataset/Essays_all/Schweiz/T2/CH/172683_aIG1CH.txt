In general the text doubts that the memoir of the popular Chevalier is reable. In contrast the presentation claims and defends that his writing is correct. Both used three main arguments. 
The first one was, when Chevalier was in Switzerland he spend an huge amount of money on parties and gambling, but researches have discovered, that he had to lend money from a merchant, so he wasn't wealthy, right? The presentation refuted this argument with the opinion that he hasn't got always real cash, because it takes time to print out money. So he has to lend some cash from somebody to pay for the pleasures. 
The next argument was that he had some important discussions with Voltaire, but he has written down these conversation many years after, so how could he has remembered all these topics on which they were talking about and how he could have written down these so detailed? The presentation said that he had made notes every night and rely on these to create his memoir. 
The last argument they are talking about was that it couldn't have been possible for Chevalier to escape from the prison in Venice with just a peace of metal. Chevalier claimed that he had made a hole in the ceiling and had climbed over the roofs. More likely was it actually that a powerful and wealthy friend had offered a bribe to free him, but this would be a boring story so he invented an escape. The presentation refuted this argument, because the other prisoners had much more powerful friends and nobody got a bribe. On top after Chevalier was out of prison his ceiling had to be repaired. 
So the text mentions arguments whch were all refuted by the presentation.
