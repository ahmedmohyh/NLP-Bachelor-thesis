Both, the text passage and the lecture are about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. They include some informations about his wealthy life in Switzerland, his conversations with the philosopher Voltaire and his escape from a prison.
 
The lecture was about how reliable this memoir is, in their opinion, the meomoir seems quite accurate because the chevalier always had an evidence. They explained that the Chevalier had to borrow money bacause he didn't always get his money the day he expected. He borrowed it and some days later, when he got his money, he right payed it back. He therefor wasn't poor at all. In the article, they claim that the Chevalier only invented that he was rich. They say that if he hed to borrow money, he coundn't be rich at all.

In the lecture they also say that the Chevalier took notes while his conversations with Voltaire. Even though he wrote his memoir some years later, he could accurately capture these conversations, using his own notes. In the article they complain that these conversations couldn't be captured accurately.They say that the Chevalier could't have been able to write down exact phrases only from his memory.

The third thing, the lecture was about is the Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. They argree with his memoir, where he wrote that he escapes through a self made hole in the roof. They claim that there was a report about this case. After his escape, the prison had to repair this hole. In the article they claim that he knew some friends who could have offered a bribe and that he didn't escape through the roof.
