The text claims Chevalier's memoir might not be as reliable as we would like to think. It is written, that he might have presented himself and his life more exciting than it really was. For example, Chevalier claims in his memoir that he was very rich, however there are evidences that he actually had to borrow money. The conversations with Voltaire, that he wrote down, were written many years after the actual conversations, raising doubts on the reliability of his memoir. How could he remember exactly what Voltaire said, years after the conversation? Another reason for doubt is his escape from a prison in Venice. An escape has a nice dramatic feel to it, but a simple bribe is much more likely in Chevalier's case.

The audio extract however explains how Chevalier's memoir might after all be a very reliable source. It explains that, eventhough he did borrow money, that doesn't mean he was poor. His business plan simply involved borrowing money, to make even more money. Also, every night after talking to Voltaire he evidently wrote down everything they said. Meaning that when writing the memoir, Chevalier could rely on his detailed notes about the conversations. Even the escape from the prison seems true, since there were many more important people than him in that prison who were not offered a bribe and there's no reason to believe he was.
