The lecture, unlike the text given, claims that Chevalier's memoir is a pretty accurate and reliable historical source. The speecher tried to proof the allegations made in the text wrong.

First they said that the accusation of the Chevalier being poor are not necessarily true. It was well know that the Chevalier spent a lot of money on parites in Switzerland. And the wealth he owned had to be sold in order to be transformed into cash. Therefore, it could take some time for him to have money so in the meantime he would borrow money from a Swiss merchant.

Secondly, it was explained that the conversations with Voltaire Chevalier wrote down in his memoir could be accurate eventhough, as it is mentioned in the text, they had taken place many years prior. The reasoning behind this is that Chevalier used to write down these conversations each night and keep them as notes. When he finally wrote the memoir he also used his notes to remember the conversations.

And lastly, the speaker attacks the claim of the text that Chevalier made up his escape from the Venetian prison. They say that other prisoners had even more powerful friends in Venice but none of these prisoners managed to escape prison. Hence, bribery seems unlikely as the answer to why Chevalier could escape. Furthermore, it is reported that the ceiling of Chevalier's prison cell had to be repaired after his escape.
