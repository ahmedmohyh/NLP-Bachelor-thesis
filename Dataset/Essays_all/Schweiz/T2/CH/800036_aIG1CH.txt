Memoirs can't possible be correct 100% of the time. However the memoir of Chevalier is pretty accurate so says the speaker. The Text contadicts this opinion.

Firstly, the memoirs mention that Chevalier wealthy but the text above says this can't be true because Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a swiss merchant to finance his parties and his gambling addiction. The Speaker however says that at that time it wasn't fast to liquidize your physical assets, which Chevalier had a lot of. This process usually took a few days and if  he was short on money during that time he borrowed some.

Secondly, the memoirs note all conversations that Chevalier had with Voltaire but the text above claims that it is impossibe for someone to remember the exact wording of a conversation years after it happened. But the speaker mention that he wrote the conversations he had that day with Voltaire down every evening. There are historical witnesses which confirm this.

Thirdly, the memoirs mention that Chevalier escaped the prison in Venice using a piece of metal to dig a hole in the ceiling of his cell. The text above claims that this is highly unlikely as bribing is a much easier way because he was well-connected in Venice. The speaker however contradicts this claim again. She says that there were much more well-connected people in the same prison at that time and they couldn't escape which makes bribing unlikely. Furthermore, the ceiling had to be renovated after Chevalier ecaped his cell.
