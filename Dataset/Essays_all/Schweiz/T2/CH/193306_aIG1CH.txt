The speech claims the memoir of Chevalier to be accurate in all discussed points. They mention the loan he had to take up while living in Switzerland. And in contrary to the text it is said that to have taken up a loan must not have meant him being poor. He was a gambler and loved a good party and for sure he did not only win money but also lost it from time to time. This debts he made in had to be paid somehow and he might have had a lot of expensive assets, but liquid money not so much. So he had to borrow money eventhough he lived an expensive and extravagant life-style. 
Further is the speecher talking about his conversations with Voltaire. In the text it is stated that there is no way the content of those discussions can be truly what is written in his memoir, since he wrote the memoir years after. He is said to make notes about those conversations every evening. There is even confirmation in other peoples writings that he did so. So it is very likely that at the time when he wrote the book he consulted those noes he made years ago and therefore the content of the conversations is accurate. 
Lastly his escape is discussed. There were other more powerful men with friends with more influence than his in the same prison, but yet it was him who made his getaway not them. There is also a documtent from said prison in which is reported that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape. Why would they need to repair a ceiling when the jailers were bribed? This must mean he actually made a hole and climed through the roof.
