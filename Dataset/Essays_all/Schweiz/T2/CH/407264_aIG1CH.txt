The text clearly doubts the accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. Mentioning three particular events that have  been highly criticised, the text makes the memoir seem unreliable.
The first point that is made is about Chevaliers life in Switzerland, where he claims to have had a lot of money that he used for big parties and gambling. While the text makes this claim look questionable by pointing out that Chevalier actually had to borrow money from a swiss merchant, the woman in the presentation holds against that this doesn't mean he wasn't wealthy.
Another example of Chevalier's doubted stories is his relation to Voltaire. His memoire contains complete conversations he had with Voltaire. While the author of the text doubts the accuracy of this conversations, explaining that the memoir was written many years after the actual conversations, the female speaker brings up the information that Chevalier actually wrote down what he had talked about with Voltaire every evening so that he could easily refer to his notes while writin the memoir.
Last but not least, the text mentions Chevaliers controversial description of his escape from a notorious prison in Venice with a piece of metal that he used to make a hole in the ceiling. This seemed unbelievable and hadn't been necessery as Chevalier had lots of well-connected politians who could have helped him getting out of prison. In the presentation, we hear an contra-argument, telling us that there had been lots of more powerful people inprisoned who didn't get a bribe. And whats probably more important: The presentor mentions that the ceiling of the prison actually had to be repaired after Chevalier's escape.
