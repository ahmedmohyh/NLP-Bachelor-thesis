The point of the lecture was to contradict the arguments stated in the text about incorrect or distorted events in the memoir of the Chevalier. The first point of discussion was the fact that the Chevalier borrowed considerable amounts from a Swiss merchant and therefore historians think that he was not rich. The woman in the lecture said that this could have been the case because he had to wait for his money, that he earned, to arrive so he had to borrow some to cover that time. The second questioned part was that he could never ever be able to capture the conversation with Voltaire accurately after many years. The argument against this was that he made notes after every conversation with said man which he consulted whilst writing the book. The third point is about how he broke out of the Venetian prison because in his memoir he told us that he broke out by carving a hole into the ceiling with a piece of metal. This however is thought of by critics as very much unlikely. They believe that some of his politivallywell-connected friends might have bribed the jailers. This is now contradicted by the lecturer because she found documents from the government of Venice from that time. In these we can see that shortly after the Chevaliers escape they had to repair the ceiling of his former cell.
