The memoire chevalier wrote about his life is according to the text above inaccured. Critics claim that he has made his life seem more spectacular through his memoire than it actually was. In the text above for example the author claims that Chevalier was not as wealthy as he claimed to be. He says this because Chevalier borrowed money froma Swiss merchant. The author thinks this makes the chevalier poor. This wrong thinking can be explained through the point made in the lecture which says that the chevalier had to borrow money because he invested money in other things. For that reason he needed money until his investement paid off. The next statement made about Chevalier's friendship with Voltaire is also abstract and untrue. Chevalier always kept a journal up to date. So he also wrote about his conversation with Voltaire and this not years after they talked. The last point which critices Chevaliers memoire is his escape from a notorious prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The author also mentions in this point that he may had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. It is true that Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice but other prisoners had even more influencial friends and those did not manage to escape according to the lecture. All in all it is up to the reader of this essay to decide wheiter to believe the lecture or the text above.
