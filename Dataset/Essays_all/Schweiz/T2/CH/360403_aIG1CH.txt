Chevalier de Seingalt is famous for his long memoir that is recounting his life andadventures.The memoir is very valuable and a historical source about European society. But some critics claim that some of the events that happend to Chevalier are just invented and never happend. 
First of all they say that while he lived in Switzerland, he had to borrow money for all his parties and the gambling. This means that he isn't that wealthy like he wrote inhis memoir. But there are other opinions as well: He just had to convert his assets, which means that he had to wait for his money to arrive. Just because of the waiting for his mone, doens't mean that he's poor. 
Chevalier also describes different conversations between him and Voltaire. There isn't anything wrong about it, there's noone doubting that he ad Voltaire never met. But critics claim that the conversations he wrote down aren't precise, because they were held years earlier. But there where other sources who could confirm that he always took notes and that he wrote a journal, something like a diary. 
Another questioned event is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. For this escape he only used a piece of metal for making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say that this can't be true and that he only wrote it to make the memoir more enjoyable. But there is evidence that the hole really existed.
