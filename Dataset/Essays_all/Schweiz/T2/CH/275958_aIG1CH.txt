Chevalier de Seingalt
It is claimed, that the well-known Chevalier invented some of his memoires so that the people think, he did amazing things throughout his life. But this can be answered by a presentation. They say, that he has a pretty accurate memoire, while on the other hand the people from the text say that it can't be possible to know so much.
When it comes to the second argument, the money problem he had because of gambling during his time in Switzerland, critics get loud. Once again the presentation explains the problem. Becuase it took him some days until the money would be in his hand, he needed some money for that time period. Therefore he had to borrow money, and that's why it is true and not invented.
The last memoir where critics gasped a chance to proof that he was lying was ascene where Chevalier escaped out of a prison cell. He said that he diga hole into the ceiling and that he climbed out of the roof. The critics claimed, that this could not be possible. The presentation covers that aswell. As further reports say, that the ceiling of the prison needed a reparation.
In general we can say that we can trust the history books and the memoires of Chevalier, because all the critics arguments got outnumbered by strong proofs of the presentation.
