The text contains the criticism about the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoires whether the lecture is about underlining the memoires of the Chevalier. There are three stages of the memoires mentionend.
First, there is the question about whether he was rich or not. The lecture says he had to have huge amounts of cash caused by his gambling and parties. The text says he couldn't be as rich as he says because he had to borrow the moeny, but it could be also that the money needed its time to get to his place.
Then there was the question whether one could remember talking to an other person as accurate as he could. He says that he wrote down every conversation he had with Voltaire, in contrary the writer of the text doesn't believe this and thinks it's impossible to remember.
At last there is the issue about the Chevalier's prison escape. He himself says he escaped by creating a hole in the ceiling. This is supported by a document of the city of Venice that witnesses a repair of his cell in the prison. It would be unlikely to repair a ceiling if there was no damage.
