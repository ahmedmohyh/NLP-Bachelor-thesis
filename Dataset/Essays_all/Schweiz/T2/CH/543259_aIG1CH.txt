The first argument for the memoir was, that even if you aren't poor it happens that you run out of liquid money and therefore you need a loan from someone. The argument against chevalier says that he needed to borrow money because there wouldn't be a reason to do so if youe aren't poor.. 
 The second argument for the memoir of Chevalier is that he took notes after his conversation with Voltaire. And there was even a witness.  What speaks against the memoir is that Chevalier wrote the book years after and that there is no way possible, he could still remember long sentences. 
The third argument for the memoir is that other prisoners had better connections than him and did not get out because of that. And for the escape the ceiling was getting repaired thats why he got out of prison. The critics against the memoir say that it is more likely that he bribed the jailers to get out of prison.
