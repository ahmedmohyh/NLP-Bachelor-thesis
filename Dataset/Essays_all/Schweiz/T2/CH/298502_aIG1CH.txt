The woman said that a memoir can't be 100 percent correct but the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is pretty accurate. 
In the text they just criticize that Chevalier couldn't experience such things or that there are some facts which can't be true. As he lived in Switzerland he was very rich and spent his money on partys and gambling but he needed to loan cash from a merchant. The woman said that it is very much possible because he needed money to invest it and gain something.
The second point they criticize in the text is that it is impossible to remember every sentence from a conversation which happened years ago. In his memoir Chevalier wrote about his meeting with voltaire. On the other hand friend of Chevalier said he used notes during the writing of his memoirs so it could be possible that he has made some notes while he was talking with voltaire.
In the text they also said that it is more likely that the jailers in a prison in Venice were bribed to free him then that he escaped due to a hole in the ceilling he has made. But in fact there were othere prisonors which had way more connections than him who couldn't bribed themselves to freedom so it is very unlikely that he has managed to do that. Also there was a hole in the ceilling of his cell which they needed to repair.
