The memoires of the chevalier Seignalt where often critically discussed at their accuracy, while criticer climed that he made up many stories to make his life seemed more interesting other beliefed that everything is true.

During his time in Switzerland, he spent a great amount of money on gambling and partys. However recent evidences state that he had to borrow a considerable amount of money and this leads to the conclussion that he was rather poor. On the other side the fact that he had to borrow money doesnt mean he was poor. As we know he spent money gambling and it takes time until this money comes back to him so it can be that he had to borrow money in the meantime.

Another controversial discussed point was the accuracy of his discussion.But he stated that he wrote down every evening what he remembered. And so it could be possible that it is accurate even though he had written it many years later.

The last point we gonna look at is his escape out from a notorious prison in venice. He claimed to have escaped using a piece of metal. However critics assume that, because he had powerful friends in Venice, he bried his way out. On the other side there were some prisoners with far more powerful friends, who werent able to bribe their way out.
