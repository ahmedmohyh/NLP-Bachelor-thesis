The presentation argues that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt was indeed very accurate and a valuable historical source about European society. In the presentation the arguments for it's inaccuracy are proven wrong. Firstly the presentator argues that having to borrow money is not an indicator for somebody being poor. It is said that payments of the Chevalies winnings could have been delayed and because of this he sometimes had to borrow money for a short period of time. 
Secondly the presentator says that there is knowledge that the Chevalier wrote down notes of the conversations he had with Voltaire every evening. Because of this the dialogue in his memoir is pretty accurate. 
Lastly the presentator argues that it is known the prison in Venice had to make repairings on the Chevaliers prison cell after he escaped indicating that the Chevalier escaped through the roof as he wrote in his memoir. 
In the presentation it is also said that the Chevalier had many friends in prison who had even more powerful friends then himself and could not escape through bribery.
