Both sources have nearly the same informations. But the perspective of them are different.Now I like to compare them.

Firstefull the text above describes the meanings of some critics (and at the beginning an introduction about Chevalier's life and his memoirs). The second one, the presentation has the contra-opinion, though a very different perspective. For example the "rich Chevalier". Critics claim that he wasnt' wealthy at all and that he borrowed money from friends. In the presentation it was told that he wasn't poor. 
If we compare  the passage from the text where Chevalier lied about his conversations with Voltaire, with the new information that he took notes and kept them, so he could use their dialogues in his memoir, we can see the difference. It's interesting aswell that critics think he didn't escape from the prison, because he asked some rich friends for help, even though people had friends, with more money.

These three aspects show us the controversial between this two sources. People have different meanings and attitudes. Both opinions can be true or not.
