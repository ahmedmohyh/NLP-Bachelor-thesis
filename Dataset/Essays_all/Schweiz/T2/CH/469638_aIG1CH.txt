The text about Chevalier's memoirs is very critical. It claims that a lot of parts are inaccurat and even invented and added by Chevalier. But a woman's speech about this texts trys to explain the accuracy of his memoirs by explaining their backgroung.

For example the text says that Chevalier was not as rich as he said he was, because he had to borrow money but the woman explains that his mony arrived a bit later than for other people and so when he did not have any cash he borrowed it from a merchant. 

Another example are the detailed conversations with Voltaire. The text claims that it is impossilble to remember conversations as accurat as he wrote them down years after they happend. But the woman says that he always took notes after the conversations to remember them. 

And the last exapmle is his escape from the prison  in Venice, Italy. The text says that he did not escape himself but that he knew a lot of powerful peolpe who helped him to get out of prison. The woman however explains that there were other people in prison with even more powerful friends but they did not get out of prison and that Chevalier's prison cell had to be fixed after he left and this is a huge sign for an actual escape with a piece of metal.
