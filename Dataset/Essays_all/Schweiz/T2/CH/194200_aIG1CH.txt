I had the opportunity to read a text about the life of Chevalier und then I listened to a presentation about Chevalier. Not every passage of the text corresponded exactly at the presentation. I mentioned here three points which are the same in the presentation and in the text.

During the presentation we heard that Chevalier sold all his assets for getting the money because he wanted to make a lot of parties. He liked also to gamble. On the contrary in the text is written that he was not rich because he needed to lend money. The presentation responded at this point with the arguments that it took a few days until he got the money from the solds assets and so he took a lend from somebody for organinising the big parties.

In the text is written that Chevalier und Voltaire never met each other because Chevalier wrote the text about that night a few years later. But hearing from the presentation they met really each other and he really reminded every single word from the conversation of that night. 

In the presentation the presentant said that Chevalier escaped by the ceiling without any help of somebody else because in the prison where others which had more powerful friend whose could have helped them for escaping. In the text is written the contrary that Chevalier had some politically well-connected friends who helped him for the escape. There came the question out of the presentant of why should a ceiling beeing repaired when the prisioner had already escaped?
