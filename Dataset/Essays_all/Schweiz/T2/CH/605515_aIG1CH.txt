In the text they say that Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant and critics say that if he had been rich he wouldnt have to borrow money. But thats not true. The reason he borrowed money is that he had to wait some days for his money and in the time he had to wait he just borrowed some money to have a good time while waiting. An other thing is that critics doubt that Chevalier had the conversation with Voltaire in the way he wrote it down. They say that its impossible to remember every exact phrase from an extended conversation many years later. But Chevalier kept his memories everyday and because of that it was possible for him to write it after this huge period of time. The last thing that critics say in the text is that they don t think he broke out of a prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They say that its more likely that the jailers bribed him free because he had number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. But in the prison were prisoners that had more powerful friends then Chevalier and on top of that they had to repair his prison room after he got out. If they would have let him out, why would they have had to repair his room then? Its because he broke out by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
