In the essay, the Chevalier of Seingalt and his memoir is presented much more critically than in the presentation I had to listen to. The essay demands the sureness of the memoir because there are some facts in it, that aren't very realistic. The Chevalier writes for example that he escaped from a prison in venice, or that he had much money during his stay in Switzerland. During his time in Switzerland he borrowed much money, says the text, so he just wanted to look like a very rich man. The text also says, that his escape in venice is a fake and he was released because of his influetial friends in venice. In the presentation I had to listen to, the speaker mentioned some documents from that time, provin' the escape. He escaped through a hole in the roof, and there are documents about repairs of the roof.
