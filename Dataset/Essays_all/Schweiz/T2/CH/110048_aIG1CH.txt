The text about "The CHevalier" is criticizing the accuracy of the memoir, while the presentation was explaining that "The Chevalier" could have told the truth in his long memoir.

In the text it was written that he had to be poor, because he had to borrow some money in switzerland but the presenter said that he was waiting for his money and just had no money at he moment. 
Another thing that was said is that after each discussion with Voltaire he made notes. With these notes he was able to write everything pretty accurate. There were some witnesses that confirmed this explanation.
The last point in the text is about his prison escape and that it was more likely that one of his politically well-connected friends in Venice offered a bribe. On the other side, it was mentionend in the presentation, that other prisoners had even more powerful frineds and some witnesses said that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape.
