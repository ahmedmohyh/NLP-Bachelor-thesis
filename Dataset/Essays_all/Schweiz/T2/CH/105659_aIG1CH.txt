Would you be happy if post mortem your life gets questioned in every possible way? Something along that line happent to Chevalier, who wrote down his whole life in a memoir. So is it just a well constructed lie or an actual historical source?

During his stay in Switzerland Chevalier took a loan from a Swiss merchant. However this doesn't have to be a sing of poverty, on the opposite to the claims made by the critics, he still could have been rich and in need of a loan. Since it takes some time to convert goods like land or jewels into money and send it towards him, he had to bridge over that time by taking that loan.

Even though the critics claim that chevalier couldn't have possibly remembered every detail about his conversations with voltaire, it is believed that he took notes every night of the days conversations and many years after, when he wrote his memoir he refered to those notes.

Furthermore The Prison break is also considered to me more likely than a bribing, because in the prison he was in there were people even more powerfull than chevalier held captive. And on top of that there are sources claiming that the cell chevalier was in had to be repaired shortly after his escape.

To sum things up chevalier's memoir is most likekly to be a good historical source, even though some critics suggest it might not be, there aren't any good indications that it isn't.
