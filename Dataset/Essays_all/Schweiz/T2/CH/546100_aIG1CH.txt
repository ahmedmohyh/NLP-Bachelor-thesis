The text says that the memoir of the Chavalier de Seingalt is not correct at all. But in the listening it is said that of course not everything is really true but many things of the story really could happen like this. As example the conversations with Voltaire. The Chavalier explained that every night after conversations with Voltaire he made notes of ehat he could remember. Another example is the episode in the prison in Venice. In this prison had been other prisioners that had more powerful conections and they also could'nt get them out. As a third example they named the wealth in Switzerland. They said that in the beginning he had to borrow money to make great parties but with these parties he got to his wealthy lifestyle in Switzerland. Through these parties he got famous and rich. But nobody knows how it really was.
