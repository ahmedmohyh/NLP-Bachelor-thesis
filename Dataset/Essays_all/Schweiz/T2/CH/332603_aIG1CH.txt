The text and the presentation aer discussing about the memoires of Chevalier. The text claims that the memoires of Chevaliers aren't very accurate and that he had invented some parts of it. On the other hand the presentation told us that everything would be true. The text said that Chevalier was poor and had to borrow money in Switzerland but the presentation explained that he in deed did borrow money but because of the reasen that he had to wait until the money, from the house he sold, came. An other point was the discussion he had with Voltaire. Theere are memoires existing which are documeentig the discussion of them. The memoires where written some years after the meeting and because of that the tet claims that Chevalier had inventet some passages. Important is the fact that there are some difficult quotes in the memoires. The presentation told that Chevalier made notes every evening and kept them so after some years he could still have written the text inculding some quotes. The last point of argue was the escape from a prison in Venice. In the text it says that some important friend of him helped him, nevertheless the memoires are claiming that fleed throu the ceilling. The presentation exactly tell us the same story as an evidence they told us that the ceilling had been repared shortly after he escaped.
