In this lecture it is about the memoir (he recounted his life and adventures)of the historical figure the Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798. He was a controversial figure but he was in contact with many important people in the eighteenth century. So this memoir became a relieable historical source. It is really unusual that a memoir is that accurate and correct but the one from the Chevalier seems to be an exception. Not for the critics: They say that his accuracy is doubted. But in the memoir there are always some things that can be proved by facts. Maybe he added some details that did not happen or invented some things. He componed this memoir using notes that he had written when certain things happened. The woman from the listening says that he took notes and componed the memoir later on. He writes about his stay in Switzerland where he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. He says that he was very welthy and rich then but critics say that he was poor. He had to borrow the money before he could spend it. Another doubted record from the memoir is the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. It is true that they met but the critics say that it is impossible to capture these conversations accurately because the memoir was written many years later. It would be really unusual if each word and sentence would be accurate. A third thing that was mentioned is the escape out of a prison in Venice, Italy. He records that he could flee using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. SO he could climp through the roof. But critics say that there were many other men with more powerful friends. So why should especially he be able to escape? But on the other hand there are some evidence. They had to repair the roof of the cell in which he stayed in the prison. The last part from the lecture is not mentioned in the hearing. It contradicts. So this is whole figure is quite mysterious.
