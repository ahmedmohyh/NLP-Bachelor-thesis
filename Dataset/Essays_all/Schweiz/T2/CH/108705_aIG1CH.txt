The text of Chevalier tells a lot about the society at this time. That's why many critics have a lot of aspects they don't really believe in. The first of those three is that he must have told some lies about the amount of money he was in possession of. He used to write about being at parties to make his life seem more interesting. These doubts can be erased by te fact that he wasn't poor, but he was just making money, what takes its time. So while selling something, he often needed financial support of friends, that doesn't make him poor. The second fact that critics are considering as a lie is that there is no chance that anybody could remember a conversation by heart, which was held many years ago. People underestimate that he was taking notes during his whole life to keep these talks in mind as good and exact as possible. An other doubted part of his life was the escape of a prison in Venice. Some people think he was just using his political contacts in a naughty way, to make his way to freedom. This might be true, but what he tells, and what could be a real possibility is that he took a piece of metal to get out of his shelter by grabbing a whole into the ceiling, until he was able to get to raise to the sky. But still there's no time machine to find out, so his life will forever be secret.
