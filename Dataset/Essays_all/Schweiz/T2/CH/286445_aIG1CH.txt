First of all, no memoir is correct in every point, but the Chevalier's memoir is really accurate and reliable. however, many critics didn't believe him and pointed out why it has to be a lie. 
The Chevalier claimed that he was wealthy while living in Switzerland but he also needed to borrow large sums of money. The woman in the lecture explained the situaton well. The chevalier needed to convert his assets to money. This procedure needed time. He borrowed money for the days, in which he was waiting for his money, but this doesn't mean that he was poor.
Another example is the conversation he had with Voltaire. He wrote it down so precisely after that many years, what made the critics think, this is impossible. But as heard in the lecture, the Chevalier used to write down everything on a piece of paper. While writing down this conversations he has also communicated with different kind of people to be able to write it down as precise as possible.
The third example is how he escaped the Venetian prison. The ctritics thought he used his money to bribe the jailers in order to free him. This is not possible, because the other prisoners knew even more important politicians with more power. But neither them succeded to escape the prison with bribery. The prison did even mention, that after the Chevalier escaped the prison, they needed to fix the roof and the roof was broken by him, in order to escape.
