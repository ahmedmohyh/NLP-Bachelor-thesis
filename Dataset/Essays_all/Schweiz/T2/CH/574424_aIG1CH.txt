Chevalier de Seingalt

He was a man, who lived from 1725 until 1798 and was a controversial figure. When he has started to met famous people also writers and kings, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the 18th century. So he also have some critics about the accuracy of the memoir. he has also invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamourous than it really was. Some of the people thought that he was poor, because he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, so he has to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But that doesn't have to mean that he was poor. The second argument was about the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire, who is a famous writer. Critics has complained that the memoir can't possibly capture these conversations, because it has been written many years after the conversations occured. The last argument was about the escape of the Venetian prison in Italy from Chevalier. He has used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and has climed through the roof to escape from the jail. So he was a man, who had a lot of critics.
