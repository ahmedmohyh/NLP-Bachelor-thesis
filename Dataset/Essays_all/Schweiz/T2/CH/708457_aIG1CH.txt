First things first, the lecturer admits that memoires are never one hundred percent accurate but the points mentioned in the text are all arguments that can be disproven.
In the reading it is mentioned that Chevalier could not have been rich while he was living in Switzerland because he was borrowing a huge amount of money from a merchant. The lecturer though blames those loans on Chevalier's partylife. He was rich, but in order to get the cash he needed he had to sell some of his properties first. Since this doesn't happen within a couple of minutes he needed the loans for the time between the money-spending and the selling of his properties.
The second argument mentioned in the text is that it was impossible for Chevalier to remember his conversations with Voltaire word by word afer many years. The lecturer's response to that is that Chevalier had written down everything he remembered the night after the conversation. This means that he was able consult his notes and write accurately about the conversation even many years after the actual conversation had occured.
The last thing pointed out by the writer is Chevalier's adventurous prison escape. He claimed that since Chevalier had a lot of well-connected friends in Venice it is more likely that he was offered a brible. The lecturer though doesn't consider a brible a very likely thing to have happened. A lot of other prisoners had a lot more influental friends than Chevalier did, but none of them got out and also in old Venetian documents it is mentioned that the ceiling in Chevalier's old cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape. If there would have been a bribe there would have been no need for such a replacement,.
