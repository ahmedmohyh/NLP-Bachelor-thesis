The lesson answers the statements made in the text in a reasonable fashion and with commen sence. It points out that borrowing money is not only for poor people, but for people without cash, which is far from the same thing. Owning for exaple real estate can make you rich, but your assets are "frozen" until you decide to sell. That is why he had to borrow money from a merchant, in order to get himself some time to sell something and get his money. 
The accuracy of Chevalier's conversation with Voltaire that is being questionned in the text is answered by pointing out, that he claimed to have written down everything he could still remmember in each following night after each conversation.
His prison break was made more likely to believe by including the information that he by far wasn't the most powerful man in that prison and other would likely have been freed by bribing the jailers before Chevalier. Also do records of the Venetian prison show repairs that had to be made on his cell, at exactly the spot he said to have escaped, the ceiling.
