 In his memoir Chevalier discribes himself as beeing wealthy while living in Switzerland and that he has spent much money on parties and gambling. But he had borrowed  a considerable amount of money from a merchant. The text states that this is enough evidence to prove that he wasn't as rich as he stated in his memoire. Opponents say that the borrwing of money is explainable as he was just waiting for money.He needef the cash for the time he was waiting. 

Another point the text critisises is the accuracy of his records about his converations with Voltaire. He wrote his memoire years after the conversations were actually held. Could they even be accurate? Yes, others say. Chevalier always noted down the conversation after it was held. He condacted those notes when writing his memoirs.
The last point mentioned in the text was Chevalier's escape from prison.

 In his memoir he wrote that he made a hole in the ceiling which allowed him to escape. Infact the ceiling was removed shortly after his escape which could imply that his story is actually true. The fact that people with even better political connections weren't able to get out of prison would also support Chevaliers story. Many people still don't believe that Chevalier made it out through the ceiling. They think he was bribed free by one of his politically-well connected friends.
