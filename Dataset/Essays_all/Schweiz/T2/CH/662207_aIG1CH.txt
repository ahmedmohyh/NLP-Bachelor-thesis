It was said, that Chevalier de Seingalt was not necessarily poor, just because he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. He was waiting for his money to arrive after business actions and had to borrow some money, so he could survive. In the text they were wondering, why someone being rich had to borrow money from a merchant. They also claimed, that Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember of the conversations with Voltaire as soon as possible and not like the text claimed after several decades. His escape of the prison in Venice  has also been discussed. In his memoir he said, that he escaped just by using a piece of metal. Critics claimed, that it is was more possible, that Chevalier's jailers were bribed, because he had influential friends. Appearantly there are documents showing, that Chevaliers prison room had to be repaired shortly after he escaped from prison. And no one knows from other escapes in this prison, eventhough there were people with even more powerful friends sitting in there, who would have been able to corrupt the jailers.
