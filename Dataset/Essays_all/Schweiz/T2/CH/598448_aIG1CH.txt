Critics say Chevalier de Seingalt didn't always say the truth. They say that he made up memories to make his life more exciting. After reading a text and hearing an audio we'll maybe know more about his way of life.

While he was living in Switzerland he claimed that he was rich but apparently he was borrowing some money. In the text they say that if he had been rich he wouldn't have borrowed money. But in the recording the also said that borrowing money doesn't automatically mean that he was poor. So it is not clear if he was poor or not they only know that he ahs borrowed money.

Chevalier met Voltaire and had conversations with him. Nobody doubts that but in the text they doubt that Chevalier was able to write down the converations accurately years afte they have met. But what they didn't include in the text is that Chevalier made a lot of notes and that he already wrote down the conversations when they met. In that case he would have been able to write it down in his memoir.

The last part that the Critics questioned was his escape from a prison in Venice. Chevalier says that he escaped the prison on his own with a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. In the text they doubt that and they say that the jailers probably freed him. On the other hand the  person on the recording said that not even Prisoners who were way more connected with people from the outside world were able to escape. So why would Chevalier be able to? The person also said that there in fact was a hole in the roof of the prison so that on the other hand shows us that he did escape on his own.

So in conclusion nobody really knows what happened or what didn't happen in Cevalier's life. Even if the stories weren't true they were still entertaining. In the end Chevalier will forever be the only on who knew what really happened in his life.
