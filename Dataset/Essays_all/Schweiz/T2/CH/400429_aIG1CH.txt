In the lesson a person opposed the statements of the text by giving counterarguments to the doubts expressed by the text about the accuracy of the Chevaliers memoires. The lecturer begins by agreeing that some passages of the memoir might be a bit exagerated and that not everything will reflect the past reaity precisely. But she still opposes the idea that the Chevalier is a notorious liar that tries ti convince others of wrong greatness. The person talking discusses all the points stated in the text systematically and in order.
The first point is the statement by the text that the Chevalier might have been poor. The lecturing person says that it has taken some time for the Chevalier to liqudizs his assets in order to finance his celebrations which have undoubtingly happened. To overcome this timeperiod he has had to takeup loans she states.
In the next point she opposes the idea that the Chevalier wrote down his memories of his conversations with Voltaire without notes as a help. She states that there are records who claim that he has been taking notes after all the conversations right away at the same evening. The caims go so far as to say that he often used to take and make use of notes in all kinds of various situations. Thesefore the notes, she states, were a reliable source.
Finally, she answers the hint that bribery might have been the reason for his escape out of prison and not a spectacular hole in the roof by saying that at the time there were people with way more influence in the same prioson that could not escape simply with bribery. Additionally, there were documents of the venician government about a repairment of the ceiling of the cell of the Chevalier after he had escaped. Those are the argument which she offers to support the credibility of the memoires of the Chevalier and to encounter the doubts the text expresses about the reliability of the memoires.
