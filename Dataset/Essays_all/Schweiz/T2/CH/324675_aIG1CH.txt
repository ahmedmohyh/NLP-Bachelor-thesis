The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1789) wwrote a long memoir about his fascinating life and his adventures. He met many people and and became a valuable source about European society in the eighteenth century.
But it`s very important that we control the accurity of all his histories.  He lived for a while in Switzerland, where he spent money on gambling and parties. This shows us that he had a huge amount of money and also had wealth before he came there. But then he borrowed money from a merchant, which could tells us that he might lost money.It doesn`t have to mean he was always poor. 
Then Chevalier remembered all his conversations he had many years earlier. That`s because he wrote everything down the night after the conversation. It`s impossible to exactly remember the conversation he had years before. 
Third there was said that the prison Chevalier escaped from in Venice was repaired after he left. So it`s not sure if he really escaped the prison by himself by using a piece of metal to make a hole and climbing through the roof of if there were maybe the jailors bribed to free him.
