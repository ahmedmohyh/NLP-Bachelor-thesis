Memoirs of famous people who lived a long time ago are often considered unreliable sources, because the content can't exactly be proven right or wrong today. The memoir of the Chevalier de Siengalt is discussed controversial, while some critics claim it to be inaccurate others claim it as one of the few reliable historical sources of the 18. century. The article raises some doubts about how some aspects of the Chevaliers life can not be considered fully true, because they simply seem unbelievable. For example seem some critics to say that the Chevalier just claimed to have had wealth while he lived in Switzerland, but on the contrary he had borrowed most of his money from a Swiss merchant. The Audio however explaines this by stating that his wealth consisted of a lot of owned land. In order to have actual money he had to sell his land first. In the meantime while he waited for his money to arrive he borrowed some money from a merchant but as soon as his money arrived he payed the merchant and had actual wealth. It is very important not to beleive the first critics available, but to compare information before making a statement. This prevents hasty conclusions and accusations.
