In the Lecture, the woman explains that the memoire of de Seingault can be seen as precious historical documents. She then starts to explain why some stories are not as controversial as they seem in the text. While the text sees de Seingalts money borrowing as a sign of lacking money flow, the woman in the lecture explains that his wealth might as well were material and so had to be sold in order for de Seingalt to have money. As with the stories about Voltaire, where critics think that they are not accurate since they were written after many years the two men spoke, the woman explains that de Seingalt had stated that after each night he spoke with Voltaire he had written down notes. Notes that he later used to write his memoir. People that knew de Seingalt have confirmed that he had used said notes in order to create his memoir. The woman then explains that there is a document by the city of Venice that states that they had to repaiir the ceiling of de Seinaults cell after he had fled.
