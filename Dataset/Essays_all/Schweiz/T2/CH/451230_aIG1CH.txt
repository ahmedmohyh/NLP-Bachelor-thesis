That means that he wasent rich at all, but on the other side, we dont know if he had a lot of property that he wanted to sell, to give the money back and that he only borrowed money because he was waitin for his money.

The truth of the conversations with Voltaire are also unknown, because he wrote them down many years later in his memoire and its impossible to write them down that accurate as Chevailer did. But diverse sources tell that he wrot the conversations down every day in his privat book, so he wouldnt forget what he spoke with Voltaire.
