One of the texts argument against the accuracy of the memoir was the fact that the Chevalier said he was rich but once he had to borrow money. In the presentation they mentioned why he did. He had to sell stuff to get money. While he was waiting for his money he was broke and had to borrow money. In the text is also written that the Chevalier once met Voltaire. He wrote down every conversation they had very detailed but in fact the memoir was written many years after these conversations. In the presentation they know how he did it. The Chevalier had something like a diary. Every night after he had met Voltaire the Chevalier wrote down every detail he knew they had talked about. That means when he wrote the memoir he had just to look into his notes he had written in the nights. The third thing the text critics is the spectacular escape from the prison. The Chevalier was in prison and escaped. In his memoir he wrote down that he did it with a piece of metal. This piece of metal he used to make a hole in the ceiling and then he climed through the the roof. In the text is written that this would be too spectacular to be true. He might got help from the jailers who freed him for some money. The presentation knows an answer to this argument. In the prison where a lot of prisoners who had much more powerful friends than the Chevalier. But these prisoners weren't freed.
