Chevalier's memoires have always been an important source for history. But there are different point of views or critics about the accuracy. The text says that chevaliers tended to invent or distort events to make their life more exciting. 
In example one the text mentions that some critics say that the chevalier can't have been a really wealthy person when he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. But the critics of the listenting part say that that it wasn't unususal to borrow money as a rich person back in time. Just because the chevalier got a loan when he came to a new town doesn't mean he were poor.
In example two people argue about the accuracy of the conversations which the chevalier had with the french writer Voltaire. On one hand people say that it must have been impossible to quote exact phrases when he wrote down the memoires years after meeting Voltaire, but one the other hand people say that the chevalier wrote down every time after he met Voltaire everything which he could remember about their conversations.
In example three there are even people who question about the accuracy of the chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. The legend claims that he made a hole in the ceiling to climbe through the roof to escape. So there are critics who say that the story is too exciting to me true so it just must be made up. Other people say that there is an old Venetian document which says that after that the chevalier left the prison, they had to repair the ceiling.
