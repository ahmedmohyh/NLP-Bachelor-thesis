First of all I have to say, that no human can regive every detail from their memoire. There was a special man, called Chevalier de Seingalt who has been living in the 18. century in Europe. This man said, that he could regive all his past. The woman in the listening said nothing about that he consideres sums of money from a Swiss merchant. She said, that he had a lot of stuff he could sell and make then money, Thats not poor. She said also that he had written down every night his conversations, so he has a lot of paperstuff at home. In the text it`s written about that that his pas was written down many years later.
Cheavalier had quit the prison in Venice. In the text it`s written about climbing through the roof. The woman in the listening said, thats it`s unknown why they have to repair the ceiling after his quit, but it`s quite near that there is a relation between the repairing and Chevalier.
