The first episode of the text says that he could not be very rich, because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But that does not have to mean he was not very rich. As he came to Switzerland he had first to change his values in Swiss money.That need a little bit of time so he had first to borrow money until his values were changed. Seconde point was that he did not really met and conversed Voltair. But he maybe wrote everything down, on which he could remember after the late meetings with Voltair. So he wrote the memoir years later, but he had his jounals to remember. The last and third point is the escape from a notorious prison in Venice.
