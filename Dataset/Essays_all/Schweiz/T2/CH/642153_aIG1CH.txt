Chevalier de Seignalt and his memoirs

In the text the memoirs were critisised a lot. There first argument is, that Chavlier describes himself as rich. But when he was in Switzerland he need to borrow money, so he cannot be as rich as he say he is. 
In the audio there are other theses about Chevalier borrowing money in Switzerland. In the 18th century, money was not a resource which was there every time. So Chavalier had money, but no cash, so he needed to borrow some cash money.

Another discussed point of the text was, that the dialog between Chavalier and Voltaire could'nt be true. Chavalier wrote about his conversation with Voltaire many years after it was happening. So the conversation could'nt be right. 
The opposite is, that he actually wrote down the conversation the exactly same day as it happend. And he wrote it as well as he could remember. So the conversation is not invented by Chavalier.

The third and last point that was critisised by the text was Chavaliers escape of the prison in Venice. Chavalier wrote, that he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and climbed out. The text tells us, that this is a nice story, but they do not believe it. They think, that Chavaliers powerfull friends in Venice had aranged the fact that he could leave the prison. 
But as the audio says, there are other people in prison there and they even have more powerfull friends, but they are still in prison. So why should Chavaliers people arange that and others don't. And also there is a remark, that the ceiling had to be repaired. And why should the ceiling be repaired if it hasn't a hole in it?
