Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life. Nowadays, his memoir is a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. We learned many things from this time. But many people critizise this memoir, because it has a lot of things that can't be true. So, the first argument of the critics is his life in Switzerland. In his memoir, he described how wealthy he was. He wasn't poor, that's a fact. To be rich, you have to make money. Seingalt lent a lot of money of other people, so himself, he hadn't money. He only spent much money on parties and gambling. Now we can ask ourself: Is this wealthiness? The second argument are the conversations with Voltaire. Seingalt have met Voltaire, but Scientists found out, Seingalt had written down the conversations many years after they met. Last but not least: the prison break. Seingalt was imprisonned in Venice. In this point, the critics underlined, that Chevalier had a number of well-connected friends in Venice. They didn't believe, that Chevalier escaped with a piece of metal. But there is one thing, that doesn't make sense: After the escape, the prison had to repaire Seingalts ceiling. But why? That's a question, we never get answered. The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is a view inside the eighteenth century. We never know, what is correct, or what is a lie.
