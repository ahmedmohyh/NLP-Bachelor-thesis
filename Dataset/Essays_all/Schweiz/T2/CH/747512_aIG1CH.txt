No memoir can be correct, but this one is very exactly. why? There are three reasons:
1.) When you need money, it doesn't mean that you are poor, it means that you may live in a country where you have to spend a lot of money like Switzerland. Chevalier de Seigalt spend much money for parties and gambling, he lived en extraordinary life. Critics have raised doubts about the memoir, they claim that the Chevalier invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous that it really was. That could be true but it doesn't mean that he was poor.
2.) He wrote every day the memoir down about the discussions he remembered. Like that, he is able to remeber every day.
3.) When he was in  prison, he doesn't had as much as friends as the other prisioners, while the text says that he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice, the place he was inprissioned. In the audio presentation they also asked themself, why they repared the prison cell, when Chevalier thold them how he flew. In other view, the text talks about that he made a hole in the roof with a piece of metal, so it's pretty obvious that they found the hole and repared it.
