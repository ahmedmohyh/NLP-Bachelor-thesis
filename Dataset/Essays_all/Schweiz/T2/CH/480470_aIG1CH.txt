In the text some doubts about the accuracy of the memoirs of the Chevalier can be found. Firstly they say that he claims in his books that  he was very wealthy while living in switzerland but there is evidence that he spent much of his money on parties and gambling and that he borrowed considerable ammounts of money from a swiss merchant which suggests that he wasn't that rich after all. But in the lecture it was said that the Chevalier had many belongings which made him wealthy but he had to sell them in order to get cash. Since this process needed some time he had to borrow the money from someone and sold it back as soon as he had his money.
Secondly the text claims that the conversations with voltaire which had been some ten years ago when he wrote down his memoirs couldn't be accurate since they were such a long time ago. But in the lecture it is made clear that the Chevalier wrote down those conversations as far as he could  remember them in the evening after they had taken place.
And last but not least the author of the text claims that it is by far more possible that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. The fact that the Chevalier was politically well connected in Venice  is supporting this statement. The lecture on the other hand pointed ou that there were other people in that jail who were by far more influential and politically connected in Venice than he was and they could'nt get out of jail by bribing their jailers. Furthermore there are accounts that state that the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired shortly after the Cevalier escaped. Thos would support his statement that he made a hole in the roof of the prison with a piece of metal.
