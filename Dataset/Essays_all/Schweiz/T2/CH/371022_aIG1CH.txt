The text above is about the Chevalier de Seingalt who lived long time ago in europe. It's about wheter the memoir of the Chevalier is true or invented. An argument for the truth of the memoir are that it's a fact, that the Chevalier met many famous people. The conterargument was that no memoir can be exact because the human brain can't perfectly store everything. The text also says that the Chevalier was poor and had to borrow money to spend it for parties. In the hearing part they said that he first had to sell something to get money and so he just had to borrow money when he forgot to sell something. There's another tale about the Chevalier. It's about his prison breakout from a prison in Venice. He wrote in his memoir that he escaped with just a piece of metal. Some say that he had a number of politicialy well-connected friends who get him out of the prision. Other say that he really escaped from the prision because it's known that his cell had to be repaired after he vanished.
