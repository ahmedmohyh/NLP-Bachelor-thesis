In the presentation they mentioned three reasons why Chevalier's memoir is a reliable historical source. 

First of all they talked about the time he had spent in Switzerland. It is proved that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and that he had to borrow some money although he seemed to be rich. But only becaus he borrowed money doesn't mean that he was poor. 

Although the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire, who is a famous writer, were written down many years after they met, it should also be a valuable source, because he took many notes during the conversations.

The last point critics are skeptical about is about his escape from a prison in Italy. After Chevalier was gone, the staff had to repaint the ceiling. And if he really escape how it is said in his memoir they didn't have to do it.
