The Chevalier de Seingalt met many famous people and had a live full of adventures. But some of his stories are controversial. But no one knows which of his stories are correct and which are not. He had a jurnal and often took notes, perhaps about his nightly conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. No one doubts that they knew each other. But his memoir are written many years after, so maybe there are some mistakes, even if he allways took notes into his jurnal. 
While living in Switzerland he spent a big amount of money on parties and gambling. But the biggest part from this money was just borrowed, so if he really had been rich he would not had to borrow money. Maybe the lean is explainable through the fact that in this time you first had to cell before you could get money. 
Some other critcal voices declaim about his stories about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. It does not seem possible the way he told, but even if it is not the truth it is enjoyable to read.
