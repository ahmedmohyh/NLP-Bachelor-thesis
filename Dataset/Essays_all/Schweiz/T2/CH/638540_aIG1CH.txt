In the lecture it is said, that no memoir tell us exactly how the things have been, but they are reliable historical source. For example the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. 
Many critics doubt the accuracy of his memoir, because of controversial points.

Firstly in the text it is written that Chevalier was claiming, that while he was living in Switzerland he was very rich. But it is known that he borrowed a lot of money during this time, and therefore he must have been poor.
The lecture contradicts this explanation. The factt that he borrowed money doesn't mean that he is poor, because his wealth consisted of property and when he was out of cash he needed to borrow money until he could change the property in money.

Secondly, Chevalier wrote about conversations with Voltaire. Critics doubt, that he could remember all those details which he was talking about. But friends of Chevalier said, that he took notes and that he always had a journal with him. So he had taken notes during the conversation with Voltaire and used them later when he was writing his memoir. This way he could remember all the details.

Thirdly, critics questioned his escape from a prison in Venice with his own hands. He wrote, that he escaped by digging a hole into the ceiling. But they think, that he came free thanks to his powerful friends who offered a bribe. In the lecture it is said that this could not have been possible, because there were a lot of other prisoners with well-connected friends who could not escape. In addition, some weeks later after Chevalier had escaped, they had to repair the ceiling of his cell. That should be evidence enough, that he made it the way he said.
