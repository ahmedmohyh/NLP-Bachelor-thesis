First it was said that the Chevalier's memoire is a reliable source of history. About the money borrowing in switzerland she said, it took some time until the Chevalier received his money from his customers. Because of that he had to go through several days without money and had to borrow some from a merchant, only to repay him a few days later when he got his money. It was possible for him to bring up entire dialogues with Voltaire in his memoire because he had written them down each night after they had spoken with each other. Friends and relatives of him later approved this statement and said, he had several notes of many different dialogues. According to venician government documents the ceiling of Chevalier's cell had to be remade shortly after his escape. This is a strong evidence that the story with the hole in the ceiling is true. Also many other prisoners had strong connections to politicians and other influencial people in Venice, but they never made it out of the prison.
