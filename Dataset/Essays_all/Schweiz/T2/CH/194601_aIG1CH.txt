Today i'll write about the presentation i heard and the text i read. Both things are about a chevalier and his life. I will tell you what I heard in the presentation and after that i will make a connection between the presentation and the text.

The presentation was about a chevalier and a memoir. We learned that he borrowed money, but that doesn't mean that he is poor. He lived a wealthy life. We know this information also from the text. It sais, that he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. But the difference is, that in the text critics are saying that had been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. 
With his money he went to parties and lived his life. I heard this in the presentation and I also read this in the text.
The chevalier escaped from the prison. We can get the same information from text. Critics sais that he has well-connected friends in Venice who could offered a bride. 

In summary, both things are about a chevalier. He had a lot of money, went to parties and escaped from the prison.
