The text says that the three arguments, they have talked about can't really be true. The woman says that everything is possible, you just need to know some more details.
The woman says that his memoir isn't correct in every detail, but it is very accurate. She says that he wasn't poor when he was in Switzerland, he just had to borrow money to earn more money. And we know, that he spent lots of money on gambling and parties. The text says that he couldn't have kept every conversation in mind until many years later, but the woman says that we know from roomates that he wrote a diary and many notes, so she says he had written the conversations down every evening and he kept his notes. Also many other prison-inmates had better poltical-connections and none of them managed to escape. She tells that it is true that the ceiling of the prison had to be renovated after his escape. Why would they renovate it if he didn't escaped the decribed way?
Even though the text tells us good reasons why his memoir can't be true, the woman shows us with some more details, that everything is possible.
