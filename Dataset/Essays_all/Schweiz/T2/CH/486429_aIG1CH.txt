It is clear that a memoir can't be correct in each and every detail, but according to the audio file the Chevaliers memoir is quite accurate. In contrast to the text, we get another point of view on the memoir of the Chevalier and more arguments in favour of the memoir being true and not made up. 

First of all it might be true that the Chevalier lent money from a Swiss merchant, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he was poor, he just didn't have his money available 24/7 and therefore he had to borrow money to have it available when he needed it and gain it back later when converting his assets. 

Second the conversations he held with Voltaire were reported and written down by the Chevalier directly and he kept his notes up to date, which allowed him to later write his conversations down in the memoir.

Finally the escape from the prison in Venice is true aswell according to the audio. In the prison were people with much more influent and powerful connections to the outside, but they didn't manage to bribe anyone and get out. Additionaly there were reports from the prison, which say that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired and why would his ceiling have to be repaired if he didn't make a hole in the ceiling to escape?

According to those reasons the audio clearly contradicts the text and supposes that his memoir is mostly true.
