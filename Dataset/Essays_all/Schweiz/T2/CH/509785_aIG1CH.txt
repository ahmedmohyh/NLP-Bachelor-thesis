the text is really about critizising the accuracy of the chevaliers memoir whereas the presentation heared before clearly supports the accuracy of the memoir. It is contradictory to what the critics said in the text but the speaker gives very good evidence and points to strenghten her points made. the speaker refers to three points mentioned in the text: the wealth of the chevalier, the discussions with voltaire and the escape out of the prison in venice.The speaker said that even though he had to take a loan in switzerland it doesn't mean he was poor. It is evidence that he spent much money for parties and stuff and therefore he had to take up loans while he was waiting for receiving his new generated money.
The chevalier was always taking notes after an evening discussion with voltaire. These notes were very precise since the talkings were held recently. Years later he could theefore tell very precise what voltaire said to that time. This was the point made by the speaker and strenghtened through the evidence that people saw him taking notes.
The fact that the Italian government had to replace or repair the roof of the chevaliers room in prison is for the speaker evidence enough to proof the historical accuracy of the escape from the prison in Venice. Again this is supported by the fact that none of the influential people in Italy could ever bribe the pffrison there.
