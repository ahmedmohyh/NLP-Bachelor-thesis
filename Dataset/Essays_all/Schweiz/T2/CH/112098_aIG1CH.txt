Although most memoires are rather unreliable, the one of the Chevalier begs to differ. The text mentions 3 points that are supposed to display the unreliability of the memoir. The first one being him having to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Secondly, him supposedly not possibly being able to accurately remember all his conversations he had with Voltaire, and thirdly, the escape he made being much more likely to have been achieved through bribes.

The first point, concerning his supposed wealth is explained by him having to borrow money for gambling because his own property couldnt be accessed right away. He would need to first convert his belonging into money, which took several days. Therefore he needed to borrow money, had he intended to use it right away.

The second point, concerning his conversations with Voltaire are also easily explainable. According to reliable sources, Voltaire wrote down as much as he could remember about the conversations he had with Voltaire each evening he talked to him. He supposedly kept these notes for many years.

The third point, concerning his miraculous escape from the prison in Venice dismissed for two reasons. Firstly, there were other people, who were much more connected, in the very same prison. And yet all those other inmates were not able to bribe themself out of prison. Secondly, there were records about the ceiling being haved to replaced in his cell after he had escaped. This would only make sense if he really had escaped the way he said he did.
