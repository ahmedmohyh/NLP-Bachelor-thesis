Is the memoir of Chevalier de Seingal reliable r not and is the information about his life right or is he probably a lier?
Critics criticise the memoir at three points. The thirst is, that Chevalier wrote that he was really wealthy and lived in Switzerland, where he gave lots of parties. But he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. The fact that he had to convert assets to get his money, makes it possible that he was wealthy but also had to borrow the money first. The second point is, that there are critics because he wrote his conversations with Voltaire a few years later than he had meetings with him, but could remember the exactly same words which Voltaire needed. Although, the speaker  mentionned, that it was seen and kown that Chevalier was writing down each night after a conversation with Voltaire all he could remember. Chevalier kept his notices and consulted them when he was writing about their discussions. the third point which gives much place to dicuss is his escape from a Venetian prison. He claims to escape from this prison by making a whole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, but he also had connections to well-known politics and critics say that he was offered a bribe. But there were even more powerful men which had friends in prison and had'nt escaped the prison that Chevalier had. And after his escape, the ceiling had to be repaired, what speaks for his arguments. In conclusion, if it is true what Chevalier said, is a question which can't be answered.
