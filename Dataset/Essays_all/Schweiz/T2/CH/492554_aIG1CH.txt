The audio said that the Chevalier de Seingalt wasn't a poor man. He spent a good time in Switzerland and had a wealthy, rich life. So he never was a poor man how it is said in the text on the top of this exercise. In contrary to the text, in the audio it was said that the Chevalier often met Voltaire a famous writer in the 18th centry and conversed with him. In my opinion there wasn't any argument in the audio saying that the Chevalier had well-connected friends in Venice.
