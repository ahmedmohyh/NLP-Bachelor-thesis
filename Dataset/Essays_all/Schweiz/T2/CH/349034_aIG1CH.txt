The woman said that memoirs aren't fully correct but thei're still reliable. And in the case of Chavelier, in his memoir he never wrote that he was poor or rich. It was just written that he was gambling and partying. But to get wealthy he had to work first and earn money but he didn't wrote it in his memoir. And the letters with Voltaire a source said that Chavelier, while he was writing his memoir he wrote a lot of letters. And in his memoir he wrote everything he could remember. But with the escape out the prison the woman said that there were stronger men in the prison and they never succeeded to escape the prison. But in a document of the government it was written that the ceiling of Chavelier's room had to be repaired. And the only logical reason for this repairment would be that Chavelier really escaped the prison. So this could be a proof that Chavelier hasn't been freed by jailers.
