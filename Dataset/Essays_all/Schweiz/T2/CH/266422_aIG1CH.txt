Nowadays, people argue whether the documents of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived approximately 300 years ago, are reliable or not. There are certain events which seem to be more suspicious than others.

One of them is that The Chevalier was believed to be rich. However, it was also recorded that he had borrowed money. If he were a rich man, he wouldn't have had to do that. A possible explanation for that could be that he possessed buildings and other goods, and when he wanted to sell these goods to earn money, he had to wait. Thus, for that time he had to borrow some cash. 

Another rather weird fact is that The Chevalier seems to have remembered countless details of the conversations he had with a man called Voltaire. The strange thing here is that he wrote everything down years later, so at a time when he had certainly forgotten several details. On the other hand, people believe that he had written down the conversations immediately after their talk.

The third claim is that the Chevalier de Seingalt escaped from prison, only by using a piece of metal. If the  ceiling was built properly, it would have been impossible for him to escape. But this might not have been the case. Furthermore, it is claimed that his mates freed him, as he had powerful friends. However, this is not a logical explanation, since other prisoners weren't freed, though they had more powerful friends.
