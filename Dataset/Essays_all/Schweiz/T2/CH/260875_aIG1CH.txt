A memoir is valuable source but the one about the Chevalier de Seingalt has some doubts.
For example when he lived in Switzerland he was said to be wealthy which he was but the kind of wealth be had, had  to be sold first. So he had to borrow money and after some days his belongings were sold. So he had to borrow a lot of money but still was wealthy.

He said that he wrote every conversation down with Voltaire and kept them for many years but it is well known that when he wrote his memoir he used those notes and also used news for his writing which without a doubt changed his memoir.

It is true that he had many powerful friends which might have helped him get out of prison but the other prisoners had even more powerful friends and not a single one of them escaped and after his escape the ceiling of his old room in prison had to be repaired which indicades that he did not escape like he wrote down in his memoir.
