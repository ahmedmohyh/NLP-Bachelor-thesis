The essay claims that Chevalier's memoir is a lie. The text contains three main arguments, which are also the main part of the lecture. Critics claim, that Chevalier wasn't as wealthy as he said while living in Switzerland because he needed to borrow a lot of money from a friend in order to celebrate the way he did. In the second argument it is said that the conversations that Chevalier wrote down in his memoir didn't actually take place because at the time he was writing it, he couldn't have remembered every conversation from a few years ago. As a last argument they say that Chevalier probably didn't escape from the venetican prison on his own, but with help from his friends.
The lecturer has a different opinion than the text. It is said that Chevalier's memoir is correct, even if this is very rare when it comes to memoirs. Chevalier wasn't poor only because he needed to borrow money for his parties, he just waited for his money to arrive after selling things. Also the conversations took place the way they are written  down in the memoir, because he took notes after every conversation in order to be able to write them down a few years later. The lecturer also talks about Chevalier's escape from the prison. Chevalier had friends in prison but there were other prisoners who had more powerful friends that could have helped them escape but still they weren't able to. After the escape they had to repair the ceiling in Chevalier's old room, which is another evidence.
The text and the lecture show two different opinions about Chevalier's memoir, but talk about the same three arguments.
