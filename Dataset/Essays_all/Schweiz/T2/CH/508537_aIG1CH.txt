About his loan from the merchant. Only because he had to loan money doesn't mean that he was poor. The thing is he had to loan money because he was still waiting for his money (it takes some time to convert winnings into money). So in that time where he was still waiting for his money he just had to loan money because he hadn't enough.

In the text it's said that Chevalier couldn't possibly remember a conversation so precisely that he has many years before. But it is proven that he wrote everything down after the conversation with Voltaire. He kept this notes for many years and that's why he could show that conversation so precisely.

Critics say that it is not likely that Chevalier actually escaped from the prison through the ceiling. They think it's more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him since he had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. But it is fairly possible that he really escaped the prison through the roof. For example other criminals in this prison had even more well-connected friends but they didn't get free like Chevalier. Also it is said that the ceiling had to be repaired right after Chevalier escaped. Why would the ceiling have to be repaired if not a inprisoner damaged it and escaped through it? If the jailers were indeed bribed to free him, they wouldn't have to repair the ceiling.
