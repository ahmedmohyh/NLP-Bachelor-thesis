In the speech the person told us, that all of the memoirs from Chevalier de Seingalt are reliable. But if we believe this text, chevalier has written about his life in the memoirs more excting and glamorous than it really was. One more argument against the text is that they don't believe that he was poor, but he was just waiting for his money. Because he's working in a bussiness, where he has to sell his money first, before he gains even more. And just because he was waiting for his money to arrive, doesn't mean that he's poor.

One more controversial action was the thing with the escaping from prison. Many people criticised that he really escaaped from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. They think that he just has written that he escaped cause it's more enjoyable to read, than reading that some of the Chevalier's jailiers freed him. But an important argument against those critics is, that they had to repair the sealing. Why would they have to repair the sealing of the prison if he never escaped? 

So in the end i quess the arguments of the speecher are quite good and understandable but they can't proof that it's 100% sure. Guess no one can.
