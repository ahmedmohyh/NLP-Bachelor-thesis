The author of the text has a very critical view of the memoir. There are listed three reasons why the Chevalier could not have written the truth. Fristly, it is doubted that he was a wealthy man because he had to borrow a large sum of money from a local merchant. The second point is about his conversations with Voltaire, which he had written down word by word. The logical conclusion is that he must have made up these words because no human being can remember a conversation that had happened years ago. The last reason why the memoir is full of lies is his escape from a notorious prison in Italy. He wrote that he escaped via a hole he had made through the roof, where as critics believe he only bribed the guards.
Now the Lady from hearing exercise debunked all those arguments. The first one was indeed true because he had to wait for his money to arrive and so he borrowed some from a friend. The second Point is also true because he wrote  down the convo right after he spoke to Voltaire and then, to write his memoir, he consulted the journal. Lastly, he did escape via hole in the ceiling because certain documents state that the roof had to be repaired in his cell after his escape.
