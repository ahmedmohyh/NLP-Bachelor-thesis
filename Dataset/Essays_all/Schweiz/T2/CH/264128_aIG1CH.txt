Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long and very accurate memoir about his life, which has become quite important for European history. However, critizicers believe that many of the events written  about were invented. For example, they say that the Chevalier couldn't have been as rich as he claims to be, because he had to borrow money from a merchant in Switzerland. But being rich and borrowing money don't necessarily exclude each other, as the Chevalier often just had to wait for money which he later received.
Another thing that critics claim to be false or not as accurate, are the Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire. They say, one is not possibly able to remember every word of a conversation many years later. But people that knew the Checvalier, said that he actually used to keep journals and took notes every night after his conversations with Voltaire.
The third incident doubted by critics is the Chevaliers escape from a Venetian prison. They believe that his powerful friends simply bribed him out. However, some of his inmates had even more powerful connections and didn't manage to get out. Also, there is actually a source saying that the roof of the Chevaliers cell later had to be fixed, which would only make sense if he escaped through that roof as he claims.
