There is a controversy about the accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. Many historians argue that some events from the memoir just don't seem likely to be true. But what we can be sure of, is that a meomoir never is a completely reliable source.
The arguments discussed in the text above show in which points of the memoir historians and critics are skeptical about. Some critics claim that Chevalier was not as rich as the memoir tells us because there is prove that Chevalier borrowed a large sum of money from a merchant while living in Switzerland. But this is not a reason for him not being rich because back then the people had to first convert their money nto real cash. This process took a long time that is why Chevalier had to borrow money to pay certain things in advance without having the money at this particular moment.
Another point in which historians are not all of the same opinion, concerns the accuracy of the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. Some historians believe that the conversations written in the memoir are not captured accurately. But there is actual prove from Voltaire personally which states that Chevalier wrote  downevery conversation between the two.
