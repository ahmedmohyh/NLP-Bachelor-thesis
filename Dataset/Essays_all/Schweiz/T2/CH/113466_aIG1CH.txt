The chevaliers memoir is a awkward in a special way, but it isn't that unlogical how critics say. When we look at these points, which the critics want to proof that they're wrong or unlogical, there are many aspacts which reproof that these statements and words in his memoir are right. 
When we look at the first one, critics argue that the Chevalier hadn't problems with money and he hadn't needed any borrowing of other people. But we have to look at the aspact of the time he lived, they communicated with letters and not with techniqual thinks like e-mail or something. So as soon as the Chevalier run out of cash, he had to send a letter to his hometown for asking to send him money and as long as he had waited for the answer und amount of cash to arrive, he had to borrow money from others. So borrowing doesn't mean to suffer at poorness. 
The second point, critics think these conversations are fake, arent't thinking about his jurnals. We know about Chevalier that he was a person who noted every important conversation with people who inspired him and he loved. When he had written his memorial, he had the notes which were much more detailed and real than writing this conversations out of his memories twenty years later. So it's not that unrealistic that his conversations were like this he had written in his memorial. 
Finally, the last point which treat the escape of Chevalier from a notorious prison in Italy. We know that after his escape, the cailing of his room had to be repaired! So out of this information, it's clear that he had the opportunity to make a hole in the ceiling. It's also profed that he hadn't many important people there who were able to help him out of the prison. So the critics are to fast and they have to research some other facts around his memoir befor they can discuss and critizise his work.
