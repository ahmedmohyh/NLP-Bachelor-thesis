All memoirs can't be precisly and true anyway because we are human. Chevalier might have written in a exaggerated way but some aspects must have taken palce. Otherwise it would be all fiction and no one could prove it in any possible way.
The first doubt is about his weahlth and if he had been living in Switzerland. The Chevaliers were an rich family. They had barely enough money to party and to gamble. However, to spend this sum of money they had to earn it somewhere by doing something. In fact they sold things to make this lifestyle possible. 
The second doubt is about a relationship between the famous french writer Voltair and Chevalier. It was proved that they had somehow communicated. 
The third doubt is about the prison break in Venice. It was said that even the prisonners with the most powerful friends couldn't escape from there. Chevalier had frinds with influence but they weren't the ones on the highest position. He claimed to be escaped through a hole in the ceiling. In fact there was a hole in the ceiling in Chevaliers cell. The prison repaired it after the breakout of Chevalier.
