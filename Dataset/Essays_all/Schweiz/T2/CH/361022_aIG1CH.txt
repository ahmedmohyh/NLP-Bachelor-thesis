The lecture tries to justify the points which the text or rather the critics are sceptical about. The woman who held the presentation about the Chevalier says at the beginning that the memoir is not correct in every detail but it is still a reliable source of information.
For instance she talks about the fact that he had to borrow money when he lived in Switzerland. In the critics eyes this is an evidence that he was not as wealthy as he said. However the lecturer says there is a logical reason for that. The chevalier used to gamble a lot and when he first arrived in Switzerland he already used all his money before his assets werre converted into money.
The next point the text and the lecture do not agree about is the conversation the Chevalier had with Voltaire. Many critics say that the conversation is way to accurate as in fact he wrote his memoir years later. Their arguement is that nobody can remember such a long conversation in detail. Again the lecturer has another simple justification for this. The woman says that the Chevalier used to write notes down for example after he had such an interesting conversation and he would consult them writing the memoir.
Last but not the least the critics and the woman have different opinions about the Chevaliers escape out of a Venetian prison. As the critics see it the Chevalier might have bribed his way out of prison but he definitely has not escaped through the ceiling. In the womans opinion it was defintely not possible to bribe his way out of prison. However there is an oöd Venetian document which says that a few days after the Chevaliers escape the roof above his cell had to be repaired. In her eyes this is evidence enough that he escaped through the ceiling.
