There are many critics about the memoir of Chevalier

In the presentation we heard a non critical woman giving her opinion about the memoir of Chevalier and the critics of the text. She claims that Chevaliers memoir is a very important historical source. No memoir is fully correct, but the one Chevalier wrote is accurate relyable. 

Critics ask why Chevalier had to borrow money while living in Switzerland, as he was that rich and well known for his parties. But borrowing money doesn't necessarily mean that one is poor. Chevalier had a big wealth because of selling things, but he wasn't always reciving the cash imidatelly. So it could be possible that he had to borrow cash, for example to host another party.

And then they criticice the memoire of the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier, because the capture of these conversations were published and maybe written many years after the conversation occurred. Chevalier maybe wouldn't have been able to remember extact phrases from their conversation. But the woman we heard thinks that Chevalier worte down this memoir the same night, but kept them for many years, as he made it with various other memoirs too. 

In the last paragraph Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice gets criticised, because he told that he escaped through the ceiling. Ciric People claim that it was more likely that friends of him with political power helped him to get out of the prison. Anyway, we hear in the presentation that other prisioniers had even more powerful friends who couldn't held their friends with getting out of the prison. And in old venicien documents you can read that right after Chevalier's escape they had to repear the ceiling of his room. 

 can read that  It's a very controverse topic with many different opinions.
