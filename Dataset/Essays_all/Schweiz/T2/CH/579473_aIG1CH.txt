In the presentation they say that it is not possible to write down exactly what happened in the past and to keep this information alive for a long time. The Chevalier is said to have done a few thing which we can not really believe. For example that he borrowed money eventhough he was a extremely rich person. In the presentation they mentioned that he had to borrow money because he had to wait for his money which was on the way to him. They also say that the Chevalier must have kept all the notebook papers where he wrote down his accurate conversation with voltaire so he could write them down in his memoir. And the last point is about escaping the Venetian prison. In the text they say he might had some well-connected friends who bribed the jailers. But there were some other people in jail who could not bribe themselves to freedom. 
In the text they look really critical on the adventures of the Chevalier contrary to the pesentation where they believe in the storys about him.
