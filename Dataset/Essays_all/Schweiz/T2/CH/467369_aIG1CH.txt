The Chevalier did not invent many events to make his life look more exciting and glamorous than it really was. While he was living in Switzerland, it was known that the Chevalier was wealthy. First he selled his wealth to get money afterwards. In that period, where he waited for his money to arrive, he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. So just because he did that doesn't mean that the Chevalier had been poor. He could afford to spend a lot of money at parties and gambling. 
Another thing, there is no need to be critical about the conversations between him and Voltaire. The Chevalier wrote down everything that he and the famous writer Voltaire talked about. Because of this it was easy for him to remember exact phrases from conversations many years later. 
It has been known that other prisoners in Venice had more powerfull friends that the Chevalier had. If the Chevaliers jailers were bribed to free him, then why had the ceiling had to be repaired in his room, straight after the Chevalier escaped? Therefore it has to be true, that he has made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and then climbed through the roof.
