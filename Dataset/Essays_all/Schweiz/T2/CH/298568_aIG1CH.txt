The memoire of the chevalier is very contraversial, because the truth is often misleading. 
For example he claims to have been very wealthy while he was living in Switzerland. Yet documents from a Swiss merchant reveal, that he had borrowed large amounts of money from him.
This proves, that he wasn't wealthy while he was living in Switzerland. Yet at that time he was planning a lot events. To make these parties he needed some sort of capital or investment. Because it took him a while to unfreeze his assets and he needed the money quick, he had to borrow money from the Swiss merchant.
In the memoire the conversation between him and Voltaire is precise and accurate although 
the memoire was written many years after Voltaire's death. The means that the story might not be so true after all.
Many friends and witnesses say that he always kept notes of the conversation that he had with Voltaire.
Also he claims to have escaped from a Venician prison by escaping through the roof. People say that it was much more likely that he bribed one of the guards. Yet historical sources say that after he had escaped the roof had to be repaired.
