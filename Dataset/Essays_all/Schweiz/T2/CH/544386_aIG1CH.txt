Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure who wrote down all his memoirs of his life and adventures. But not everything he wrote down and remembered can be trusted for sure. He wrote down that while living in Switzerland he was wealthy, but some people say that this isn't true. He wasn't a poor man but to get wealthy he had to sell things first to get some money and to get wealthy. As well as in the listening there are critics which tell that the conversation in his memoir with Voltaire isn't correct. Some sceptical voices are telling that Chevalier didn't wrote everything down from the conversation he had with him. He wrote only those things down he remembered. But that all of his memoirs can be fully true is nearly impossible. In the text there is manchend that he had a lot of well-connected friends in prison when he was arrested in Venice. But criticals say that the other jailers had more powerful friends than he had.
