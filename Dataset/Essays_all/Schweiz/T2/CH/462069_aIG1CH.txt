In the listening it was also talken about the life in switzerland, they talked also about the wealth and that the people aren't poor. But they said that they have to borrow money and not as in the text. In the listening they didn't talk about that Chevalier de Seingalt distorted or invented many events, they just said that he has written everything he could remember. 
The text shows us more critics from his memoir than the listening. This is also a big different between this two things. An example for that is that he not have needed to borrow money because he had been rich. Another example is that they said in the text, that he couldn't remember exact phrases from conversations and in the listening they have said that he has written everything he could remember.
All in All the listening shows us a much better side from Chevaliers memoir than the text. In the listening they said that the escape from prison in Venice was the best and in the text they criticed this point. 
There are many differences between the text and the listening.
