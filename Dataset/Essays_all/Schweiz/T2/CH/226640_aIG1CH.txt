Many critics doubt the accuracy of Chevaliers memoirs. They think he invented a lot to make his storys intresting for the readers. So the question remains: Can we rely on his memoir or not?
The text claims that Chevalier can't be rich and wealthy as he claims to be, when it's proven that he had to borrow money from a merchant. However in the time Chevalier lived, borrowing money and being rich was a combination, wich existed. Because after you sold someting you had to wait a few days, before your money arrived. In the time Chevalier had to wait on his money, he had to borrow some from a merchant, so he was able to afford his lifestyle.
The critics argue furthermore, that it's not possible to remeber so many details of coversations, so his story, he wrote years later, can't be true. But his friends and families can confirm, that he had a lot of notes from the time he is talking about. That way it's very well possible to remember many things for years. 
The last point is, that it's unbelievable that he could escape from Prison and that this is aswell invented to make his story more thrilling. Chevalier wrote that he escaped though the celing and in fact there were documents found, wich say that the celing had to be repaired, shortly after the time of his escape.
