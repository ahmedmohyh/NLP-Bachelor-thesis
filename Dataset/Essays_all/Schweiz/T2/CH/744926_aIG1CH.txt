In this summary I would like to talk about the Chevalier de Seingalt and the accuracy of his memoirs. Mentioned in the text are three main aspects of which critics think that they cannot be true. First there was his wealthy lifestyle in Switzerland, second there were his conversations with Voltaire and third his escape from a prison in Venice. The text is very critical whilst the audio is quite pro Chevalier. 
The text mentions that Chevalier probably was not as wealthy as he said he was because there is evidence that he borrowed a lot of money. But the audio explains that you sometimes had to wait to get your money so you borrowed it in the mean time from someone else.
Next there are his conversations with Voltaire. The text claims that they cannot be accurate because Chevalier wrote them down a long time after they had actually happened. The audio sais that every night he took notes from what they said and used them for his memoirs. There are also witnesses who can confirm that.
At last there is his escape from a prison in Venice through a ceiling. The author of the text thinks that he only escaped with the help of his important friends who bribed for him. But the audio mentions that an old document was found that confirms that the ceiling of the prison had to be fixed after he was there so he must have spoken the truth. Also there were people in the prison who had more powerful friends than him but they could not get free.
