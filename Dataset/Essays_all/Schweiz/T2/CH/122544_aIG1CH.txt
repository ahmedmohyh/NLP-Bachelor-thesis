In the lecture it was said that the Chevalier's memoir is crrect and accurate. It's a reliable historical source. Three facts were mentioned. At first his loan. He said that he had much money ond was very wealthy when he lived in Switzerland. The texte mentioned that this fact can't be true because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant.  But in the lecture they said that he had a lot of property which he had to sell first and meanweale he borrowed the money. That doesn't mean that he was lying about his wealth. Some critics said that the Chevalier memoir can't be accurate becaus he wrote his memoir many years after he met the famous writer Voltaire. But the lecture is not convinced. The Cevalier wrote journals so he must have had a good memory.
The third point is about that he escape the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The text sais that this fat can't be true becaus he had a lot of wealthy friends which helped him tiô escape and he just told that sotory to be intresting. But the lecture is convinced that there were others wirth more powerfull firends and they did not escape. Thats why he had done it by himself. and later the seeling of the prieson had tho be reparid. Why did they have to repair it if nobody made a whole in the roof.
