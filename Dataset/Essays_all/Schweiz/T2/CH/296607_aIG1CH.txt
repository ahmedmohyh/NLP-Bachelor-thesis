He was born in 1725 and he died in 1798. At the end of his life he wrote a book with all his experiences and adventures. The majority of the people who had read the book liked it and believed Seingalts stories.
But there is always a critisizer that wants to critisize a thing that you do or did.
One Story tells about the parties and the gambling that he did in switzerland and how much money he has spent there. Critics say that he can't have had so much money because there are documents that say that he had to borrow money from a bank. The other side tells that he could have also borrowed money from the bank even if he was rich.
In another story Seingalt tells about his relation to Voltaire. The critics say that he can't have memorized all the sentences that he had spoken with voltaire. But people who have known Seingalt tell that he always wrote everything down to memorize it better, so maybe he wrote every talk with voltaire down.
In the last story he describes how he had escaped from a prison in Venice. he said that he had used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling
