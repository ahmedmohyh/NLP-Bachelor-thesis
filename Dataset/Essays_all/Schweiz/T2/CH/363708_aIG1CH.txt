Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoir, in which he recounts his adventures and his life, belong to valuable historical source to understand life in Europe in the 18th century. But since he was a rather controversial figure, critics claim, that parts of his memoir were invented or enhanced to make his life seem more interesting and glamorous. Of course, no memoir can be one hundred percent correct, since it only includes one's personal view of things. One example includes, that de Seingalt wrote about all his conversations with Voltaire. The critics suggested, that no one could ever be able to recall every detail of every conversation after so many years had passed by. It does seem impossible to remember every conversation, but de Seingalt himself said, that every night, after a conversation with Voltaire, he would try to write down everything, that had been said, on a piece of paper. He never threw away any of his notes and people who knew him ag, that he always referred to his notes when writing about his conversations with Voltaire.
