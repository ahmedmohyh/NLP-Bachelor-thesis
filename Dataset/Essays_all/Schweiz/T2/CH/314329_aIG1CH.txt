The text is fully against Chevalier's memoir's account. The listening part fully supports his actions mentioned in his momoir's account. The text simply sais that it is impossible that he was rich because he had to borrow money. So  why should a rich man borrow money? The listening says that he was rich but had to wait for his money to arrive and in the meentime he had to borrow some. The text says that it is impossible that he could have rememberred all conversations he had with famous writer Voltaire. This statement from the text isn't based with facts at all. But the listening says that Chevalier took notes while speaking with Voltaire, which seems very strange but at least it would explain why he could remember the conversations. The last thing the text mentions is that he did not escape prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They say that his jailers were bribed to free him because Chevalier had a lot of  friends which were politicians. At least this statement is based with facts. But on the other hand the listening says that he infact did escape by using a piece of metal. They say that shortly after the escape the prison had to repair the ceiling in his cell. This statement is based with facts too. In the end I have to say that I trust the listening more than the text because the text hardly mentions any facts.
