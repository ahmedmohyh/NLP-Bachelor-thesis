The Chevalier's first doubtful story is about partying and gambling a lot in switzerland. The text says that he was thought to be poor and that he had to borrow sums of money. In the presentation they said that he had to borrow this money, because you always need someting to start your business. The conversation between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire is thought to be manipulated over the years by the text. There is a huge difference between the original and the reproduction of the conversation. However the presentation says that Chevalier had always written down notes for his memoir and that he had also used them to write about this cnversation. The third doubtful adventure was his escape from the prison in Venice. While the text thinks about bribery, the presentation says that bribery was't possible and that the story with the hole in the ceiling is true, because after he had escaped, they had to renew the cell.
