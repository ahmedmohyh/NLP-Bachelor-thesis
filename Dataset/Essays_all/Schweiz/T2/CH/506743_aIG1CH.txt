While in the text about the memoire of Chevalier de Seingalt the points of the critics are listed, the heard speech is pointing out the correctness of his writig.

Firstly, the speech doesn't see Chevalier's statement about having been wealthy as wrong claim of Chevalier. The speech trys to explains that he wasn't poor at all because they seem to know that he spent a lot of money on Partys and other things alike and the reason why he had to borrow money was simply because he spent so much that while he was waiting for his own to arrive he had to have some money borrowed to help him out.

The second point takes a link to the dialogue he had with Voltaire from which he seems to have written theire conversations years after it took place. While critics in the text seem to be sure that after all that time you can't write an accurate conversations of what they talked about, the speech claims that he took notes already the night they talked together. 

At last, the speech sees his escape from the prison in Venice as accurate as well because if it has happend as critics claim the ceiling in his cell would't have got to be repaired afterwards. So they seem to believe that it was bribery in contrast to the statements of the critics in the text.

In conclusion the speech seems to revidate the statements of the critic point of view. But because they know to fade each others argument on a topic of a person which is already dead for a long time so in consequences he can't be asked, they won't come to a point of unity.
