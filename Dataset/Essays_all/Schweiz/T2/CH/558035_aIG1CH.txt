It's said that Chevalier de Seingalt destroyed events in his life by writing his memoir that his life seems more exciting. Critics say that he changed what he did in his life time. In the text and in the audio are mentioned three arguments.
First, Chevalier couldn't be that rich as he says in his memoir. In the text i's said that he had to borrow a lot of the money he used to  spent on parties and gambling. The audio otherwise says, that he wasn't poor, he just had to wait until the borrowed money came.
Secondly, Chevalier wrote that he met Voltaire. In the text is written that crtitics say that they never met. It's impossible to remember the exact phrases. In the audio is mentionned that they culd have met. Chevalier just made notes during the meeting. So hecould remember.
Lastly, Chevalier wrote about his escape fromprison in Venice. He wrote that he escaped through the window.Critics say that he just had friends under the jailers that helped him to get out. The audio critisises that because some other prisoners had higher friends in jail and they couln't escape. Also the window had to be repaired. Why should dthey do that if Chevalier didn't escape through it?
