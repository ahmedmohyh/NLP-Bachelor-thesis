No memoire is in every part correct. That was the first thing in the presentation. It is not possible to write a memoire without any mistake. The Chevalier was not a poor person he gained his money from different tasks and had to wait till he got his money cash so he was not a poor person he had just to wait for his cash which he gained. The conversations with Voltaire had taken place too. He wrote after every conversation with him the important points in his memoire. His escape from the prison was possible too. There were other persons in this prison who had more powerful friends than the Chevalier. 

In the article they wrote that the Chevalier was not a rich person because he had borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But the money which gined he got later and he had to wait for his cash and during this time he had not a lot money but this is not a signal to be a poor person.

In the article they say that the conversations hadnot take place betweeen this two persons because the conversations were written many years after the conversations in the memoire and that is not possible. But Chevalier kept after every conversation the most important things and so is it possible to write the conversations after a few years in the memoire.

In the article is written too that his escape from the prison is also in his memoire to get a good level of tension and that he came free because he had very good connection. But in this prison there were athor people who had more powerful friends then the Chevalier and did not break out from the prison.
