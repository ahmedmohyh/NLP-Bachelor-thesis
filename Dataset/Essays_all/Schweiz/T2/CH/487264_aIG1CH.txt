The Chevalier
Critics in the aricle about the Chevalier say that not all of the stories he told us about his life in Switzerland are true. He wrote that he enjoyed partying and gambling and living in a wealth - but in contrast it is known that he had to borrow a lot of money - so what is true about his rich life? However, the mentor mentions that taking out a loan doesn't mean your actually poor. The Chevalier had a big amount of money, what is proofed, and in the 18th century it took a couple of days to convert all the money to Switzerland where he was staying. While he had no spare money, he had to take out a loan even though there was enough money in his property. Summing it up, taking out a loan doesn't mean you are poor at all. 
As second critic it is written that the Chevalier wrote about his conversation with Voltaire many years after they have conversed. It is impossible to remember every single sentence a person said to you like the Chevalier does, no matter how important the man is you were talking to. But the mentor seems to know that the Chevalier has written down the whole conversation just in the night after and just had to refer to his notices when he was writing his memoir. 
Last but not least, according to the article the Chevalier didn't escape from the prision by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, he did escape because he had a number of politically well-connecten friends in Venice who offered a bribe. But, like the mentor says, there have been many other imprisioned people hwo were more powerful and even they didn't escape and it is proved that they had to repare the ceiling of his room just in the night after he had escaped.
