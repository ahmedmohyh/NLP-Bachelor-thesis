The Chevalier is said to be a great historical figure, who had an impact on European society in the eighteenth century. Before he passed away he had written a long memoir about his life and adventures. In his reading he wrote about the time which he had spent in Switzerland. He claimed that he had been wealthy but critics say that he borrowed money. This does not mean that he was poor. By selling things to other people he had to wait for the money to arrive therefore he had to ask people for money during that periode. 
Chevalier also met Voltaire a few times and made notes of their conversations. He kept those notes for years and later used them to write his memoir. Although he had talked to Voltaire way before he wrote his memoir the writings about Voltaire can be accurate because of the fact that he used his old notes. 
Chevalier mentioned his escape from a prison in Venice. Critics say that this adventure may just be an enjoyable reading and not accurate. There where other people in prison at the same time as Chevalier which had better connections than him and even those people couldn't manage to get out of prison. Chevalier had not commited bribery. They had to repare his ceiling. Why should they have done that if he hadn't escaped?
