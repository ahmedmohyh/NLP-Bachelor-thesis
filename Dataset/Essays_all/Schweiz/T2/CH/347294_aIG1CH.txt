It is mentioned in the text how the Chevalier was a rich man and that he spent huge amounts of money in Switzerland for parties and gambles. However, the text also mentions critics claiming that he was poor, because he had borrowed money from a swiss merchant to do so. But in the lecture, the woman said that even though the Chevalier had spent much money and borrowed some, he hadn't neccessarily to be poor. He might have had to wait for his own money to arrive to him and might have borrowed money so he hadn't to live on the street until then.
The conversation with Voltaire seems to have too much detail in the eyes of the critics. No man could remember every single sentence of a conversation which had happened years ago. But the Woman giving the lecture had a simple expanation for it. The Chevalier had probably written journals and wrote down the conversation just after it was held. Even his friends mentioned him writing journals and taking lots of notes in their writings.
Last but not least, the critics have doubts about the Chevaliers escape of a prison in Venice. In his memoire, he claims to have escaped by making a hole in the ceiling using only a little piece of metal. The critics believe he had escaped because some of his powerful friends paid the jailers to let him go. But the Woman holding a lecture had some arguments to support the Chevaliers side of the story. She said that there were other prisoners with more powerful friends in that prison, and that they weren't bribed out. Also, it was mentioned somewhere that the ceiling in the Chevaliers cell had to be repaired afterwards. It couldn't have been repaired if there hadn't been a hole in it, could it?
