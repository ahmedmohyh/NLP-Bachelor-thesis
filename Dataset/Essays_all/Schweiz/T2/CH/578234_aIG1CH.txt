The voice document mentioned that Chevalier was pretty famous. We know from historiqual sources that Chevalier lived in Switzerland. He also was a quite wealthy person. He made huge parties and did a lot of gambling in his leisure. Those parties and gambling evenings were very expensive, so he often borrowed money from friends or banks. The text above says that some critics have raised doubt about the avvurancy of the memoir of Chevalier. It is written, that Chevalier wasn't wealthy, because he has to borrow all the time money.

A secound argument is that Chevalier and Voltaire met and conserved. But it exists something like a diary of Chevalier. In this diary he wrote the conversation with Voltaire each night down. But those conversations were written many years after the coversations occured.

The last point is that Chevalier was arrested in a prison. But he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. The speaker of the voice document also has a proof, that this really happend. The proof were som old documents, that the ceiling had been repaired. In the text it is written that Chevalier has bribed jailers to free him. But this isn't true, because other inmates also have political friends and a lot of money to bribe a jailer.
