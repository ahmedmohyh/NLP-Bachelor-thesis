Chevalier

In the story the talk about Chevalier glamourous and exciting life.I will write a short summary about his story.

Chevalier de seingalt spent a lot of his money for parties and gamling.In the story they told us that he borrowed money from a Swiss mercchant. The question is why he had borrowed money if he had been very rich.
Critics are skeptical about a conversation between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire.They think it's impossible to rewrite exactly the same phrases of the conversation because they wrote the story many years later. 


At the end he escapes from the prison in venice. Whit a peace of metal he punched a hole in the ceiling and climbed out of it. They had to repair the ceiling.
