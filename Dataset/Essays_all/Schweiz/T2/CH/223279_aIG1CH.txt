First the woman said that the memoir is very specific and belivable. In the article is written down, that the autor is not sure about the rightness of the memoir. 
First in the speaking part the woman explained the trip to Switzerland and why the Chevalier had to borrow himself money from a swiss merchant. She said that he had to wait for his money to get new one from his banc in his hometown because he spent so much in the beginning with having paties and stuff. In the article it seems like the autor cannot believe why a rich man needs to borrow himself money and is not sure if the Chevalier really was as rich as he said. 
Second the woman was talking about his frindship with Voltaire and their night conversations. She said that it is really possible the Chevalier remembered himself of these coversations so he was able to write it down. In the article the autor is not sure if it was easy for the Chevalier to remembered himself of these coverstions and is very critical again. 
In the end the woman was talking about his escape from the prison in Italy. She said that after he escaped his cell have to be repaired so it is possible he escaped the way he wrote down in his memoir. Also because he had not the most influenced friends to free him. In the article the autor is again very critical and cannot believe the way the Chevalier explained his escape from prison. 
The whole article is written down very very critical and not very positive about the way the Chevalier had written his memoir. On the other hand the speaking part is very positive for the Chevalier and trusted him about the way he wrote his memoir.
