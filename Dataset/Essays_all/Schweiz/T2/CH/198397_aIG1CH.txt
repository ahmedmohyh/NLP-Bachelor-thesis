The arguments from the presentation were, that the Chevalier is poor. Furthermore the Chevalier wrote down all about he could remember about the conversations and escaped from an prison. In Switzerland the Chavaliers are rich and sometimes have waiting for their money.

This presentation critisize the text, because in the presentation the Chevalier (of Switzerland) is represented as poor and the text says, that the Chevalier was rich. To adjust, the presentation talked about the Chevalier who wrote down all about the conversations and the text says, that the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, wrote down all about his life, special the adventures he had. There are not only differents between this two sources. Both sources say, that he escaped from a prison.

To summarise these to sources, we can say, that the "Story of the Chevalier" in both sources is simular but there are some different points of view.
