Chevalier de Seingalt is a very controversial person. There is and was much gossip about him and his person and many stories are told about him. You could say that he is a liar and highstacker because many people say that he invented the stories about his life to be looked as a very interesting person and that his life looks more exciting. The presentation about him was a statement for him. That nearly all of his stories happend and that also the connection with Voltaire is correct. His gambling and spending money was explained that Chevalier had much money but he had to wait for it so he asked a friend to borrow him some money but he paid it back and that has nothing to do with beeing very rich or not. The escape from Venice looks very suspicious but there is the fact that after Chevalier was in prison the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired. And I do not think you repair a ceiling just for fun. If you look at this facts it seems to be confirmed that the story about Chevalier in Venice is correct. It is difficult to confirm the other stories about him but is not in every fairy a little bit of truth in it?
