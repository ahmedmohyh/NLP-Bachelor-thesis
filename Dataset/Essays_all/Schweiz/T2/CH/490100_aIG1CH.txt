The Chevalier was someone who lived in the eighteen century in Europe and wrote memoirs about his eventful life. The controversy whether his memoirs tell the truth or are just a good novel is ongoing until today, let me show you on one out of the three examples, I got to hear and read:
The first expamle is the one I'd like to discuss about his life in Siwtzerland. The Chevalier wrote down, he was a wealthy man and din't have any problems with his finances. What both sides agree on is that he was a gambler and that he did borrow money to finance this lifestyle. The motives otherwise seem to be far apart from each other. While some say he's borrowing is a sign for his poorness, others say he was wealthy in another way. Supporters claim he owned a lot of poverty and had to sell it, while waiting for the cash he lend some money so he could afford his lifestyle and paid it back as soon as he got the money.
So it's clear to see that the opinions n Chevalier'rs memoire are very diverted.
