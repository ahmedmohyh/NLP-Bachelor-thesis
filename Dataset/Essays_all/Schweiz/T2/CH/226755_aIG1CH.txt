The presentation and the text do not agree with each other: In the text the critics do not believe that the Chevalier was wealthy, because he had to borrow some money. But the presentation shows that the Chevalier had the money, he just had to wait until his asset arrived. Also, the critics have questioned his exact memories of the conversation between him and the famous writer Voltaire. Instead, the counterargument of the presenation says that the Chevalier always took some notes after their discussions, so he could easily just look up in these as he was writing his memoir. The last memoir the critics doubt is that the Chevalier could escape the prison in Venice by only using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Nevertheless, the presentation disagrees and argues with the arguement that, after the Chevalier escaped, the prison of Venice had to repair the roof in the room, where he was captured.
