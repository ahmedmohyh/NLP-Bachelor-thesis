With the presentation the woman wants to show that the critics, which are mentioned in the text, don't have evidence and that it's wrong to ciritisize Chevalier's memoir. In the text there are mentioned three different points of criticism. The first critic was about Chevalier's time in Switzerland and how rich he was. In the text they mention that if he would have been as rich as it stands in his memoir, he wouldn't have needed to borrow money. The woman says that you can't say that a person who has to borrow things is evidently a poor human. Because when you spent a lot of money you have to sell other things and till you get the money for that, you might have to borrow some money. On the second critic, that it's impossible to remember exact phrases from conversations held many years earlier, she responds with the argument, that the Chevalier wrote down everyday what happened, so he was able to write the memoir many years later. On the third critic about the story with the Venetian prison, she arguments in the presentation, that there were other prisoners with much more powerful friends and that the ceiling in his room also had to be repaired after he left. So it's evident that he broke out of the prison.
