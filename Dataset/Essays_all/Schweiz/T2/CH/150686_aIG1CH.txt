In the lecture, the focus lays on three main arguments about the memoir of the Chevalier. While the text extract is very critical about his memoir, the lecture supports Chevalier and his opinions. 
Going in detail of the first argument, the lectrice says that he was wealthy and just had to borrow money to cover the periods whenever he had to sell his assets. On the other hand, the text extracts claims that he would not have needed to borrow money if he really had been rich.
The lectrice claims that Chevalier wrote down some notes every night after each conversation with Voltaire and therefore was able to refer to the conversations in his memoir. The text complains about the impossibility of capturing the conversations so exactly.
Last but not least, there is Chevaliers escape from the notorious prison in Venice. While critics are claiming that the escape was only possible due to bribery, the lecture is claiming the opposite. At the same time, there were people imprisoned with much more powerful friends and they were not able to escape. In addition, they had to repair the sealing after Chevalier's escape.
