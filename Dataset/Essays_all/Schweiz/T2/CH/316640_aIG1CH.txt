The lecture said, it is true that no memoir can be exacly accurated, nevertheless the memoir of the chevalier is a good source for historical.
We know the chevalier was spending his time and his money in Switzerland on gambling and parties. He was rich, thereforw he could allowed himself to do such things. But he did not have the money in cash, he had goods. So to pay what he lost by gambling, he had to sell his goods. And at the 18th century, it took time to get money in cash - you could not simply go to the bank like today. So the Chevalier had to borrow money, for this time. But it does not mean he was not rich.
No doupt the Chevalier wrote his memoir long after having discussed with Voltaire. In fact, he was writing down there conversation after each meeting, therefore, it was not difficult for him to write so accurately what the famous authore said.
In Italie, we know that other prisoners had hight relations, but they did not escape - only the Chevalier did. Moreover, the cell where he was, had to be repaired. So, why should it be repaired if he did not break out like he discribe?
