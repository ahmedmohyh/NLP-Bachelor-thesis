In the text the accuracy of the memoir was questioned. In the presentation however, the woman reasured that the memoir is very accurate and that it can be used for research in history. After that she refered to three controversial aspects of the memoir. Firstly, she explained that Chevalier was not exaggerating when it came to his wealth. Just because Chevalier sometimes had to wait for his money to arrive does not mean that he was poor. Secondly, she argues that Chevalier used to take notes after every conversation with Voltair and that he wrote down everything that he could remember. When writing the memoir he relied on these notes. This is why according to her, the critics who say that Chevalier could not possibly memorize the conversations accurately after so many years are wrong. Thirdly, according to critics, Chevalier could only escape because he bribed the jailers. The woman in the recording however believes Chevalier's story of climbing through a hole in the ceiling because, first of all, there was actually a hole in the ceiling to be repaired and secondly, there were more wealthy people with important connections in prison, but they still were unable to bribe the jailers to free them. She therefore concludes that Chevalier would not have been able to achieve exactly that.
