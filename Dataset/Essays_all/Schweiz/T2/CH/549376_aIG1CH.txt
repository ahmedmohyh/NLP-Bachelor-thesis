The woman who just held her presentation used those arguments:

First of all the woman claimed that borrowing money had nothing to do with being poor. The Chevalier had to take a loan beacause he hadn't any cash left. 

Her second argumet was, that the Chevalier could remember his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire because he wrote everything down the night after the conversation. She claims he often used his notes and diaries while writing his memoir. 

The third and last point she mentioned was the ecsape from the prison in Venice. She is sure a bribary never happend because there were people in the same prison with far more influence than he had. And she claims that there are reports of a reperation of the ceiling of his cell.
