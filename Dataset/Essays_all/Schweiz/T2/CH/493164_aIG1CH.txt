In the presentation the woman claims that the memoir of Chevalier is pretty accurate. She explains that Chevalier spent a lot of money with parties and gambling in Switzerland and then he had to borrow some because he had run out of cash. But that didn't mean as it is said in the text that he was poor.
Furthermore she tells us that Chevalier wrote down the whole conversations with Voltaire every evening. He was able to capture the exact phrases ,to answer to the text, because he kept those notes.
To the escape from the Venetian prison the text proposes bribery as the solution. But according to the woman there were many other people in this prison with more politically well-connected friends that could offer a bribery and they couldn't escape. In addition to that the ceiling of the room where Chevalier was before had to be repaired. That goes along with Chevaliers history about escaping through a hole in the ceiling.
