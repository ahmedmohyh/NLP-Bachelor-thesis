The lecture states that though many memoirs are not quite accurate Chevalier's would be one that is very accurate and an important historical source. There are many claims that some of the events he wrote about would not have happened in the way he describes them. 
For example he claims that he was very wealthy while living in Switzerland and that he spent a lot of money there. But there is evidence that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant at the time. However in the lecure the woman says that not having money at the time did not mean one was not wealthy and that Chevalier could have simply been waiting for his resources to be converted money and therefore had to borrow money from the merchant.
Also claimed to be inaccurate are the conversations he apparently held with the famous writer Voltaire as he wrote them down many years afterwards. Critics claim that he could not possibly remember exact phrases after such a long time. The woman holding the lecture on the other hand claims that after every conversation he wrote down immediately everything he could remember and that he wrote about them in the memoir based on his notes. There is also evidence  of witnesses having seen these and other notes.
Another incidence which according to critics is made up is Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice. In his memoir he claims to have escaped by making a hole in the ceiling. He is known to have many wealthy friends in Venice so critics think he got out of prison thanks to bribery. The woman however sas that bribery was no option in that prison as other prisoner who had even more powerful friends could not get out of prison. Also there are records of the ceiling having to be repaired.
