The text said that the memoir is not accurate because he invented many things. But the lecturer told us that there are no doubs about the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir.

Firstly the text informed us about the critics that claimed he wasn't rich at all because he had to borrow a lot of money while he was in Switzerland. The lecturer explained that, he had to borrow money because he had to wait for the money to be transferred. He earned this money by selling houses and areas he owned in Switzerland.

Secondly the text talked about the critics that raised about the conversation Chevalier had with Voltaire. The opposers say that it's impossible to remember conversations that found place years ago. In the lecutr we get informed, that Chevalier hadn't wrote his memoir from his memory but that he consulted notes he made, for example the ones he made at this conversation he had with Voltaire.

Thirdly the text tells us that it wasn't true that he escaped from the prison in Venice. Instead he brieb his way out of there. The argument of the lecuturer says that it's impossible he brieb his wa out of prison, because they were much more powerful people in prison who couldn't bribe their way out with the powerful friends they had. In the lecturers view it's ver likely that he escaped from prison, because after he did, they had to repair the ceiling of his cell. And why do that if nobody escaped from there?
