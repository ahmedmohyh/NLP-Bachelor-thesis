The text and the hearing were about a person, Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote a book about his life. The text and the hearing have one big different, then in the text they doesn't believe, that the situation who being written in the book are real and the hearing says that they are true but maybe a little crazy. 
They gave three exemples in the text and in the hearing. The first one. In the book is written, that he had a good wealth, but he had to borrow money, that means that he is poor. The hearing said agianst this statement, that he isn't poor he only have to sell first before he get money. After that he get money and a good wealth.
Another exemple is about his escape of the prison. In the book it is being written, that he escape through a roof but the text finds that this story is to crazy to be true and they think that the Chevalier had well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. The hearing replied to this statement, that it could be true because other prioners have even more politically well-connected friends and they also didn't get offered a bribe. After this text and this hearing, we don't knwo who is right. Is the book only a book with a nice story or is it really the life of the Chevalier?
