First of all it has to be said that the two sources agree on the accuracy of the data available. However the women from the lecture disagrees with the interpretation of source one. Her first point was that the Cavalier had a lown beacuse in short term he ran out of money. She argues that a poor persone would not be able to actually get a lown in a Swiss bank. I quote:"first you have to have the money". 
Moreover the woman from the lecture talkes about the conversation records which have been a topic in source one. She states that there are time witnesses whose confirmed that such notes had been done by the Chevalier de Seingalt.
The third point where they had differences was the argument about the prison break in the famous and notorious prison in Venice. Source one argues that the Chavalier had bribed his way out o the prison with the help of ric and powerfull friends outside. However in the lecture we learned that other prison inmates had had even more powerfull and richer contacts outside the prison, which makes it very unlikely that the Cavalier was able to briebe his way out. Moreover she give a further resource of this document where it is written that the roof had been redone after the Chavalier was able to break out of the prison.
