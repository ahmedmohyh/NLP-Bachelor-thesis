In the lecture about the life of Chevailier de Seingalt the woman explains why some of the doubts of the critics are unreasonable. She also claims that even though some details might not be completly right, the memoir of Chevalier would still provide an accurate historical source.

First of all, the question about Chevaliers wealth. The woman claims that he did spend a great deal of money on paries and gambling. However, just because he had to borrow money that doesn't necessarily mean that he was poor. It is very likely that he had to exchange his assets into money and then had to wait until his money arrived. 

Furthermore, critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltair. To that doubt the woman in the lecture argues that each night Chevalier would write down the converstation between him and Voltaire since they met multiple times. In addition, eye witnesses saw him consulitng letters and notes many times while writing the memoir. 

Another doubt of the critics is that Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy is not as spectacular as described. Chevalier claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics claim it was more likely that he bribed the jailers. The woman in the lecture however, argues that they were far more poweful people in the prison in not even they would be able to bribe their way out of prison. In addition, records of the prison mention that after Chevalier's escape the celling of his prison cell had to be repeared.
