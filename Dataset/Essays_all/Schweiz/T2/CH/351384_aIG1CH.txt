Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure. He was born in 1725 and died in the year 1798 and during his life he met many important people like kings or writers. Toward the end of his life he wrote a long memoire.  Sure a memoir is never to 100 percent correct, but there are some critics  that doubt that  ewerything he has written is right. They think he invented events to make his life more exciting and glamorous than it really was. The following three examples shows that their is space for critics but also proves that say that Chevaliers memoir could be correct. 

First the text claims that Chevalier wasn't rich, as mentioned in the memoir. Because he had to borrow money while he lived in Switzerland. But in these centuries it took long untill you get the money, you have earnt. In reallity he was rich and had wealth but he had to borrow money until he get his own. Which took not long, he borrow it just for a short time.

Another event that the critics like to explain about is that his memoir is too exactly. It contains accurately conversations with Voltaire. They think it is not possible to remember everlyy detail from a conversation that happend three years ago. But it is known that Chevalier wrote things down after every conversation and while he wrote his memoire he had consulted these notes.

ANother thing critics are sceptic about is Chevaliers escape from the prison. They say it's not possible to make a hole in the ceiling and climbe through the roof. The think he had powerful friends in Venice that had offered him a bribe. But there were other men in the prison with more powerful freinds that hadn't a bribe and after Chevalier was out of the prison they had to repare the ceiling.
