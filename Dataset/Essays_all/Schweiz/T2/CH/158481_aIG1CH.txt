The text passage shows that the memoirs of the Chevalier raises many critics and doubts but the spoken text claims on a very high accuracy of them. The three episodes are heavily critizised in the written text, the spoken part mentioned that all the episodes are reliable. The first critics in the text is about the questionnable wealth of the Chevalier during his living in Switzerland since evidences say that he had to borrow money. In the spoken part they explain that this is due to his great spend of money to parties and gambling and that he had to whay for new money so he had to borrow some. The second episode is the unclear accuracy of the conversations with Voltaire in his memoirs. The critics can't believe that the Chevalier would be able to remember the sentences still by heart after many years. The spoken text is again controverse to these critics since they rely on the unclear fact that the Chevalier had written down every single conversation with Voltaire right after this happend and so he was able to rewrite the sentences after many years in between. The third critizised part in the memoirs is his escapement from a prison in Venice. The Chevalier wrote that he was able to escape due to a hole in the ceiling by using a piece of metal. Critizier believe that it is more logical that he became free because of his connections with political friendships. In the spoken text is not possible since other prisoner at this time had more and stronger connections than the Chevalier. And although his method described in the memoirs sounds weird the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired at this time what is quite plausible if the the Chevalier had escaped on his way.
