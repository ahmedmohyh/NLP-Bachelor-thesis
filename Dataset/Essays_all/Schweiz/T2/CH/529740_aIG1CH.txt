It is possible that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is based on true events and did not invent anything to make the impression that his life was more glamourous than it actually was.
The Critics argue that the Chevalier must have been a lot more poor than he claimed he was in his memoir. This is possibly wrong, because there is evidence that the Chevalier was just waiting for his money to arrive in Switzerland, so he borrowed money, which he can spend in the spare-time.
Critics also doubt that the records of conversations between Voltaire and the Chevalier are accurate But they possibly could be, because it is a fact that the Chevalier owned a lot of diarys, in which he could have taken notes during or after his conversations.
Critics do not believe the story of how the Chevalier escaped the prison in Venice (funny huh how i can relate in this situation to not being able to do something useful for my education... oh wait they have libraries in prison.. okay this is acutally a worse situation, when looking at the learing aspect, than being imprisoned). Enough of this, so fact is that the ceiling of a cell in this prison had to be repaired shortly after the Chevalier escaped. So the logical to suppose that he actually climbed through the roof, where he met is nice friend liberty. oh i wish i had the liberty to prepare my matura essay and be reading a few texts of platon... but waiting till the time is up is fine too..
