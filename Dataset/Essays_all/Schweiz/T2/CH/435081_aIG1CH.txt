The following essay will be a comparison of the presentation and the text. What did the presentation criticize about the text? Where did both of them agree? 

There are three major points that are discussed. The first one is the thing with the money. While the Chevalier lived in Switzerland, he spend a lot of time partying and gambling. In the text it says that he claimed to be wealthy but evidence shows that he needed to borrow money. If he really has been rich, why would he had had to borrow money? But the woman during the presentation claimes that after he spent his cash he just needed to wait a few days for his new money to be sent to him. Therefore he lent some money and not because he wasn't rich.

The second point is about his friend Voltaire. They had some kind of meetings and talked a lot. He wrote down what they discussed. Critics say that it is impossible to remember all the sentences word by word. Of course it isn't. But in the presentation the woman says that people regularly spotted him writing down notes about their meetings. So actually he didn't have to remember them precisely as the text says.

Last but not least both sources are heading to the prison story. Was it escape or bribing? The text says it was bribing but the presentation claimes that this was hardly realistic. Why? Because there were other prisoners much richer than him.
