There have been some little differences but they weren't quite big. One I remeber is the one with the wealth of the chevalier. In the text they say that he wasn't that rich as he pretend to be because he has to borrow some money from other persons or from the bank. But in the audience they say that the chevalier was actually rich but that he had to borrow some money from others because he spent his whole limit in one week or so. After that he has to order more money and that thing took a lot of time and that's the reason why he has to borrow some money in that time. But he always give it back to the others.
The other thing is the prison story. In the audience they said that also other men had some famous friends who had a lot of influence in the politics. So why didn't they get out of prison? That's the big question. So there must be something true in the story that the chevalier told the guards and the police.
