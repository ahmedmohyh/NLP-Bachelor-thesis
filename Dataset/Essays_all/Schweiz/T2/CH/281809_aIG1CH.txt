Firstly in the recording it was said that borrowing money does not necessairely indicate that someone is poor. It just took Chevalier a while to get the money for the things he was selling and in these days he borrowed money from a merchant. Also wealthy people sometimes borrow money to invest in something which could result in even more money. This contradicts the text passage, which says that he was poor because he had to borrow money from a merchant. 

Secondly it is said that the conversations he had with Voltaire could have been exactly like he wrote them down, because he took notes every evening after talking to Voltaire. He would have kept the notes and the memoir is therefore correct, even though the text passage says that it's impossible to remember things so accurately after so many years. If he took notes, which he had, the memoir is a reliable source.

Lastly it is very likely that Chevalier escaped from prison by making a hole into the roof, because there were people in that prison that had even better connections to politically well-connected friends outside of the prison and that bribery is very unlikely because they couldn't get out like this either. Also the jailers of the prison said that the roof of Chevalier's cell had to be repared shortly after he had escaped. This would put the argument of the text out of power, because bribery was not possible and there's an evidence that the roof had to be repared.
