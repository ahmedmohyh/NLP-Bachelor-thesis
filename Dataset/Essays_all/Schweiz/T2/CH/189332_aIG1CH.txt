It's no doubt that the Chevalier de Seingalt is very important for us, because he gives us an impresssion of how the European society used to live in the eighteenth century. But there are a few points, which are still claimed not to be fully true. 

First of all many people claim that the Chevalier was not as rich as he pretended to be. The reason for this thought is, that the Chevalier lend money from a Swiss merchant, so he obviously can't have that much money to afford his partys. On the other hand in the eighteenth century you had no wait until your next salary came. So if he wanted to make a party, he had to pay a lot of cash before he actually got his salary. 

Secondly critcs don't believe, that the Chevalier could write about his conversation with Voltaire so detailled. It's simply not possible to have such an incredible memory to keep whole phrases in made and write them down many years later. But the critics have no reason to be so skeptical. In the night after Chevaliers conversation with Voltaire he wrote down a few sentences, which he referred to when he wrote his final piece.

Thirdly the misterious escape of prison. Often it's clamed that he could only escape because he had friends in high ranks of the prison, but in fact other prisoners had friends in much higher positions than he had and they couldn't escape. Furthermore soon after his escape the sealing of the prison had to be repareted, which could be a clearly evidence for a prison escape.
