In the lecture it is said that the Chevalier earned money buy selling property. So he did not get often his money but when he did it was a huge amount. In the meantime he he lent money from the Swiss merchant to be able to pursue his lifestyle while wating for his money. The lecture claimes that this diffrent from being poor.
ALso it is claimed that the Chevalier had been writing journals to which he refered while writing his memoires. So it is possible that he has taken notes just after the conversation with Volataire. In that way, he surley was able to write about detais from the conversation that actually had happen.
Furthermore the lecture draws attention to the fact that the ceiling from the prison in Venice in which the Chevalier was in had a whole and had to be repaired. This would not have been necessary if it really was a bribery.
