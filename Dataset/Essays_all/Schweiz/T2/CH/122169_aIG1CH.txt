Chevalier

The memoire of the Chevalier de Seingalt is according to the audio quite accurate which makes it reliable. In the text they disagree with this because they think that the chevalier invented many events. 

In the audio they say, that the events aren't invented because there are many things that prove that the events happened. They said that the Chevalier had to borrow money  not because he wasn't rich but he had to borrow it because it needed time till he got his money. According to the audio also the two other events weren't disorted or invented. The conversation between Voltaire and him was wrote down directly after the conversation but he published it later and the story where he escaped from the prison also has to be true because they had proofed that the ceiling in the cell had to be repaired which won't make sense if he didn't escape. 

But in the text they do not agree with this. They say, that he wasn't rich because if he was rich he wouldn't have had to borrow money. They also write, that the text about the conversation between the Chevalier de Seingalt and Voltaire can't be accurate because he wrote it down many years later. Finally they also don't believe in the event when he escaped from the prison. They think, that it is more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him because the Chevalier had a number of politically well-conected friends.
