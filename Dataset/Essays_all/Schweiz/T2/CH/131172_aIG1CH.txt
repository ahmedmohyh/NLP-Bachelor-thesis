First the woman from the presentation talked about his time in Switzerland. He played a sort of gambling, where you first have to sell something, before you have the money to gamble. But this process needs time. So as he run out of money, he borrowed some, because it would have took too much time to get new from his own. So he didn't have to be a poor person at all, as it's said in the text

Some friends of Chevalier proofed, that he often conserved protocols of conversations and wrote them down later on. so that's how he was able to know the correct spoken words. It seems as if there is a way to remember the spoken words over a long time and being able to write down later on.

They found a writing about his prison escape in Venice. They wrote, that the ceiling had to be repeared. So why would it have been repared, if he didn't escape through it? in the presentation she says, that most prisoners had more firends than he had, so it's unrealistic that they helped him escape. The ones from the text think, that other prisoners ribed him free and some politically well-connected freinds of him could have offered a bribe.

So the woman from the presentation thinks, that there is more correct than it's written down in the text. She also says that his memoir isn't totally correct but it's reliable source of the European society
