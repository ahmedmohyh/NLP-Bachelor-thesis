Chevalier Seingalt was a well known man from the 18th century. He wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures he made, but it was very accurate. the critic about his memoir was't that good, because it was claimed that he wanted to make his life looking more exciting by inventing tings and details. For example he wrote about living in Switzerland and beeing very whealthy, but he had to sell a part of his property for becoming wealthy, so then a short time he was  pretty poor because he needed time earning so much money. Critics are also skeptical about the content of the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire, because it was held so many years before the memoir.
The escape from a prison in Venice in Chavaliers memoir has also been questioned, because he wrote that he escaped by using a piece of metal to build a hole to go through. But while this text talks about his ability of escaping in case of his connections but the speaker from the lesson said that the ceiling had to be repaired, so that wouldn t match with the text.
