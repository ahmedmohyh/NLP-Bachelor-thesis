So in the textpassage and discussion they talk about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt and wether it is true or not. 
The three most important things which are mentioned in the text and also in the discussion were the accuracy of his wealth, his conversation with Voltaire and that he could escape from a Venetian prison.
In the text it is said that it is bizzare that he had to borrow money if he was really that rich. But in the discussion they believe that he was wealthy and to borrow money has nothing to do with poorness. 
About the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire, the text mentioned that it is impossible to remember phrases that exactly. But the discussion said it could be possible because Chevalier kept notes about the conversation many years.
It is also accurate that he escaped from prison then they had to repare the ceiling afterwards. In the text it is said that it is more likely that his famous friends could offered a bribe.

As a conclusion I would say that the textpassage is more critical about the memoir and doesn't believe everything. In the discussion they think it could be an accuracy memoir because everything is very plausible.
