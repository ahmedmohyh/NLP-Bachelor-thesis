The accuracy of the memoire of Chevalier is a very controversial topic among experts, due to his countless adventures he swears to have experienced. This leads critics to doubt it's accuracy.

First of all, there is the question about his loan. While the text states, that he had to borrow lots of money while staying in Switzerland and that this is a prove of debts,  the lecture quotes, that in order to get money in that time, you had to sell something of your property and it could take some time till you would get your money. Due to this delay he was forced to borrow money in the meantime, but only till his own money arrived.

According to the text, another prove of inaccuracy are the conversations between him and Voltaire.The problem is that he wrote them down years after they had happened, which led experts to believe that he invented most of it. But the lecture states, that he wrote small notes after each conversation and while writing his memoire, he constantly referred to them. This was even confirmed by people who knew him.

Last but not least, there is the question about his prison escape. The text says,that his story about escaping through the ceiing is only a result of his own imagination and that it would be more likely, that some of his important friends simply bribed the jailers. But as it is told in the lecture, there exist government documents, proving that shortly after his escape the ceiling had to be rebuilt, which might be prove of his story.

Imagination or truth, in the end it was only Chevalier himself, who knew how accurate his memoire actually was.
