The Chevalier de Seingalt lived in the eigteenth century and wrote a long memoir about his life and the adventures he did. His memoir is in oure century an important historical source but it's not actually sure if everythings true or not. For example in the historical source it's written that himself was a controversial figure who wasn't very famous but got popular through the realationships and meetings with famous people, kings and writers. He intvented many events in memoir that it seems that his life is so exciting and glamorous. 
When he was in switzerland he wrote about the his wealthy life, the partys and the gambling but eventhough people think that he just had borrowed his money to spemt it. But an important point is also that in the presentation talked the woman about his career and she said that he wasn't poor, he just borrowed money when he hadn't enough. These two diffrenet point say that not everythings true and that he lied about some situations in his life. He just wanted to be someone, who's not. 
An other similar thing is also the informations about the meeting with the famous writer Voltaire. The texts says that they maybe met but that it is impossible to keep these informamations over years. Nobody also him mentioned any written notes during the talk and after, what seems very suspicious. The presentation said that he wrote notes and kept it in his house until he wrote the memoir with Voltair. What's now the truth ? Is there a truth? 
These two souces are hard to complain. Everyone says something diffrent. 
The last point for these subject is also the escape of the prison in Venice he only used a single piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. Actually that is not possible at all and also with the informations that he had a very bad eyesight. 
Both sources don't fit together which makes it hard to trust something.
