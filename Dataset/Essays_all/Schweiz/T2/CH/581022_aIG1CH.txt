The struggle of the truth in chevaliers memoirs is big; nobody knows if he told the truth or just things from his fantasie. Maybe no of his memoirs is correct. First the poverty; the text says that Chevalier was a poor man, because he spend  alot of his money there on parties and gambling. But he just had to wait to get his money, and during this time, he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. And nowbody knows, but maybe he was agood friend of Chevalier or they had a deal together so Chevalier was allowed to use the money of this Swiss merchant. 
The second point is the skeptical memoir with Voltaire. Chevalier have told that he and Voltaire met and conversed. Critics from the text says that can not be possible, because it was years ago and he can not know aftre many years about what they have had discussed. But they had conversations by night, and Chevalier wrote down erveything, so he did not have to hold everything in mind. 
The third and last reliable memoir is the one with the escape from prison. He ws in prison, and told that he escaped with a piece of metal. Critics says that this is impossible, but maybe he came free because he had a lot of friends in politics, and they have had helped him. But there were a lot of other prisoniers, which also have had a lot of politically well-connected friends in Venice, who could have offered them - but they did not. ANd the prison-room from Chevalier have to had repared after Chevalier left. 
So there are many different arguments between the text and the listening, so you can see it depends who tells you something, you can not trust everything.
