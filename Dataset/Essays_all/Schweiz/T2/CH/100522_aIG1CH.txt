The Chevalier a controversial figure in history with his memoir which seems to be pretty accourate and reliable. But there are many debating points in the book. The chavalier claims to have been rich in switzerland but also has borrowed money from merchants. But that doesn't mean he was poor it is explained that he simply could have been waiting for his assets to turn into proper money he could actually use. The second point is about his conversations with Voltaire. The text tells us it was impossible for Chevalier to remember his conversation with Voltaire, while others argue that the Chevalier wrote his conversations with Voltaire down and refered to his notes when he wrote the book. There is also the mystery about his prison escape, he claims to have escaped through the roof of his prison. Which is possible as old documents show that the roof had to be repaired shortly after he left. The text says it would be more likely that someone had bribed the guards but as there were many prisoners with far more powerful friends than the Chaevalier had, who all didn't escaped through a bribe, it seems to be unlikely that bribes actually worked on the guards.
