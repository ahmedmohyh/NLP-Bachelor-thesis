The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, written in the 18th century, has different aspects that induce critics to the assumption of not being accurate. The three leading arguments are firstly, the affluence of the Chevalier family. Although in the book they're said to be a rich family, there is evidence of them having lost huge amounts of money gambling and even borrowing money from a Swiss merchant. However this can be explained considering the fact that they had to sell properties. As converting material goods into money needs time, the loan was only a temporare solution.
Secondly, he reported his conversations with Voltaire, what seems to be almost impossible as the memoir has beeen written many years after their encouters. But there are testimonials, that Chevalier wrote down the contents of their discussions every night and used his notes to write his book afterwards.
Thirdly, his prison escape using only a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through it. Although sounding quite implausible it is likely to be truth, as the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape. Furthermore a bribe could not have been possible, because other prisoners whose friends had far more influence were  not able to bribe their jailers.
