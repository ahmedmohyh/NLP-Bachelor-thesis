Chevalier de Seingalt wrote towards the end of his lif a long memoire. Alot of critics claim that he has invented and disorted the real events though. 

As a main point the critis doubt that his state of wealth was actually as high as he says due to the fact that he often borrowed money. His supporters, however, say that this does not mean one is poor because the people used to get to borrowed money not at the day they asked for it but a few days later and Chevalier was able to go trough this stage. 
The highly accourate description of Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire is another point of sceptism. The conversations happned many year before the actual writing of the memoire and so it would be impossible to remember it that way, the critis argue. The ones who believe his memoire is correct claim that Chevalier wrote down notes every night after he talked to Voltaire.
Lastly the opposition states that the escape out of a Venecian prison was not as spectacular as described. They say he could only reach freedom with the help of well-connected friends even tough the supporters point out that other inmates with way more well-connected friends never escaped and that his celldoor had to be repaired what could indicate that he used a piece of metal.

It is most likely that the parties will never have the same opinion due to the fact that neither of them can prove that their point of view is correct.
