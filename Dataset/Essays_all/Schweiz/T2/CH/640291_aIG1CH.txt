Chevalier wrote at the end of his life a long memoire of his life and adventures. But some critics say that the things written in the memoire aren't always true. 
For example at the time when he was living in Switzerland he wrote that he was very wealthy, and spent a lot of money on partying and gambling. Critics are doubting his wealthy lifestyle and are saying that he made things appear a lot more glamourous in his book than they actually were. However, there are people who say that he didn't invent anything and that he indeed was really wealthy at the time.
Critics have also questioned his conversations with Voltaire, saying that they aren't accurate, because Chevalier couldn't possibly remember so many details, because the conversations were very long ago. But there is prove that the conversations are actually really accurate, because Chevalier took a lot of notes right after the conversations happened.
Lastly, critics are also skeptical about his escape from the Venetian prison. They say that he escaped, because he had a number of politically well-connected friends. However, other prisoners had more politically well-connected friends and weren't able to escape. In an old Venetian document it is also written, that after the escape of Chevalier, they had to repair the ceiling, because Chevalier wrote, that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
