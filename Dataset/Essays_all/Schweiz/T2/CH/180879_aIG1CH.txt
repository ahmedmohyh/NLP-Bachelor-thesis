At first it`s impossible that the memoirs are all corect, but the memoirs of Chevalier are a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. We know that Chevaliers spend a huge amount of money on parties and gambling, when he was living in Switzerland. Altough the text shows us that the most money was borrowed. But in the referate it was manchend, that Cabalier had to borrow money, because he had to wait for his money to come. It shows us firstly why Cavalier borrowed money and secondly that he spend so much money, that he had to wait.
The second point the text is showing is, the converse between Cavalier and Voltaire, the problem is that the converse was years before Cabalier wrote done his memoirs, he cannot possibly capture these conversation accuratley like the memoirs tells us. The speaker tells that Chavalier took wrotes done about his conversations and that he capt those notes for a long time. In his memoirs he is also refering to them. There were also freinds who sayed that Chevalier wrote and kept his notes about his conversations. 
The third point what the text is manchening is the prison break of Chevalier using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and to climb through the roof. The text says that it was more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him, because of his politically well-connected freinds. In the speech although was manchend that other prisoners had more powerfull friends that Chavalier and they were still in prision. And also is manchend that the jail had someone hired to repair a damage in the exact place, where Chevalier used to be. So it`t an evidence of Chabaliers escabe by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
