The audio tape describes the accuracy of some of the memoirs of the life of the Chevalier. The women in the audio says that the memoirs were indeed accurate and that even though some of the events might seem as they are a myth, they could all be explained in a reliable and logic way. The chevalier was wealthy, and yes he also had to borow money from a swiss merchand. The text questions why he would have to borrow some money if apparently he was so rich. He had spent some money on parties and gambling, both, the text and the audio agree on that fact but they disagree about the Chevalier's loan from the merchand.The audio explains it with the fact that the Chavalier had sold a property and he had to wait for  the money to be converted and then for the actual payment. During that time the Chavalier was poor, and had to borrow some money from the swiss merchand. The text says that it's not possible for the memoirs, concerning Voltaire, to be correct and reliable because they were written down way too long after the actual conversations. But the audio tells us that the Chevaier used to write down, every night after they both had a conversation, what they were talking about. So the that everything is accurate because he alsways relied on notes and on his journal. The audio and the text disagree on another fact, his prison escape. The text says that the Chevalier would have left the prison thanks to a bribe. But the audio tells us that they were a lot of wealthier inmates and that they could not flee from the prison, located near Venice, and that soon after his escape the ceiling from his prison cell had to be repared. That could not be a coincidence and this was a proof for his escape through the celing.
