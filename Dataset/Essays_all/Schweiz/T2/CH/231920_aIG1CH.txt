Chevalier
The text makes several points about Chevaliers memoir and how everything is overexaggerated. The text argues that Chevalier couldn't have had that much money since he had to borrow some money in switzerland from a merchant, so he couldn't have been as wealthy. The Presentation although refers to the fact that Chevaliers wealth wasn't real cash but much more property, which first had to be sold. A second point which the essay makes is, that the conversations with Voltaire were too precise and noone could remember exact sentences that long after a conversation. The speaker although brings in the fact that Chevalier had written down his conversations with Voltaire every night after they spoke to each other, and friends of Chevalier said that he consulted his archive when writing the memoir. The last topic where the text and the writer don't have the same opinion is the Chevaliers escape from prison. While the text guesses that Chevalier has bribed his way out of prison, without climbing out of the rooftop, the presentation argues that other inmates would have had a better chance of bribing the guards and the didn't get out of prison. But the main argument is that the ceiling had to be repaired shortly after Chevaliers time in prison.
