The Cevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir, which tellsus about his life. This memoir is nowadays a historical source about the European society. A lot of peole says he invented most of his adventures. 

The first argument is that he says he was rich, but some evidences show that he had borrowed some money. The defenders of the Chevalier claim that it doesn't mean that he was poor. Every one kows that he liked gambling and because of this he had to convert his money. And while he was converting his money he had no cash and that's why he had to borrow.

The second argument is about the Chevalier meeting the french writer Voltaire. The Chevalier says that they had a lot of conversations, and in his memoir he write some of them. He claims that it was exactly what they were saying, but some people have doubts about it. How did he remember conversations he had many years ago ?
His defenders say that after each conversation, he wrote all on pieces of paper. And when he wrote his memoir he helped himself with these sheets of paper. Some Chevalier's friends said that he was always looking at papers and diaries while he was writing the memoir.

The third and last argument is that the Chevalier said he escaped from a Venetian prison. They are proves which say that he was in a prison in Venice. But he said that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. The critics say that he wrote that for being read, but he had many friends in Venice whom had power and they maybe helped him to gt out of the jail. The defenders say that some documents of the Venetian administration show that the ceiling was repared just after he left the prison. They ask the critics why the ceiling would have been repared if he diden't escape the way he said ?
