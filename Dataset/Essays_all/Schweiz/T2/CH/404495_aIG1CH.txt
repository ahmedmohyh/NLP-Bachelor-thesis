Many critics raised doubts about the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir and mentioned points and passages in his memoir, which aren't likely to be true. So they say that Chevalier might have invented happenings in his memoir. But the facts from the presentation of this woman don't fit with the critics which are mentioned. 
Critics say, that it isn't likely that the Chevalier couldn't have been rich like it is mentioned in the memoir because in Switzerland he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. But in the presentation is mentioned that the Chevalier was new in Switzerland and so he had to borrow money to get his position and his life right in this new place. This doesn't mean to be poor just to borrow money which can be invested smart and later given back to the merchant.

The critics also mentioned that Chevalier wrote his memoir many years after he had his conversation with Voltaire and so it isn't possible that he was able to remember every phrase that has been told. But in the presentation it was said that the Chevalier made notes about the presentation just the night after and he based his memoir on the notes he wrote many years before.

Critics also say, that it is more likely that the Chevalier got out of prison in Venice, because well-connected friends offered a bribe for him to get him out. But the woman in the presentation said that there were other mens in the prison with better-connected friends and there was still no bribe offered for them, so it is likely that the memoir about the escape from the prison is true.
