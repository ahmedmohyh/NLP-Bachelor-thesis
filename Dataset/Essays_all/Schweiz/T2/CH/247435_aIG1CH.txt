In the end of the Cevalier de Seingalts life he wrote a memoir about his past. His personality is important for the European society in the eighteenth century, he had met some famous people for exemple kings and writers which could interesting to talk about.
But there is a problem, they are not hundred percent sure if everything is the truth. There are some rumors. They say he wrote his memoir too glamorous than it really was.
They say he spent a great deal of money on gambling. But the fact is; in real life he had to borrow money when he was in Switzerland. And if he was such a rich person he does not have to borrow such a great deal of money.
An other critical point in his memoir is that he wrote about conversations with Voltaire, but it is impossible that he met Voltaire, it does not fit in the time.
There are some more points to argue about the truth.
