The memoir written by the Chevalier de Seingalt is an important historical document, but it's accuracy is doubted by many people, such as the author of the text above. The speaker on the other hand is reasoning, why it'd be correct. They are both refering to the same three parts of the memoire: Switzerland, the conversation with Voltaire and the prison in Venice. The Chevalier wrote that he was "very wealthy" in Switzerland, his spending-sprees are actually documented, however, it was discovered, that he had to borrow money. In that the author of the text sees a conflict, but the speaker argues that the Chevalier had to wait, until his properties were changed to money.
Further, the author sais that the records of the conversations with Voltaire cannot be accurate, because they were documented years after they took place. The Speaker knows, that the Chevalier took notes just after the conversations.
The third point of dibelieve is the escape from the Venetian prison by making a hole in the ceiling. The author thinks it's more believable that he escaped with help from his various connections to people with lots of influence, but according to the speaker, other prisoners had that as well and didn't escape and she mentions records of repairwork on the ceiling after the escape.
So the memoirs of the Chevalier are and allways will be a subject for intense discussions.
