In the presentation, the woman argues, that Chevalier's memoires are some of the most accurate during this time-period. Contrary to the text, she states that Chevalier was indeed rich, but he just took a loan because he had to wait a while to liquidate his assets, a period during which he had no money and thus borrowed some to finance the parties he was attending or hosting. 

Furthemore, she argues that Chevalier noted the conversations between him and Chevalier in the evening after they met. He just kept those notes and used them in his memoires years later when he could indeed not remember the details like the writer of the text points out but simply referred to his earlier notes. 

She also defends Chevalier's escape from the prison as being authentic since the roof of Chevalier's cell had to be renovated shortly after he broke out. To add to that, other prisoners with much more influence than Chevalier were unable to get out using their connections, which begs the question why he should be able to do so. 

Lastly, the text always refers to certain critics which are never revealed nor is there any apparent source material allowing us to verify the writers claim. Because if one wants to argue for something, he should always present evidence so that he can be believed. The woman states more specific cases like the historical documents of the Venetian prison which holds much more weight in a conversation based on evidence.
