Chevalier de Seingalt's memoires are said to be not accurate or even just a story created by himself. Even though some critics say that, we know from reliable sources that the memoires should be quite accurate. For example, it says that Chevalier was quite wealthy but while living in Switzerland he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. He spended a great amount on parties and gambling so he needed the money but he didn't have that much cash on him so he had to wait until his money, that was being converted into usable cash comes to him, so he temporaly had to borrow cash from that merchant. The second critised memoire was about his conversations and dialogues with Voltaire. Although it is almost impossible to write a text about something you've done quite a long time ago, it is said that Chevalier constantly made notes and wrote journals about his daily life. The last mentioned memoire was about his adventurous escape from a prison in Venice through the ceiling. The critics say he bribed the jailers and got out of the prison with his own money and connections. But there were also wealthier people and people with better connections in the prison and they couldn't get out even if they tried to bribe the jailers. On top of that, there is a note on one of the official papers of the prison, that they had to fix a ceiling that time he escaped from there. It seems that the critics about the memoires are false and Chevalier had after all quite an intresting life.
