The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures but not every memoir can be written correctely how it really was. The speaker said that and in the text there are also an argument that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. The Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant but if he was very wealthy then he would not have to needed to borrow money. The Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. The conversation between them was many years ago and it is impossible that the Chevalier can remember every word like it was. The speaker and the writer have the same opinion and they don't believe in the conversations.
