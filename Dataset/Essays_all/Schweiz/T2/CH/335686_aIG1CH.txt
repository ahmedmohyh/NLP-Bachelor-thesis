A controversialfigure named Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir in the end of his life. Critics argue wether the content is true or untrue. Chevalier said that he was very wealthy in the time he lifed in Switzerland. We know, that he spend enourmus amounts of money for parties, nut on the contrary he borrowed lots of money. So why did he have to borrow money if he is very wealthy? Some say, that in the peroid when he had to borrow money, he was waiting for his money to be delivered to his bank account.
Another point to argue about is, if his conversations with Voltaire really took place. Witnesses say, that he was checking his notices all the tie while writing the memoir. Furthermore many piecesof paper werefound on with notes of conversation were written on. It has to be said, that he mentoinned the conversation much time later than they happened. So critics question the truth of his memoir.

Why did he manage to escape and other prisoners with better connectoins to people with power did not? But to his defense it is stated, that the prison had too repair the ceiling after his escape
