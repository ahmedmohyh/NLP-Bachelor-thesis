There are two differnt main opinions regarding the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt.

While the text suggests that the Chevalier de Seingalt couldn't possibly have been rich, since he had to lend money, the audition argues that he often times had to wait until his money arrived, after having sold stuff, so he had to take a loan for a few days.

When dealing with his conversations with  Voltaire, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, but the audition says that the Chevalier de Seingalt always wrote down everything he had said to Voltaire and refered to those notes when composing his memoires.

Lastly when escaping prison, the text claims that his powerful friends must have helped him escape. But the audition says that at the time Chevalier de Seingalt was in prison, much more powerful man than him were in the very same jail too, and those men weren't offered a bribe as well. Furthermore the ceiling had to be repared, after he had escaped, which again provides evidence for a succesful escape.
