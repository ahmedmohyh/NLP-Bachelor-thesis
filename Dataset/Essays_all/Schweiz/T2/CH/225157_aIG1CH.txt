The text as well as the record is about a Chevalier that lived in the 18th century.

While the text criticises the Chevalier and doubts the things that happened in his life, the record is more about believing in his memoir. The record counters a lots of aspects that were criticised by the text. Like for example the escape of the prison. In the Text they wrote, that the Chavalier was only able to escape from the prison because he had good firends that had a lot of power back in the day. But the lecture says that by consulting old venician documents, they found out that after his escape they had to repair the sealing of his former cell.

In addition, the story of a very rich Chevalier in Switzerland also has two point of views. The Text claims, that he had borrowed all his wellbeing from a Swiss merchant. But in the record we hear, that the Chevalier had a lot of Objects that he sold in order to get all that money but while he was waiting for the people to pay him his former belongings, he had to borrow some money to be able to survive in that period of time.

To conclude I would say, that the text and the record are not different content wise but of course they are different in the way they explain and argument about the life of the Chevalier and all the things that happened during the time he was alive.
