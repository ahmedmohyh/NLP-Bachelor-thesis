The text is about the memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt. There are many critics that claim that these memoirs cannot be correct. To proof this, some critical points in are explained in the text. But the memoirs are not necessairly wrong. 

A critical thing are the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire. As the critics point out, it is not possible to remember things said some years ago. Therefore, Chevalier wrote the conversation down in his notes, directly afterwards. Later, he referred to his notes to write the memoirs. This way, there is no reason not to believe in the reliability of the memoirs.

Another point of critics is Chevaliers escape from prison. Critics are, that there is no need to take the risk of such an adventure as climbing through the roof, if one has the power in social life as Chevalier has. The thing is, that there were some other prisoners not escaping, who had very influencing friends in high position. This leads to the conclusion that Chevalier too, had to escape on his own. Furthermore it is known, that the ceiling had to be repared afterwards.

In respect to all the known facts and possibilities, it is much more likely that the memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt are correct. There is no reason we should not trust them.
