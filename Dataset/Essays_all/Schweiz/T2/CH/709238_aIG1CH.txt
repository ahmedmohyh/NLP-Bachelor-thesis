Chevalier de Seingalt was a men, who wrote a memoir that was a little bit more exciting then his real life. This memoir is an important historical source and it helps some people a much.
In the speech she speaks over three important points:
The first was: How rich was Chevalier really?
In his memoir he wrote that he went often to parties and gamling. But often he borrowed some money from other people and when you are rich, then you mustn't borrow money. In this point the text and the speech are agree with eachother.
The second point was: How was his relationship with Voltaire?
In the memoir he wrote, that he spoke with him every evening. The speech says that this couldn't be true. The text also agree with this, because nobody can remember a conversation so long as Chevalier has said.
The last point was: Broke he out of the prison?
In the prison were a lot of people and nobody ever escaped there. So the speech says that it couldn't be true but one point is special. After Chevalier went out of the prison his cell must repaired and when he didn't broke out why should they do that? The text says that someone helped him and he only wrote this in his memoir because the book will be more interesting.
