In the presentation and the text it is talked about the memoir of Chevalier. There are different oppinions about it.
First it is talked about the loan that Chevalier had to get. They think that this does not mean that Chevalier wasn't rich as it stands in the memoire. It rather means that he first spent his own money and than he had to loan some. But in the text it says that this means that Chevalier can not be rich so the memoir would be lying.

In the memoir you can read almost the exact conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire. In the presentation they say that this is possible because apparently Chevalier always wrote down everything he could remember from the conversations with Voltaire the same day they talked. But in the text it says that this is not possible because the memoir was written many years after the conversations.

The escape from the Venetian prison is also a big topic. In the presentation it is said that it could have been possible for Chevalier to escape like it is said in the memoir. With a piece of metal. Because it is known that Chevalier's cell hat to be repaired after he was there. But in the text the critics think that it is more plausible that the jailers were bribed by mighty friends of Chevalier.
