The Lectrue tells us about Chevaliers memoirs. Even though there are some critics who say that it's not possible everything happend this way, the lectuere tells us that everything can be prooved. The text critics complain that the memoirs of Chevalier have some faults in it.
For example the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire: Some say the conversation didn't even happen. Others are convinced that the converation isn't written down in Chevaliers memoirs corectly. While the text is more on the critics side, the lecture thinks positive about the memoirs of Chevalier and they try to tell us that it's possible it happened the way Chevalier wrote it down.
The lecture only gives arguments in favour for the memoirs while the text is agianst its truth.
Both ways give us the same information but in different ways and with other hidden oppinions in the background.
