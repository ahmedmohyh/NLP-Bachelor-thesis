The text sais that critics argue that if the Cevalier had really been rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. In the beginning of the presentation the lady said that just because he borrowed a great deal of money does not mean he was poor. He said that he spent a lot of money duringhis stay in switzerland for parties and gambling, which means it is natural that at some point he ran out of cash. But that does not mean he was poor.

The critics in the essay also complain about the fact that it is unlikely to know the excact words and phrases of a conversation that took place many years before. But the women in the audio confirmes that he took notes during the conversations he hold and that he just wrote down everything he remembered. 

Another story that peaople doubt to believe is his escape out of prison. They think it is more likely that the Chevalier`s jailers were bribed to free him. But she again conters whith the fact that the ceiling of the prison had to be prepared after he was free and that a bribe would be hardly believable because the jailers could not even escape for their own.
