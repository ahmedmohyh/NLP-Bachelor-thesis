First of all, while Chevalier de Seingalt lived in Switzerland he borrowed money which does not mean that he was poor. He invested money in properties and while he was waiting for it he had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. The text mentions that because he borrowed sums of money and spent a lot for gambling and parties Chevalier was not wealthy.
In addition Chevalier wrote down everything that he remembered after the meetings with Voltaire. But the notes were consultet so that they showed off years after they met eachother. So the memoir capture these conversations accurately. But the text does not talk about these notes and maintains that it is impossible to remember the exact words from the conversations many years after they actually had the meetings.
Furthermore he escaped the prison without bribing the jailers. As he claimed Chevalier used a piece of metal. There are some evidents. On the one hand he had more powerful friends who did not escape because of bribery and on the other hand the ceiling had to be repared. In the text they mention that it is more enjoyable for the readers to read such an adventure. And they point out that he had politically well-connected friends in Italy who could have helped him easily with offering a bribe.
