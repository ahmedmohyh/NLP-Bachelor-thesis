The first argument mentioned in the text talks about how chevalier was supposedly a rich man. He is said to have hosted parties and gone gambling with his sizable fortune. However, the text states that large sums of that money was borrowed from a swiss merchant, which would mean he was not as rich as he proclaimed to be. The lecture then justifies his money loans by stating that he needed to borrow the money during the transitional period, and that it doesnt mean he isnt rich. 
The second point states that he had conversations with a famous writer, voltaire. He documented his conversations a few zears after thez happened, so the text uses this as a valid point to lower the credibilitz. He would not have been able to remember the details of extended conversations he lead zears before. The lecture however states that there is evidence that he took notes at the time of his conversations, and held onto them, and that he used those notes to write his memoir. 
The last point the critics question, is his alleged prison escape from a venician prison. Thez feel that his recounting of his escape was made for enjozable reading rather than convezing facts, and that rather, he just bribed the guards at the prison since he was well connected. The lecture counteracts this point bz stating that there were other people at the prison who had even more power than he did, and that if thez couldnt bribe their waz out of the prison, then would he have done it. Furthermore, the said the prison had to repair the roof of his cell which was broken, and that would make perfect sense if his account of his escape was true.
