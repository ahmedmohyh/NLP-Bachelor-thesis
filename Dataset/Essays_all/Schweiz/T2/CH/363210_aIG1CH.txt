The text and the presentation take different opinions about the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. 
In the text, it`s wrote down that the memoir of the Chevalier became ony famous because he met kings and writers and other important figures. The first scene which is very doubted is that he wrote of his wealthyness during his time in switzerland tough he borrowed a lot of money from the banc. The presentation here takes the controversial position and says that he maked the money because he borrowed all that money from the banc. 
The next point criticized by the text is that Chevalier wrote about controversations with Voltaire which happened many years ago. They accuse Chevalier by inventing phrases of the conversation in his memoir. The presentation sets himself to the opinion that tough the conversations were a long time ago, he could notice the essential points of the conversations. 
Also doubted is the escape of the prison in venice in which he was because Chevalier had a lot of politically well-known friends who could have helped him. Now in the presentation is said that there were other people in the prison with more politically well-known friends who didn`t escape from the prison. Also should the ceiling of the prison have been repaired after his escape of the prison.
Now this were all points of controversation between the text and tha presentatio
