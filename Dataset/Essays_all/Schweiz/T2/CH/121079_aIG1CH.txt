In the text it is said that the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt can't be very accurate because for example in his memoirs Chevalier wrote about himself that he lived a very wealthy lifestyle in Switzerland, but later evidence showed that he borrowed a lot of money during this time in Switzerland. The spokerperson from the text I just heard says in opposiion that the evidence that he got loans of merchants isn't a proof that the Chevalier was poor: 
It could be even a proof that he was rich because he was able to afford these loans. 

The second point was the thing that the memoirs that were written about the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire also can't be accurate because they got written many years after the actual conversations. However, in the text I just heard they said that the Chevalier always wrote notes directly after these named conversations and that therefore the memoir of the conversations was written based on these very accurate notes.

Last but not least they pointed to the Chevaliers escape from prison:
in the text it is said that he managed to get out of prison thanks to his political powerfull friends in Venice who bribed the leader from the prison, however according to the just heard things it is proofed that in prison were guys with even more powerfull friends (and they also didn't manage to escape the prison, so bribbery wasn't possible) and a source from the actual time documented that after his escape, they had to repair the roof from his cell, so the theory from the hole in the ceiling thanks to a piece of metal is very likely.
