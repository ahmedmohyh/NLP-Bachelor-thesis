The memoire of the Chevalier de Seingalt is a controversially discussed topic concerning if it is a valuable historic source or more of a tale, made to be interesting to read. Critics often doubt the accuracy of the Chevailers documentations and refer to three main flaws.
The first flaw they found is that the Chevalier claims to be very rich and to have used his wealth for parties and gambling while he was in Switzerland. However, evidence has shown that Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, contradicting his possesion of wealth. The people who believe in the memoire explain this flaw with the origins of Chevalier's wealth. He possessed many objects of value which he could sell if he needed money. This process however, of converting his possessions into money, took time an that is the reason, why he had to borrow money.
The second flaw that is critized is the accuracy of Chevalier's records about conversations between himself and Voltaire. They critics claim that no human can remember excact conversations that happened years in the past. And while that is certainly true, Chevalier didn't have to remember excact conversations as he was said to have always taken notes after talking with Voltaire and it has been documented that he considered notes while writing his memoire.
The last flaw is his famous escape from a prison in Italy. He claims to have made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. Critics say that this is just a story Chevalier invented to make reading his memoire more interesting and that he in truth, escaped the prison because friends of him bribed the jailers. Believers reject this myth as there were other people in the same prison as the Chevalier who had friends with more influence than his. And it was documented that after his escape, the ceiling had to be repaired.
