In the lecture they talked about Chevalier's memoir and it is a really reliable and accurate source of that time. The critics were also stated as wrong, because there is evidence, that the things happend excatly as Chavlier stated. The critics claim, that Chevalier a lot money in Switzerland and therefore he could not been rich and wealthy. However the critics didn't consider, that his wealth was not liquid, meaning he had to sell his assets first in order to have money to spend. In the mean time he borrowed money to gamble, considering he had to wait for his own money. The second critic of his memoir was, that the conversions with Voltaire are to detailed and he had probably had made up some thing. This isn't the whole truth either. The professer explained that Chevalier had taken some notes each night after talking to Voltaire. This explains the accuracy of his memoir. Many of Chevalier's friend said that he always took down some notes in a journal and that he kept them safe. 
The third critic of the memoir was that Chevalier never broke out of the venician prision. The critics claim that he was let free by his influencial contacts. Knowing that there were other people, who had even more influencial friends than Chevalier and that they hadn't been let free, the critism doesn't make any sense. Historians also found some venician documents, which state that Chevalier's prison roof had to be repaired after Chevlier broke out.
