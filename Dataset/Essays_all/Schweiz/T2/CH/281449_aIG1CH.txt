In the presentation of Chevaliers life, the reasons against critics that have been made are being explained. It is known that Chevalier is really accurate and that he is a realiable source. 

Against the first statement that Chevalier was not even rich, it is said that that is normal in switzerland and that he had to borrow money until his own had arrived. 

Secondly, it is mentioned that it is right that remembering exact phrases of a conversation is impossible. But friends and family said that Chevalier had taken notes of it and as he wrote about it, he took a great use of them so that he would write the truth.

Lastly, in the explanation of his escape from prison it is said that after his escape, they had to repair the ceiling and it would be a big coincidence if it was just at the same time without a reason. They are pretty sure that it was because he escaped through that ceiling. 

In the whole presentation, there are reasons and evidence given to believe in the writing of Chevalier.
