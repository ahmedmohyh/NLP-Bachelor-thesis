In the lecture all negative points and arguments from critics are denied and logically explained.
First point: the chevalier was rich, but he was not liguid all the time. So he had to borrow money for short periods of time just to get liquids. Also the Chevalier had not had such an excellent memory. He simply wrote down every evening what he knew from the previous conversation. Many of his friends described this habit. And even the escape from prison could really be right. There were much more wealthy people inprisoned at this time and none of them was bribed. Also the government of Venice had to repare the ceiling of the Chevalier's room.
