The text of the memoir of the Chavalier is a bit suspicious about the truth of what's written in the memoir, while the audio tries to conter all the statements from the text which may identifiy de memoir as not 100% truth.
The essay claims that maybe not all of the stories in the memoir be truth and just invented for pleasuring reading, which get contred by the audio, that tells that witnesses said that de Chevalier took notes about his experince in some evening, which he consulted while writing the memoir. Further the audio disagrees with the fact that the Chevalier might haven't been that rich, because back then people used to spent money befor gaining, what makes taking credits nessecary. when it comes to the last thing written in the text, that it's more believable that the Chevalier got free of prison because of his important friends than escaping trough the roof, the audio also tells exactly why this has to be possible or truth. It's said that in this prison, where he was even people with more important connections were, whom never got free. And that in the documents of that prison is written that the roof of the chevaliers room had to be fixed, which obviouslyy is an evident for escaping trough the roof.
