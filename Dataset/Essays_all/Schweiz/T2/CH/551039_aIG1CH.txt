Chevalier claims that he was very wealthy while living in Switzerland and that he spent a lot money on gambling and parties. There is evidence found that he burrowed big sums of money from a swiss merchant during this time. This doesn't still mean that he couln't have been rich anyways. His property could have been in a from from wich it takes time to transfer in money and thats why he burrowed money for the time between.

It is complained that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire cannot be accurate because the memoir was written years after the two actually met. Chevalier could have simply just written memos in the evening after the conversations and based then the memoir on these memos. It is even said that he often used the refer to Voltaire from his memos.

Some critics claim that he did not escape from the prison in Venice through the roof with a piece of metal but by bribing the jailers. At the same time there were prisoners with even more powerful friends than Chevalier had and even they weren't able to bribe their way out so could have Chevalier possibly. Also according to a source Chevaliers prison sell had to be repaired right after Chevalier. Why would they have to do that if he didn't escape through it.
