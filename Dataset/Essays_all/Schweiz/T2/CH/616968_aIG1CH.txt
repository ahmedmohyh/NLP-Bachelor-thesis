No memoir can be 100% accurate. But Chevaliers is actually pretty close to that. Chevalier was in fact a wealthy man yet his money often was invested for example in property. That means if he needed cash he had to sell the property first and had to wait a few days until he got the money. During that time it would often occur that he needed money quickly and that's the reason why he loaned these substantial amounts. This argument from the lecture shows that the argument in the text isn't actually valid because just because he loaned money doesn't mean he wasn't rich.
It is proven that Chevalier conversed alot with Voltaire. It is confirmed by many people that after every session with Voltaire, Chevalier would write down everything they discussed and that he used these notes when he was writing his memoir. Because it is confirmed that he wrote down all this and used his notes to write the memoir the argument that he couldn't possibly remember all of the details for so many years isn't actually a good argument. It just shows the bad research on the subject. 
About his prison escape in Venice. According to the lecture he couldn't have possibly bribed his way out of prison because there were far wealthier and more powerful people in this prison and even they couldn't bribe their way out. And the fact that they had to repare the ceiling shortly after his escape because it crashed down is another good argument that he actually escaped prison through the roof.
