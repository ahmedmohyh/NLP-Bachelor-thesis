Chevalier

Chevalier de Seingalt lives form 1725-1798. He wrote a momoir of his life and adventures. But he wrote it at the end of his life. The memoir is very clear and his life seems to be rich and good. But de critics have raised doubts. 
Because Chevaliers life seems more exciting and glamourous than it was.
They do not want to say that he was poor. But in fact he was not so rich that he could spent such huge amounts for parties in Switzerland. Chevalier run out of cash and have to borrow from other peolpes bus he get his own money. Then he has to wait for his own money. But other critics are saying that he was not so rich because he has to borrow money from others. 
He also take regulary notes from his life what can explain why his memoir was so clear. 
But the escape from the prison in Venice was very questioned. He wrote down that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in ceiling and climbing trough the roof. But why did the prison have to reparing the ceiling when he escaped like he told?
Also there were more powerful people in the prison then Chevalier. The others have more good connection and could not escaped. So did he really escaped or did the friends from Chevalier just payed for him to get out?
As we can see the life memoir from Chevalier seems to be sometimes right but sometimes a little bit
