Chevalier de Seingalt has many criticers. They thnik that he invented many stories because they are sure that he couldn't remember so many things in detail. The criticers think it's not possible that a human can have such a good brain. But Chevalier was maybe a genius. He wrote each night about the conversation that he had this day. So he could remember it better and read it a second time if he forgot a detail. The criticers also think that he wasn't that rich like he represent himself. Often it took a view days till he could turn the bars into money. But he wasn't poor. He just pushed himself up and he act like his life was very glamourus. Some parties he invented to make his life more interessting. Thats also a point why the criticer don't trust him. If he lied about this little things he also would lie with other things.
