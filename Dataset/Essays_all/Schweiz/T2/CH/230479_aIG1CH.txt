Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life with a lot of details. It is unbelievable that he wrote such a correct memoir a long time ago. But he has large sources like three episodes.

The first one shows that Chevalier lived a wealthy life. He was not poor and he claimed that he was partying and gambling all the time when he lived in Switzerland. But to afford this kind of wealth, he had do sell things to get money and before he got the money he had to borrow sums of money from other people. This was not a sign for poverty. 

Secondly, the conversation between him and the writer Voltaire is also incredible. He remembered everything they said, every sentence and he had kept notes for many years. But he also consulted notes. 

The last source is his escape from the prison in Venice. It is hard to believe that the jailers were bribed to free him, because in this time, in that prison, there were people with even more powerful friends and none of them escaped. Although, old governments proved that his ceiling from his room had to be repared after his escape. And this matches to his breaking-out story.
