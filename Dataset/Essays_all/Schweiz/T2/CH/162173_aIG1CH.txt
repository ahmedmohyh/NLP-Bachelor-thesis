The woman talked about the Chevalier de Seintgalt and she made some corrections about the text.
First, she talked about the critic that the chevalier was not as rich as they think he is. She told that people, who borrow money, are not poor because they have to borrow many. If they are poor they won't get the money.
Second, she said that the chevalier has written down the conversation immediatly but he kept the the script for a while. So he didn't write the conversation a few years later and he had known what they were speaking at the time he was writing the script and as a result the script is the truth. 
Finally, she told about his time in prison. She said, that they repaired the ceiling after the chevalier escaped from prison. They found old documents which tell that the chevalier wasn't escaped with the help of his jailers.
