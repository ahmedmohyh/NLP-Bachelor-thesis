The Chevalier de Seingalt

The Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the eighteenth century, spent the end of his life writing a memoir. Because he met many famous people, this memoir is a important historical document nowadays. But the accuracy of the document is in question, critics think that the Chevalier invented or changed some parts to make people think he had lived a more interesting life.
First, the Chevalier wrote that he had a very wealthy life during his stage in Switzerland. But evidence was found that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant, which makes him seem poor. On the other hand, the Chevalier spent a large amount of money at parties and gambling, and his income was not very constant. So he did not have to be poor, maybe he just had to wait for money and needed something to live with during that time.
However, the Chevalier wrote a lot about his conversations with Voltaire. Crtitics say that those can not be very accurate because it is impossible to remember a conversation word by word. But there were witnesses who confirmed that the Chevalier was taking notes every night after his conversations with Voltaire and that he used those to write his memoir.
Another point is his prison escape from Venice. the Chevalier wrote that he made a hole in the ceiling of his cell. But there is evidence that he had many powerful friends in Venice and his jailers were probabebly bribed to free him. On the other hand some other prisoners had even more powerful friends and were never freed, and a ceiling repair of his cell is reported.

However, the accuracy of the the document may be critisized, but it is sure that the Chevalier's memoir is a important historical source.
