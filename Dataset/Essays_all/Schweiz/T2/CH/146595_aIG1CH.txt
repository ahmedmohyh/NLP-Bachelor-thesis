In the presentation the woman had the opinion that Chevalier's memoir is avaluable historical source. He wrote for instance that he lived in Switzerland. At this time Switzerland was a really rich country which is why Chevalier had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant for the start. After that he made his own money. In contrast to the presentation the text has doubt that Chevalier was wealthy due to the fact that he had to borrow money. 

Furthermore, they talk about the meeting with Voltaire. The woman was convinced that Chevalier wrote notes after every night when he had a conversation with Voltaire. Despite this the text doesn't doubt that Chevalier conversed with Voltaire yet they think the conversation written down from Chevalier many years later couldn't be like that. It says that it is impossible to remember exact every phrase. 

The last point is the escape from the prison in Venice. Chevalier wrote that he managed to escape using a piece of metal to make a hole and climb through the roof. The woman think that this could be true because after his escape his room in the prison had to be rebuild due to the hole which he made. However the text doubt this too. It mentions that Chevalier had a lot of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could help him to excape. 

As you can see now his memoir and his life is very controversial. There are different ways which can explain why his adventures are true or just for entertainment.
