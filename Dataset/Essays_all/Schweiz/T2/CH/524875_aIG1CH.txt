Sadly I could not hear the speech about this topic due to technical issues. So I am going to simply summarize the text above.

The text is about Chevalier de Seingalt who live in the eighteenth century. His memoir is a great source for information about the history of europe in this century. There are critics that doubt this memoir because some parts seem rather unlikely to be true. The Chavalier has listed converations word by word which he had five years before writing them down. Critics say that it is not possible to remember every word like it was yesterday if a conversation was years back. He also talks about the money he had whilst living in Switzerland but further research shows that he has borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. In the end we will not know if tthe stories are true or not and it is upon every single one to decide for him- or herself wether he or she wants to believe the stories.
