This essay will discuss the two points of view on the historical figur Chevalier de Seingalt. Chevailer wrote a memoir of his life, which was very remacable. Although his memoir semms prety acurate a lot of people question wether his life realy happend in the way he says it did.
Never the less there are people defending him. As a example it is said, that Chevalier wasn`t as rich as he said he was, due to the fact that he had to borrow a lot of money while staying in Switzeralnd. The people defending point out, that in the in order to get his money he had to sell property. Selling stuff meant that he had to wait for his money to arrive. So when he was short on money because he was waiting for his income he had to borrowe some.
His critics also question wether his conversations with voltair realy happend that way, cause it happend long time before wrote down his  memoire. On the other hand it is proven, and he also mentioned it himself, that he took notes from the convertations with Voltaire. 
His remarcable escape is proven with records from the prison, in which they wrote that they had to repair the ceiling of his cell after his escape and it is also to mention, that a lot of other prisoners had far more important friends than Chevalier an they couln`t bail out.
