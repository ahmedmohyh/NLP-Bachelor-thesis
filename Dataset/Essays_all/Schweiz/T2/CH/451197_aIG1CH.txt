In the presentation, several arguments were raised that the Chevalier's memoirs are in general accurate, which is in contradiction to his critics.

The first part was about the time when the Chevalier lived in Switzerland. In his memoirs he claims to have been very wealthy when living there, however, there is evidence that he borrowed large sums of money in this time. His critics argue that this shwos he cannot have been rich when living there. In the presentation, it is argued that when the Chevalier lived there, he possessed very wealthy property, which needs time to sell. In the meantime, he had to borrow money, which does absolutely not mean that he was poor.

The second part was about the conversations the Chevalier held with Voltaire and recorded in his memoirs. Critics claim that as the memoirs were written several years after his conversations with Voltaire, the memoirs cannot be correct. In the presentation it is mentioned that the Chevalier used to take notes after each conversation with Voltaire, and that he used these notes for his memoirs. Therefore, the conversations were accurately recorded.

The third part was about the Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice, which he claimed to have done by climbing through the roof of his ceiling. His critics argue that the Chevalier had powerful friends in Venice, and that it is much more likely that the Chevalier escaped because his frined offered a bribe. In the presentation it is revealed that other prisoners who were in the same prison as the Chevalier had much more powerful friends, but never escaped. In addition, old governemnt documents show that the roof of the ceiling of the Chevalier needed repair after his excape, which supports his version.
