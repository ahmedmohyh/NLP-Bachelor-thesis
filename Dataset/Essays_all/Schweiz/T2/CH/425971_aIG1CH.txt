The first thing that i mention was that in the listening she said that it could possibel be corrected but it doesn't sounds that the woman who speaks believe what Chevalier wrote in his memoir. The three points wich were told in the audio were also in the text but sometimes it's another context. For exmaple the last of these three points. In the Text is written that he had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could help him to escaped from the prison. But in the audio is told that other prisoner had more politic powerful friends than Chevalier. So this is in some kind really unreal. In general the text shows more positive things about Chevalier de Seingalt than the audio. When I read the text i belived many aspects they pointed out. As i heard the audio i feel unsure about the things i read before. I think Chevalier de Seingalt was a really popular person with many influences but i think also that he pushes himslef in a better and more glamorous life than he had.
