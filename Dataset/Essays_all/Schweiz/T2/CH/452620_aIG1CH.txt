The lecture about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725 - 1798) contains arguments contradicting the statement, that the Chevalier's long memoir, which recounts his life and adventures, are historically not reliable. This has to do with three controversial points, that the Chevalier wrote about in his memoire.

Firstly the lecturer claims that the first point, which tells us something about the wealth of the Chevalier,doesn't necessary mean that the Chevalier was a poor man. Just because he had to borrow loans from the merchant doesn't mean that he couldn't financially support himself. He may had to sell his products first in order to get money and during that time, in which he didn't have any income he could've asked someone to lend him money.

Secondly, the converstations could've been written down very detailed if he wrote down everything just after he had had his conversations with Voltaire. Thus, it could truly be that he remembered everything from his rendez-vous with Voltaire.

The last point concerning his escape from the prison in Venice was found to be the truth after documents from the governemtn were found showing that the prison had to repair the cieling from his cell, which apparently shows that he escaped from his cell by damaging it. Furthermore it was found that other prisoners ffrom that time had much more influential friends, who could have bribed to free him but they didn't, so it is denied that the Chevalier got out of prison in this way.

Summarizing the three points it is important to deduct and inform oneself about a topic with reliable information, such as the governmental documents,before making statements denying the truth of one historical memoire.
