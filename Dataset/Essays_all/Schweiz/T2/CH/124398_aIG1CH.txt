The opposition has tree points to counter the text above.
The first point is about his wealth. It is told, that indeed was rich, but this wealth he posessed wasn't liquid. Therefore he burrowed some money from a local merchant.
The second point sais, that there was nor such problem as there beeing to much time between when he had his conversation with Voltaire and when he wrote his memoir. For every conversation he had with Voltaire he has wirrten some manuscripts which he used later when writing his memoir.
The third point is about Chevalier braking out of his prison cell. It is rather unlikly that a powerful friend bribed a guard, because there were even people in the prison with more powerfulfriends who coulden't bribe them out of prison. There is also a anther evicence, namely a record from the venician prison which is about repairing the ceiling.
