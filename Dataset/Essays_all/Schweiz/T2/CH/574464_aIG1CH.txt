Chevalier
The aim of this essay is to bring together the arguments of a text and a presentation about Chevalier de Seingalt. The memoir of Chevalier de Seignalt has becom a valuable historical source about European society, but critics say that a lot of it is invented.

When the Chevalier lived in Switzerland he was known for spending a great deal of money for parties and gambling. Evidence has recently surfaced that he borrowed money. Critics thus argue that if he had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. The women of the presentation says that it was normal to borrow money because their wealth was in their land. 
The second arguement is if he has escaped an prison in Italy or not. The text says that he had connections to people wich brought him out and he just made that story up. The women in the presentation says that there is evidence in an old writting that the prison had to replace the ceeling of his cell. 
Lastly critics say that his writtings are to accurate to be true. For example he rembers whole conversations. The women in the presentation says that he has always wrote down things in his journal.

In conclution it is really dificult to say what is true. In my opinion everybody has to make teir own image of him.
