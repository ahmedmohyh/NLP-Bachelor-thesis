Chevalier de Seingalts memoir is ciriticised to be unaccurate. There are three aspects who are questioned. All three of them aren't real proofs as the audio file shows. There are information about his life and the background which schow that the memoir could show the truth of his life.
First in his memoir he wrote that he was very wealthy. Nevertheless it seems like he borrowed a lot of money. That means that he wasn't weahlty, says the text. But maybe he didn't borrowed money. It just took some time to get the money for the properties he sold. So he was rich but hadn't much money but expensive properties which he could sell for much money.
Secondly, it's cirticesd that the conversations aren't the reality. The text says that the memoir was written years after the conversations, consequently they can't be accurate. Though it seems like Chevalier took notes after the conversations and so he could rembember the conversations years later quite well.
The last point quetioned is the escape of the Venetian prison. He wrote that he could escape himself without any help, but as he had powerful friends inside the jail, some people think that someone let him go. Other prisoners had also good relationships with jailers but couldn't break out.
The audio file criticises the text. All proofs who are shown in the text are somehow questioned. So there's no proof that Chevalier lied in his memoir to make his life more interesting for readers.
