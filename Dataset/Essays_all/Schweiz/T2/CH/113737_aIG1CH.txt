Both, the text and the presentation are about a miriculous man called Chevalier de Seingalt. At the end of his life he wrote a memoir about his life, in which he wrote some unbelievebel things. But there are soms claims that he hasn't always say the truth.
Firstly, the text says, that he wrote that he's rich. In fact he should have borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. So if he would really was rich he hasn't need to. The presentator says something different. She say, that you have to borrow money to make more and that wealth isn't wealth.
Secondly, Chevalier have spoke with Voltaire many times. So how could he remembered all the things they spoke, so that he cold have wrote it in his memoires? Easy answer from the presentation: He wrotes everything down after his meetings with Voltaire.
Thirdly, he has escaped from the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal. The critics mean that the jailers should have been bribed to free him. On the other hand, the presentator has told, that there were prisenors, who had much more influence than Chevalier. An other special thing is, that the room in which Chevalier was arrested had been repaird  after his escape.
The critics are right, there are some unanswered questions, but the presentator always brouth responsible answers to explain what could have happen.
