The first thing critized by the woman was the controversial money borrowing. She claimed, that the Chevalier always had a lot of money. The reason why he borrowed some, was just the fact, that he invested a lot in other things such as properties. So according to the woman speaking it could have been that he had no money but on the other hand he had invested in commodities so the value of his wealth increased all the time. The difference was only that he hadn't bare cash. So coming back to the borrowing, he needed that money to expand his wealth even further because he invested every last bit of his money.

The woman also said, that the second topic of the text isn't accurat. The text informs the reader of the fact, that the Chevalier's memories can't be this accurat, because that's what is critical about memories. Noone can tell something word by word after several months or even after several days. There is one exception, if one has a photographical memory or is an authist with special skills the accuracy of the told could be exactly right. But this is not mentioned in the text so, sad Chevalier. The women countered the critics with the fact that the Chevalier wrote the whole conversation with Voltaire down after a long night of speaking. 

The last thing she critized was the prison escape. Critics said, that it's more likely the Chevalier jailers were bribed to free him. The woman said, this makes no sense because this prison still stands. Thus one can see the repaired hole in the roof.
