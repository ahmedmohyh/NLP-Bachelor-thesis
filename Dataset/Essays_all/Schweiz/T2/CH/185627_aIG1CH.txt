The lecture talked about Chevalier's memoir and the three excerpts of it mentioned in the text passage. The lecturer explained how no memoir will be completely correct but how Chevalier's is mostly accurate and reliable. She went on to argue how him getting a loan from a Swiss merchant while in Switzerland in no way meant he was poor but how he did have wealth but selling properties would take several days so he needed to borrow money until he received his payments. The second point discussed are the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The text argues that the conversations can hardly be accurately described in the memoir since it was written many years later. The lecturer however counters by stating that Chevalier wrote down all of his talks with Voltaire right after they had them and that witnesses confirmed Chevalier went back on his notes, which he had kept over all the years, when writing his memoir. Lastly the lecture proofs that even the last excerpt mentioned in the text can be debunked. The first argument for the prison escape story being correct and not glamourized is that there were many other prisoners who didn't escape with friends more powerful than Chevalier's, so him having powerful friends couldn't have been how he escaped. The second argument is that an old Venetian government document proofs the ceiling of Chevalier's cell had to be repared just after his escape. 
The lecture gives arguments against the critics opinions to proof the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir and retain its raliability as a valuable source for European society in the 18th century.
