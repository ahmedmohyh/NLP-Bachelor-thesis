It seems that the text and the presentation discuss the same points. Both, however, appear to be very controversial. In the text it is stated that however important Chevalier's memoir might have been there is no guarantee for its historic accuracy. Chevalier writes of his adventures, of how for example he spent his time in Switzerland throwing parties and spending money. While his wealthiness is questioned in the text, for there has been discovered evidence of him having borrowed the money he spent, the presentation claims that his memoire is true on that point. Apparently he had to wait on his assets to be sold, so while he waited he needed to borrow money in order to enjoy life. This, so it says in the presenation, does not mean that he was poor. Chevalier also writes about his conversations with Voltaire and critics point out that there is no way or Chevalier to have remembered these conversations so accurately to recite them years later. On the other hand there are those who explain, that Chevalier kept close journal on his conversations with Voltaire, so that he could indeed quote them years later. One more story mentioned in both the text and the presentation is the one where Chevalier escaped a prison in Venice by using a metal tool to dig his way out. Some accuse him of having lost himself to his imagination and that in truth he did no such thing but bribed his way out of prison. But it seems that there is more to it, or after Chevalier escaped, in whatever way, the cell he had previously inhabited had to be repaired. SO that his story doesn't seem so unlikely ater all. 
All in all there seem to be valid arguments in both accounts and since Chevalier's memoir is an important istorical source it is very unlikely that all he has written was made up.
