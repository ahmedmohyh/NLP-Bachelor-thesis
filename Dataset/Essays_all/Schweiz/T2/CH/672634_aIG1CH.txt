The chevalier is a guy who wrote down his whole life with all the adventures and meetings with famous people. In these century he saw a lot from the world. With his very good contacts he could borrowed a lot of money and with this money he was a rich man. But in the end he got in prison in Venice, but after a short time he could go out with the help of his friends. 

In the text you can read about his lifestory and after each part there is a little sentences whrere you can find some opinions from critics. they give you another way to look at his life and also it relativates his story in a way.

In the listening part were also some other informations and the critical part is jut in the text. In the main part I can not see some differentences between text and listning part.
