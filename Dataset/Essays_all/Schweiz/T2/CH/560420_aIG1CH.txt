You can never be sure, if a momoir of a person is really correct and that everything they said is true, because everyone can just invite something that could have happened just to make him look better and to become famous. Like it's said in the text, he got famous because he said, that he met many famous person. But we can't proof if this is true or if Chevalier just invited those things. May be he was just a poor man, because in the presentation they said, that he could have gone to any bar to get his money from someone. The conversation with Voltaire also isn't proofed. It's said, that he worte down everything but we can't exactly know it, because you can write down any conversation and say that it was a conversation with Voltaire. It seems nearly impossible to remember the whole conversation and write it down afterwards. He was also in prison which shows that he wasn't only a good person. Nowadays it's the same with famous people. We never know which sort of story is true and which one they just invited.
