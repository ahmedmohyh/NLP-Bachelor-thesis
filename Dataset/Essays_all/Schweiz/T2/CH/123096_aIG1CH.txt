While the text states three major points that could be criticized in terms of how accurate the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt really is, the presentation seeks to counter these points by giving some extra information on them. The target is to explain why these cannot be considered as inaccuracies. 

In the text it is mentioned that the Chevalier cannot possibly have been partying and gambling all the time while simultaneously being wealthy, if he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant more often than not. This is countered by explaining that the Chevalier had a habit of partying and gambling, then running out of money, then borrowing money from the merchant while waiting for his own money to arrive from his home, just to repeat the process all over again.
How can the Chevalier, years and years after having had his conversations with Voltaire, still write them down accurately in his memoir? Well, it is said, and by the way confirmed by many people he met during his time of living, that the Chevalier, every night after having had these convos with Voltaire, wrote them down as quickly as possible.
The last alleged "inaccuracy" was that the Cheavlier probably didn't escape prison in Venice by breaking the roof and climbing out, but rather by having one of his powerful allies in Venice bribe one of the jailers. This however is also not very probable, due to there having been many other prisoners with more powerful allies that were not able to escape by bribe. Also, after breaking free, the roof of the Chevalier's cell had to be repaired.
