Critics claim that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt isn't a valuable historical source because he distored or invented many events.
First of all you have to say no memoire can be totally correct. Even when he wrote down everything emediately  after he met famous people or his adventerous events there could be some minor faults. 

But other eveidences show that his memoir was accurate reliable.
In his time in Switzerland he wrote down that he spent much money on gambling and partying, but there is evidence that he bored horrendous sums of money. Money needs time to arrive. People in the 18th century were faster than there luggage(including money). In the time waiting for his luggag to arrive he had to borrow some money; it has nothing to do with his wealth.
Another story in his memoir is about his escape out of the Venetian prison. Critics say thhat while such a daring escape is enjoyable to read it is more likely that one of his pollitically well-connected friends bribed to free him. Against it speaks the fact that other prisoners had even more important friends and noone could ever escape. Plus after his escape they had to repaint the fassade where his prison cell was another evidence that his adventour is true.
