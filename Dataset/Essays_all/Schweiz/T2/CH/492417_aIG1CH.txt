The text proclaims that the Chevalier wasn't wealthy when he lived in Switzerland, because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But in the hearing is said that borrowing money isn't a proof of being poor, because Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gamblings. So sometimes he had to wait until money from his home arrived. These were times when he decided to borrow money from somebody else to continue his playing passionants.
The second point was about a conversation he wrote down years after the talk with the writer Voltaire took place. Critical votes say that it isn't possible to remember the exactly words of the phrases which they've exchanged.

Once Chevalier has been in a prison in Venice. From there he escaped, but there are different opinions how he organized his escape. The text above sais that there would have been influencing friends who had paid a bribe for him. In the hearing it was mentioned that the story of his own that he escaped through the ceiling by making a hole is historically possible because the ceiling had been repaired shortly after he leaved. And there were a lot of other prisoners having more influencing friends but not managing to flee from the notorious prison.
