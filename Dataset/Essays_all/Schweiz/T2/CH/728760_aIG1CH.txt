The arguments we've read or heard are categorised in tree different themes. His borrowed money, the discussions with Voltaire and his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. It's said in both sources that the text overall is accurat but there are unclear points in it. First the thing with Chevaliers loan while he was in switzerland. The text says that the taking of a credit shows poorness. The lecturer thinks that he just needed to borrow money because hist tradingpositions weren't fluid that fast. So in the time from selling a position to get the money he needed to lend something. The second thing about his discussions with voltaire. The text proclames that he can't remember all the topics discussed years after but the recording shows that there are sources proofing that Chevalier has written down the discussions just after the conversation ended. The last point captures the Venice question about how Chevalier was able to escape the prison. He has written that he has cut the ceiling with a piece of metal and escaped trough the roof. Some people think this is just a lie that sounds better than the reality which is that he has well-known political friends who used their conections to help Chevalier "escaping". Literally said he were bought out. In the documents from the prison it's shown that the cell of Chevalier has to been repaired, specially at the ceilings, right after the spectacular escape. Basically this would support Chevaliers story very well.
