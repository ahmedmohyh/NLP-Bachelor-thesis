The presentation argues about the text's critical view on the chevalier's memoir. It defends his memoir, saying no memoir can be exactly correct. The woman says that the three critizised points of the essay aren't wrong, like it says in the essay. She tells us that, if you are wealthy person in switzerland, you surely can lend money because if you gamble, you may not have your money yet. So basically, a person lending money doesn't have to be poor. She also defends the second and third critizised aspect: She says, the chevalier wrote the whole conversation with Voltaire down right in the follwing night after they spoke. He always had old notes which he used as a source when he was writing, so he doesn't just tell stories out of his memories. The third point, breaking out of prison through the ceiling, is also said to be true in the presentation. The woman tells us that, after the chevalier's escape, there was a hole in the seiling and it had to be repaired. Also, there were many other more important prisoners than the chevalier who couldn't break out through bribing, so he also wouldn't be able to.
