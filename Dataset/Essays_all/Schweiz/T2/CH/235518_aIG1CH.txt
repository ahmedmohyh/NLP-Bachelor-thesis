No memoir is absolutly correct but the memoir of  the  Chevalier is somtimes used for a historycal source.

The Chevalier was rich and while he was living in Switzerland he spent lots of mony on parties. But to get money he had to sold some of his things and while waiting of the money of the sells he borrowed some. That is why some critics say he was not as whelthy as he pretend to be.

Also the Chevalier escaped from a prison in Italy documents of that time show that after his escape the ceiling of  his room had to got repaird. But some critics sais that he had some connections to politicans which helped him but other prisoners had more powerful friends and they did not escape.

Chevalier had also some meetings whith Voltaire and after each meeting he wrote down all he could remember and he keept this notes for years and he used them for writing his memoir. Also there some critics complain that the Chevalier had ever met Voltaire because you cannot remember these conversation so exactely after such a long time as Chevalier did.
