There are a lot of critics, who may consider the memoirs of the chevalier as not fully true. There are some evidences tough, that they actually are true. The first passage in his memoires, who had been criticised, is the one from Switzerland, where he sh Even tough he had to borrow money from a merchant, it does not mean he wasn't wealthy. We know, that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. The problem was, that he could not change the amount he won, directly to money, so he had to lend some. 
Secondly we know, that he wrote down everything he could remember, after he had a conversation with Voltaire. There are actually some witnesses, who can proove this. 
Last bot not least, we know that there were a lot of other men in the venetian prison, who had even more important political friend, but were not freed. There is also a venetian document, who disclaims, that shortly after the chevalier escaped, the roof of his cell had to be repared.
