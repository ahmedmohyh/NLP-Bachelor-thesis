The text is talking about how untrue the Chevaliers memoir was. There are many events that can not have been happened like this and he just wrote to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. The first point the text and the audio file differ on is that the Chavalier said he was rich. Evidence however sufaced that Chevalier borrowed quite a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. The audio part said, that it was normal these days to borrow money and still be rich. When somebody sells something, they need to wait on the money to arrive. Chevalier owned many properties so when he sold them just recently and wanted to invest in something else, he needed to borrow money for that. 
The second point is Chevaliers conversation with Voltair. The text and the the audio file agree, that they have met and talked, but the text doubts that Chevaliers memoir captured the exact conversations and phrases they exchanged. The audio file however is sure about that de Seingalt took notes during every important conversation he had with people. To write his memoir he used them for a more accurate describing of his events. 
The last thing the text and audio file do not agree on is the escape from the Italian prison. While the text says the jailers were bribed to free him, the audio file claims that Chevalier really made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal to climb trough the roof. They say that bribery was not possible during the time he lived and that a document proofs that the ceiling of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired.
