In the text, the point of view of the critics is explained while in the listening the women tells us her point of view and tries to show that the reasons to disbelieve Chavalier`s memoir, Which are mentioned in the text, aren`t true, or can be interpretet differently.
Apparently Chavaliers memoir is an important historical source, but it is unclear how accurate his notes are.
There are three points mentioned in the text, and discussed in the listening. The firs one is the fact, that the Chavalier claims to have had a lot of money while he was living in Switzerland, but from other sources we know that he had to borrow considerable sums of money. While this is enough for the writer of the text to assume, that the Chavalier wasn`t rich, the women in the listening thinks that there could be apossible explanation. She says that when the Chavalier sold property it took a few days to get his money, so during this time he had to borrow some, but gave it back just a few days later.
The second questionable part are his conversations with Voltaire. The critics opinion is that it would be impossible to exactly remember conversations after a few years, but according to the knowledge of the women, he wrote his conversations down each night.
The last part is the spectacular escape trough the ceiling from a notorious prison in Venice. The critics are sure that the Chavalier had such powerful friends, that they could have easily freed him in another way, but the women argues that other prisoners had even more powerful friends, but still could not leave the prison. Also there is evidence that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired just some time after hes espcape so it has to be true.
