In the text it says, that Chevalier lied about his wealth. He apparently borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. In the lecture it is pointed out that reliable sources say that Chevalier indeed had money. The reason he had to borrow money from the merchant was, that he had to sell his property in order to make money so for the time inbetween selling his property and receiving the moeny, he of course had none. That's why he had to ask the merchant. That also means he wasn't poor.

A second thing that is mentioned in the text is, that Chevalier lied about his conversationes with the famous philosopher Voltaire, because Chevalier only wrote down their discussion topics many years after they had happened. The lecture claims that Chevalier had lots of journals where he documented all of those talks with Voltaire and that's why he was able to write them down so accurately. 

The last thing in the text is, that Chevalier wasn't honest about his escape from prison. And that he bribed people to get out. The lecture counters this argument with documents of the Venitian government, that say, that a hole in Chevalier's prison cell wall had to be fixed and that there were other inmtes who had much richer friends than Chevalier and none of them managed to escape with bribery
