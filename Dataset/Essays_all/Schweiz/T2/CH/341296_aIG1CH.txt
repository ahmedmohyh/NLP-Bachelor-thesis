To start with the first fact that Chevalier de Seignalt has borrowed money of a Swiss merchant during the time he lived in Switzerland, would not mean he was pour. Critics say it was difficult to resieve the own money in a short period of time. You had to wait several days to get the money, which means, that the Chevalier was rich but had to wait for his money. Critics are also skeptical about the conversations he was in. It can not be filly the truth, because the memoir was written years after conversation occurred, which means, there had to be people reminding themselfes about the exact conversation, which is pretty unrealistic. The fact that he escaped from prison in Venice is a critisised topic as well. On the one hand people say he has made a hole in the ceiling to escape on his own, and on the other hand people say it is unrealisitc and that he could have payed the people working in jail to let him escape.
