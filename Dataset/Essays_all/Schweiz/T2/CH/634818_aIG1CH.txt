No memoir can be hundert percent correct but the one of Chevalier de Seingalt was pretty accurate. There are some doubts but all of them could be explained in a logical way. The first doubt was that while he was in Switzerland he had to borrow sums of money but in his memoir he claims that he was very wealthy so why would borrow some money? 
There is a simple explanation. He first had to sell money to claim his status after that he had to borrow some because the Chevalier was waiting for more that had to come from France to Switzerland.
The second doubt was that de letter exchange with the famous writer Voltaire couldn`t be so detailed in the memoir but the critics forgot that the Chevalier keept his notes and thats the reason why the conversation was so exactly.
The last doubt was that the escape from Chevalier out of the prison in Venice was so sureal that it couldn`t have been true. Critics thought that the Chevalier`s jailers were bribed to free him and that the story about the hole in the ceiling was a lie. But other prisonners had better connections than him but none of them could escape out of the prison. After Chevalier`s escape they had to repair the ceiling in his room and why would they have done that when he hadn`t escaped out of it?
