In the text and the lecture the topic is the memoire of Chevalier. His memoires are very controversial because we do not know whether they are true or not. The text claims that the memoires are not true respective that some things are invited to make it more interesting. The lecture says that the stories in the memoires are completly true and nothing is invented.
According to the memoires Chevalier was wealthy while he was living in Switzerland and he spent a lot of money. But the author of the text asks where he got his money. According to his research Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. This is a proof for the critics that he was not rich because if he had been rich, he would not have borrowed money. In the lecture it is said that Chevalier just had to give away things where he got some money.
Another controversial point are the conversations with Voltaire. In the memoires the conversations are written detailed and the critics believe that some information is invented because the memoires were written years after the conversations. The person of the lecture says that Chevalier wrote every evening about what he discussed with Voltaire and when writing the memoires he took his notes.
The third story is the prisonbreak of Chevalier. He was in Venice in prison and could flee. According to the memoires he had a piece of metal with which he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped over the roof. Critics claim that he wrote this just to make the text more interesting. The truth is that the jailers were bribed and had to release him. In the lecture is said that the prison in Venice had to repair the ceiling of the prison soon after Chevalier escaped which is reported.
All in all the memoires of Chevalier are very controversail and we will never know if they are true.
