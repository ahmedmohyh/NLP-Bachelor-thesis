The Chevalier de Seingalt did really write a memoir which told the world in the future how his life was going on and what happened in his life. This doesn't mean that all information are true that he wrote down. It also opens some space for historians to discuss about if this really happend how it is written or if it's not true. 

The first discussed point is that he was rich. For sure everyone wants to be rich and if you aren't you just write down for the future that you were, and so you are at least a wealthy man after your death. Critics say, that he wasn't because he has borrowed a lot of money. The contra argument is that he has not borrowed it because he had'nt any money but because he just hadn't the money in cash but in his home castle or in form of gold and jewelry. 
The second discussing point is that he never met Voltaire. The opposite says he did, but he has just written down his remembers and not the real and complete story, what lets a reader think the story is just out of imagination. 
And the last fact which gives space to talk about was, when the Chevalier was prisonner in Venice. Some people say, he has paid to get out of the prison and the story which seems very interesting and enjoyable for the lector is completely invented. The enemies of this point of view say, that it really happened like its written down by Chevalier de Seingalt. They mention, that there were other wealthy prisonners with good connections to rich and mighty peaple and even they couldn't pay to get out of prison. This is the ultimative evidence that the action-story told by De Seingalt must be true!

In this three points the text and the recording do contradict each other.
