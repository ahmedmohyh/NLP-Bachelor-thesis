The Lecture talks about the chevalier and states, in contrary to the text, how reliable his memoires are. It responds to the threee arguments given in the text by giving proofs the arguments aren't valid.

First of, it is stated wrong, to think the chevalier was poor, just ebcause he borrowed money. Since his wealth came from his estates, he needed to sell them before actually beeing able to use the money. Because this takes time and he spend a lot of money on partying and gambling, it is normal to assume he had to borrow money once in a while.

Furthermore, critics have been arguing about the exactitude of the conversation the chevalier had with voltaire. They argue, that it is impossible to restate the exact phrases of a conversation years after that. Even though this is a good point, the chevalier claims to have written notes of these conversation every evening after talking to voltaire. Additionally, there are many sources, that say that le chevalier ergulary consulted his notes to write his memoires.

The last argument against the reliability of the memoires given in the text criticises the imaginative escapeplan of the chevalier to get out of a prison in Venice. It is a bit unbelievable to think, that he actually made a hole through the ceiling rather than using one of his well-connected friends in Venice. Nevertheless, many other prisoners had well-connected friends and didn't get out of prison and there are actual documents in Venice stating, thaat the roof of his cell had to be repared after his escape.
