In our text Chevalier de Seingalt gets critisized strongly for writing memoires that are faulty, whereas in the listening they state that his memoires are an accurate and reliable historical source. Chevalier claims being very rich and splashing money on gambling and parties in Switzerland. Critics say that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant thus proving he was poor but we can also assume that his buisiness required him to wait until he could convert assets into money and in the meantime he lend money. In his memoires we can read a lot about conversations between him and Voltaire. Again one may ask themself how he was able to remember all there conversations that went back years when writing down his memoires. Chevalier has been seen cosulting a lot of notes and he even mentions that after each conversation with Voltaire he tried to remember as much as he could and write it down. Lastly we have the famous breakout story from a Venetian prison. He states that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and escape, but critics are more keen to the theory that he bribed himself free which contradicts with the fact that in this prison were many more influencial and powerful people that were not able to get out by bribary. In newly found Venetian documents it says that they had to repair the ceiling of his cell after he escaped, so why would they have done that if he bribed himself free?
