The text passage as well as the lecture have the memoire of Chevalier de Seingalt and it's accuracy as topic. The text passage states it's critique towards the historique accuracy whereas the the person holding the lecture thinks that no memoire can be 100 percent correct but the one of Chevalier comes close to it. But they both talk about three main topics of his memoire that they both interprete differently.

The first one is about the passage of Seingalts style of living in Switzerland. They both agree that Chevalier lived a life full of gambling and spending a lot of money. What they do not agree on is whose money it actually was that he spent. 

The second one is the part about Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire. The text passaage states that this is a total lie and that they never actually met but the lecturer says that there actually were time witnesses who stated that they did meet from time to time.

And finally the third topic was about Chavaliers escape from prison in Venice. And one more time the text passage doesn't agree with the story that was written in his memoire. The thinks it's another lie that was inventedd to make his life appeare more interesting. But the lecturer saays one more time that this possibly isns't the case and that this seems logic that Chevalier actually escaped through the ceiling.
