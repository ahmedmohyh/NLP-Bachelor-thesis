Chavalier de Seingalt is known for his long memoir about his life and adventures, which has become an important historical source about European society during the eighteenth century. Many critics have been made about his stories, clamiming that many things have been made up by him in order to make his life more exciting. But if we take a closer look into his life, we can say that this memoir is very accurate.

For example, while living in Switzerland, he wrote about his wealthy life and how he enjoyed going to parties. We can imagine that a man, who wants to write about his adventures has the porpuse to make something that leaves a footprint in the world. So as everybody does, he invested his money until he spent it all. The only way to survive and see if his efforts gave him the results he wanted and to keep living his life as he wanted, was borrowing money from a Swiss merchant. That doesn't mean that he was poor as many critics claim.

Another story was about his conversations with his close friend Voltaire. Every night after he had spent time with Voltaire he made notes of his conversations. So that one day years later he decided to write every conversation down and include it in his memoir. This also recieved many critics, beacause they doubted that he could remember every word they said years later.

The escape from the Venetian prison, was also critisized. They claim that his close friend from Venice helped him escape. But what they probably don't know is that many other men with more powerful friends than him, remained in prison.
