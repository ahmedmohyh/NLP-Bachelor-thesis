Chevalier de Seingalt mentioned in his memoir that he spent a part of his life living in Switzerland and that he was very wealthy during that time and organized a lot of parties. Yet it is proven that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money. According to the lecture, he had to do so because his wealth was not "liquid". Which means that he had a lot of valuable things but not a lot of cash. Therefore he had to borrow money to pay the parties while he sold some of his valuable things.
The Chevalier also mentions his talks with Voltaire. He even wrote down whole phrases in his memoir in the exact same way they were spoken. Critics don't believe this as he wrote the memoir many years after his talks with Voltaire. According to the lecture, the Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered from the talk the same night as he talked with Voltaire. So this too is no proof that the Chevalier has not been accurate in his memoir.
The last thing the Chevalier mentions is his escape from a venicien prison through the roof. Critics believe he bribed the prison guads in order to get free. This seems likely especially because of his good connections to politicians. But according to the lecture the Chevalier did not lie. Other prisoners had even better connections and also the venetian government had to repair the roof of the prison shortly after the Chevalier escaped.
