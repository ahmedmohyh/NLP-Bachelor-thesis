The first remark which can be done is that the audio passage is a lot more credible in the actions the Chevalier had done. It is said that this person is a reliable indicator of living circumstances in the 18th century. The writing is the contrast of that what happened in the audio. The Chevalier's actions are regarded to be very controversial and insecure, because the source the text comes from is not reliable at all.

Well, in order to get more concretely I want to point out different things that are illustrated otherwise.
Firstly,the text proposes that the Chevalier was not as wealthy as told in the audio. He is rumoured to have borrowed considerable sums from a Swiss Merchant, whereas the audio gives us the impression that he gained every penny by himself. 

Moreover, the Chevalier of the text is presented that his knowledge would base on memories. In the audio there is an accurate description told of what he had done effectively. Another affirmation that can be written is the belief that the Chevalier had bribed the jailers in Venice so as to get free. The audio gives us the information that he had escaped totally by himself with a piece of metal. The fact that the Chevalier had had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice has pushed us forward to be confirmed in our doubts about this story.

To sum up, I would suggest leaving it at that, because we cannot change history without knowing what really occurred instead. We just can hope for evidence and proofs that the Chevalier was not as brilliant as assumed at the beginning.
