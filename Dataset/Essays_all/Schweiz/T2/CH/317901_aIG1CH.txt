Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure in the eighteenth century, but on the other hand his memoir has become a valuable historical source. 
Of course no memory can be totally correct, but Cevalier's memory can be looked as a reliable source as the tutor in the lecture said. 
On the other hand many critics have a slightly different opinion about Chevalier's memoir. They doubt its accuracy, because Chevalier said he was very wealthy and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, but at the same time he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. The tutor in the lecture explained that case followed: "Chevalier had to sell his property to get money and at the same time he needed money, so he borrowed some. But that does not mean he is poor." 
Another point, that critics doubt it is correct, is the conversation with the famous writer and revolutionist Voltaire. They claim that it is impossible to remember the phrases exactly from the conversation and write them down many years later. But on the other hand, that is not a reason for the invalidity of Chevalier's memory, claims the tutor in the lecture. Chevalier is known, that he wrote everything down and kept notes of the conversation and so it is possible that he could write down the exact phrases in his memoir.

The last point mentioned of the critics was that the escape of the prision in Venice is very unlikely that it has happended in reality. Chevalier had made a hole in the ceiling and escaped. The women in the lecture said, that the had not really powerful friends as other prisoniers. But later in other documents of Venice it says that the ceiling of the prison had to be replaced. So another prove that the stories of Chevalier are true.

Also if the critics of the text and the women in the lecture had different opinions on the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir, it's no doubt a valuable source about European society in the eighteenth century.
