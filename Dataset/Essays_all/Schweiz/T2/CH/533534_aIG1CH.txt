In the essay the woman said, that the chevalier had to borrow money from somebody. But this doesn't mean, that he is poor. Chevalier spent lot of money on parties and gambling. So it's possible that he had to borrow money, because he had no money left at the moment. 
Critics also say, that the conversations with Voltaire are invented. It isn't possible to remember the conversations many years after, they say. But the woman mentioned, that Chevalier wrote the conversationsns down every evening. So he could write everything down, even a few years later.
In the text is written that Chevalier escaped from a notorious prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing  through the roof. The critics think it is inveted and he used it for a more enjoyable reading. Other people think it is true, because after his escape other prisoners went out too.
