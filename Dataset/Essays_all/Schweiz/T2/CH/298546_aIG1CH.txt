For the first point, the lecturer argues that Chevalier taking a loan does not mean that he was poor. He was on the contrary very wealty but his wealth came from sorts of assets which needed to be liquidized first and while he was waiting for that to happen he borrowed money to maintain his life-style during the waiting time.

For the second point, the lecturer says that the conversations described in Chevaliers memoiors are as accurate as it can get because he stated multiple times that he wrote down each conversation with voltaire the night he had had them. Furthermore, mulriple persons in the later life of Chevalier confirmed that he always carried around a lot f personal notes while writing his memoir.

Fo the last point, the lectures states that other prisoner had even more powerful friends in Venice than Chevalier and they did not escape which makes bribery highly unlikely. Plus a old eport from the Venetian government staes that they had to make reparations in the cell of Chevalier after he made his escape which supports his version of the story.

To sum up, while the lecturer claims that the memoir is one of the most accurate books in history critics question the most parts of Chevaliers books.
