It says that chevalier was rich, but was he realy that rich as everyone tells? A lot of people said that he did not have that much money because he borrowed alwys money. But that does not mean that he does not have any. To earn money you first have to become popular and the easiest way to become popular is making alot of parties.like this you meet alot of new people and maybe also some sponsers. So he first spend his money and then earnd it. 

The second argument about chavalier was that he escaped from the prison in venice. But there are alot of weird facts. For example were there alot of other prisoners that had a lot of conections and contacts to outside the prison. But why did chavalier have so good conections that he was able to escape? The second fact about the prison was that his room was preparated so it was very easy for him to escape, but why was he exactly in this room
