The text about Chevalier Seingalt (1725 - 1789) talks about Chevalier's memoir that he wrote at the end of his life which consists of many adventures of his life and his life itself. 
One of the point is that Chevalier spent a lot of money when he was living in Switzeland. As he was a wealthy man he spent the money on parties and gambling. The interesting point is that he has borrowed a large sum money from a Swiss merchant, so the question is whether he is really whealthy or not. 

Another point is the conversation between Chavalier and Voltaire which is also in the memoir of Chevalier, but critics complain, that the memoir was written too many years after Chevalier had the conversation with Voltaire and that it would be impossible to remember and write down every exact phrase from the conversation.

The last point is the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. Chevalier pretends to have escaped with a peace of metal that he used to make a hole into the ceiling and then escaped through the roof, but critics claim that it's more likely that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. Also Chevalier had a lot of politically well- connected friends in Venice who could have helped him. 

All in all I would say that the critics don't believe what Chevalier has written in his memoir whether it is a conversation with Voltaire or the escape from a prison in Venice.
