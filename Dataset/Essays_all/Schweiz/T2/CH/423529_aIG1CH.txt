The woman talks about the critics of the memoir of Chevalier. She commented every point which is mentioned in the text above and which doesen't seem true in the memoir.
The text says that Chevalier would not have been needed to borrow money if he had been very rich. But she explains that you first have to sell something to get the money. While he was waiting on his money he had to borrow some. That doesn't mean he was poor.
The next point says that it isn't possible that Chevalier could remember everything he and Voltaire talked about because his memoir was written many years after the conversation occured. The woman tells us that Chevalier sat down every evening after a conversation with Voltaire and wrote down everthing he could remember. With his notes he could write down the exact conversation years later. 
Another point which is mentioned in the text is the escape from the prison. They say that Chevelier had well-connected friends and they could have offered a bribe to free him. But as we are told by the woman there were prisoners who had a lot more politically well-connected friends and none of them could be bribed to free. 
And another proval of his story is that they had to repair the ceiling right after his escape which wouldn't be nescessary if he hadn't made a hole in the ceiling to climb out.
So the woman explains us how these critics may not be true. There is an explanation for all of them.
