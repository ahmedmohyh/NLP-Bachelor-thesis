In the article are written three main critics against the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, the speech defends it and gives arguments against this critics. The first critic is that Chevalier wasn't really rich beacause he often borrowed money. In the presentation they critisize this argument. It says that he was rich but at this time you often had to spend much money for special events in Swizzerland. So he used all his money and then he had to order more but until this money arrived he had to borrow some. That explains the fact that he was rich but he also borrowed a lot of money.
The second argument is that he couldn't remember his conversations after so many years. But witnesses told that he was taking notes regularly. In the speech they say that he has written down everything after the conversation with the famous people. So he was able to quote everything so exactly. 
To the last case which the critics questioned they say, that there were many other persons with even more politically well-connected friends in this prison. And they couldn't escape anyway. So it was easier to escape through the hole in the roof. They also mentioned that it has to be right because the prison in Venice had to repair the roof.
