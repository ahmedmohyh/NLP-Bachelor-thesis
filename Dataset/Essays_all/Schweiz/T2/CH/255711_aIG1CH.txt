Chevalier de Seingalt was a rich gambler. He gambled a lot in Switzerland, but for gambling he had to sell first some objects.
He escaped from the prison in Venice, but that was a really surprise, because there were other guys with much more influence and friends there.
The text and the presentation haven't so many different meanings, they are really similar, ther is many critic much about the chevalier's life.
The big difference between the text and the presentation is the bribe, in the text noody thinks about that, in the presentation it is telled that chevalier escaped in a strange way.
He is only famous in Europe and really important in many countries.
The famous writter Voltaire is not telled in the presentation but he was really important in whole Europe that time.
