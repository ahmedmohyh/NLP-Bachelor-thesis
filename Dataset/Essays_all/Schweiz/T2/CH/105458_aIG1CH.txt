Chevalier de Seingalt is known for his amazing adventures and memoir. But the truth of his memoirs is hard critized by expert. Some of his stories couldn't have happened the way he wrote it down. Sometimes even the expert are arguein about the stories of Chevalier. In the text is written, that Chavalier couldn't have been wealthy because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchent, while in the presentation it is said that he was a rich man, cause no merchant would lend money to a poor man. At least he must have been able to pay his debt so he must have been rich. Experts are also argueing about the escape from the prison. Both sources,(text and presentation) do agree that he couldn't have escaped from prison like he wrote it down in his memoir. But the real way of the escape is hard discused. In the text his escape is explained by knowing people out of prison with much influence. The experts in the presention think that that couldn't have been true, cause other prisoners knew much more important friends
