In the presentation it's said, that the memoires of Chevalier are pretty accurate and relyable as an historical sorce. However in the text there are some arguments which question the truth of his experiences. For all of these questioning arguments there are some explanations in the presentation, which make them seem redundant.
First of all the questio about his wealth is mentioned. It is known that Chevalier had to take out loans while he lived in switzlerland. In the text this fact leads the the assumption, that Chevalier must have been poor. In the presentation we get different view. It is explained that, just because he had to take out a loan and orrow money it doesn't have to mean that he was poor. He lived a very expensive live and he was a gambler, therefore he had to borrow money sometimes but the money came back again, so the interpretation of  in the presentation.
Another aspect which is questioned is meeting between Voltaire and Chevalier. It seems strange that Chevalier rembered whole and accurate phrases from the conversation between them. In the prensentation there is no daubt about his meeting with Voltaire. They say that it is very likely that Chevalier had taken notes during their conversation and published them a few weeks later.
In conclusion there are many aspects in his memoires which can be questionend but it accures that for every doubt there is an reasonable explanation in the presentattion.
