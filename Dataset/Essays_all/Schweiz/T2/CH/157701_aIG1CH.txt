Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived between 1725 and 1798, wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. However, there are some critics who doubt that all events are true. They say that Chevalier invented many events to make his life more exciting than it was for the world.
In the text it is written that Chevalier spent a lot of money. Despite of he said that he was poor when he lived in Switzerland. In the presentation it is said that Chevalier did not have much money. But he was not poor. He had enough money for having a good life.
Chevalier had met Voltaire for a conversation. But he wrote the facts about the conversation between Voltaire and him many years after. So many people doubt that all the facts are true. Because Chevalier could not remember exactt phrases from the conversation. In the presentation the woman talks also about this.
In the text they doubt also that Chevalier escape the prison. But in the presentation they say that after this event, some people had to repair the prison. Why should the prison had been repaired when the story from Chevalier is not true? In the text it is written that maybe some famous friends Chevalier had helped. But nobody talks in the presentation about politically well-connected friends in Venice of Chevalier.
