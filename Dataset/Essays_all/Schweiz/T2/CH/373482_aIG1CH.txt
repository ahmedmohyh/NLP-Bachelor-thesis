In the audio about Chevaliers memoir they talked about its accuracy and what critics say. But they think that the memoir is accurate and isn't exaggerated. Even though no memoir can be completly correct it still is of importance, mostly so Chevaliers because it's a historical resource.
Critics say that even though Chevalier wrote that he was very wealthy and that he spent a lot of many in Switzerland where he was gambling. Also he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant which leads them to think that he wasn't rich at all. But in the audio they say that just because someone borrows money he or she doesn't have to be poor. An argument was also that when winning assets while gambling it takes some time to turn them in cash and that's the reason for Chevalier borrowing money.
Another argument was that nobody can remember a conversation from some time ago so accurate that he could rewrite it word for word. In the audio they say that research has shown that Chevalier wrote down notes in his journal after every conversation with Voltaire and that's why he could write it down so accurate in his memoir.
Lastly there's the escape of a Venetian prison which critics claim to be a lie. They believe that his important, politically well-connected friends in Venice have bribed the jailer. The person in the audio disagrees. He or she says that many other prisoners which had even wealthier and more important friends than Chevalier couldnever leave. Also they mentioned old documents from the Venetian prison which hold information about a repairment in Chevaliers cell. Because of those reasons they believe the memoir to be accurate.
