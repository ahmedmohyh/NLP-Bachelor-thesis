His memoire is never fully correct, but his is pretty acurate.

The text argues about his wealth with the evidence of him taking out loans from a swiss merchant. This however does not have to mean that he is poor. He had his wealth not in chash but in a type of property that needs time to be made liquid. So while selling his assets and waiting for cash, he borrowed money from a merchant until he had hid money from the sale. Then he could pay the merchant back. This does not mean that he was not rich.

Chevalier had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire described in his memoire. The text doubts the acuracy of the phrases mentioned in the memoire as it apparently 'is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier'. But it is said in the memoir that Chevalier wrote down the conversation in the night after the actual meeting. And People living with Chevalier in his later life also said that he was using papers with noted stuff on it, while writing the memoire.
 
The text doubts the reliability of his story about his escape from prision. Bribery is not very likely because there were  many other prisoneers with better connections, who had never been able to escape. The best evidence to his story, was an official document saying that the ceiling of his cell had to be repared after he was gone.
