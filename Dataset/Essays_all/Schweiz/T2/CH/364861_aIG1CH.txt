It is said that the Chevalier de Seingalt has one of the most accurate biographies. Although many believe that his life story is very controversial and too extravagant to be true the lecture states that he does tell the truth in his adventures. First controversy that is found between the text and the lecture is that the Chevalier had spent a lot of money in Switzerland during his stay here. The lecture supports this statement and believes that the Chevalier did spent a lot of money due to his wealthness. The text although states that the Chevalier had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant.
The second controversy that is found, are the conversations he had withthe writer Voltaire. Critics state that it is impossible that these conversations are accurate because no one can capture the precise words they exchanged, especially if the conversation took plays years ago. However the lecture believes that the conversation had been captured immediatly after it had taken place. Both do agree that they had a conversation. 
Thirdly the escape from the Venetian prison. Critics believe that he escaped from prison by bribing the guards and having such powerful connections.However the lecture thinks that the Chevalier did indeed escape from prison by making a hole in the ceiling. They state that after the Chevalier had escaped from prison, the prison had to repair the ceiling of his cell. Another reason why they think that the Chevalier had escaped through the hole is because the other inmates had much more powerful connections but never managed to bribe the prisonguards. So if the Chevalier had indeed escaped from prison through bribe why would the prison repair the cell in which he was.
