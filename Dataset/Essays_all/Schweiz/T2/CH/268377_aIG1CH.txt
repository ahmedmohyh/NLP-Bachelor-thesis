Many critics think that the Chevalier invented stories about his live to make it seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. There are some evidences that support the critics. For example did the Chevalier say that he spent his time in switzerland by gambling and going on parties. Evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, what would mean that the critics are right. But others say that he needed to borrow money becuase he had no Swiss money and it needed time to change money. Another event was the break out of he prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the celling. the critics claim that it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. To negate this version professionals say that there were man others in that prison with alot more influence than him. And they had no jailers that were bribed to free them. Another strange fact is that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after the break-out. Why would they repair the ceiling if it wasn't damaged?
