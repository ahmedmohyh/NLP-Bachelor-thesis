In the lecture, the point was made that the Chevalier had been wealthy. But actually he gambled and went to parties a lot which made him loose money and if he didnt have enough, he would just borrow some money from someone else. It is also stated that Chevalier had conversations with Voltaire and that he refered to them in the memoir. What Chevalier made more famous, is that he escaped from a prison. This kind of thing doesnt happen very often. It actually isnt said in the lecture that he borrowed money from a swiss merchant, but just from other people he knew and met. In the lecture, she doesnt talk about how Chevalier met famous people like kings, writers and more. And I dont think that she talked about that he was living in Switzerland while all those things happenend. Meeting Voltaire was one thing, but rememberbing the conversation in such an exact manner, is outstanding and lead to claim that it couldnt have been like that, because no one can remember a conversation in such a way when it was a couple years ago. It is also not said in the lecture that Chevalier was controversial which I find pretty interesting, because the claims they make in the text are actually pretty high.
