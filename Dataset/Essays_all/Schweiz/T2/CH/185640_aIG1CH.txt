The text succests that Chevalier's memoir is not accurate, it points out several controversial events. Like every other historical source, people interpret them differenty. Was Chevalier very wealthy while living in Switzerland? The text suggests, that since he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, he could not have been very rich, the refery contradicts and says, that he just needed to wait for his money. Also the conversations between himself and Voltaire, a famous writer of the time, are discussed. He wrote his memoir many years after the conersations, and therefor could not remember the event accuratly, however other souces mention him consulting notes while writing his memoir. His escape from a prison in Venice, Italy, is also a great issue. He claims to have escaped the prison by using a piece of metal and making a hole in the ceiling so as to climb through. This story sounds incredible and critics claim that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him with the help of his well-connected friends. However other influencial prisoner did not manage to escape and the ceiling of Chevalier's cell is recorded to have been repaired after his escape.
