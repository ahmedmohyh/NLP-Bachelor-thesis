The lecture defends the memoire of Chevalier against three main critic points. Firstly, critics claim that, had he been rich, he would not have had to take a loan from a merchant. The lecture however, states that Chevalier had most of his wealth in goods and land. To convert these in to money, which he needed for his excesive partying, he had to sell them first. Naturally he had to find a buyer first, which is why it took some time to get his money. That is, most likely, why he had to borrow money from a merchant. However, that does not mean he wasn't wealthy. Secondly, the text states that his conversation with voltaire,which he had a few years prior to his memoire, couldn't have possibly been accurate, as it's nearly impossible to remember whole phrases of a long converation. In the lecture, the woman mentions that Chevalier had most likely taken notes during the conversation, and that he used those to write his memoires. Thirdly, critics don't believe his story of how he escaped prison in Venice. They say the story is exagerated, and that it is more likely that he just bribed the guards to let him out as he had well-connected friends.
