Most memoirs are not correct at all, but those from Chevalier de Seingalt are. Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 up to 1798 in Switzerland. He was righting notes all his life and at the end of this life he wrote his memoirs.There are three episodes. The first one tells about his life in genearal like how he lived.He was not poor at all. He just had to borrow sometimes money for his parties and the gampling.
On the second part he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire and how he spent time with him.He also mentiont about how he kept his notes hiden, so nobody could ever read them exept him, untill he finished his memoir.
Then on the last part he tells the readers about how he escaped from the prison in Venice.So alot of prisoners had better conectiond to the goverment than Chevalier. But he's the only one who was able to escape from the prison with he help of his connections.He was well-connected with polotically friends so he was able to offered a bribe.
