The lecturer gives explanations why the memoirs of the Chevalier were so detailed and why the criticism mentioned in the text are wrong. 

The first point in the text which claimed that the Chevailer wasn't whealty because he had to borrow money can be invalidated. The lecturer says that the Chevalier was in fact whealty and was just waiting for the money he got from converting his assets. 

The second criticism was about how detailed the conversation with Voltaire were written in the memoirs, because no one could remember exact phrases for so long. The lecturer explains that there is evidence that the Chevalier made notes about the conversations every night and had consulted them while writing his memoirs.

The last point mentioned in the text was about the Chevaliers escape from a Venetian prison. The text claims, that it's way more likely that friends of the Chevalier had bribed the jailers than that he ecsaped through a hole in the ceiling. The lecturer explains, that there were people in this prison which had more important friends to bribe the jailers and weren't able to escape this way. The escape through the ceiling is also likely when you consider old Venetian documents in which is writen that the ceiling in the Chevaliers cell had to be repaired.
