When writing a memoir many people tend to polish their lifes and adventures just to get more attention from the readers. In the case of Chevalier memoir there are a few questionable points regarding the accuracy.

The first thing that is mentioned in the text is that he was exagerating about his wealth. He used to borrow money from rich merchants and borrowing money is not something rich people would do. However just because having to borrow money from others doesn't mean that chevalier wasn't rich in fact he was kind of investing his money and because he didn't get his money immidiately he had to borrow some from other, which he obviously paid back later.
The second thing mentioned was his meeting with voltaire. Many believe that he couldn't exactly remember every phrase that they spoke to each other. But Chevalier was the type of guy who did make notes that is why it is possible that they met and his memoir regarding Voltaires conversation was quite accurate.
The last point mentioned was his escape from the Venitian Jail. Many people doubt that he dug a hole with a piece of metal to flee from the prison. It could be that he offered money to the ones who are in charged with the prison.
But there are documents found about Chevaliers cell that it needed to be repaired because he broke something. Why on earth would Chevalier break something if not for his escape?

However we will never really find out the truth because Chevalier is deceased and he can't tell us anymore which statements are true and which are not.
