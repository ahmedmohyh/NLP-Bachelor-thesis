Chevalier:
There are three major arguments that prove his storys: Firstly, he needed to borrow money in Switzerland because he didn't have the money fluid. Because it needs time to sell his ownings he had to borrow money to get it in short term and pay it back after he get the money from selling his belongings. Secondly, after he talked to Voltaire he made some notes and refered to them when he wrote down his memoirs. He also contacted  newspapers. Thirdly, in the prison where he was there were many more powerful people and they couldn't bribe the jailers, so why could he? After his escape from prison his cell needed to get repaired so his version of the story had to be true. flflflflflflflflfl
