Chevalier de Seingalt is the main character in the text.He was a writer and wrote his own memoir. It's said, that no memoir can be corrected, so the sentences and statements on the paper are all the wuotes we got, if it's true or false we don't know, but we can pretend. Surely he wasn't poor, because he had a lot of money and he spent a huge amount of it for parties and gambling, so he always had money to spent, he wasn't poor at all. How we know, he was in the Venetian prison and escaped from there, but we don't know exactly how. In Venetian documents though, there's a statement, where we can understand that the Italians tried to repair the ceiling, but it seems to be a wrong statement, because didn't we say that we know from other quotes that he escaped and didn't break the ceiling? Questions are open.
