As we were able to hear, there are some contrarities in the text and the reading. While the text seems critical, the reading is in that case pro Chevalier. The first point was the discussion about his wealth in switzerland. The text says that Chevalier has borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant and because of that it seems unlikely that Chevalier was a wealthy man. In the other hand the reading says that this has nothing to mean about his wealth. It is known that he spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling. Furthermore he was waiting on his money which he got for selling his properities.
Another discussion point is the conversation of him and Voltaire. The text holds the position that it is not possible to remember as detailed as Chevalier a conversation which was hold years ago. Furthermore the reading brings up the fact that this is a very small point for the critics of the text to establish its theory that Chevalier was faking his memoir
Chevalier wrote about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. As we can see the text says that this ain't possible and that it is more likely that his powerful friends have offered him a bribe. The reading in the other view thinks that in an another statement the prison said that his jail had to be fixed afterwards. In my eyes a clear evidence that he was not lying.
