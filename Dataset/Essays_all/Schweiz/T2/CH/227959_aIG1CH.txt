The Chevalier de Seingalts memoirs are questioned by some historians on their acuracy. These critics say that he invented and/or exaggerated events that are documented in his meomirs. 
For example, critics are sceptical about is financial state when he was in switzerland. In his memoirs the Chevalier de Seingalts claism that he was very wealthy. Some say that isn't true since he had to borrow big sums of money and that he wouldn't have had to ask people for money if he was wealthy. Other say that he was only borrowing money because it took him some time to get the money from his estates and that he only loaned money so he could throw partys and gable while he was waiting for his own.
Critics also say that the Chevalier had in fact written down his conversations white the famous frnech philosopher, Voltaire, corrently. The claims of him not being accurate because he supposadly wrote down the conversations years later, are heavily disagreed upon since he wrote down all the talks on the same day. 
Critics are question his escape from the venician prison, simce he had politically well-known friends tat could have bribed him out. Other critics believe that he did actually break out of the prison with a piece of metal, because italian documents of that time say that a hole in the ceiling had to be fixed and other prisoners had more politically well-known friend and weren't able to be bribed out.
