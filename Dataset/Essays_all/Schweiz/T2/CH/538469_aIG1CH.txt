In the text I read,they talked about the doubts of experts of the accuacy of the memoir from Chevalier.
They took out tree points mentioned in the text, what they consider as impossible and wrong.
The first point was, that he couldn't be as rich as he wrote about it, because he had been borrowing money. But actually he borrowed the money as he was waiting for his house to sell. It was just a little time, when his cash ran out. They also had doubts on the thruth of the conversations with the famous french writer Voltaire- But they should be pretty accourate because Chavalier wrote down the conversations right after they met, not a few years later. And when he wrote down his memoir he used his jourals with his notes to write those conersations down.
The Breakout of the Jail in Venecia is another controversial part of the memoir, because they think e just bought himself ut of the prison. But actually this wouldn't be so possible, because there where even more powerful prisoners with even more powerful friends who could possible helped them out,but this never happened. There is also an old document from that time in venecia, where they wrote about the repair of the seeling in Chevaliers cell.
So the memoires can be prooved in some way
