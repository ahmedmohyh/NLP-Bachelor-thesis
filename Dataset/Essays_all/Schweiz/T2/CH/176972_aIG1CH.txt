The woman who spoke in the audio has the opposite opinion about Chevalier. She has her reasons for this critics which she wants to change. At first point the critc he had been in really poor but he just said he had been wealthy while he was in switzerland. In fact the woman explaint he had to sell things at first before he could earn money. That menas he has to borrow money from others. Second point which was discussed is his uncorrected memoir which is a historical source about European society. Voltaire was named in this affaire because the conversations which they had Chevalier regulary wrote them down. But his fault was that he published his memoir years ago and he had to write the conversations again. It means it is just an misunderstanding. Last point of the critics is chevaliers escape from notorious prison in Venice. It is said Chevalier got help to escape from a friend who was politically activeted. But in the audio was another story of this escape of Chevalier. It was told Chevalier had not any strong friend in Venice who could have helped him to escape from prison. There were other people in that prison who have got such friends like it was said about Chevalier.
