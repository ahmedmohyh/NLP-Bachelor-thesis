The lecture I heard contradicts the statements made in the text. There is an explanation for every single point made against the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier.
To start off, the first point can be explained by knowing that Chevalier only borrowed money from the Swiss merchant shortly after his arrival. Even if someone borrows money it doesn't mean he didn't pay it back or that he is poor. The Chevalier can still be wealthy.
Secondly, it is known that Chevalier transcribed his conversations with Voltaire and then referred back to them when writing his memoir. There is nothing to be sceptical about.
Lastly, the prison escape is also said to seem quite unprobable in the lecture, since Chevalier was not a man of as much influence as other prisoners, who have not been able to escape. However, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after his escape, which wouldn't have been necessary had he not escaped.
