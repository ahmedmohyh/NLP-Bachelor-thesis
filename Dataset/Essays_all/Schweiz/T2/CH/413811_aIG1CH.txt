In the text and the audio there were mentioned the same points from different angels. First of all they talk about Chevailer de Seingalt, who wrote at the end of his life a memoir recounting. Critics then said, that most of his things, that he wrote down, were not possible and were just simply invented. 
A mentioned point was, that he had he wrote about being rich while he lived in Switzerland. But it sound like a bit abstract that he had to borrow some money while being rich at the same time. In the audio they give the explanation, that he sold all his worthy things and had to wait for the money. While waiting for it, he had to borrow money to survive. 
Another point was the text, where Chevalier met the famous writer Voltare. In the text they talk about, that it's impossible to keep the sentences, Voltaire said, in mind for many years. Like before the audio gives another explanation for that. They sipmly say, that the made notes during the dialoge and kept them for many years so hed could just copy the sentences from his notes. 
The third point they talk both about ist the escape from the prison in Venice. The text says, that the whole escape was just invented, because it was nearly impossible to get out of a prison with just a piece of metal. It's way more easy to get out of prison with just bribe the jailers to free him. The audio has again an other view to the situation. They say that the had to repair the sealing after Chevailer escaped. If this information is right then it's very questionable, why they had to repair it if he just bribed the jailers.
