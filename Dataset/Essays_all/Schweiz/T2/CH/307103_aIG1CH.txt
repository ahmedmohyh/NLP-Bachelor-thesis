The long memoir recounting the life of Chevalier de Seingalt(1725-1798) is quoted as pretty accurate. In fact there are some evidents that prove the rightfoulness but as in all memoires they still are memoires and there is always the possiblity of wrongs and lies.
The first argument is about the money that Chevalier had spent while he was living in Switzerland. It is known that he had spent an enormous amount of money but why should he then have to borrow money from a Swiss merchant? The reason is simple. He could still have been rich and wealthy but the things he was selling demanded always a little time. So untill he had his money he had to borrow some.
The second argument is the conversation between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The memoire was written long after the talking had been. So how could Chevalier still had known all sentences and so accurate as he had written in his memoir? That is because he had some other guys with him when the conversation had been and they noted everything down.
The last argument is about the prison break from Venice. It is proven that there had been prisoners that had more and better politically  well-connected friends in Venice than Chevalier and they did not get out of prison. There are also records of the ceiling of Chevaliers chamber
