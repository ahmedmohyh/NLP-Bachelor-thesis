Chevalier wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures. there are many criticers who have doubts about the accuracy and reliability of this memoir. 
Critics think that Chevalier was not rich, because he had to borrow money. But just because of the loan it does not mean that he would have been poor. In those days you had to wait until you got the cash from the assets you you wanted to change into. And until he got that money he had to borrow it from others until he could pay them back. 
Now regarding the conversations with Voltaire. Chevalier claimed that he had written down every word from the conversation he could remember right after this conversation had taken place. And his close friends and family do proove that he had consult his notes while writing this memoir. So the conversation could not possibly be that wrong in the memoir unless he would have written something into it that never happened. 
Last but not least the prison story, we can not be 100 percent sure if he really made a hole to escape from the prison but we do know that there were prisoners who had better connected friends than Chevalier and that a few weeks after his escape the prison had to repair a ceiling. So there is actually a high chance that this was written like it happened.
So all this arguments actually do support the fact that the memoir from Chevalier pretty accurate.
