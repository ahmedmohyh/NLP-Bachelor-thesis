Chevalier de Seingalt somehow had a really adventurous life. He met many famous people and became also famous by his own. He wrote a memoir about his life where he described all the important steps, including his wealth and his escape from prison. 
He lived in Switzerland for a long time and it is written that he spent alot of money on parties and gambling. Some critics say that he became poor because of that but others say that it can't be true. A reason to prove his poorness could be the fact that he boworred considerable sums of money from a Swiss mechant. But maybe he needed it for big projects as a credit. 
Most people don't know him for his wealth but for his escape from a prison in Venice. He wrote that he escaped through a hole in the ceiling, but many people don't believe this story. It was well known that he had a number of relly influencable friends who maybe helped him to escape. Bribery was a graet deal at this time and no one could ever proove that Chevalier didn't lie in his version of the story.
