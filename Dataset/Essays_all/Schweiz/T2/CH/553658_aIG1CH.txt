The Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life and all of his experiences. The text and the presentation talk about three episodes of his memoir. Critics claim the Chevavlier came up with many of his adventures and did not really experience them.
In the first episode mentioned by the text and presentation the Chevalier wrote about living in Switzerland and spending a lot of money on gambling and parties. However, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. The presentation explained the loan as the time it took for the Chevalier to make money out of his assets.
The second episode was about conversations with Voltaire. Critics claim he couldn't have possibly remembered all of the conversations with Voltaire. Although apparently the Chevalier came home every night and wrote down all of his conversations.
The Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice was also a victim of a lot of critisism. In his memoir he writes about escaping through the ceiling using a piece of metal. Although critics say he bribed his way ou with the help of political friends. There are old government documents that were found stating that the roof had to be repaired a little after the Chevalier's escape.
