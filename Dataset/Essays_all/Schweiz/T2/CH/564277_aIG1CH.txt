argumets text:
toward the end of his life, the chavalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recoutung his life and adventures.
He was a somewhat controversial figure.
He met many famous people.
Some critics have doubts about the accuracy of the memoir.

argumets I listened before:
He is rich and not poor.
Memoires are often not correct.

Al in all the text and the other think tell the same but not really the same. How I mean that? it is the same in different words.
