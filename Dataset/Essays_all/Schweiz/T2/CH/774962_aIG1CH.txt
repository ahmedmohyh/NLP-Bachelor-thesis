It is almost impossible that a memoire is correct overall. In the presentation it is mentioned that the memoire of Chevalier is pretty accurate. Chevalier was wealthy and spent a lot of money in Switzerland. He worked there and had to wait for his money thats why he borrowed some but not because he was poor. In fact he was a very rich man. 

Chevalier also mentioned in his memoire his conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. He took notes all the time and people who knew him very well told that he had a journal and that he wrote everything very accurate down. In fact he remembered every exact phrase because he wrote everything down.

The memoir's account of the Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice is also true. It is possible because many other prisoners had a lot of wealthy and well known friends too but couldn't escape. Another sign that it is true is that there was a hole in the ceiling that had to be repaired. There's no other good reason for a hole in the ceiling.
