The reliability of the memoir recounting Chevalier de Seingalt's life and adventures is highly debated these days. For instance, some critics claim that Chevalier was in fact not as wealthy as he pretented to be. Evidence even shows that he borrowed considerable sums of money, which would suggest that Chevalier was living a life above his financial standards. However, Chevalier was known to be an investor. As an investor, you sometimes have to wait for the money you invested into assets to come back; therefore, it might have been possible that he lended money to some in order to profit from that very investment at some point. Since he was living an exciting life, he had to borrow money to maintain his extraordinary lifestyle. 
Further on, the conversations with the writer Voltaire are said to be inaccurate. Critics say that no one can remember conversations that well that he can use them again many years later. On the other hand, many witnesses confessed that Chevaliers in fact wrote everything down right after the conversations with Voltaire were over. 
Regarding the spectacular prison escape which is said to have resulted from bribery, there is proof that other inmates were even more powerful than Chevalier and they did not get free. Besides, the metal thing he used to escape according to his memoir, was later found to be part of the ceiling. That very ceiling in his cell had later been fixed, because it missed that very metal bar.
