The memoirs from Chevalier de Seingalt are a importent resource from the historics, but there are also critics who think, that a lot of things he did arent realy true and just to entertaining.

The chevalier was in switzerland and spent a lot of money there in gambeling and partys. So that he needed more money, which he got from an merchant. That means he was very rich because he spent a lot of money for luxury.
The Fakt, that he spoke to Voltaire is also true, because, its proved that he rode the book many years later and perhaps he found the note from himself there and came to the idea that he could write about it. So there he hadent known everything exactly he pergaps had a note so he just wrote what the conversation could be like.
Its also proved , that his cell in jail had to be renovated after he ascaped. So he must have made a hole or something like that to escape. And not because of his friends. Otherwiese you dont have to repair a cell in jail.

yeah!
