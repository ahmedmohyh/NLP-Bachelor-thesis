The speaker is talking about the accuracy of the memoir, written by Chevalier de Seingalt, which is criticized hardly by critics. She says, that no memoie can be really accurate, because they`re based on memorys of life with all his adventures,but Chevalier's memoir wouldbe very accurate. She tells us, that he had wealth, but he sold stuff, and so he first had to sell it before he got cash and because of that he had to borrow money sometimes before he was able to earn money. So this would be an explanation for the problem shown in the text, that if he had wealth, he wouldn't have been forced to even borrow any money. Furthermore he has kept notes, he wrote right after the conversation with Voltaire, whom accurancy is also doubted in the text, which he said to have used for his memoir. And on to the last one; in the prison in Venice, there were inprisonners, who had more powerful friends than Chevalier and the never got out, but the text is telling us he would have gotten uot of prison. Also, shortl yafter his escape, the ceiling of his room in prison, actually had to be reapaired.
