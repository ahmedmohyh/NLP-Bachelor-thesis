In the text critics say, that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt, which he wrote toward the end of his life, is no reliable historic source. They made three major points. Firstly he couldn`t have been that rich because he often borrowed money from a merchant. Secondly he couldn`t have remembered the whole conversation he had with Voltaire, which he describes very detailed in his memoir. And thirdly his unrealistic breakout from the prison in Venice, where his wealthy friends probably bribed the jailers for his freedom. 
But the opposition sais that his memoir is true and reliable. The Chevalier borrowed money from the merchant because he didn`t have cash. His riches were in form of land which he had to sell first, which took a while for the money to arrive. He wrote down the conversations with Voltaire on the same day he had them, so he didn`t have to remember them. And the escape from the prison, where he drilled a whole into the ceiling could very well be true, because the ceiling was replaced the day after his escape. Besides there were way more powerful prisoners at that time who couldn`t escape through bribery.
