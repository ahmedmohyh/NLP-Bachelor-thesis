The Chevalier

It is a text about the Chevalier de Seingalt who wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures.

The memoir of the Chevalier are accurancy overall and has become a valuable hisroeical source about European society in  the eighteenth century. But in the text stands, that a lot of critics have raised doubt about the accurcy od the memoir. The Chevalier wasn't poor, because of he run out of money. He was very wealthy and spent to much of on parties and so he needed to borrow money. But critis argue that if he had really been rich, he would not have needed to borrow money, so they think he was poor. The Chevalier had saved the notiz of the conversations between him and Voltaire at home and wrote the text years later. However, critics complained that the text was written years later and no one can rembember the exact conversation.
