Critics claim that if Chavalier was indeed so rich as he mentions in his memoir, he needn't have borrowed money. But maybe his wealth didn't have the form of money but the form of stuff he owned. When he tries to turn them in to money it takes a couple of days until the money arries. In this time Chavalier may have borrowed money.

Hisorical sources prove that Chavalier always had a great amount of notes, which he kept save during a long period of time. He could have written everything down he remembers of the conversation the same night or a day after the conversation. Like this almost everything would be accurat and even years after, he could write everything down relied on his notes.

The notorious escape from the prison could be possible. There were many other even more powerfull prisoner with even more powerfull friend that could have helped them escape. But none of them actually did or were able to. So it wouldn't likely that Chevalier had help as well. A historical fact says that just after Chevalier had escaped, the roof from Chevaliers cell had to be replaced and fixed. It is unlikely that these events don't have any connections at all.
