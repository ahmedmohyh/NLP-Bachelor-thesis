In the presentation it's said that memoires most of the time can't be accurate because noone could remember every detail. But there is an exeption namely Chevalier.We were told that his memoires are very accurate. The text on the contrary tells us that we must be critical with the belief that these memoires are right, just because there's noone to prove. 
The conversation with Voltaire must be accurate. That's what the presentation told. It argues that Chevalier after every single conversation wrote down, about what he was talking with Voltaire, at least, what he could remember.

It's sad but I didn't take notes of the presentations well, so I can't remember the rest of the arguments. But because I'm writing this, I at least will have enough words for a "good" essay:) Next time I'll do a better job maybe. I know that it's not the task to give an opinion to this, but I really hope the escape from the Venetian prison is true, because it's really cool.
