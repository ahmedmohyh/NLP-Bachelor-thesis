Chevalier was a person which wrote a long memoir recounting his life and his adventures. In the reading part it was said that he wrote every night everything down from his conversations which are still in his memoire. He is a very controversial person but since het met many famous people, including kings and writers his memoire became a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteen century. He liked to have a very glamorous live and he wanted everytime to make this a little bit more excitining that it still was. Critcer said that his memoirs are not possilble because they think that Chevalier and Voltaire never met and conversed together. And there is a other point, it could be that these memoires are all writen many years later after the "conversation". 
Chevalier claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbign through the roof. What is not normal, is that his jailers were bribed to free him.
