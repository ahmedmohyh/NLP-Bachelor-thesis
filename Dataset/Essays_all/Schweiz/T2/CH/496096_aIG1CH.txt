A memoir can't be always correct, there's always a fictional part in it. So it is aswell in the memoir from Chevalier. The Chevalier was wealthy and spent too much money for parties and gambling but because of that he had to borrow money a lot. He had conversations with Voltaire but they were kept secretly. In the audio they mentioned that Chevalier must had escaped because otherwise the prison wouldn't have repaired the ceiling.  
The first point wich is different from the audio is that Chevalier wouldn't have needed to borrow money because he was that rich, but as I mentioned he spent that much that he had to borrow money till he got himself his money. A second point is that critics don't believe that the conversations between Voltair and him were captured. In the text there is also a doubt that Chevalier has escaped from the prison because it wouldn't be possible to do it with a piece of metal.
