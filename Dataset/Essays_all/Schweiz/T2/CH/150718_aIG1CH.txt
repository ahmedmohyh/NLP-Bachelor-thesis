The Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure. Some critics have raised doubts about his famous memoires, which have become a valuable historical source about European sciety in the eighteenth century. There are three aspects: First, that the Chevalier was very wealthy while living in Switzerland, even though it is known that he spent a grat deal of money there on parties and gambling. Second, his accurately captured conversations with Voltaire, and last but not least, his escape from the Venetian prison. A lot of people think that those are just invented things to make the memoire seem more exciting and glamorous than in really was. 

For examble, it was quite usual that the Chevalier were on parties and gambling. They often had to wait for their money, but that doesn't mean that they were poor. Also the criticism about the conversations with Voltaire: It is known that the Chevalier sat sometimes down in the evening and wrote down everything he could remember about the conversations. He kept his notes and brought them finally in his memoire. So it is quite possible that the notes could capture the content accurately, although the memoire was written many years after the conversations occurred. His escape from the prison room in Venice is a bit more difficult to explain. The Chevalier de Seingalt hadn't had a lot of strong friends in the prison, so it made a lot more difficult for him to escape. But the fact that there was really a hole in the ceiling which had to be repaired, shows that the claim of his daring excape could possibly true. But even though some of the critics memoire of the Chevalier can be proofed, one should know that no memoire can be entirely correct.
