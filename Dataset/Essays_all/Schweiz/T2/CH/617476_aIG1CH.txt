Chevalier sounds like a messed up name, 
obviously he gained a lot of fame, 
the question is, is it true, what he claimed, 
legends say he was the boss of the game. 

He met a lot of famous people famous on his journey,
in this sentence I see nothing to concern me,

Some people say he wasn't that rich as
he said but I think those people are snitches.

Leave him alone, he had his own loan,
He lived the lifestyle I want he's my icone.

And though, he may not remember anything, 
his discussions with voltaire were astonishing.

What a king who escaped a prison through the ceiling,
the prison guards must have had a really bad feeling,
I know the rap doesn't have a lot of meaning,
All I want to know is when kicks the lean in?
