The aim of this essay is to resume the arguments given in the presentation about Chevalier de Seingalts life. 

Firstly, the Chevalier is not sure to be wealthy as he pretended to be in his memoir because it someoene found out, that he borrowed big amounts of money from a Swiss merchant. But the oral presentation explains that even wealthy people need some time to sell an asset and get cash from it, so it's reasonable that he borrowed cash from other people sometimes.

Next, critics are skeptical about the conversation he had with Voltaire, another famous poet. But friends of Chevalier confirmed that he wrote down the conversation with Voltaire the next day and kept them many years.

The third argument which confirms that Chevalier says the truth in his memoir is the fact, that the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired after he escaped. Therefore it's very likely that he escaped. The claim, that he only had political friends which got him out is false because there were other prisoners with more influencing friends and they didn't came out of prison with their connections.
