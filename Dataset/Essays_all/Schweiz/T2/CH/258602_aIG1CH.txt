Chevalier de Seingal wrote at the final stage of his life a memoir that refers to his adventurous life. Some people think nowadays that his memoir is not reliable because of a few inacurracies but still many historians believe otherwise. But why do some believe that these texts are inaccurate and some that it is?

Those who believe that his memoir is inaccurate claim that he did not have such a glamorous life as he wrote down in 1790. Chevalier did not have a glamorous and wealhty life as he claims. How do the know that? Because historians found out that he had to borrow money while living there. Otherwise the believers of the memoir say that it was common back then and that it did not have anything to do with the financial status of a person. Therefore this borrowing has nothing to do with being poor.

Also are people skeptical about the conversations between him and the famous writet Voltaire which the other ones still can contraverse.

A few are also unsure about the fact that he has escaped prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They say that Chevalier's jailers were bribed for him but actually other prisoners had more powerful friends, as we know now, that could have helped them way more and now we also know that the policists had to repair the ceiling at that time therefore there must be some truth behind this text in their opinion.
