Chevalier de Seingalt had an exciting and glamourous life. This is how he described it in his handwritten memoir. But critics have raised doubts about the varity of the memoir. They argument with facts aganist Chevalier.

One fact against the accuracy of the memoir is that Chevalier claimed that he was rich while living in Switzerland, but they are facts, which shows that he had borrowed a lot of money. So if he was walthy why should he had to borrow money? People who believe in the accuracy of the memoir says that he had to wait for his money to arrive. So he waited in bary but he wasn't really poor.

An other critical point is that Chevalier claimed that he recorded conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. The memoir can not capture this conversations because Chevalier wrote them years after the meeting with Voltaire down. Others say that Chevalier wrote each night phrases or parts of the conversation down and that the memoir was so filled in.

The last point is that Chevalier escaped from a notorious prison in Venice by using a piece of metal. Critics claim that his friends helped him out. Others say that other people in the prison had more well-connected friends than Chevalier and that they couldn't leave the prison. They claim also that the ceiling had to be repeared because of the escape of Chevalier de Seingalt.

I think that we can't really say which one an real event was or which one not, but despite this the life of Chevalier was without doubts adventourous and exiting.
