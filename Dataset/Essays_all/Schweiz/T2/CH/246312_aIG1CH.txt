The memoires of the Chevalier are very controversial. It is difficult to know if they tell the whole truth or if he made up a few things to make his life look more interesting and glamorous. .Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland he was very wealthy but there is evidence, that he had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant what would mean that he couldn't have been rich. There is one theory that says, that he had a job where he would have toinvest his money and then he would have to wair a few days for his money so during this time he had to borrow money. Chevalier recorded conversations of between himself and the writer Voltaire in his memoires. These records were made years after the conversation so critics say, that he must made them up because there is no way to remember the exact phrases  of a conversation after such a long time. Critics also say that he didn't escape from the prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling but that he rather bribed the jailers through his politically well-connected friends in Venice.
