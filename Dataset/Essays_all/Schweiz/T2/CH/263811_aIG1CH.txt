The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is very important historical source when it comes to the eighteenth century, but people are not sure if all of the memoir is correct. This text and the reading is a very good example of a discussion of the points that are said to be made up in the memoir to make the life of the Chevalier look more exciting.

It is said in the text that Chevalier claimed to be rich even though he had to borrow a lot of money from a swiss merchant. The Person who holds the reading sais that borrowing money doesn't mean he was poor, just that maybe it took the Chevalier a long time to get his money, since he didn't bring his money in form of real money, but objects. 
The text also speaks about his conversations with Voltaire, that seem to be too detailed in the memoir. But the reader arguments that it is said by people who have known the Chevalier that he used notes he made right after the conversations for the memoir. The last point is about the ecaping from the prison, and the text sais that Chevalier must have had friends there who let him out, while the reader brings up that it's confirmed that the wall after his escape had to be fixed, so the story about Chevalier escaping through a hole he built in the wall seems to be true.

The reading responds to every point that is made in the text and it gets very clear that the person who holds the reading doesn't have the same opinion as the writer of the text. The writer discusses three topics of the memoir he doubts, and the reading proves all of them wrong. Still it is not clear which one of the two is right, because no one can clearly say what really happened.
