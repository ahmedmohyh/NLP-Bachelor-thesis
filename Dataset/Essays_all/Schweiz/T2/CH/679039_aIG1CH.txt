 First off all, the lecture sais that the Chevalier is pretty accurate, because there are reliable historical sources. She began to talk about the Switerland problem. In the text they claim that he could be that rich, because he had to lend money from a merchant. but in the lecture said, he was wealthy and did partys, but he had to convert his propperty to money and he got loan by the merchant, because he had to wait for it`s own money.

The Text critics also the accuracy of the disscussions of Voltaire, because how could this Chevalier remember all the topics they had discussed during such a long time period. But the lecture disagree with it because in the Chevalier is writen that he took notes from evry single discussion with Voltaire.

At last the text critics the way how the chevalier escaped the prison in venice making a hole in the roof of his prisoncell. Thex claim that he had powerfull men and this friends got him out off there. But the lectue said the had been other and more powerfull inmates, which couldn`t escape or buy their way out. And an old document of the city, decribes a reparation of a roof off one of the prisoncells.
