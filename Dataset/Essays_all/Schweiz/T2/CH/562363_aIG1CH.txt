First it have been said that no memoir can be completely correct. Neither that from Chevalier. 
Critics said that Chevalier wouldn't have needed to borrow money when he had been rich. But when he had nearly no money because he spent it, he tooks new money from his own bar. So that's one of his other money sources. And when he would have borrowed money, that doesn't have to show he was poor. 
The text says the conversations between Cheavlier and Voltaire couldn't be accuracy and correct because he had wrote it years later. But the presentation says that he had wrote down the conversations the same evening as they took place and he tried to remebmer every word exactly.
According to the presentation  the other prisonners had much more friends than Cheavalier. So it would be more logical  for them to buy them free as for Chevalier. But the text says that Chevalier had politically well-conntected friends. And it doesn't really matter if someone has two or hundred friends, the matter is what the friends can or would do.
