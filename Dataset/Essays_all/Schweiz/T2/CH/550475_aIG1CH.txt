The oral presentation concerning the Chevalier de Seingalt contained three main topics I would like to summarise:
The first one deals wwith the financial situation of the Chevalier while he lived in Switzerland. He isn't, as in the text, described as poor, although the Chevalier often borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant and spent a lot of money in parties and gambling. It is more likely that he wasn't actually being poor, but simply had to wait some days for his new money to arrive, so that for that period of time, he had to borrow money.    
Another aspect that's described is the way the Chevalier dealt with the conversations he apparently had with Voltaire: The Chevalier insisted in the fact that each night after a conversation with him, he wrote the accurate conversation down. It is said that he only did that many years later, although other sources say that he often used his own documents, where he wrote that dialogues down, for his memoire, which would kind of imply that he did write the conversations down right away. In this aspect, there are no contradictions in the two provided sources. 
The last point is how the escape from a notorious prison in Venice took place: The Chevalier insisted in having destroyed the ceiling of the prison, which would actually make sense because there are sources that say that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape. The text mentions that it could just the same be possible that some of his politically well-connected friends provided money to bribe the jailers. The oral presentation does not agree in that point since there were many other prisoners with even more powerful friends who didn't succeed in bribing the jailers.
