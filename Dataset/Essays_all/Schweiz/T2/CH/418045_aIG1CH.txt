The lecture takes a deeper look of the points and arguments that were made in the text passage. In the passage it is stated, that many of the adventures and anecdotes in the Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir are believed to be in accurare or even untrue. It is claimed that the Chevalier probably made up some stories or at least added to events that had happend in his life. It was supposedly his goal to make it seem more exciting and glamorous than it was. In the audio from the lecture we are provided with more in depth information to help support the view that the Chevalier's memoir is in fact more accurate and can therefore be used as a reliable historical source. For example the point that he wasn't very wealthy because he had to borrow money is shown to not be very thorugh as it doesn't take into consideration that the Chevalier might have owned land, property and precious objects that he would have had to sell in order to get money. And if he quickly needed money for paries and gambling his choice might have been to rather take loan than to sell his possessions. Another important point is that he actually often took notes right after his conversations with Voltaire, which makes it far more believable that his memoir does them justice. The last evennt which is supported by the lecture is that the Chevalier is very likely to have escaped from the prison for two reasons: Firstly the claim that his connections where the real reason he got out is quite unlikely as other inmates had even more popular friends which couldn't help them. And secondly that there are documents from the prison which state that they had to repare the roof around the time the Chevalier left the prison which fits with his story of climbing through the roof.
