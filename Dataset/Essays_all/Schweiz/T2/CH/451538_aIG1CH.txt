Critics have many points on how the memoir of the Chevalier is inaccurate. One of them being the borrowing of money from a Swiss merchant while the Chevalier claimed he was living a wealthy life in Switzerland and was throwing party after party. But borrowing the money doesn't have to mean he was a poor man. It takes time to make money and selling your goods, so for when the Chevalier waited for his money he borrowed it temporarely from the merchant although they are thought to be considerable sums that make critics think if he ever could've repaid his debts. 
Another point critics find suspicious is the exact written down dialogs with the famous writer Voltaire. The sentences seem too real and with too many details to be remembered and written down many years later. But apparently the Chevalier used to take notes everytime after they had a conversation and kept them until he wrote them in his memoire. 
The Chevalier also spent some in prison and claims he escaped it through a hole in the ceiling. Some think he had friends with great influence who could've offered a bribe but there is the evidence that they had to repai the ceiling
