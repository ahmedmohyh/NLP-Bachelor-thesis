Chevialier de Seingalt was a famous person in the eighteenth century, who wrote a long memoir about his life and the adventures he had had. 
Critics are not sure that the memoir contains real or imaginated adventures.
They doubt that in the time he spend in Switzerland he wasn't as healthy as he seems. He also had borrowed money from a Swiss merchant because he was broke. 
The other point that insecures the critics is the fact that's not possible that the conversation with Voltaire are true, because there is a long time gap between when he had met and when he had written the conversation. Although the critics are convinced that Chevalier and Voltaire had had converstions, but they are not sure if he tells the truth in his memoir. 
The last point is his escape out of the prision. He wrote that he had escaped from the Venetial prision after making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The criticals in the text think that's just a fact he had written to enjoy the readers. But in the presentation they told that it could be true, because there was a hole in the ceiling and it's approved tho repair the hole.

So both critics aren't sure about the truth of all, also because they both have other arguments against each other
