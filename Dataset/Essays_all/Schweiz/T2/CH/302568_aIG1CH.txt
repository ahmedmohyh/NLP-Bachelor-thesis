The spoken text wants to correct some aspects that the written critics mentioned, and said that he may had invented some stories. First the story about spending and lending money in Switzerland. The Critics point out that Chevalier could not had such a spendable life in reality as he had written in his text. In fact, the critis said that he was a poor man, because he had to borrow some money. But in the second text they say that borrow money in Switzerland didn't mean that you are poor, so he wasn't.
The second story about the conversation between  Chevalier and Voltaire. Some critics argue that this conversation didn't happened as he had written it, because he can't had remembered what Voltair said after such a long time. On the other hand it is said that he had written many passages from the conversation right then and made a lot of notices.
The third story about the escape from the ceiling is criticised to be to spectacular, as that it possibly could had happened,critics mentioned. They say that he possibly got some help from the jailers, because hed had some politically well-connected friends. On the opposite they argue that there were a lot more spectacular escapes from prison in Venice and that they had to repair Chevaliers ceiling.
