The Chevalier and his memoir

What is true about is memoir and what isn

The first point is the money which Chevalier borrowed from a Swiss merchant. In the text they say, if he was that rich he said why would he nedd to borrow money from a merchant. So they say he can't have had that much money as it looked like. But in the presentation they (the woman) explained or gave a reason why he was in need to borrow some money. She said that he was in need of the money because to make money by selling stuff or what else or to build your company you ned first money to spend it on things so you can sell stuff and make profit. So the point from her makes sence.
The second point is that in the text Crtics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations between him and Voltaire.They say those conversations can't be that accuratet because he wrote them down many years after the conversation. But as before in the presentation they something else. She said that he always wrote down everything he knew of the conversation at night after the conversation. So that is a reason for the accuracy of the conversation he wrote down. It's also said that there are or were witnesses which told that it was like the girl of the presentation said.
The last point is about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. In the text they say he didn't escaped, they say it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. They also say that he had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe.In the text they disagree with this one by saying that after his escape they had to repare is cell because of his escape with a piece of metal. They also have a document which totally agrees with what is said in the presentation.
