No memoirs can be correct to 100 percent. But they are reliable if the storyteller stics to the truth. 
First the critics about Chevaliers wealth were discussed. The lecturer explains, that it doesn't neccesarily mean you are brke when you lean money from someone. It just means, you don't have it in notes or coins ready to pay with it. The text however says that Chevalier had to borrow sums of money which is a cotradiction to how the lecturer tries to explain the small amounts which you borrow when you just don't have money at the moment to pay with.
The second argument was about the accuracy of the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire, written down by Chevalier. They say that noone could remember phrases told so many years ago. The lecturer says that Chevalier wrote notes down right after the conversation but put them together later when he wanted to publish them. Here the cotradiction is that yes, the statements with Chevalier taking notes and rewrite them later can be encountered correctly, but the question wheather one can still remember whole sentences as they were said, is to be doubted.
The third statement, Chevalier wouldn't have been in the position to break out on his own, but had some help from influencial connections, was smashed down by the lecturer by saying that there have been some prisoners with far greater and better connections and still wouldn't have been helped to come out of jail. And also there apparently was a roof which had to be repaired after his escape, which indicates, that he really fled by his own. But The roof could also have been damadged just to make the story more belifable to others, while he simply was freed by the jailers which got a bribe. Influencial politically connected friends have some gadgets and ideas of how th get someone out of jail. Each statement can therefore be distrusted further and no conclusion can be clearly made.
