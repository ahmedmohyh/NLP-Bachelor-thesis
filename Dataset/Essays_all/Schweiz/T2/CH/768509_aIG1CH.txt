No memoir is completely correct in every facet but Chevalier's is pretty accurat- with this citation the listenting 

First of all is the loan from the swiss merchant mentioned in the text, which indicates Chevalier's poverty. Against this claim there was a good argument in the listening part. Chevalier was not at all a poor man, he seldom had his fortune invested into houses and other materialistic things, which he needed to sell when he ran out of cash. During the time his money was transfomred from an investment into cash he took out a loan, which he immediately paid back. 

It is said that Chevalier kept a journal and other pieces of paper, in which he wrote about the people he met and the adventures he conquerd. Exactely the same he did after his meet up with Voltaire, which allowed him many years later to write down an exact copy of the controversial discussion those two held. This is the complete opposite to the text, which stated that the accuracy of this conversation is very low due to the fact that so much time passed since the event and the moment he wrote it down in his memoir. 

The third point is nearly the same. In the text the accuracy of the story in Venice is questioned since the story in the book seems to be very adventurous. People believe that he escaped due to his connection to very important people in the Venetian gouvernment. But to prove them wrong there are official documents about construction work in his cell after his escape that support Chevaliers story.
