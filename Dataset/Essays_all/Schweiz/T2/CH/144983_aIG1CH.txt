The passage above and the listening are about a famous person who lived about three centuries ago. He was called the Chevalier de Seingalt. To be specific, they are about the memoir he wrote. While the text above seems rather critical the listening was way more lopsided to him. 
The chevalir claimes that he was very wealthy in Switzerland. However, he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. That seems rather contradictory due to the fact that a wealthy person shouldn't have to borrow money. On the other hand, supporters say that he invested money and had to wait until it returned to him and. In the meantime he had to borrow some money therefore he was still a wealthy person in the end.
His conversations with the famous writer Voltaire are also being criticised heavily. He wrote the memoir years after he had those conversations hence, he cannot possibly be able to remember them as exactly as he talks and writes about them in his memoir. However, he used to make notes all the time. The Chevalier claimed to have made notes after each conversation and there is also support from other people who said that he used notes while writing his memoir thus it is quite possible that his conversations may be true. 
Another point of criticism is his escape from prison. People claim he bribed the guards to let him go. On the other hand, supporters claim that there were far more influential people in prison at that time and they could not leave so why was the Chevalier able to? They claim he escaped as described.
