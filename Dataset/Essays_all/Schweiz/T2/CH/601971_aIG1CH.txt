The lecturing woman states that it is in fact impossible that Chevaliers memoir are a hundred percent correct. But in her opinion it's still a reliable source. In the following she explains why she thinks so.

She mentions three episodes from his memoir: Wealthy lifestyle and gambling while he was in switzerland, hours and hours of conversation with the famous Voltair and his incredible escape from a prison in Venice.

Critics in the text state that there's evidence Chevaier borrowed money in switzerland thus he couldn't have been wealthy. The woman explains how the valuables won from gambling often were things you first had to trade to get hold of money. Because of that he had to borrow money while he was looking to trade.

Not without reason do critics say that it's impossible to remember exact conversations for as long as Chevailer waited before he wrote his memoir. But the woman has a solution for that too: There are recordings of people stating that Chevailer had a journal in which he wrote every night. So it's entirely possible that the conversations in his Memoir are accurate.

The last episode she mentioned was the prison escape. Chevailer wrote how he escaped the prison using nothing else but a piece of metal. Critics think that he invented that for the Joy of the reader and it would be far more reasonable that he escaped through his politically well-connected friends. Acc ording to the woman there were other inmates with far more powerful connections and they didn't get out. Also the roof had to be repaired right after he escaped, why would the be required to repair a roof if he didn't escape through it?
