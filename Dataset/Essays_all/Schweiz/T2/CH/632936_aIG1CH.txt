Some critics have doubts concerning the accuracy of the memoirs of the Chevalier. Many of the facts that seem to proove that the memoirs are not true could be wrong.
The Chevalier wrote in his memoirs that he was very rich during the time he lived in Switzerland. It is known that he borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. The lecture is critical concerning the fact that the Chevalier was poor. Maybe he only waited for money from his hometown. To be able to spend money on parties like before, he had to borrow some from the merchant.
The text tells us that the Chevalier could not remember all conversations and its exact phrases with Voltaire years after them, but he wrote them down in his memoirs. According to the lecture, he wrote them down straight afterwards and took them up while writing the memoirs.
The Chevalier wrote that he escaped from a Venetian prison by climbing through the roof. This seems unlikely because he  knew politically well-connected friends who could have offered him a bribe. The lecture tells us that his cell had been repaired after he has been in prison. Why should the cell have been repaired when he had not escaped through the hole in the roof?
