The Chevalier was a man who lived from 1725 to 1789. He had a great story, altough some say it's no true or wome details are invented. By checking some points of his life I shall explain my opinion to whoever this reads.
It's said the Chevalier was whealthy and lived partialy in Switzerland. The fact that he was wealthy and lived in Switzerland can only be true, because the Swiss have the most money and are perfect. The point where it gets a little messy, is that some say, that Chevalier had to borrow money from a merchant to be rich. Well, thats only partially true. He had to sell some things, to get the money. So he went to a merchant and he gave him money for the things he buyed.
Second Chevalier met with Voltaire and wrote down his meetings with him in he's memoire years later. Critics say, that this couldn't be him wroting this, but it actually could be. Chevalier wrote notes after every conversation with Voltaire. He kept the notes and used them for his memoire. Simple.
Last Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice. It is known that ohter prisoners with more powerfull friends were in there, and they couldn't  escape. So Chevalier broke a hole in the ceiling and escaped this way. Critics say, that this is a lie and Chevalier was just dealing with a prisonguard. But some letters from the governement of Venice say, that the ceiling had to be repared after Chevalier left. Therefore he really made a hole and escaped through the ceiling.
In addition to that I have to say, that the memoire of Chevalier is a great story, and great stories deserve to be changeed sometimes. I believe that Chevalier told everything correctly and didn't lie, because his actions were proovedd, not impossible, and it's a good story.
