Chevalier
The woman in the presentation explained, thet not every thing about the Chevalier must be correct but it's possible, that it's accurat. The Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money in Switzerland from a merchant, because it took a long time to have this money and to give back the money. But this don't meen, that he isn't poor. The writer maybe have forgot, that you have to do something for your money and this take time. Critics are skeptical about the  conversations that the Chevalier recorded in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire, but the woman in the presentaation said, that the Chevalier wrote every thing he knows about this conversations in the past. So it's possible, that he could wrote this. That he is escaped from the prison is right, but how he is escaped isn't clear. In the text, he had a number of politically well-conected friends who could have offered a bribe and so they helped him to escape. But the woman said that this action couldn't be in every point really correct, because to escape from a prison isn't that easy and you have to be really strong.
