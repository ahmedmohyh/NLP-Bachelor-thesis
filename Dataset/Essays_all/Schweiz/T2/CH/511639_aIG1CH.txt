The Chevalier is raising controversial discussions even long after his death. The main question is: are his memoirs a reliable source? Or did he invent certain things to make his life seem more interesting? In this essay, I'm going to present some reasons why the memoir may not be accurate and the response of people who think it is reliable.

The Chevalier stayed a part of his life in Switzerland. He stated that during this time, he was very rich and spent a lot of money on parties aswell as gambling. But it has been revealed that he borrowed huge sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics now wonder why he would have needed to borrow money if he had been rich. But the people who believe in his memoirs explain it that way: in the 18th Century, you had to sell property in order to get money. So he had to wait some time to get his money, and borrowed some because he didn't yet have it.

ALso, the Chevalier has recorded conversations he had with the writer Voltaire. While nobody doubts that the two have met various times, critics are skeptical about the truth these recordings possess, as he only wrote them down several years after they occured. They say that it is not possible to remember every sentence after such a lomg time. But others state that the Chevalier wrote down each of his conversations with Voltaire immediately the night after. So he could rely on these protocolls when he made his memoirs.

Another thing the critics don't believe is how the Chevalier escaped from his prison in Venice. They say it is far more likely that he had some of his powerful friends bribed him. But people who think his memoirs are accurate argue that the sealing had to be repaired a few days after after his escape. Also, there were other prisoners with friends who were more powerful than the ones of the Chevalier. They on the other hand stayed in the prison, so they think it wasn't possible to bribe the jailers.
