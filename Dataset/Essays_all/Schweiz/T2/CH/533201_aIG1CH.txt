The first argument is pretty much the same in the text and the listening but one point. It's said that the Chevalier was pretty rich and was gambling and hosting huge parties. He also borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. The only difference between the text and the listening is that in the listenig it's said that he just needed cash to continue gambling. If he won a house it took some days to receive the money so he had to borrow it.
In the second argument the text and the listenting are mostly the same. The only difference is that in the lisetning it's said that he was simply collecting quotes of Voltaire and used them to talk about him.
The text says that the Chevalier didn't escape through the ceiling of his prison cell, but he had good connections that enabled him to bribe the jailers and get free. The listening says that the Chevalier didn't have the best connections to people in Venice and that there where other prisoners that had better ones but still didn't get free with bribing jailers. The ceiling of his cell also needed to be repaired after his freeing.
