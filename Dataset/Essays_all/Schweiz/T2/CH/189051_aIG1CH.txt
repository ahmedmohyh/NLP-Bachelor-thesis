The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. However,there are many critics about it.
In the text above it is said that the Chevalier has spent a lot of money in Switzerlnad. It is also said that he had to borrow money, so that he was not very rich. Actually, he was rich. Others say that he was very wealthy and went to many partys to get to his richness. He needed to spend a lot of money for them and that is not being poor at all, even if he had to borrow money.
Skeptical person mention that he can not have met and conversed Voltaire because they think that it was written many years after the conversation ocurred. But actually, he took notes about everything that was essential and his writings were not found at the right time.
Critics have also questioned his escape from a prison in Venice. They say that he got bribed free and just wrote about an escape to make his memoir more enjoyable. The truth is, that the ceiling of his cell was destroyed when the Chevalier left. This is a clear statement.
In conclusion, there are no memoirs that are to a hundret percent correct at all. People need to stop questioning these things so hard.
