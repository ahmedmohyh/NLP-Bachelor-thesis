The Chevalier's memoir has brought a lot of controversy as people are not sure whether the sources are accurate or not. In the following essay the two sides of the story are presented.

Firstly, many people claim that he used to borrow money from a Swiss merchant which makes him automatically a poor man. What many people seem to forget is that in the eighteenth century it requiered a certain time until your assets could be converted in money.

Furthermore, it is hard to believe that Chevalier could memorize and thereby capture every single sentence perfectly of his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. While people doubt the accuracy of his memoir, other are convinced that Chevalier would write everything down each night after talking to Voltaire. He eventually kept this notes in order to make his memoir more realistic.

Lastly, people do not seem to believe that he could escape by only using a piece of metal. They claim that he had politically well-connected friends who helped him to get out of prison. But the fact that the ceiling of his room needed to be repaired as he left prison leads many to believe that he actually could escape as told in his memoir. 

One can always argue the accuracy of every source and there is always going to be people who criticize everything. As there are lots of different opinions, it is up to people what they want to believe considering different sources.
