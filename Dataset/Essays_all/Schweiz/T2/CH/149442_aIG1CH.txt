The text is very critical of the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir. For example it says that Chevalier was rich. But resently researchers have found that Chevalier had to borrow vast amounts of money. Which according to the text means, he can't have been as rich as he reported. The woman in the lecture opposes this interpretation as she said that the way he made money was rather slow so after he spent money on something he would have to borrow money for a few days until he had his next income. This would mean that he had been rich, his wealth was just not very liquid. 
The text also claims that the report of Chevalier's conversations with Voltaire can't be very accurate, as it was written years after the conversations took place. But the lecturer says that Chevalier reportedly always wrote down notes in the same night as one of the conversations took place.
Last but not least the text doesn't believe the story of Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. They say it is more likely for him to have bribed his way out than to have made a hole in the ceiling. In the audio file they tell a differtent story. They say there were many prisoners with a lot of influential friends, so why would those not have been bribed out? Also they found a report in which one can read that the ceiling of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired soon after his escape.
