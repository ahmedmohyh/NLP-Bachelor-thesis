In the audio they said that everything chevalier wrote isn't true and the also explained why they think,it isn't true. For example the chevqlier wrote down than he escaped from the prison in Venetian. But in the audion they explained why thins is possibly not true. Even iv Vhevalier had powerful friends, there were many other prisoneers who had more powerful friends. And why should Chevalier had been able to escape but not the other prisoneers?

In his memoir Chevalier also wrote, that he met The famoous writer Voltair and had a conversation with him. But critics alsay that even that isn't true. BEcause Chevalier wrote the conversition inte his memoir many years after theconverssation actually took place. ANdd it is impossivple that he could remember every single sentence of the conversaition. Thats why critics don't believe him.

But he told one more lie. He said, that he lived in Switzerland and he was very wealthy and spent much money on parties and gambling. But he actually boorowed money from other people. And someone who has to borrow money from other people cannot be rich and wealthy.Also in the audio they say that Chevalier lies and that it cannot be true what he wrote. 

So his memoir is critisized a lot because he was a liar.
