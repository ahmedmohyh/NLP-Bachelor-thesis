Essay about the controversial memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798)

When it comes to the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt, we have a lot off different meanings about its accuracy. Some say, that its content is helpfull for understanding and learning about the past, others believe that a lot of its content is fake, just to make his life seem more interessting. Here are some examples:

It is well know that the Chevalier lived, during a period of his life, in Switzerland. And it was also know that he used to have a lot of money which he tend to spend for parties and gambling. But, and there come the first criticism, evidence shows that he should have borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. And well, I see you wondering what isn't accurate about borrowing money, but it is the fact that he, according to his memoires, was not quite a poor persion, more like the exact opposite. So critics are wondering; "Why does a rhich person have to lendmoney?". Well according to others, he had no money at the moment, but that was because he was still waiting to recieve it from trading stuff for it. Which means, he wasn't poor, the people just where slow.

An other example are his conversations with Chevalier. Even though he spoke many years before he wrote his memoires, he mentioned exact phrases from them which makes a lot of people sceptical, because according to siencetist, it would be impossible for him to remember. Others say, that he, according to other evidences, he used to write it al down, the exact same evening as he talked to Voltaire so he wouldn't forget, and later used these for his memoires.


At the end, there is to say, that no one realy knows what is right, and what is just a product of his pure fantasy.
