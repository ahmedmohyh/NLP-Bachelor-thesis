The text and the presentation I listened to do not agree whether the memoir of the Chevalier is accurate or not.
The woman in the presentation agrees to the argument that the Chevalier spent a lot of money while lving in Switzerland and that he also borrowed money. The text claims that he borrowed money because he did not have any left, there the woman contradicts with saying he sold his properties and while waiting to recieve the money he borrowed some in order to live a wealthy life. 
In the listening it was said that the Chevalier wrote down all the conversations he had with Voltaire in a journal every evening and that he could then, many years after, refer to them when he officially wrote them down. There the woman brought up an argument which cannot be contradicted by the text. The text only writes that the Chevalier could never remember the conversations so many years after having them. This point is clearly not a very reliable argument.
The Chevalier wrote about an escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. The argument by the text that he could never escape and that it is more likely that someone was bribed to free him, is easily contradicted by the women with konwing out of sources that other people in the prison had even more powerful friends and they could not escape. Furthermore the woman claimed that the ceiling of the room he was imprisoned in, had to be prepared.
