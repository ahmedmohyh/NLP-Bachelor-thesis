It is proofed that a memoire can not capture  everything and it can not be correct. But it is a reliable historical resource, as we see in the example of Chevalier.
That Cevalier borrowed money doesn't mean that he was poor. He spent a lot of money, he selled money because he had to. And then he waited to receive his money, and because he didn't received it yet, he had to borrow some money. IN fact he was not poor, he just had to wait on his money. 
Every night after Chevalier talked with Voltaire he wrote down some things about which they talked. That means that when he wrote the memoir later, he could rely on different notes and journals. So Chevalier didn't have to remember every single detail from the conversations with Voltaire - in fact, that is not possible - because he had written down everything he needed to write the memoire.
Other prisoners had more powerful friends than Chevalier had, so you can easy think that his story is not true. But in fact, there is proof that just after Chevalier' escape, the ceiling in his ancient room at the prison has been repared. Why does a ceiling has to be repaired if there wasn't a hole inside? That proofes that his escape is true.
