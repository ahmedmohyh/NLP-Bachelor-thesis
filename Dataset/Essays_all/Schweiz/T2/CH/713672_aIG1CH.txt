In the spoken essay they try to prove that Chevalier de Seingalt memoir is accur and valuable as an historical source. But the written essay is arguing against it. 

The first point they make in the listing is that Chevalier was not poor. He just had a buisness were he first needs to sell some property to get his money, but that sometimes took a while. If he needet money rightnow he had to borrow it. But the text doesen't agree, they say if the really was that rich he would not have to borrow money. 

The second point in the listing is that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire is very accur. It's said that Chevalier wrotte everything down that same evening from what he could remember. But he only published it in the memoir. The text don't think that. They think he wrotte everything down years later and so it can't be accur becaus nobody has suce a good memorie that he can remeber the exact phrase that had been said years ago.

The last point they make in the listing is thats the story about he escape from prison is truth. They are arguing that in the prison were many powerfull people with powerfull freinds but they din'd make it out. So Chevalier had to escape from prison the way he wrotte in his memoir. It's also said that the venice people had to restauried the cell after his escape. But the text can't believe it and insist that he just could get out because of his powerfull freinds in Venic.
