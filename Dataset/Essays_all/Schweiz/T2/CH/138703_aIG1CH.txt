The two statements claim opposing points of view. In the text, the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is highly questioned. It is claimed to be unlikely to be true. However in the presentation, the opposite is stated.

Critics argument that only because he borrowed money it means that the Chevalier wasn't rich. Though in the presentation it is explained that in that time it was normal to borrow money from friends.

In the second point critics claim that the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire probably aren't accurate. Though in the presentation it is proved that the Chevalier wrote down every single conversation he had with Voltaire.

In tha last point, the escape from prison is mentioned. The text questions the possibility of being able to escape. It states that most likely the guards accepted bribes. On the other hand, the presentation explains that other prisoners, even if they had more powerful connections, could not manipulate the guards either. Moreover, in the prison's documentation it was found that some days after Chevalier's escape the roof had to be repaired.

I think the integrity of facts is striking in the second source which makes it more believable for me.
