In the lecture it was stated that the memoir of the Chevalier is a reliable historical source, contrary to what the text says. The text says that a lot of the adventures Chevalier claims to have had are inventede because it wouldn't possibly be true. But in the lecture they have valid reasons that cntradict everything that stands in the text.
For one inthe text it says that the Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he was a wealthy man during his time in Switzerland, but apperently he borrowed money from a merchant which would mean that he was in fact poor. But the lecturer enlightend the listeners by saying that just because he hadn't had any liquid money at this time doesn't mean that he's poor, it simply means that at this time it took a while to convert assets into cash.

Critics are also skeptical about his conversations with  Voltaire that he only wrote down years after the conversation actually took place, but what isn't stated in this text ist that the Chevalier actually wrote down parts of the conversation he could remember every night. So he didn't have to remember everything as he wrote his memoir, he just had to copy it from his journal.

Chevlier was onceimprisoned in Venice, but managed to escape. The critics stated that his escape was way too dangerous for it to actually have happened, but that his connection to political friends helped him out of prison. The lecturer recounted that at the time Chevalier was in this prison, there had been other inmates with more powerful connections, but they never made their way out of prison, so why should chevalier. And also she had evience of an old venitian document which said that the roof of his cell had to be repaired soon after his escape, which would undermine his story of how he got outof prison.
