The chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the 18th century, is an important historical source about the society back in his time. Now, there have been doubts about the accuracy of his notes. Some say that he made it all seem more exciting than it really was.
For example, when he lived in Switzerland, he wrote that he was wealthy. But other sources have shown, that he spent alot of his money on parties and gambling and only borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. However, as other people say, just because he spent money on gambling, it doesn't prove that he was poor. When gambling he needed time to convert the assets into money, so in the meantime he had to borrow some money. 
Another doubt about the accuracy of his tellings is, when he published all his conversations with Voltaire, many years after the actual conversations. It is proven, that he conversed with Voltaire but who knows every single word one has said in a conversation many years back? Well, there are people who can prove that everytime after having conversed with Voltaire, he wrote it all down in journals, so that he could publish it one day.
Last but not least, some people aren't convinced that he really escaped from prison in Venice the way he told us he did (with a piece of metal, through a hole) but that he really had his jailers bribed by his friends, which were well-connected people. The argument against that is that the other inmates of Chevalier had way more connections to people and none of them were able to be let out that way. And even so, his cell in prison had to be repaired after his escape, and why would they have to fix it, if there never was a hole or something like that? 
At the end of this essay, I have to say that it seems as though the woman from the listening could prove that the Chevalier de Seingalt is infact a reliable historical source of his time.
