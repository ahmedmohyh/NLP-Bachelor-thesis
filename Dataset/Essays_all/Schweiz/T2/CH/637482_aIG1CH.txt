In this text they talk about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt which got 73 years old and lived from 1725 to 1798. The theme of the speech is if he was rich or not. Something that speaks against him is that he borrowed consideral sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Thats one of the best argument. Others say the memoir are invented from the Chevalier and aren`t true. An other thing is that it`s nearly unbelievable that the Chevalier escaped from a prison in venice just with a piece of metal and afterwards climbing trough the roof. That`s nearly impossible for someone like him. It`s obvious that the jailers got bribed to free him because the Chevalier had a numer of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe to get him out of prison. It exi no fact which speak for him that his storys are true s we have to believe that he`s lying.
