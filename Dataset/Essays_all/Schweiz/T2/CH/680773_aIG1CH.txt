Allthough there is some doubt as to how accurate Chevalier's memoir are, if other significant historical details are not left out of consideration, the events described in the memoir are very likely to be true, if possibly a little bit exagerated.

For instance, Chevalier being wealthy while living in Switzerland does not have to mean that he had cash at all times. Part of his wealth was also the property he owned, and by liquidatin his property, he would have money. Still, if every time he was short on cash he sold property, it would take a certain amount of time for the money to arrive, so he would probably lend money to continue his lavish lifestyle.

Witnesses claimed that, while writing the memoir, he consulted notebooks, and Chevalier himself claimed that every night, after his conversations with Voltair, he would take notes of the topics they discussed, which would explain why conversations are so accuratly described in the memoir.

And finaly, his escape from prison. Opening a hole in the ceiling of his cell is a highly suspicious thing to do in a prison. But, as unlikely as it sounds, it might well have been how he actually got out. Many inmates had friends in high places, some even more or even more powerfull ones than Chevalier, yet none of them had been released by bribing the guards. The likelyhood of the guards making a one time exception is less likely than a hole in a prisoner's ceiling. Also the ceiling of said cell had to be repaired after Chevalier got out, which suggests that he indeed escaped through a hole he made in the ceiling.
