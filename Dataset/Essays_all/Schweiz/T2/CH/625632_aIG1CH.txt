In the speach the speaker seams very impressd of the Chevalier. She started to talk about how well done the memoir which the Chevalier wrote was detailled even dough some of the aspects might have happened exactly like the Chevalier wrote. The speaker talks about three happenings out of the memoir. The first was the episode in Switzerland where he borrowed money but in difference to the text she tells that he did not have to be poor just because he borrowed some money because in this time most people in wealth had propertys and he had to sell them before he could spend a lot for parties and gambling. The second arugment the speaker talked about were the discussions with Voltaire. In the text they argue eith the fact that the memoir was writen years after the discussions with Voltaire but the speaker claimed the conversations seemed to be very understandable and well documentet. At the end of the speach the third reason was discussed: how the Chevalier left prison in Venice. The text claimed he just got free because of his connection to the politicall elite of Venice but in the speach she mentioned there were better connected people in prison which not were able to escape.
