The fact that the Chevalier was rich is very controversial as we can see. According to the lector he actually was rich, but not rich of money, more of property which he couldn't actually use to pay anything. The argumentation in the text is, that if he was rich, there would be no reason to borrow money at all. 

The memoirs of the Chevalier are said to be a realiable source, for example his controversations with Voltair. While the lector says that the  Chevalier wrote the happenings of a day with voltair down every evening, the texts says that they were written years later, and that it is impossible to remeber exactly what they were about. 

Also does the lector talk about the excape in Venice. She says that it is out of question that he escaped the prison, since there wasa hole in the roof wich they had to repair later. Also she says that there where much more powerful people imprisonned in Venice, which didn't get freed by the prison assistence. The text says the exact opposit about all of this topics. Accordring to the text, he did get freed by the police who were bribed.
