Many critics doubt the accuracy of chevalier's memoir because of three main episodes within it. 

First they doubt that when he wrote about his wealth while living in switzerland, that that was actually true because he was said to have borrowed money from a swiss merchant. Now this can be explained as followed. It took a while to get his assets in cash so when he ran out of cash he simply borrowed more until he got his money. This does not mean he was not wealthy.

The second episode they claim to be inaccurate are the conversations between himself and Voltaire. They say one can not possibly remember all those conversations after such a long time. But what they did not take into consdieration was that sources have said that Chevalier used to write down all he could remember from the convesations he had with Voltaire each day and that he used those notes while writing the memoir.

The third this they critizize is his credibility of having escpaed from prison and not only having bribed his way out. But what they say is that they had to repair his cell right after he had escaped which means he must have gotten out of his cell somehow and the other thing is that there were much more powerful people in that prisod in venice and they were also never able to bribe their way out so why would he have had this ability.
