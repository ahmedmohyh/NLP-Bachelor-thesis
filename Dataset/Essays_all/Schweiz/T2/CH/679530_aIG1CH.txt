The text is very critical about the memoir which the Cevalier de Seingalt wrote.

The first critical point of his memoir is, that when he lived in Switzerland he mentioned that he was very rich but had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. So if he had to borrow money he was not as rich as he said.
The presentation however, explains this situation very plausible. He spent much money in Switzerland because he liked gambling and afer he had no money left he had to wait until more money was delivered. Meanwhile he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant.

Another critical point mentioned in the text is, that Chevalier wrote down exact conversations wich were held years before. Critics claim that they are not correct because noone can remember conversations from years ago this exactly. The presentation on the other had mentions that Chevalier wrote everythimg from his conversations in notebooks and wrote years later a text with them. In this case the conversations in the memoire can be very exactly.

And the last critical point from the text is, that Chevalier claimed that he escaped a notorious prison in Venice with using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say that this story is a lie. They think one of his politically important friends in Venice has offered a bribe. However the presentaion mentions that, on a prison document of Venice, some days after Chevalier escaped the ceiling of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired.
