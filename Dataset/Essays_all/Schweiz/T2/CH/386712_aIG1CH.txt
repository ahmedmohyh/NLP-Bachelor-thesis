In the text is said that it couldn`t be that Chevalier was very rich because he had to borrow money. But in the audio version they said that he coudn`t be poor because he spent huge amounts of money on parties and other things. He had just borrowed the money during the the time his accents were turned into cash. 
In the text they say, that Chevalier has invented most of his discussions with Voltaire because Chevalier wrote extremly precise what Voltaire said. But that shouldnt be possible because humans can`t remember such a large amount of facts. But in the audio version they say that Chevalier hadn`t to remember all the phrases of Voltaire because he wrote them down before he had gone to bed. 
In the last point they spoke about Chevalier`s prisonbreack in Venice. He wrote in his memoir that he has used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climed through the roof. Critics claim that he had powerful, poltical friends in Venice or that the Chevaliers jailers were bribed to free him. They say he only wrote the story of the escape through the ceiling to make it more interesting. But in the dictation they claimed that other prsioners had more important Venitian friends and that after Chevaliers escape they had to repair the ceiling in his old prisonroom.
