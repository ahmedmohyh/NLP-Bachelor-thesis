In both of the sources the main topic is the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725-1798. The textpassage wants to show us the aspects of the critics, who think that Chevalier distorted and invented many events in his memoir such as being rich while living in Switzerland, having conversations with Voltaire and escaping from a prison in Venice. They say that all of this is not true, or at least not everything of it. They say that while Chevalier lived in Switzerland, he had borrowed enormous sums from a Swiss merchant so he couldn't be as rich as he always told. In the listening the woman told that is is wright that he had spent a lot of money, but borrowing money while he was waiting until his own money arrives isn't a fact that he was poor. The text also complains about the accuracy of the conversations that Chevalier records in his memoir between himseld an the writer Voltaire. Critics think that they can't be exactly true, because Chevalier wrote his memoir many years after the conversations took place.  The other source tells us that he wrote down everything after each conversation with Voltaire, so his memoir isn't just based on memories. THe two sources also don't agree with Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. The writer of the text says, that there are no facts that Chevalier escaped exactly like it's written in his memoir. Critics assume that he bribed his jailers, who freed him. The woman said that it's proved that the ceiling of the cell in the prison really had to be repared, so the story can't be invented of Chevalier.
