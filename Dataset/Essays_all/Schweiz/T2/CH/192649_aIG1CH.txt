Chevalier de Seinghalt, wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. The Chevalier has met many famous people, incuding kings and writers and his memoir has become a valuable historical source about Europen society in the eighteenth century. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that he distorted or invented many events, to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. One point was that the Chevalier claimed that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy and that he had spent a big amount of money there on gambling and parties. it has recently been surface that he had borrowed huge sums of money from a merchant. Critics argue that if he had been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. A person explained, that he had a lot of properties, which he had invested in and he had to sell them first to recieve the money. This took some time and meanwhile he borrowed money but he was actually very wealthy. Another point was that he wrote that he escape from jail by making a hole in the roof with a piece of metal. Thus critics said that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. It was explain that there were a lot of more significant persons in the jail and their jailers were not been bribed to let them free. ALos it was said that they had to repair hole in the roof of his cell, so his story is believable. Also the critics argue about how he remembered all the dialogues and it was said that after each dialoque with Voltaire he wrote things down.
