The life of the Chevalier appears to be controversial. While the written text suggests that some aspects of his life probably did not take place as Chevalier claims, the audio document states that those points at question are probably accurately depicted by the Chevalier.

First of all, the wealth of the Chevalier is doubted. While the text insists on questionable wealth due to loans the Chevalier took, the document listened to defends the Chevalier. It is mentioned that his assets would have been long-term; in order to get access to the money needed for parties and gambling, the Chevalier would therefore have had to take short-term loans.

Secondly, there is a controversy on the accuracy of the depiction of the conversation Chevalier had with Voltaire. While the written text criticizes the account to have been written years later, the audio document emphasizes the notes Chevalier supposedly took after the discussion. As he would have referred to his notes when writing his memoires, the precision of the account could be justified.

The third point of debate is the Chevalier's escape from a Venetian prison. The text suggests the Chevalier to have escaped due to bribery. However, the audio file contradicts this theory, as even more influential people could not easily escape from prison, and as Venetian records mention the need to repair the Chevalier's cell roof shortly after his escape.

Despite these differences, both sources agree in the historical importance of the Chevalier's memoires. Whether or not all the information provided is entirely accurate thus is not crucial. His contact with famous  figures such as writers and kings turns his memoires into a valuable source.
