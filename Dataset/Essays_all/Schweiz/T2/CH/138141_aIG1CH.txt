First off the loan issue was mentioned by the lecturer. In the text we've read that if he would have been so wealthy, why did he have to borrow money? Just because he borrowed money it doesn't have to mean he was poor. To make money you have to make some transactions. And if he sold some properties he might have had to wait some days until he would get the money, so he had to borrow it for a certain timespan. 

Second his conversations with Voltaire were mentioned. Of course he would have not been able to remember every sentence they have talked about. But the Chevalier didn't do this by heart. He took notes and wrote in his journal every night after him and Voltaire had met. Like that he didn't have to remember every detail.

As a last point the lecturer talked about the escape in prison of the Chevalier. The strongest evidence for this was the ceiling which had to be prepaired after he escaped. Also mentioned were people in the prison who had much more powerful connections but were not able to bribe the workers.
