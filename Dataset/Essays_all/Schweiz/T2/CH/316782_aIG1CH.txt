The text is written from a more critical point of view, but the speech is more on the side of Chevalier. The first point: Chevalier had a lot of money. In the text they use the same arguments, that he hadn't that big amount of money and because of he was a gambler he had to borrow money before he gambled, s when we won he could pay back the money and made a win.
In the text is written, that Chevalier couldn't remember everything and exspecialy exact frases years after the conversation with Voltaire. But the speaking lady says, that he made, after every conversation notices, so he could remember later what the talked about and write it down years later.
In the third part they takl about the prison escape from a prison in Venice, where Chevalier escaped by destroying the ceiling and escaping thru it. In the text, they say, taht he hadn't do his, because he had a lot of contacts who could have offered him a bribe and he only wrote this, because it sounds better. But in the speech they say, that there where other prisoners who even had more money and contacts, and in the log of the prison is written that they had to repair a destreoyed ceiling, in the cell of Chevalier. And this is a main evidence he escaped.
