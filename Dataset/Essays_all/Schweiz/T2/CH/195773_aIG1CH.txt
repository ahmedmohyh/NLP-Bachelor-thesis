Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life which is being critizied by many people because they think that he invented some stories to make it more interesting, whereas the woman in the presentation thinks that a lot of his memoirs seem to really have happen. The critics doubt, that he was as rich as he claimed to be, because he had to borrow some money during his time in switzerland. In the presentation the case was being explained this way: Chevalier only had to borrow money because his money did not arrive soon enough. However, Chevalier was being described as wealthy. Furthermore, critics think that the conversations between him and Voltaire can not have been completely how he had written them down because they think he would not have remembered them. On the other hand, it is known that Chevalier immediately wrote down nearly every word just after having finished talking. Critics are also not too sure about the memoir when it comes to Chevalier`s escape from a prison in Venice. They do not think that he escaped by himself but that he had friends that had some influence in politics. But is is known that some other prisoners had more well-connected friends and could not get out, furthermore it is being told that the ceiling in Chevalier`s room had to be repaired soon afterwards.
