In the text above, it says that Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. It also says that if he had been rich, he would not have needed money from a Swiss merchant. With that, it's a sign  that he wasn't rich at all. On the other hand, in the listening was being said that he was very wealthy and that he had to sell houses first to recieve money. So if at one moment he hadn't had enough money, he had to borrow it.
The second information, that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire cannot possibly be captured accurately, because it was wrtitten many years after the conversation, is false. A person who lived with Chevalier could prove that Chevalier wrote down every night what the conversation between Voltaire and him was about and kept these informations for many years. 
About the escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. In the last paragraph it says that it was impossible for Chevalier to escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof.He escaped by the help of a powerful friend. But in the listening excercise, they said that other prisoners had a better connection to powerful friends and that just one week or a few days after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling in his cell in prison had to be repaired. With that argument it is clear that he escaped from prison using a piece of metal and making his way out with it.
