Chevalier de Seingalt, the person we are talking about, is seen as a worse figure than he actually is. He is not controversial, corrupt nor a liar. Even tough his stories might seem a little surreal and make the appearance that not everything about it can be correct, he certainly did experience the happenings written in his memoir. Critics believe that he wanted to make his life seem more enjoyable in his stories by making up the funniest and craziest stories but after further research Chevalier seems as a very reliable person. For example is he being critizised for not having any money but still spending plenty of it. This is not correct because it has been found out that Chevalier did not have money for a while because hhe was borrowing it from his wealthy friends but he was certain to pay it back right away. If he did not have any money to pay back, he would not have chosen to borrow it in the first place. In addition Chevalier is also claimed to be a liar because he wrote down conversations that he had years ago and critics think that it is not possible to remember the exact sentences. This is not true as well because the conversations being held were justified as correct and he did not wait for such a long time to write them down. No memoir is correct but all in all his memoir is rather reliable, especially if you compare it with other memoirs from other celebrities who try to make a different impression and want to seem better than they actually are, just to make them more popular and wanted. Chevalier is not one of them and even though stated differently in the eyes of the critics I believe he was a good and honest man who wanted to share  his experiences with his "fans" or his community without making the impression of wanting to seem differently.
