The woman said that no memoir can be totally correct. But according to her, Chevaliers memoir could be nearly true. She told that borrowing money doesn't mean to be poor. To earn money, you need to spend money. Accorrding to her, Chevalier was just waiting for his money to arrive. So he lend some money to earn more money and gave the money back. She also said that it's not possible to remember all parts of a conversation. But for sure you can remember parts of it. We can not say which parts of it are true and which not. So it's hard for us to decide what we shall believe and what not.  The third point was that he escaped from prison. It can be possible but it would be strange. Then in the prison he was there were many other people who were much stronger and they had friends with even more influence then he had. And these other guys in prison weren't able to escape. That's why it is unrealistic that he really escaped. Finally, you can't say that his story is totally true or wrong. It's sure that some parts probably are true. So you can't say that Chevaliers memoir is rubbish but parts of it are.
