So in the lecture they were three arguments, at first and that's important the lady talking said, that every memoir can't be correct in every detail. The first point she mentioned was the discussion whether he was rich or not, so in her opinion he was wealthy but since he gave lots of partys he sometimes had to lend money until he's own money had arrived. Now critics claim that his memoir isn't the reality. They think he couldn't be rich if he had to borrow money. Ever so how, let's move on to the next argument. He writes about having conversations with Voltaire what's very likely to be possible. He wrote down everything he could remember right after the conversation, so when writing his memoir he could look at the conversation and write it down correctly. Now critics say that never can be totally acurrate because how shold he remember, well if anyone of them listened the lecture they'd be smarter. The last agrument is the one about the prison in Venice, so the claims to have climbed out of the roof of a prison. Critics think that isn't true, they think it makes a good story read but it can't be true. So the assume the had some help by a politically well-connected friend. Sorry for the critics but he could be right about climbing out of the roof, because the had to fix the roof of the cell in which he was, shortly after he left. So we see, they're all ways to points on the truth.
