The first controversy concerning the Chevalier de Seingalt is about money. Since he had to take out a loan to finance his lifestile of gambling and parties it could be a hint that he lied about being wealthy. On the other hand, it is possible that he had wealth in form of property and had to sell his possessions for money. This process takes some time so he possibly had to take out a loan for a few days until he had gotten his money.
There are also discussions about his conversations with Voltaire. Some say they could not be a reliable source, seeing as he wrote his memoirs many years after they took place. Others argue that he wrote down notes after each meeting and recreated them looking at them.
It is unclear if he actually broke out of jail by digging through the ceiling. His influencal friends may have offered a bribe to free him. Unfortunately many prisoners with even more important conections were not able to get out this way so it is uncertain if he used bribes. There are also recordings of ceiling repairs at the prison after he got out which may be an indicator that he actually dug through the ceiling.
