The text blaims the memoir of the Chevalier de Steingalt as unreliable and exaggerated. The women, who makes the presentation, thinks, that the memoir is indeed reliable and that the things had possibly happend like the Chevalier has written them down. She tries to contradict all arguments written in the text.

The first passage, which doesn't seem possible to the writer of the text, is, that the Chevalier has written, that he had been very wealthy while living in Switzerland, but on the other hand had borrowed a big sum of money at the same thime. The women in the presentation says, that the reason of borrowing money had been, that the Chevalier had to wait for his money to be sent to Switzerland.

Another reason for the author of the text not to believe the Chevalier is that Chevaliers descriptions of his conversations with Voltaire are very detailed and that it would be impossible to remember so accurately a conversation so many years after it had taken place. The women in the presentation says to contradict him, that the Chandelier had always made notes after his conversations and that he had taken these notes in order to write his book.

The third reason why the person, who as written the text thinks that Chandelier can't have written down the truth is his escape heroic escape from the prison of Venice. The woman, who held the presentation, thinks that the escape had exactly been as the Chevalier describes. The text claims, that it was bribery, which brought him out of prison, but the women in the presentation thinks, that bribery doesnt't seem likely, because other people, which have had much more influence didn't manage to come free. In addition the ceiling of the Chandeliers cell had to be repaired after he had vanished from the prison.
