Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures which were controversial. For some people this memoir is valuable to unterstand the 18. century. Others consider about the amout of truth in his text. After one evening taking conversations with Voltaire, he began writing his memoir. Maybe he was so influenced by Voltaire that he began to invent events for getting more attention of the readers. 
In Switzerland, he behaved like "the Great Gatsby". He spent a huge amount of money for parties. In his memoir, he describes himself like a rich man. But why had he to borrow money?
In Venice, he described that he broke out of a prison with nothing more as a piece of metal. He claimed to have many friends which were politically well-connected. Critics consider that other prisoners had better connections and they didn't break out either. So maybe the judge decided to set him free anyway.
If the memoir is true or not, we won't find out.
