The Chevalier's memoir is a valuable historical source because the agruments mentioned have prooves and reasons. So I am about to bring some cons which show that the pros can't be true or fully the truth.
For example when the Chevalier was in Switzerland he had to borrow money because he ran out of it but in the meantime he was also waiting for his money from his sales to arrive. And so we could say that he never was poor or something like that. 
Secondly there are some people who lived or knew the Chevalier and they could verify that the Chevalier mostly took notes during conversations with VIPs. And also during the conversation with Voltaire. Few years later he took back his notes and described the conversation in his memoir as he had it in his knowledge.
Last but least the escape story of the Chevalier is also the truth and nothing else because the reports of the Venetian prison show that the cell in which the Chevalier used to get imprisoned had to be repaired after the escape of him. And there also were others who knew much more politically well-connected friends.
So the critics just took some random information out of their head which haven't been prooved. And the information I just gave or summarized all have reliable sources which can verify my statemnets.
Hööööööööööööööööiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
