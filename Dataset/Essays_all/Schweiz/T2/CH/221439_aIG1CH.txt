In the text it is said that the Chevalier lived in Switzerland and he wrote in his memoire that he has been very wealthy there. But there is evidence that the Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, so in the text the wealth of the Chevalier is questionned. In the presentation the woman explains this. She sais that the Chevalier spent much money on parties and gambling. So he had to invest money to earn some. So he borrowed money to live while he was waiting for his money to arrive. She sais that just because someone borrows money it does not mean he is poor.

The second thing in the text are the conversations the Chevalier wrote down with Voltaire. It is critisized that it is impossible that the Chevalier remembers every phrase from this conversation, because it was written many years after the conversation with Voltaire took place. The woman in the presentation says that there is evidence, that the Chevalier wrote down every conversation with Voltaire just after they happened, but he published them after many years. So it is very likely that these conversation really happended like the Chevalier wrote them in his memoire.

The last thing is the escape of the Venetian prison. In the text it is said that he did not escape like he wrote. The Chevalier wrote that he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and climbed through the roof. In the text it is said that it is more likely that the jailers were bribed, because the Chevalier had many friends who had a high political position in Venice. The woman says that this is not logical, because in the Venetian prison there were prisonners who had more important friends than the Chevalier and they did not get out. Furthermore the ceiling has been renovated right after the Chevalier got out of prison. This would not have been necessary, if nobody had broken out of there.
