The women talks about the different doubts critics have and she speaks about what she tings about these doubts and which hypothesis could clearfy the doubts.
First, she says that the memoir recounting can't be correct in every detail because nobody can remember a conversation word by word after such a long time. But what if the Chevalier wrote down the things he could remember right after the conversation with Voltaire? These notes could have helped him years after this conversation to write down his momeoir recounting. 
She also doesn't agree with the critics which say that the Cheveral wasn't rich like he said but poor. She tinks that it doen't has to mean the Cheveral was poor just because he had to borrow money. The beginning of his career won't be so easy for him so he had to borrow the money for having a chance to make money itself.
Finally she talk about the doubt of his escape from notorious prison in Venice. She doesn't believe it beacause it sounds very unrealistic for her.
