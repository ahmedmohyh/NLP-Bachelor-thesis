The chevalier lived form 1735 to 1789. Toward the end of his life he wrote a long memoire about his life. But critics are sceptical that everything that he wrote can be true. They think that he wanted to make his life more interesting than it really was. 
Some facts that he wrote down are quite mysterial. For example it is written that he'd been a rich man but on the other hand he also had to borrow money and that si quite strange. But an explanation for this could be that he first had sell money befoe he could get it. 
In his memoire he tells a lot about his nightconversations with Voltaire. And he writes exactly the sentences down that Voltaire had said. This is an other point for critics. They say that it is impossible to remember the exact phrases from his conversation. Peoble who believe him assume that he'd written down all the nightconversations and this is why he can take this sentences. 
There are also many different oppinions about how he broke out of the prison in Venice. He wrote in this memoir that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling but critics believe that the jailers jut let him free.
