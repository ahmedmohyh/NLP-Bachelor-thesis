The memoire of Chevalier de Seingalt is of extreme historical importance while it contains important information about the European society in the eighteenth century. Nevertheless it is controversal because many historians doubt its accuracy. 

Firstly the question is hold whether he was really that rich as stated. During his time in Switzerland he borrowed most of the money form a Swiss marchant to pay for parties and gambling. Therefore some think he did not own it himself. But in that century is was normal that the convertion to money took quite a while and he first needed to be rich that the marchant would lend him of it. 

Secondly his memoire was written some years after he met the famous writer Voltaire nevertheless the memoire of the Chevalier contains quotes, the reconstruction of exact phrases. Some friends of the Chevalier and he himself stated that each night after a conversation with Voltaire, he would immediately write down everything he could remember. For the writting of the memoire he obviously needed his notes and his journals.

Last but not least his escape from the notorious prison in Venice. Not even people with more power could escape. The Chevalier did it by using a piece of metal and digged a hole in the ceiling. The Venecian government stated in one of their documents that after he fleed, the ceiling needed to be repair, which supports Chevalier's statement. 

To conclude; even if not every memoire is accurate and one needs to remain critical, the memoire of Chevalier is supportet by some outstanding sources.
