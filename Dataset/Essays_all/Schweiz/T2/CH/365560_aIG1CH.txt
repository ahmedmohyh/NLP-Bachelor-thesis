The text is about Chevalier, a controversial figure of the eighteenth century. In his self-written memoir recounting his adventures in his life it seems that he made it more exciting and glamorous than it actually was. About many of his memoirs people critices its accuracy. 3 diiferent examples are given. 
Critics don`t understand why Chevalier had to borrow a huge amount of money during his time in Switzerland. He claimed that he was very wealthy. But we shouldn`t forget that Chevalier spent his money on many parties and the change of his wealthy into money needed time. Sohe just borrowed it.Nothing suspicious.
Other Critics state it`s impossible to record Chevaliers conversation with Voltaire with such an accuracy. But we shouldn`t forget that Chevalier wrote notes after most of his conversations with his friend Voltaire. So the exact recording of sentences in their conversation isn`t suspicious as well.
Third of all people don`t understand how Chevalier was able to escape from a notorious prison in Venice. Crititcs say that friends of Chevalier had helped him to escape of the prison an it wasn`t Chevalier who escaped by climbing through a self made whole in the ceiling, made with a little  piece of metal. But why did the prison had to repair a ceiling some days after Chevalier escaped? 
While the text shows us how many things of Chevaliers memoir are written more exciting and adventurous than they should have been, according to the words I`ve just heard everything has an understandable reason.
