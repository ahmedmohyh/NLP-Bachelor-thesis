The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 until 1798. Before his death he wrote a long memoir about his fullfilled life. This memoir is seen as a reliable historical source, mostly because he knew a lot of famous people like kings and writers. Despite the fact that it is counted as reliable, there are still some people out there who critizise his writings. Some say that his life wasn't that glamorous as it seems. While living in Switzerlad he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Because of this, critics say that he wasn't as wealthy as they said he was, which makes his memoir seem unreliable in that way. Another point of critics is that the part in the memoir where conversations with Voltaire appear was written long after the conversations actually took place. People who lived with him and knew him very well say that he always wrote in his journals every night, so it is possible that the conversations are actually true and written down as they really were. Critics of the memoir also believe that the passage where he broke out of prison is actually unreliable. Other people from the same prison who had better connections than him have never been able to break out of it. Because of these points, critics believe that the memoir written by the Chevalier de Seingalt is not a reliable historcial source, even though other points show the exact opposite of what they argue.
