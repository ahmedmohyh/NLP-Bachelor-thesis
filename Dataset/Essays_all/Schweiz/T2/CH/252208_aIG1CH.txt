The Chevalier is an important historical source because he documented his life in great detail in a memoir. Both the text and the presentation agree on this. Their opinions differ a lot however when it comes to the accuracy and truth  value of the Chevalier's documentation. First of all the text challenges the Chevalier's claim that he was very rich while living in Switzerland and says that he had to borrow all of the money he spent on gambling. The lady giving the presentation agrees on that point but she states that the reason he took the loan was that his wealth was stored in other assets than cash money. The text also says that many critics are skeptical of Chevaliers memory of his conversations with Voltaire because he wrote his memoir long after his encounter with the famous writer. The presentation states that there were many people confirming that the Chevalier used notes from years ago to better remember his conversation. The Chevalier's escape from the prison of Venice is also highly doubted by the text, saying that he most likely bribed the guards to get out of prison. In her presentation the lady brings up the fact that none of the much more powerful prisoners were able to bribe their way out of prison. This combined with the story of the guards having to repair the facility makes the Chevaliers story of escaping through the ceiling of the cell more believable.
