Due to the presentation, Chevalier did not need to be poor during his stay in Switzerland. He could be very wealthy because he sold all his valuable things to get money. But unluckily, it took a long time until he got his money, so he had to borrow it from a Swiss merachant. 
Moreover, it is not possible that any conversation is a hundret percent accurate, because it is nearly impossible to remember every detail. After his conversation with Voltaire, Chevalier de Seingalt wrote down everything he could remember. In this way he could not forget the important aspects and was able to write his memoir. 
Furthermore, his escape from prison could be possible too. The roof's ceiling had to be repaired after his escape.As you read in Chevalier's memoir, he escaped through the roof after he damaged it with a piece of metal. Why should this roof be damaged, if the "inhabitant" was still in the room? Not everything is made by chance...
