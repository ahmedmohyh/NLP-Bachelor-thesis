Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir with some possibly inaccurate points. 

Firstly, critics say that Chevalier claiming to having been rich had to lend money from a Swiss merchant, so after all he could not have been rich. Fact is, that Chevalier was rich, but did no have much cash. He sold his investigations to change them into cash. So he actually was rich, but not in a direct and easy reachable way. 

Secondly, he is said to have lied about the accuracy of the conversations with Voltaire. Critics find it impossible for someone to have such an accurate memory of a conversation, which happened many years before he wrote his memoirs. But fact is that he noted down everything he remembered of all the conversations he had with Voltaire to still be able to remember them even years later. 

Lastly, Chevailer claims to have escaped the prison in Venice through the ceiling. Due to the fact that he had some very influencial friends in Venice, it seemed more logical that he bribed the jailers than escaping through the ceiling. There were some even more powerful people in this prison who were not able to bribe themselfs out and the ceiling of the cell of Chevalier had to be repaired after he fled. 

So maybe he did not lie after all or make his life more interesting. His memoirs were proved to be reliable and accurate.
