Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir toward the end of his life. But there are different critics about this memoir.
So there are three big subjects from the text and the presentation which I want to summarize.
First, there is the time which he spent in Switzerland. He wrote in his memoire that he was very rich and spend the money on parties and gambling, but in the presentation they said that too be rich he must sell some things before to get it in cash like in the text where they said, that he must borrow money to be rich.
Second, there were some conversations with Voltaire, which he recorded. But he writes his memoir many years later. So what is true after so many years? The text also interogate if he really had a conversation with him, when the presentation only asked if he really could remember exactly to this conversations.
And now the last point is about his escape from the prison in Venice. In the text they said, that he have a number of politically friends and so e could escape but in the presentation the told us that other prisoners had more from this connections with politically friends. So it is not clear how he came out of this prison because in the memoire he said he got out by using a piece of metal.
All in all we should question this memoire before take it as an historical source about European society.
