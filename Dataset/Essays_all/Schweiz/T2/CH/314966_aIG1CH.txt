Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote down a memoir about his life and adventures as he was an old man. But there are many rumour wheter if its true or completly inventet. So the passage gives 3 examples about inventet things. But the lady from the presentation had a few arguments why it could be true. So for the story in switzerland. Chevalier wasnt poor. But to become healthy he first needs a loan from which he can become rich and he celebrated indeed parties and did gamblings.
He wrote down his conversations with Voltaire in his memoire which has been written down a few years after the conversations. Therefore it isnt possible to remember every phrase word by word. In the speaking the lady says that Chevalier each night wrote down his conversation with Voltaire and kept it for years.
In another story he escaped a prison by making a hole into the ceiling of the prison. The text says that couldnt be and his friends bribed him free. But the lady of the speaking says that other prisoners which had friends with more influence couldnt bribe them free. So its more likely that he escaped. And theres a document, which says that they had to repair a ceiling in the prison.
In conclusion the text is a work which value the memoir very critical. On the other hand the speaking tries to hold against with some arguments which makes the memoir more believable.
