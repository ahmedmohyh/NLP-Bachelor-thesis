Well the text was about how big of a liar and scammer he was, and the audio tape tried to deny this with some more or less convincing points. Like if you spend to much money on partys and gambling and you have to wait for your paycheck or something like that, it's more likely to take a loan from a merchant than to wait for your paycheck. Or in the text they doubted that the conversation with voltair was accurate because it wouldn't be possible to remember a conversation in all details after many years, but surprise surprise the chevalier wrote down some notes on the days he had his posh little chats with voltair. Later in the text they doubt that the chevalier was able to escape the prison because he made a hole in the ceiling but because he had some nice and rich friends who would bribe de prison guard, but it seems logical that the audio tape has an explanation for this as well. Documents of that prison that were found later on confirmed that right after the chevalier got out of prison they had to repair the ceiling in his former cell. And in general the text's opinion is that the memoir is not fit to be historically accurate but the audio tape thinks it is.
