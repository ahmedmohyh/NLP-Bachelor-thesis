The lecutrer claims that Chevalier's memoir is a pretty accurate... recreation of his life and a reliable historical source. She states following reasons as to why his memoir is trustworthy and not ...... as clamimed in the text extract.  

First of all, although Chevalier had to borrow money from a merchant during his stay in Switzerland does this not exclude the possibility of him being wealthy as stated in the text. Due to the fact that it was difficult to liqudise money at that time, Chevalier probably lacked chash and only had borrowed money while he was actually waiting for his own.

Furthermore, while it is made clear that Chevalier cannot have possibly remembered each word of a conversation, which he had held with Voltaire a few years back, the lecturer says that Chevalier in fact had written down as much as we remembered immediately after his conversations and then consulted his notes to write his memoir. This therefore strenghens the accuracy of his memoir.

At last the lecturer argued that even though the text states that Chevalier probably bribed powerful friends to escape the prison,and did not break through the ceiling as he calimed, his claimes might well be true because he ceiling apparently had to be repaired after his escape.
