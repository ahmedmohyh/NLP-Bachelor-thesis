There was a famous guy in the eighteenth century, who wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures. His name was Chevalier de Seingalt. Chevalier was a controversial figure, but since he met many famous people, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about the European society in this time. With this source of the past we can imagine how it was in this society in the eighteenth century. But there are many critics about Chevalier and his life. It says that Chevalier wasn't that rich how he has said. It says that he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. And when Chevalier was really very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money from another rich guy. There are also some other critics. The Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these converstaions accurately, because it was written some yeares after the conversations occured. The escape from a prison in Venice stands also in critic. Chevalier descpribed how he has escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal. It says that it is more likely that the Cevalier's jailers were bribed to free him.
