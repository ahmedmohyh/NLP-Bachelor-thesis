In the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, there are many stunnig sotrys about his life.
Some people believe, that those stories are made up. But otherd think, that theire not. 
The fact, that the Memoir of the Chevalier was written a long time after the meeting with Voltaire, is not really a a strong critic. After a talk with such a famos man, humans are able to remember details for a verry lng time.
All though the story with the CHevaliers prisonbreak seams unbeliveable, it may have took Place once. Because even the Chevalier had some wealthy Friends in Venice, they wouldn't have been able to free him, beacause many other prisoniers had much more well-connected friends in the city. And why after all should the wardens have to had to fix the cell of the Chevalier, if he didn't escape?
