The controvercial figure that Chevalier was and his memoires are nowadays a reliable source of information about how the european society behaved and how it was structure in the pre-french-revolution era. As Chevalier met various famous persons like royals and great thinkers he also experienced several adventures which seemed until recently somehow doubtable. Especially his memory about the conversation he had with Voltaire, thet he wrote down several years later, the fact that he stated he was rich while living in switzerland although we now know he had to borrow huge amounts of money from a swiss merchant and his adventure of fleeing from a vernice prison by breaking a hole into the ceiling seemed very suspicous.

But now we know that apparently these adventure came up to be true. For example there is evidence that Chevalier took notes right after he had talked to Voltaire and wrote them later down in his memoires. We now also assume that CHevalier was in fact rich while livig in switzerland but he was not liquid at all. When he had to buy stuff in large amounts we suspect that it took time to transform his wealth into liquid money, if he had to get money rapidly he was in the need of asking the mentioned swiss merchant for it.The last story also may be true as old documents confirm that right after Chevaliers escape the prison ceiling had to be repaired.

In conclusion we can now assume that Chevalier is still a reliable information source.
