Chevalier de Seingalt lived in the 18th century. He wrote a very precise memoir about his life, what makes him a good source to look how life was back then. But there are people questioning the accuracy of the informations Chevalier gives. One point is, that Chevalier tells in his book he was very wealthy while living in switzerland but other researches showed that he borrowed big sums of money. This although doesn't need to say something because it could also just be that he had invested all his money and therefor ran out of cash.
Something different was his talk with Voltaire. In his book he sometimes writes exact sentences of the conversation. But it is questioning if they are true because he wrote his book many years later and it was impossible to remember the sentences word by word. This would be correct, if there weren't sources of friends and family of Chevalier that tell that he was making notes one day after the talk and he always was working with notes when writing on his memoir.
The third questioning point is his escape of the prison in Venice. In his book he says he made a hole in the roof and escaped through this. Critics claim this story as wrong because Chevalier had friends in the Venice government, so they say his friends aranged something to free him. On the other hand, in the Venice prison were also people with better and more powerful friends and they weren't freeed too. Also there is a note that says the roof of Chevaliers cell had to be renewed after he was gone.
