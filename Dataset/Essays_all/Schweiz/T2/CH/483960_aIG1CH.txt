Critics in the text say that someone who is really rich does not havte to borrow money from someone else. The women in the recording said that thats a sign of beeing rich if you have to borrow money. A rich man invest his money and if he need some money before he get his money back from the invest he has to borrow it. 
Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversation between him and Voltaire. They believe it could not be possible that he can write down the conversation so accurate years after. But the women in the recording said he made notes during the conversation and kept them at home for many years. 
Critics have also questioned the Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice. They said that Chevalier had many friends with big influence in politics, that means Chevalier didn't had to escape it was arranged by his friends.
But the women in the recording has arguments against that. She said that  there were other prisoners with more influential friends and they couldn't escape. And she also said that immediatly after the escape they had to fix the cell's ceiling. In Chevaliers memoirs he tells that he escaped through the ceiling, which he break down with a stick of iron. So this story has to be true, because of no else reason they had to fix the ceiling after his escape.
