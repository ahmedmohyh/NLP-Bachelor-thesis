In the text they worte about three things where they claim that the Chavalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. 
The first thing is that they claim that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy and he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, so he had to be very pour in this time. But the correct answer is that he wasn't pour in this time, he really spend a lot of money for parties and events and he just borrowed money because he had to wait for his money to arrive. 
An other critic about his memoir is that they don't believe that he can remeber everything about the conversation with Voltaire. But people refered that the Chavalier wrote down everything and kept this notes for a long time and many years later when he wrote his memoir he could remember the exact phrases from extended conversations because this notes. 
The last thing they claim about is that when he was in prison in Venice, he has escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. But old gouvernement documents prove that they had to repared the room in which the Chevalier had been arrested.

There are also different proofs that the Chevalier had a very interessting life and his memoir is a valuable historical source about European society.
