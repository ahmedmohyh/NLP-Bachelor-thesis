The Chevalier of Seingalt lived an adventurous life. He met many famous people and experienced a lot. Although he documented a lot of his actions there is also a lot of controversity about his life.

In the Presentation it was said that Chevalier was a rich man. But he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant while he was living in switzerland. But he only was forced to do that because he had to wait for his own money that arrived some days later. Also it was said that Chevalier and Voltaire conversed at some point od Chevalier's life and Chevalier took notes of the conversation so he later could write it down. This is not exactly what is written in the essay. The essay claims that it was not possible for Chevalier to have written down the information about Voltaire accurately in his memoir because they met many years before he wrote about their meeting. Furthermore in the essay it is written that the story of Chevalier escaping through the ceiling in a notorious prison in Venice was made up. But in the presentation it was said that this may actually be possible since some documents of the prison confirm that after Chevalier was free the ceiling had to be repaired.

Nevertheless it is clear the The Chevalier of Seingalt was a man that lived an adventurous life. No matter whether all of his stories are true or not.
