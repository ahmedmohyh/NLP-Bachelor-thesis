At the beginning they said that the memoir from the Chevalier de Seingalt indeed is a confirmed source to rely on. In the text there is a point where the Chevalier borrows money. In the presentation they told that even though he borrows money from other people he is not a poor person. The reason for him to borrow money is that he is actually waiting for his money from sellings and in this period of time the Chevalier still needs money. So although he was borrowing money from a Swiss merchant he is still not a poor guy.
 
In the Text it says that the Chevalier wrote down conversations between him and Voltaire in his memoir. But the memoir was written years after these conversations happend. The text shows the argument that it is not possible for the Chevalier to write down the exact sentece Voltaire was saying in a conversation that took place many years ago. But in the listening part of this exercise they told us that the Chevalier was able to write down his conversations that accurately because he was taking notes back when the conversation was going on. 

I cannot give a statement to the last point where the Chevalier gets out of prison because of the time pressure and because I did not get all the information out of the presentation.
