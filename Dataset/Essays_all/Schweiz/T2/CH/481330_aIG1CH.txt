The lecture is about the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoires. In the text, there are given three examples of the memoires and why critics think that those event's probably didn't happen the way they are described there. However the lecture states the opposite and gives reasons why these three points mentioned in the text are in fact probaly true.
The first point is about the time the Chevalier was living in Swizerland. The text tells that critics think that the Chevalier wasn't as rich as he tells he was in his memoire because he had to borrow money from other people, which is something that he wouldn't have done if he had really been as rich as he states. The lecture argues that he had to borrow money because he had to wait for his to arrive (it always took some days to send it from the banks).
The second point mentioned is the Chevalier's conversations with Voltaire. In the text it is argued that those conversations can impossibly be fully accurate as the memoires have been written down quite a few years after those conversations and humans can't remember every detail of every conversation made. The lecture contradicts this statement with the fact that the Chevalier wrote some notes after the conversation with Voltaire happened and that he could refer to them while writing his memoires, so these conversations probably have a high accuracy.
Finally, the last point made is the Chevalier's outbreak of the prison in Venice. The text states it is impossible the way he did it and that is is much more likely that friends have helped him, the lecture gives evidence of the
