Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life and adventures towards the end of his life. He is very popular because he is sort of a controversial figure. Some critics do not believe in the accuracy of his memoir and think he invented some of the events in order to make it more interesting. But at the other hand some people say that the arguments of the critics are not true and that Chevalier is a pretty reliable source. These people say for example that in the time Chevalier was in Switzerland he was not poor like the critics say but he had to make some money first so that he could live like a wealthy man. Critics also say that the conversations Chevalier had with Voltaire could never be so detailed written down when he only wrote them some years after the two met. There is no doubt that the two men met and spoke to each other but they do not believe he could have remembered every word so well after many years after he met Voltaire. But some sources say that Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered of the conversation with Voltaire right after he came home and that he had some detailed diaries. Then there is one story in his memoir where he escaped the prison in Venice where the critics are also very skeptical about. In his memoir he wrote that he could escape by using a piece of metal and climbing through the roof. Critics are questioning that because he had some contacts in Venice who could have helped him to escape and that was more likely to happen. But the others claim that there were more other prisoners who had more contacts to people that could have helped them escape but they never escaped and that they had to mend something in his cell and that is why he could escape with a piece of metal.
