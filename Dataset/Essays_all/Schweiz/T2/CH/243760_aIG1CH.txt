The woman presenting the three events wtitten down by the Chevalier complains about every critic that those events could have happened as told by the Chevalier.

She responds to the critic of borrowing money from a Swiss merchant that this isn't an evidence that the Chevalier had to be poor. Because of his gambling habits he lost a lot of money and had to wait for new money to arrive. During this short period of time he borrowed money due to his addiction. So he couldn't wait for his own money. But when this arrived he would have paid everything back.
The presenter complains about the second critic that he wrote everything down after the conversation with Voltaire and then kept them away for a long time. Then he pupshlished way later all his converstions. It is also said by his friends that he used to keep notes for a long time before puplishing them.
About the last event the womans critizes that bribing the jailers isn't plausible beacause in his jail there were many people better connected. So the offer of  bribec isn't an option in her eyes. And there is also a proof that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape.
