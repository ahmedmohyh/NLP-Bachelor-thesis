The topic that the woman and the critics in the text are talking about, is about a man called Chevalier who lived in the 18 Century. The critics and the woman say exactly the opposite. Their arguments are contradictions of each other. First: They both are talking about how rich the Chevalier exactly was. Critics claim that the Chevalier could not have been rich as the Chevalier himself claimed to be. Evidence that recently showed up surfaced, Chevalier had borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics argument about that is, if he has been so "rich" why would he need to borrow money from a friend then?. The woman that held a presentation about Chevalier states that Chevalier was borrowing money because the transfer would take so long back then. While waiting for his money he had to borrow it. Like taking a credit. Second: No one doubts that Chevalier and Voltaire have met. But the critics problem with the memoir of Chevalier is that he could not have remembered their whole conversation years later after meeting Voltaire. The counter argument of the woman is that Chevalier would have taken constantly notes when he remembered something. People who lived with Chevalier could confirm that. Third: In the memoir of Chevalier it is mentioned that Chevalier had a notorious escape from a prison in Venice. Chevalier claims to have escaped but with a piece of metal through the ceiling. Critics problem with this is that you would only write such a thing to make the reading more enjoyable. He probalby bribed the guards claim the critics. The woman sais that in the prison were other people much more powerful than Chevalier so bribing was no option. And documents tell that after the escape of Chevalier the ceiling had to be repaiered.
