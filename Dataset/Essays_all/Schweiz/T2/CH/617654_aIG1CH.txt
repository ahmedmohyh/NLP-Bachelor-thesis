The lecture responds to all three main accusations made in the text and proves them wrong.
First, the speaker differentiates between being poor having no money. The loan from the merchant does not mean that the Chevalier was poor, it could as well be an indication that he needs to sell things first to get more money later. In other words, the loan is not evidence of lying in the memoirs.
Second, the speaker admits that writing the conversations with Voltaire purely from the memory years later is practically impossible, but she states this did not happen. It later has been confirmed that the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember from the conversations each night. The memoirs then refer to these notes. The text's point is proved wrong.
Finally, the speaker tries to convinde the audience that it is likely that the Chevalier escaped from the prison by himself through the ceiling. According to her, other prisoners with more powerful friends had no chance of getting out with a bribe, which makes the text's proposition unlikely. Additionally, old Venician documents show that the ceiling hat to be repaired after the Chevalier's disappearance, which shows the Chevalier's memoirs' views could not be that far off.
