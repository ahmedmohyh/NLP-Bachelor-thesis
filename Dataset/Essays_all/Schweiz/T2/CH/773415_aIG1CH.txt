The text shown above and the record I just listened to could not be more different. The only thing they have in common is the fact, that they talk about the Chevalier and his memoir.
The author of the text is very sceptical and questions the accuracy of his memoir. The speaker however really believes that what the Chevalier wrote down was the truth. 
There are three key points they talk about. First, the Chevalier's wealth. In his memoir he says that he is pretty wealthy but the writer argues that he would not have to borrow money from somebody if he was not poor. The speaker says that borrowing money from someone does not mean he did not have money and that he first had to tade his value in for actual money which usually takes some time. 
Second, his conversation with Voltaire. The writer says that their conversations was a long time before he wrote it down and that after such a long time it would be impossible to write it down accurately. The speaker says then, that the Chevalier took some notes right after their conversation and that what he wrote in the memoir always referred to them. So in his opinion it is very accurate. 
Third, the escape from prison. In the writer's opinion this whole making-a-hole-in-the-ceiling-thing was a lie and  he just payed the jailers to free him. But the speaker mentiones a document in venice which states that they had to fix the ceiling in Chevalier's cell after his escape which then again supports the Chevalier's statement.
