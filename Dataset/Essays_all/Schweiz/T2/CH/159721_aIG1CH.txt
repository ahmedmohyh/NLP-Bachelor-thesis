There have always been many historical documents which have been and still are very controversialial. When these are being released from the historical libraries, they are read and judged from many people. Not everybody believes everything they read and people start to look out for evidence to prove something right or wrong. The memoire of the Chevalier de Seingalt is a example of such a text.

Critics doubt the accuracy of his memoire because he might have wanted his life to seem more glamorous than it actually was. In his memoire he tells that he was very weathly throughout his stay in Switzerland. But there is evidence that he lent some money from a friend.  It might still be possible that he did lend some money but he was wealthy and just waiting for his money at that time, due to that it was a lot more complicated to handle your financal issues in the past. 

Another reason why critics don't believe in the accuracy of the memoire is because he wrote down a conversation between him and Voltaire, word for word. Critcs lack that it is't possible to remember a conversation that was held years ago in such a accurcy. Eventhough it might be possible that the Chevalier took notes about his conversation with Voltaire throughout the years, so he could write it all down years later.

The thrid reason why not to believe the Chevalier is about his stay in the prison of Italy. The Chevalier escaped from it by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing out on the roof. Critics think it is more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him. But on the other hand there is evidence, that his ceiling had to be repaired after he had left, so why would that have been neccessairy if not becuase of the Chevailer.
