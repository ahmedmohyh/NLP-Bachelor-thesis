In the text Chevalier de Seingalt is getting critisized and is pointed out as a horrible lyer...It's witten, that he was very wealthy but that he didn't spent his own money...he should have borrowed considerable sums of money.  It looks like he had a lot of debts. But in the audio we heard that that information wasn't true! YES - He did a lot of parties and some gambling but he wasn't poor at all... He lost his money and had to wait for new one so he had to lent some money from others...that doesn't mean he was poor.
Its also witten, that he can't know the exact conversation between him and Voltaire... but the truth ist that he had written down everything in his journal. His friends and family can confirm that. He just refers to that journal.
And last but not least the escape from the Venetian prison... In the text it was written, that he had many powerful friends who could have helped him getting out, but we know there were other prisonners who had more powerful friends and who couln't escape. Also in the old vencie documents it was written that the ciling had to be repaired. 

So we can believe both versions of the story but we'll never find out the truth!
