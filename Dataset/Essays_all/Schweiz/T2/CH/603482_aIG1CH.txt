Chevalier de Seingalt is a very controversial historical figure who wrote a long memoir of everything he has experienced. Critics ddoubt that everyting is true but their arguments are overweighed by evidence and logic. in this essay I will be presenting three points that people doubt they are true.

The memoir says that Chevalier was a very whealthy man, but still he had to take a loan from a Swiss merchant. That may be controversial but it can be explained by the circumstances he lived in. As a chevalier he often attended in parties and gambling. So of course he needed a lot of cash, for which he had so sell his stuff and this took some time. So in the mean time he had to lend money, but he still had a lot of possesions. 

Another point that gets criticised is his meeting with Voltaire and the accuracy of that. But Chevalier wrote down everything they talked about in the same night and relied on his diaries when writing the memoir.$

Also there is a part in the memoir when Chevalier escapes from a prison in Venice, which is really nice to read, but also unrealistic. He escapes by making a hole into the ceiling and climbing out of it. Critics say that he escaped with the help of his whealthy and politically well-connected friends bought him out of jail. But there is evidene that the ceiling of the his room had to be repaired right afterwards because it was damaged.
