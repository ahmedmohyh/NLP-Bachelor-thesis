Firstly, the woman who was giving the lecture pointed out that of course memoirs might not be correct in all detial but indeed the memoir written by Chevalier was very accurate in the way of narrating. Even if the accuracy was to the extend which raised doubts his memoir is a reliable source of history. 
She believe that Chevalier was not a poor man like the text said. Borrowing money from a Swiss merchant does not imply that he was poor. He needed to borrow a certain amount of money in order to establish his own business.
The lecturer said that it was a fact that Chevalier met Voltaire in the evenings to dicuss and the conversations they had together were documented in a journal. This journal was the source for his memoir which he pubished many years after the meetings. According to her this should explain why the dialogs were so detailed and by no means invented as the text mentions.
Also that he escaped the prison by making a hole in the ceiling was not impossible since there are documents that state after his escape there was repair work done on the ceiling of his cell. It would not make sense to repair the ceiling for no reason. 
Even if he had infuencial friends in Venice there were prisoners that knew even more influential people and those people in fact did not or could not escape from prison.
