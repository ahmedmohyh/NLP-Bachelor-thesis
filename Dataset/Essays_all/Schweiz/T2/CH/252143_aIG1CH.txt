In the presentation the speaker clearly showed some doubts.

The first argument is that in the memorie from the Chevalier it is  written that he met Voltaire and that they had a long conversation. But in the presentation they sad that he can not know all the things that they talked about. Because it is a long time ago.

The second argument is that in the text they sad that he escaped from the prison in Venice using a piece of metal to make  a hole and climbing through the roof. In the text crtîtics claim that he were bribed to free him. In the presentation she sad that in the prison it had a lot people who have more strenght as him and that no one could ever escape from this prison.

The last argument ist that the Chevalier wrote in his long memoir that he spent a lot of money in Switzerland on parties and gambling and that he borrow money drom a Swiss merchant. Critics are skeptical because the don^t untersand why a person has to borrow money when he'is rich.
