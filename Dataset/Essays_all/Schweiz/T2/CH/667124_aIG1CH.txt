The critics regarding the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir have been ocurred. Following are presented three arguments against these doubts.

 The first argument considering the Chevaliers questionable wealth during his lifetime in Switzerland explains details about the amount of money he possessed. Researches have been made to his real income living in Switzerland and that he must have been poor. In fact he did just have to wait till his money arrives, but that doesn't mean he was poor. It is proven that he had spent a lot of money for parties and gamblings. 

For the second point about the conversation he had with the writer Voltaire it is to mention that some written down memories have been found about his conversation with Voltaire, and they served the Chevalier as a references for his whole life. There are several situations, where the Chevalier mentioned these memories during his writing activity. Therefore it is unquestionable proven that the meeting between the two had taken place.

The last argument where the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in venice, Italy, is doubted by critics. Researches  have made clear that the prison's ceiling has been repaired after his escape. Consequently it is probable that the jailers have not been bribed to free him but that he flew on his own by escaping through the roof. 

The three main arguments about the doubtful accuracy of the Chevalier's memories have been proven from the opposite. Therefore his memoirs can absolutely be used as a historical source about European society in the eighteenth century.
