The speaker said, that it is defenetly true that the Chevalier spent huge amounts of money in Switzerland. It is also true that the Chevalier was rich. He just didn't have his money in liquid for and therefore had to convert it first for being able to spend it. This is also the reason why he had to borrow the money from the merchant. He had to wait for his money to arrive and while he waited he still wanted to spend money, so he had to borrow it somewhere.
The text states that the conversations the Chevalier had with Voltaire were not acurate, as no one can remember every little detail about a conversation, wich was held years ago. The speaker also mentions these conversations and says, that the Chevalier made notes of what they talked about, so he could write it into his memoires later.
The prison escape, which according to the text wasn't a real escape should be lead back to the connections the Chevalier had in Venice. The speaker on the other hand states that wealthier better connectet people sat in this prison and dind't get out. It is alsow a fact, that the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell had to be renovated after he left the prison.
When all the facts stated above are true, then the momoirees of the Chavalier are very accurate, and he did not invent a lot by himself.
