The presentation is about the Chavalier, a man who wrote toward his end of life a long memoir. He wrote about his life, about very famous people, kings and writers etc. Because of this his memoir has become a valuable historical source about the European society. But not everyone is happy about what the Chavalier has writen. Some people even critisize and say that he just invented some stories to make his life more exiting and glamurous.

Some people say that during he was living in Switzerland that he was a very poor guy. A man who had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Of course if you have to borrow money you can't tell that you had a wealthy life there. On the other hand, people say that he had a good life in Switzerland. He had to sell some of his stuff to get his money and of course that doesn't mean that he was poor. 

An other good example is the conversation with Voltaire. Some of the critisizer say that they have never met each other and that they didn't even talked to each other. Altough, maybe he just kept his informations and didn't want to make it public at that certain time. 

The last point is about the escape from a prison in Venice. Critics says that Chevalier had a number of politically connected friends in Venice and because of this he came free. But, if you look at it out of an other point of view, there must have been prisoners, which had much more powerful friends and they didn't came free.
