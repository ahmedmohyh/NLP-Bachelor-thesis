One of the argument is that the swiss people are very rich. The do lots of partys and gatements to earn lots of money. But first the sell different things. The text allsow say that the swiss people are very rich. But one of the questins is why the rich peope needed to borrow money. They allready had enough. 

An other argument is the prison. In the text and allsow in the presentation they aren't sure if prisons are the right answer. They allsow aren't very safe. People i there could get out through a hole in the roof. 

I think each argument in the text and in the presentations is rignt. But it is allsow very hard to answer all the questions. Many questions you couldn't answer and the will be opened.
