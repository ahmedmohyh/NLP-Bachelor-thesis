In the text it says that critics claim that the Chevalier invented events in his memoir, but the heard text says something different. They say that the memoir is pretty accurate. Although they agree with the fact that the Chevalier had to borrow money, they say that this doesn't mean that he was poor. He just had to wait for his money while he was spending a lot on parties and gambling. So because in this moment he did't have that much money he had to borrow some. Another example for the accuracy of his memoire are the conversations with Voltaire. They say that the exact conversations could very likely be true, because Voltaire had always journeys with him and in the evening after the conversations he wrote almost everything down. The third argument is about the Chevalier escaping the prison in Italy. Nobody, however rich or well-connected they are, was bribed free before. So it is very unlikely that the Chevalier could do that, although he had well-connected friends. Also the hole in the ceiling that had to be repaired after the Chevalier escaped is a proof for his escape.
