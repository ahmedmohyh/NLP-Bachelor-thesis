Arguments of the lecture 

First argument: In the text is written about that the Chevalier claimed that he had to borrow huge amounts of money for gambling and parties. According to the text, that's not true; he dind't have any reason for it because he was obscenely rich. But according to the lecture, he spent a lot of money for gambling and partying. When he didn't had any cash left, he would just sell things of his immense property. But while waiting until the cash arrives, he wanted to continue gambling and partying. So he just borrowed money.

Second argument: The Chevalier had long and extended conversations with Voltaire- the famous philosophe. According to the text, it is not possible to know each detail of this conversations accurately many years after. According to the lecture the Chevalier took each night, after a long conversation with Voltaire, notes about their conversation. Because he wrote everything down, he was able to refer to this notes while writing his memoires.

Third argument: The Chevalier claims to have escaped from a prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. According to the text, he just invented this adventurous episode of his memoires to make them more glamorous and exciting and that he had powerful friends with a lot of influece, who arranged the escape. But on the other hand and according to the lecture other inmates of the prison had more powerful friends than he had and in the archives you can read, that the the ceiling of the prison was broken and had to be repaired. That proofs his memoires.
