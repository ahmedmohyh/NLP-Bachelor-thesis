Histians have always taken advantage of memoirs in order to get a better insight of past times. However the accuracy of some of these sources is doubted, including the writings of Chevalier de Seingalt. Besides being considered 'a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century' critics have pointed out certain aspects, which prove that the text has been adjusted for different reasons. 
Whilst critics claim that a man of such wealth would have never been in need to borrow money for gambling purposes, defendants highlight that the loaning was only for the time being when waiting for his properties to be converted into money. A second aspect which is prone to criticism it the fact that he had displayed a conversation between him and Voltaire. It was brought to paper many years after it happened, thus leading to the conclusion the citations could have never been exact quotes, which they claimed to be. There have been Witnesses however who confirmed Chevalier's regular use of notes, where he would write down his experiences within a reasonable time frame. The last point of order discussed is his escape from the Venice prison, whereby he states to have used a piece o fmetal in order to make a hole in the ceiling and climbin through the roof. This seems to be rather surrealistic, since Chevalier, an influential character during his time, could have used his power to bribe the jailers. The counter argument to this is, besides Chevalier there have been even more important prisoners, which nevertheless also didn't manage to escape and furthermore there were documents found in Venice that state that the ceiling had to be replaced after his apparent escape.
