Many of the people say that he invented or distorted many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting that it really was. In the presentation it is said that not every memoir is correct. Chevalier's memoir is very accurate. Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy. He spend alot time and money on parties and gambling. We don't know if he was poor, but it is said that if he spent alot of money, he had to borrow it from someone, but that doesn't mean that he was poor. It is also very accurate that he wrote down everything he could remember at the conversation with Voltaire. Critics complained that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversation occurred. Also in the presentation it is said that it isn's possible to remember everything, what was said in the conversation, after so many years. The escape from the prison is also an accurate memoir. In the prison were people with more powerful friends than Chevalier and no one of them escaped. So why should Chevalier make it out? It was also told that the ceiling had to be repaired, but if there were jailers, who free him, than there wasn't any reparation needed. It is a story, that both of the sides could be true. We don't know exactly what's true, but the arguments in the text and the arguments in the presentation are both very good.
