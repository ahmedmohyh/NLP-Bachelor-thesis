The text claims that Chevalier's memoires are distortet and not accurate. The first argument was that Chevalier wasn't wealthy when he lived in Switzerland. The scientists doubt his welthy because he had to borrow money of a rich merchant. The lecturer though states that Chevalier had to borrow money from this merchant because the transformation of assets to cash took a few days. So Chevalier had to borrow money to being able to continue having partys. To sum up, the reason why he borrowed money of the merchant was not because he wasn't wealthy, it was because he needed cash and not assets.
The second argument was that the accuracy of the conversation with Chevalier and Voltaire is doubtable because Chevalier wrote his memoires years after he met Voltaire. The scientist do not believe that he can remember every conversation with the french philosopher. The lecturer says that it is proven that Chevalier took very detailed notes after every discussion with Voltaire. Even People who knew Chevalier say that he often consulted his own notes to write his memoires. All in all Chevalier always took notes to remember as much as possible and as accurate as possible. He did not write his memoires without consulting his notes.
The last argument of the text was that Chevalier bribed the people who brought him in jail. In their opinion it is not possible to escape from the italian prison through a hole in the ceiling. However the lecturer proves that other prisoner's friends with even more power and influence were not able to release them from custody. Another argument of the lecturer was that there is an old venicien document that indicates a repair of a ceiling in the italien prison.
