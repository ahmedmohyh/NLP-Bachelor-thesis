No memoir can be completely correct. The lecturer claims that the memoir of the Chevalier would almost completely be. During the lecture, she mentions three points that eventhough they don't make sense, seem to be very logical. 

To start with the Chevalier was very wealthy and he spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling but that's because he didn't always have cash, sometimes he had to sell properties and it took some days to receive cash, so he simply borrowed some in advance, especially since borrowing money from a swiss merchant doesn't mean that he was poor at all, it was actually common.

For the lecturer it's quite obvious, how the Chevalier was able to keep all the conversations with Voltaire. Every night after a discussion with Voltaire, the Chevalier went to his room and wrote down everything he could remember from that day. This is only supported by the fact that he has been seem consulting journals during the time he wrote his memoir.

At the end of the lecture, it's mentioned how bribery in the venetian prison was very unlikely. Apparently there were politically more powerful people in said prison that couldn't bribe any jailers. In old venetian papers about the prison the repair of the Chevaliers cell is actually mentioned, which does only make sense if he actually did what he claimed he had done.

Since there is no source of the text and no furter information about the lecturer, it's very hard to decide who's more in favour, but the life of the Chevalier was entertaining nevertheless.
