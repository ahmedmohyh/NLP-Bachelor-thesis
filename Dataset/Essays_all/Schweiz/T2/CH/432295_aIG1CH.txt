Both texts are from Chevalier de Seingalt. He wrote a long memoir which recountes his life and also his adventures. He wrote evertything he could remember.  In the text we had listened is say that no memory is perfect, but in the first text, this isn' said. Chevalier has a lot of money and he is not a poor man. In Switzerland he loves to celebrate a lot of parties. In the first text we had readed, it is written that he wouldn't have needed to borrow money, but in the second text, the speaker had said that Chevalier had to barrow money. An other contrast between these two textes is the break out of the prison. In the second text we had heard it is said that Chevalier haD only few friends, but in the text we had read it is written that Chevalier has many well-connected friends. This is another contrast.
An other important contrast between these two textes from Chevalier de Seingalt is that in the text we first readed is the life of Chevalier more glamerous and exciting. It is mentioned that he met a lot of famous persons, including kings and writers, and that his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. This isn't mentioned in the text we had heard.
