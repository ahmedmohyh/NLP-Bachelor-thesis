In the text le Chevalier's memoirs are approached in a more critical way. The text claims, le Chevalier distorted the reality of his past to seem more interesting and more influential than he actually was. I will compare the arguments presented by the text and the counter-arguments made by an expert in a speech.
Critics say, he couldn't have possibly remembered the exact details and phrases of his conversations with Voltaire many years in advance. On this point the woman who was giving a short speech on this topic disagreed. She argues that Chevalier wrote down the conversations as soon as he got home from the encounters with Voltaire. She also says there is no good reason for le Chevalier to lie.
The memoirs mention an incident, where le Chevalier was forced to borrow a lot of money. The text argues, if he were as rich as he claims to be, he wouldn't need to borrow money. The woman in the speech disagrees. She says he was forced to borrow money because his money was still on the way from somewhere and he had to wait for it to arrive. In the mean time he was forced to borrow money from a Swiss merchant.
