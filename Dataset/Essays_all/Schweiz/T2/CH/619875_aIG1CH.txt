While the audition suggests that no memoire can possibly be correct, it is still possible that all of the stated events may be true and happened the way the Chevalier wrote them down in his memories.
For the first example, where he claims to be very wealthy and spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling, it is stated that even tough he may needed to get a loan from a merchant, he might still be very wealthy and that his wealth was just immobile by having his money in properties or similar assets.
For the second example, were he was able to write down the conversations he had with the famous french writer Voltaire it is mentioned that after each night when they had a talk he took notes of the conversations and wrote down all the things he remembered. Also it is stated that he considered different notes while writing his memoire.
In the third example, where it is said that he made his escape through the ceiling by cutting a hole in it. The speaker says that it is very well possible that he left this way, because after Chevalier escaped the prison had to repair the ceiling in different ways, and there would be no other explanation to repair the roof than a prisoner fleeing. All of the before mentioned points lead me to the conclusion that the Chevalier must have been not only a great writer but also quite an adventerous person who has encountered a lot of interesting people and had the chance to have conversations with them in a way only a few people ever could.
