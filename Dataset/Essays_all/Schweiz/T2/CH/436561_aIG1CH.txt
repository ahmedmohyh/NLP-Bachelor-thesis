The memoir included three important actions, which nobody really knows if their are true or not. Between the text and the audio their are some differences. I begin with the first story about Chevalier's wealth: the text says that Chevalier wasn't as wealthy as he said in his memoir, beacause he spent a lot of money for gambling in Switzerland, but he had to borrow it. On the other side the audio means, that Chavalier had a property which he had to sell first to get money. So he needed to borrow money to get his actual money. So in fact he wasn't poor.
The second story about his conversation with Voltaire isn't as true as all, said the text, because Chevalier wrote the memoir yeasr after he had the conversation with Voltaire, so how should he know every phrase and word he said many years ago? Not really trustful. However the audio explaines the situation: Chevalier wrote just right after the conversation every sentence he rembered down.
The last story about the escape from the prison, is also a little bit suspicious, because he wrote in his memoir that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling and then climbing through the roof. But people can't really believe this, because he had many powerful friends outside who could have offered a bribe, and this would be the easier way to get out of prison. But on the other hand the audio says that the room Chevalier escaped from had to be repaired right after he got out, so why should they repair a not destroyed room? Another point is, that a few people in prison had a lot more important friends than Chevalier did and they also couldn't have offered a bribe.So in the end we don't know what's true and what's not, so every human has to think for his own.
