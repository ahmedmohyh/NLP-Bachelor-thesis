Chavalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798 and wrote a memoir toward the end of that time about his travelings. This memoir is seen as a reliable historical source even though it is known that no memoir can be 100% correct. 

Critics say that some of the things Chevalier wrote about cannot be true due to evidence found claiming to be against his writings. As for example when Chevalier was in Switzerland he threw a lot of parties and claimed he was a wealthy man. The text claims that this can't be due because he borrowed money from a merchant. The lecturer claims that he was wealthy in form of properties that needed to first be exchanged for cash. Chevalier only went to the merchant when he needed instant money for spending.

It isn't disputed that Chevalier had had conversations with Voltaire but how many details of the conversations in his memoire are true. As he wrote hsis memoire years after having met Voltaire it is hardly likely he would remember exact phrases of these conversations. People who had lived with Chevalier while he was writing his memoir state that he often looked up things in journals, which implys that he wrote down these conversations. 

In Venice Chevalier was put in prison and claimed to have escaped through the roof. People said this was unlikely due to Chevalier having friedns in high places easily being able to bribe the right people to let him out. THe lecturer points out that there were other people in the same prison with friends in even higher places which weren't let out. Also recently found documents state that the roof of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired shortly after he had escaped.
