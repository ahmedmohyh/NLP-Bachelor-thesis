The lecture is about the accuracy of the memoir of the chavalier. The lady holding the lecture relies on the three main points of the text and gives reasonable explanaitions why the memoir is so accurate.

The first point mentioning that the chevalier could not be rich because he always borrowed money from a merchant. The explanation was that he did not always have cash but he had valuable posessions which threw off money in certain periods which gave him liquidity for a certain time and then he had to borrow money again.

To the second point which states the conversatio could not possibly be very accurate because it was written many years after the conversaition occured, but there also is a quite good explantion for this. The merchant wrote down every conversation he had with Voltaire in the exact night after the conversation and relatable sources like friends to that time confirm that.

About the third point there are in fact two arguments in favor of the precise memoir. It is said the chevalier made up his escape from prison to make his memoir more exciting but he may have also bribed the jailers. The first explanation was that there were more powerful and more wealthy people in that exact prison with him that could not bribe the jailers and the second point was the venetians claimed that the chevaliers roof had to be repaired after his escape and no other cell.
