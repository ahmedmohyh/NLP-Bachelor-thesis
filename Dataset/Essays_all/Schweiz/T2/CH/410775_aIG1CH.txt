Chevalier de Seignalt has wrote a memoire in his old day, which is still of importance to day becuse he has met many famous and important people of his time. However, critics doubt that his memoire is a reliable source, they claim that he made some things up, in order to seem more interesting. For instance there is an episode of his life in Switzerland were he states in his memoires that he was wealthy, evidence shows that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But supporters of the memoire have a explantion for it. They say he had big parties and spend large sums of money and because his fortune was manly real  estate he was not always able to collect money right away, so he needed to borrow money. 
Nobody questions if he had met Voltaire but since he wrote the incounter years later down people are suspicous that the conversation are the product of his mind rather then the the real words of voltaire. Some belive that he has took notes right after their meeting and was able to recapitulate the conversation even years later.
His movie worthy prison break in Venice with only one piece of metall with whom he supposedly made a whole in the celing and escape, has been very controverial. Critics say he simply bribed the prison guard however there were even more powerful men in this prison who were never able to escape,even though they had a lot more money. If the Chvalier invented key moments in his memoire or not. The wolrd may never now...
