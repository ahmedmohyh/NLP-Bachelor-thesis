No memoire is pefect. But in fact the memoire of chavalier is a historical source. The critic doesn't exclude that chavalier had a lot of money. If someone sells their living space in a country they have to wait until they get paid. An this isn't a quick process. So while he lived in Switzerland he borrowed money because he was waiting for his own but still wanted to spend a great deal of money on gambling and parties. Another critic, which does not prove that chavalier had invented events and things is the claim that no memoire can remember exact words out of conversation, which took place a long time before. Chavalier took notes of the conversation that he had with the famous writer voltaire. Right on the following day, he wrote down every sentence of the conversation. Those, who lived next to him knew that  he always took care of his notes and he wrote a lot of them through out his life. So this argument that he invented something in his conversation just isn't true. Critics have questionned the memoir's acoount of the Chevaliers escape from a notorious prison in Venice. Their argument is that he would not have had escaped through a hole in the ceiling, which he made with a piece of metal. Eventhough there are venice documents, in which does stand that after his escape the seeiling (Zelle) in which he lived in the prison had to get repaired. So those documents do prove that something was wrong in this seeling and this probably was the whole he created. They also say he had powerful friends and it was more likely that the Chavaliers's jailers bribed him free. But other persons in the jail had much higher political friends and couldn't escape.
