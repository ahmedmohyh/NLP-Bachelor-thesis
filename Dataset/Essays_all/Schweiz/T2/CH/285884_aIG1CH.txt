The woman from the audio disagrees with all the statements from the text and delivers a logic answer to all the critics and questions which came up while reading the text. 

First of all she talks about the loan from the merchants and she says that borrowing money doesn't mean that Chevalier was by any means poor. Because he had to change the profit he made into money which took a few days so he wasn't always liquid.

The next point she spoke about was the conversation with Voltaire about which she said that Chevalier wrote everything down but he just published it later in his memoirs which doesn't mean that they didn't happen.

And as a last aspect she mentioned that the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired which is an evidence for the escape of Chevalier.

So the woman has a answer for ever question but what is actually true in the end only Chevalier knows.
