This lecture was specifically pointed towards the three critics in the text. The lecturer even claims the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt to be accurate and to be a very reliable source in history.
The text says that in the time when Chevalier was living in Switzerland he did not have a lot of money because he had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. However, the lecturer points out that Chevalier did have to borrow that money from the merchant due to the fact that his income took a while to be changed and used. Borrowing does not mean he is not wealthy.
The second statement in the text critizised the conversation in the memoir that Chevalier held with Voltaire. They did not accuse him to not having met him, but the critics thinks that a lot of the parts are to be invented, because the memoir was written several years after the conversation with Voltaire. But in spite of the long time between the conversation and the memoir, it is still very accurate because Chevalier had taken notes on the evening after the conversation had taken place. 
Lastly, the critics are skeptical about his escape of the prison in Venice. They claim that he had not climbed through a hole he had made with a piece of metal, but more likely the jailers were bribed to free him. In the lecture, it is said that after the escape of Chevalier, the ceiling has had to be repaired.
