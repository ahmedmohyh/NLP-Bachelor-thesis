The Chevalier de Seingalt who lived between 1725 and 1798 wrote a long memoir recounting his life adventures and this memoir is often used as a valuable historical source. Critics doubt that his memoir is accurate due to three of his events which, in their point of view, seem to be suspicious. Nevertheless proponents do not doubt the accuracy of his recountings due to many reasons. 

Firstly opponents doubt that the Chevalier was as rich as he himself claims to be while he lived in Switzerland because evidence has surfaced that he borrowed great sums of money from a Swiss merchant. On the other hand proponents claim that this does not neccessarily mean that he was not wealthy, but it shows that he owned property which could esold and that those transitions of money usually took some time. 
Secondly people are uncertain about the conversations the Chevalier had with Voltaire since he wrote them into his memoir many years later. Still it is said that the Chevalier wrtoe down everything he remembered of the conversation each night and he used these sources for his memoir, which means that the accuracy cannot be doubted. 
Lastly the Chevalier's escape from a prision in Venice is doubted since it seems impossible that he managed to escape by cutting a hole in the ceiling of his cell. Critics believe that it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to let him escape. This theory would not explain why other, more powerful prisoners at that time did not manage to bribe the jailers and it would also leave the question open why the celing of the Chevalier's cell had to be repaired after he escaped. 

Due to the listed reasons above it is displayed that both critics and proponents have their arguments for the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir. Nevertheless the question whether or not his memoir is a reliable source for valuable historical events can certainly not be answered.
