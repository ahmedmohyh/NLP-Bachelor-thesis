Some people doubt that Chevalier was actually a wealthy man because when he was living in Switzerland he borrowed money off a Swiss merchant. It is possible that Chevalier, who evidentally spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, just had to wait for his own money to be transfered to Switzerland. So in the short time he was broke he had to lend some money. 
The concerns about his conversations with Voltaire could also be untrue. Friends of Chevalier said that Chevalier consulted notes and journals while writting the memoir. Chevalier himself said that after every conversation with Voltaire he later took notes and worte down everything he could remember. 
Chevalier's prison break is also doubted by many but really old documents show that shortly after Chevalier escaped from the prison they had to repair the ceiling, just where Chevalier had escpaed through. It is also known that a lot of Chevalier's inmates were a lot more powerful so it is unlikely that Chevalier was able to bribe his way out of prison but they weren't.
