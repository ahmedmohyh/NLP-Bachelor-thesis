The following text is about a Chevalier and his life. I'm going to point out some significant stations from his life that are being doubt. First of all, chevaliers are known to be partying and gambling. In his memoir he claimed that he's very wealthy, but when people heard that he borrowed money, the didn't believe him. In reality he was wealthy, he just had to borrow money to finance his living, until his money arrived again. His memoir seems to be very detailed and people think that this isn't possible to have such as detailed informations, even if it's many years ago. In the text it was claimed to be impossible but in the presentation people said that he had done notes over the years and wrote a journal. This made it possible to have the exact informations in the memoir. Also an important point is that critics also questioned the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. This case isn't possible because after the Chevalier was out of prison, they had to repair the roof. People think that he got out in a normal way. Even if people think the reason was that he also had good connections, it wasn't the reason. Other prisoners were better connected with higher forces but also didn't get out of prison as easy as Chevalier claimed to got out.
