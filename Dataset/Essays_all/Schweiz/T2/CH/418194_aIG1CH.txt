It is a fact that Chevalier wrote a memoir which is nowadays a valuale historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. In this memoir he wrote down all the adventures of is lifetime. Critics now started to point out that his life in his memoir seems more exciting and glamorous than it really was. They especially refere to three points:
First they doubt that Chevalier was so wealthy while living in switzerland bcause it is proven that he actually had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. This can be explained thoght by considering that most of his wealth came from selling properties. So he actually had money, spent it on his luxurious lifestyle and than sold some property again but than he had to wait a few days to get the money so he borrowed some inbetween.
The second argument they bring up is that he wrote down a conversation with Voltaire, claiming it happened exactly like that, years after the actual conversation took place. So how could he still know the exact words? This can be explained very simply. Chevalier wrote down important conversations he had with voltaire as acurate as possible shortly after they happened. He kept those notes and later used them as source for his memoir.
The third and last point people criticise is Chevalier's escape from prsion. They doubt he actually escaped through the roof.
