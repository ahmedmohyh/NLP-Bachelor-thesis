In the presentation the woman said that chevalier was not poor while staying in Switzerland. Because he had to cnvert the assets into money. So for a short period of time he had less money. In the text it was mentioned that Chevalier wasn't rich because he had to borrow money. This point wasn't discussed.

It is said that Chevalier took notes of his meetings with Voltaire on the same day. But he used the notes only a few years later while writing his memoire. So many people think he wrote the notes about Voltaire a few years later. This point of view is written down in the text too.

In the venetian Prison were other people who had more powerful friends than Chevalier and these people didn't break out. Anotehr evidence is that the ceiling had to be replaced in his room after the escape. So its more likely that Chevalier has escaped and was not bought out of prison by his friends as said in the text.
