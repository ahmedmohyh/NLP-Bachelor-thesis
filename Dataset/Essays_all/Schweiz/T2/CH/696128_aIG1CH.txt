The lecture was all about the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt. More specific the lecturer talks about the three points critics made to raise doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. Those three point were the need of taking a loan he took whilst living in switzerland, the acuuracy of retelling the conversation with Voltaire and his escape out of a Venice prison through the ceiling of his cell.

"Why would he have needed to take a loan when he has been such a whealthy man?" Critics say. The lecturer said that even if he had much money it would have been easier for him to take a loan than sell his expensive stuff to make money out of it.

Critics also asked themselves: "How could anyone have written his memoirs about the conversation he had had years after he wrote about it?" 
For a fact it is known, that teh Chevalier took accurate notes during or shortly after their conversation and even years later when ha was writing his memoires he still had the same notes with him which helped him to be so accurate.

And for the last point it was mentioned that in this prison were even more important men than the Chevalier so this couldn't have been the reason why he was able to escape. They even got to know, that the ceiling in the Chevalier's cell had been repaired and why would it have been repaired if not because it had a great hole in it, big enough for a Chevalier sized man.
