It says that memoires cannot be completely accurate. Although memoires are pretty important for historical research. That Chevalier had to borrow money does not mean he was poor. He had to make all of thîs parties and gambling to earn money at all. That means that he may was wealthy in Switzerland. 
After the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire, Chevalier wrote down some notes. For his memoir recounting life adventures he used these notes. 
The question if he is really escaped from the Venetian prison or was he just well-connected in Venice? The bribery seems hardly possible in his escape. Because if he was not escaped the way he told then why had the prison must have been repaired exactly the way he wrote in his memoir.
The critical text and speak are about the honestness of Chevalier de Seingalt. The text shows Chevalier off as a controversial person whereas the speak is more about believing in his memoir. For sure a memoir is always a bit self-interpreted because every man has his own truth in adventures, how he saw it that day.
