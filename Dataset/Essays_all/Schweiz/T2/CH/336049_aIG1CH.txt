 There are 3 different events in the Chevalier's life people use to show that the Chevalier wasn't a 100 percent accurate ins his memoires. First, critics say that Chevalier mentioned, that he lived in wealth while he was staying in Switzerland and that he hosted a lot of different parties and spent a lot of money on gambling. Nevertheless stories tell that the Chevalier used to get loans of a rich swiss merchant, and this would show that he wansn't too whealty.  But the Chevalier was indeed rich, his profession just couldn't let him have his money ready all the time. Sometimes he had to wait for it, therefore he lend some money so he could gamble right away.
Second, the Chevalier spoke with the famous writer Voltaire and many years later wrote down the conversation in his memoir. According to critics, no human can remember a conversation so accurat like Chevalier did, a couple years later. But in reality, the Chevalier took notes, the night he spoke with Voltair and decided to write them down in his memoir some years later.
Third, critics doubt the accuracy of the story in which Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice, Italy. The critics think the Chavelier used his connections to get out of the jail. Some say that inmates of the prison had even more powerful friends in Venice, than Chevalier, so why would they couldn't be rescued. Another fact is that the ceiling of the Chevaliers cell had to be repaired, right after the escape, the question is, why would they have to repair the ceiling event though the Chevalier's jailers had been bribed to free him.
