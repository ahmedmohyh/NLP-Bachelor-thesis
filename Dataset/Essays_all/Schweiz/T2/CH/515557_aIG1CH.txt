The referrent's main thesis is, in contrast to the text, that Chevalier's memoir is probably very accurate. She says that he was rich but had to make his property first into money. So the fact that he had to take loans in Switzerland doesn't mean that he was poor. It only stresses the fact taht his wealth didn't consist of money. 
The text says that Chevalier could have reconstructed the conversation whit Voltair as precisely as he did in his memoir since this had been long before he wrote his memoir. The refferent however states that he made notes after the conversation and used these to write the conversation down. 
In Venice a report of the city's jail proves taht the celing of Chevaliers cell had to be repeared after he flew. This could only mean that he made a howle in the celing to leave the prison. So his memoir would be correct. The text hwoever claims that it would be more probable that he bribed the prison's officers.
