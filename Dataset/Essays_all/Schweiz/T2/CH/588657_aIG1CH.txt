At first the lecturer gave a not at all humongous summary. The lecturer, who looked a bit like a feminist, but suprisingly didn`t talk about rape, said that the memoir is a pretty accurate source over all. After that she talked about the three points made in the text.

The first point is the one with the merchant in Switzerland. The lecturer claimed that he had wealth in property, and to convert that wealth smoothly to money, you had to wait a few days. So when the Chevalier ran out of money and had to wait to get new, he took a small lone of a million dollars from the merchant.

The second point is his conversation with Voltair. She says it is written in his memoires that he took notes every evening after the talks with Voltair. So that point is denied like a taxi driver denies you at 3 am in the rain.

The last point is his prison escape. He is said to have given the guards money, but there were people in the prison with bigger, blacker Johnsons that the Chavalier had and they didn`t escape. Also, the Venice Government has a document which states that the ceiling to his cell had to be renewed shortly after his escape. So it is highly likely that he escaped through the ceiling with the words "DO YOU SMELL, WHAT THE ROCK, IS COOKING".
