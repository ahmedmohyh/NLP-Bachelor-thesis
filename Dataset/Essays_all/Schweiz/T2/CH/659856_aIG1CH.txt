In the text and the lecture about Chevalier the accuercy of his memoires are discused. The three main point that are metiond mostly cover each others in their content yet they have a other opinion of the reliabitlity of the facts. The first point, his wealth and money, has its center of discusion around a certian loan Chevalier recived from a merchant. In the text its said to be unrealistic that he would have needed a loan because of his wealth. The lecture counters that with the claim that these assets were not liquid and unaccsesable. Second, his encounter with voltair. Yet again the text shows his disbelive in the memoires but the lecture states that that Chevalier made many notes he had accses to while writing. Third and last point, his escape from prison. Thet text also shows disbelive in a real escape and sees a bribery more plausible. The lecture doubts that because more influential people than Chevalier could not brieb themself out, so the escape seems more likely.
