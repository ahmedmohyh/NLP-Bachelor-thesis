In the text they say that Chevalier invented many events in his memoir and they begin to make examples to prove their theory. The first example is that Chevalier claimed to be very wealth and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling but evidence showed that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. So why does he need to borrow money if his rich? The woman from the lecture gaves us an explanation. Chevalier was wealthy but he hadn't the money at him all the time. So he borrow money to spend it on parties and gambling and his own money he recived later.
In another example the text argue that Chevalier put citation from a conversation in his memoir and they claim that he can't know the exact words and phrases when he wrote his memoir a year after the conversation. In the lecture they give answer is really simple. Chevalier did take notes after interesting conversation according to multiples sources.
At the and the critics claim that he didn't escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. They say he bribed the jailers to get him free. To that argument the woman from the lecture gives us an interesting fact. According to her the prison needed to repair the ceiling of Chevalier's cell after he broke out.
