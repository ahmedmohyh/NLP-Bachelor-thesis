It's doubtful if Chevalier's memoire are completly true. Critics for example find it strange that Chevalier have needed to borrow money. Yet in the listening we heard that in the past it has taken you a lot of time to get money ready for spending. You have to remember that there wasn't any cash machines where you could take your money. That's why the people of this time borrowed money and it didn't mean that you're poor if you had to borrow money. So maybe also Chevalier needed to borrow some money from friends finally he got his own money. 
Another argument from critics are that his escape in Venice can't be true. In their oppinion he escaped only because of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. On the other side in the listening they talk about repairtures of his prison ceiling. Why shuld they repair the prison? The only logical answer is that Chevalier used also in real life a piece of metal.
