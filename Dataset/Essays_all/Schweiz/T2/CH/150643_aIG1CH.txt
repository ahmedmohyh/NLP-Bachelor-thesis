The Chevalier wrote a memoir which is a great historical source about European society. In this presentation it says that memoirs could be an accurate source for historical acts. Furthermore, in the memoir of the Chevalier there are correct information. Nevertheless there are some Critics.
Firstly, when a person has to borrow money from others, it does not mean that this person is poor. When the Chevalier had run out of money, he had to borrow money to overcome this period. Moreover, he needed to borrow money to gain new money.
Critics said that the writing about the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire is not accurate. On the other hand, in the presentation they mention that the Chevalier wrote down every conversation the night after. He kept these notes and used them to write his memoir.
Finally, Critics are sure he wrote the escape from prison just to entertain his readers. However, in some documents from the Venetian government there are proofs about this period of his life. For example it says that they have to repair the ceiling. Besides, other prisioneers had more well-connected friends.
