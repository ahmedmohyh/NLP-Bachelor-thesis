The presentation shows up the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir and that the document is reliable.

First the loan of the merchants does not mean that the Chevalier was poor, as it is presented in the text. The chevalier borrowed money in periods of which he was waiting for the money he worked for to arrive. It is proven that he spent a lot of money, but he also earned a lot of money.

Also it is true that the conversations written down with Voltaire were real. Witnesses confirmed that the Chevalier wrote down every night what he remembered of their conversation in journals. He only summarized his notes a few years later.

Also of his escape exists evidence: a venetian governal document. There is written that the prisoners had to repair a ceiling. They would not need to repair a ceiling if nobody would have broken it. It must have been the Chevalier, as he also wrote in his memoir.

The sources clearly differ, but there exists many evidence of the arguments shown in the presentaion. Critics may consider them as unreliable.
