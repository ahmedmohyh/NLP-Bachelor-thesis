Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoire and some details are controversial to critics. In the presentation the lady said that taking a loan doesn`t mean Chevalier was poor. She explained that converting his assets to money took a cuple of days and he might have borrowed money during that time. That way he could still lead an exciting and glamurous life as it says in the text and be rich as he wrote in his memoire.
Another point made in the presentation was Chevalier took notes after every meeting with Voltaire on which he based his memoire. People who knew him, say that he really wrote down those conversations and that is how he was able to write them down so accurately. Critics in the text complain that it could not be possible to remember those conversations so man years later but by taking notes this was not necessary. He didn`t have to have a great memory to copy the notes and write them down in the memoire.
Lastly, about the prison outbreak, it is critisized in the text that writing he escaped through a hole in the ceiling was more interesting to read than escaping by bribery. The lady in the presentation said however that bribery seems unlikely because there were more poweful inmates that were not able to pay their way out. Additionally they had to fix the ceiling of his cell after the escape which also points to his heroic breakout.
