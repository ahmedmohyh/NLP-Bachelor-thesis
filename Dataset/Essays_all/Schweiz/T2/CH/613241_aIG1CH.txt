In the listen part, they explained, that the things they're saying in the text, don't have to be right. Chevalier have not to be a lier, like the reading text explains. Because even if the Chevalier was rich, maybe he had to change his things, which maked him rich, in to money and for that, he had to wait. So in this time of waiting, Chevalier had to borrow money. That doesn't mean he's poor. At this case, he didn't have to lie in his biography.
An other thing is, that he wrote, that he had spoken with Voltaire and the reading text sais, that this is impossible because he worte it down many years after, with exact phrases. But the listening text sais, that he could had maken notes and with them, he could have written the conversation with Voltaire down.
And the last thing they talked about is the escape from the prison. The listening text argues, that many other inprisoners had friends, which were more powerfull than his but they didn't escaped. Also they had to repaire Chevalier's seeling and why should they had to do that, when he didn't escape of the way, he had written in his biography.
