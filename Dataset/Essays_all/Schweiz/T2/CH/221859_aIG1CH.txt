Well as far as i know, i'd say that both parties have standing points. But to be honest i'm sure that there are some things that aren't true or only half true. The Chevalier possibly adjusted a few things on his behalve. Critics mention that nobady is able to remember whole sentences of a conversation they had years ago, although in the presentation they say he kept notes of the conversation (who keeps notes like that? Like:" Yes hey buddy wait let me take some notes.")And regarding the point where they critisise the fact that somebody lend him money, one one hand it is suspicious that you have to borrow cash when you rich, but on the other hand, they weren't living in the 21. century, they could just take out their credit card and pay it later. And last but least the escape from the prison in Venice, where criticts state that he was bailed out by wealthy friends it is weird that they had to repair the roof the next day but i dout that he did it on his own.
