The text and the listening part had quite the same arguments but there were like a few little differences. At first in the text there is a comment, which shows, that if he had been rich, he wouldn't have needed to borrow money. But in the listening part they said, that it took a particular time to earn the money and if he would spend all the money in a single day, he had to wait when the money comes. So he borrowed money, not because he needed it urgently. It's because he had like in the next few days not much money. That doesn't mean that he is or was poor. The text says exactly the opposite. The next differece is that in the listening part it says, that he wrote all the things that he knew about the meeting of the last nights. In the reading it is formulated, that the informations of the conversations were written many years later. An other point is that the text shows that they knew, that he made a whole in the ceiling by a piece of metal and than he climbed through the roof. But in the listening part, they said that the roof of the prison had to be repared. So they expected that he climbed through the roof.
