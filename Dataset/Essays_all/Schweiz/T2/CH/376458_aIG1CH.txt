The life of Chevalier dee Seingalt(1725-1798)

The life of Chevalier de Seingalt is very questionable, because Chevalier leaved something behind, his memoir. This memoir includes stories from his whole life and adventures, which are today a big valuable historic source. But this source concludes so many stories, that critics start to talk. Their opininion is that this famous memoir is incorrect and invented. They just missed one argument: A memoir is never fully correct! If we look at the examples from this story, than we can see, sure it didn't happen excactly like he wrote it down, but it happened that way. When we combine the arguments from the critics with the one from the audio we all realised that this arguments against Chevalier are very weak. And it doesn't matter which words he used to write his memoir,aslong as it comes to the real end and I believe that these were the real ends.
So believe it or not Chevalier de Seingalt made an historic impact.
