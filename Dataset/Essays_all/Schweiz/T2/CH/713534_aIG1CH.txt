The leading question concernig this subjet is weather the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt are of accuracy or not. All of the doubts around the accuracy of the memoires seam easily explained in the just heard audio. It starts with the statement, that no memoir can be of high and precise accuracy. Further they explain why people would think that the Chevalier would be poor and have to lend money from friends. It is stated that it took time to get the money from the things he sold so to overcome the time where he was waiting for the moey he would lend it from friends, but that he was indeed wealthy. 
Another reason that speaks for the accuracy of the stories of the Chevalier, would be that we know from his friends that he used to write down the conversations he had. So there would be no need to remember the conversatione when they are written down at a time when remembering every detail was possible.
The last statement of Chevalier not really having escaped like he wrote down he did is also denied. They state that the prison ceiling needed fixing after the great escape of Chevalier but would the cell really need fixing if it didnt get destoyed in the first place? Further more it is claimed that at the time more influencial people were in prison and not even they were able to get out of it with bribing. 
To get a conclusion out of this subject one could say that we really can not realy on thing we read about a time that none of us were there to wittness.
