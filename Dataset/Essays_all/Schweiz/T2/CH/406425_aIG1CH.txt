The Chevalier de Seingault wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. Because his life seems so interesting, there are a lot of people who critisize it and claim that it isn't real. 
But actually there is a lot of evidence that the things in the Chevaliers life happened like he wrote down in his memoir.
Critics say that it isn't realistic at all that he would have been able to escape the prison in Venice, because it is said to having been quite well guarded. But in the papers of the prison it is written that the prison had to replace the ceiling of his cell in the prison after he was there, so why would they have had to replace it, when he wouldn't have escaped? Seems much more legit that he escaped than that how the critics say he would have been let free as a bribe of a well-connected friend of his in Venice. 
The argument that while he was living in Switzerland he would have had to borrow money is also not relevant, because while he was living in Switzerland, he had to wait for the money that his business brings him.
And concerning the argument about the Voltaire, it is even prooved that they met. Even if the conversations are not 100 percent accurate, this doesn't make the memoir bad, because it is not at all important.
