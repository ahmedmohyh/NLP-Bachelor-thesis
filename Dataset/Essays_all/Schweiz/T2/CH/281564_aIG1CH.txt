There are lots of critics out there who doubt that Chevaliers memoirs are accurate. But there are others who have several arguments for the accuracy of the memoirs, proving the events in the life of Chevalier as being right. For example regarding the money-borrowing in Switzerland, they say that it does not mean that you are poor, when you borrow money. It even seems more logical that he was wealthy, because he spent alot of money on parties and thus had to rent places where he could do them. While waiting for a large amount of money to arrive, he had to borrow something from the merchant, to not be completely without anything. 
The thing with his conversations with Voltaire is, that he had not wrote them down the moment when he began to write his memoirs at the end of his life. There was evidence found, that he had written down everything from the conversation that he remembered, the night after the conversation took place, so that he would not forget it. In this case, the argument of the critics is inaccurate.
The last event, which took place in a prison in Venice, it is claimed by the critics that Chevaliers escape with a piece of metal through the roof sounds to daring and adventurous to be true. It would be more likely that the jailers were bribed by Chevaliers many friends in Venice to free him, but others say, that this cannot be true, because Chevalier had very few friends there in comparison with the other prisonners. The frineds of Chevalier would not even have a chance to bribe the other prisonners. After the escape, the roof in that prison had to be repaired as well, so that even more suggests the accuracy of Chevaliers escape.
