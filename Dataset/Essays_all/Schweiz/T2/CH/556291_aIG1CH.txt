At the beginning of presentaton the lady says, that no memoire can be totally correct. Then she talks about the facts, which prove that the memoire of Chevalier is mostly the truth, even if there are many critics against that. One fact is about Chevalier's richness, while he was living in Switzerland. In the text it's said, that Chevalier couldn't really have been rich, because he often had to borrow money. The lady says that he gave many parties and he was living in glamour but he had property, which he had to sell first. Her next fact was about his conversations with Voltaire. Critics say, that his memoire about that can't be true, because he wrote it many years after he had been in contat with Volaire, and nobody could remember exact sentences for such a long time. But the lady says, that Chevalier always took notes after his conversations with Voltaire, which he could use years after, when he wrote his meoire. In the text it is written, that Chevalier wrote in his memoires, that he had escaped out of a Italian prison. But this wasn't possible. But the presentator explains, that there is evidence from documents of the government, which say that the ceiling had to get repaired, after Chevalier had left the prison. So why should the ceiling had to get repaired?
