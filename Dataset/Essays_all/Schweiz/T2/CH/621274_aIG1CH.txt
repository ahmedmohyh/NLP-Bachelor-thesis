The woman who was speaking in the presentation, said that no memoir could be perfect. As we can see this is also the case in Chevalier's memoire. During her speach the woman mentioned the three invented events of Chevalier's life from the writing. First, while Chevalier was in Switzerland he claimed that he had a lot of money, but for a few reasons this is not possible. Second, he had a conversation with Voltaire but he just wrote many years later about what he could remember. Third, he claimed to have escaped the Venetian prison with just a piece of metal. It is suggested that he had powerful friends who helped him to escape.
