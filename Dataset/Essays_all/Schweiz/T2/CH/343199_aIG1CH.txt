Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir towards the end of his life, which critics find quite controversial. It is said that he invented or changed some of the events. However there are many reasons that these events are actually accurate:

Firstly, it is said that the Chevalier lied about being rich, since he borrowed money from others. However, the Chevalier maid money by gamblin etc. and with these ways of making money, there was a time he had to wait in between spending the money and receiving it. So in that time, he borrowed money from others, while waiting for his own.  

Seconldy, critics say that it is impossible for Chevalier to have noted the exact conversations between him and Voltaire. However, there are witnesses, who have seen Chevalier alwys write everything down, so it is very likely that he noted the entire conversation between himself and Voltaire.

Lastly, Chevalier really did escape from prison through the ceiling and did not bribe anyone. Why otherwise would there be sources saying that the ceiling was repared after Chevaliers escape?

All these facts show that the memoir of Chevalier was actually accurate and not changed as many critics like to think.
