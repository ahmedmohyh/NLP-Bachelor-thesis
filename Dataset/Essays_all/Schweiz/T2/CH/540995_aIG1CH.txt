Everybody knews the fact, that Chevalier had lived in the 18th century. In this time he had written about his life. Know a lot of people are saying that this what he has written is not in every case the trough. In this little I will tell and explain the passages which are not in the text and what they are saying. But there is a little problem: I couldn't read the whole text before. The fact why I could not read it is because I have not seen that it was going furter an so I only had about 20 seconds to read the whole text. I am very sorry for that and I hope it is not so important. But enough of explainasions. I will try do write something as if I would have read the whole text. I hope that it don not write something that is not true but I can not give you a garanty. So I have read that Chevalier had live in the 18th century. This was a very dark time. And I do not think that everything what Chhevalier said is write. Know I will explain why. There is a little but very important example. BUT there is an other problem. At this moment I'am seeing that the timer is saying that I have only one minute left and have not really started with my essay. I'm sorry and I hope that I have not wasted your time. At the end Chabalier was a good guy
