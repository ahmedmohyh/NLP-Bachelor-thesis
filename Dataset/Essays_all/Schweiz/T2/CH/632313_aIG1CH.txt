Chevalier lived in Switzerland for a while. He claims to be very wealthy that time. The text mentions that the had borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. So is it really true that he was that rich? Critics argue that he would have never lent that amount of money if he was a rich as he claims. On the other hand it wasn't such a big deal to borrow money in that time. As we know Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. After that he had run out of cash. That doesn't have to mean that he was poor. He just had no cash at that moment, so he had to borrow some. I mean they certainly had no cash automats that time.
Another controversial story about Chevalier is about his conversations with the writer Voltaire. It is argued that he has written down those conversations years later, which is impossible to rememeber as exact as he did. Other opinions say that it is proved that he wrote down every night what they had talked about. He just kept the things for a long time. 
Chevalier escaped from a prion in Venice using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. Critics say it's more likely that the jailers offered a bribe. On the other hand there is a prove that he ceiling in the prison had to be repaired after Chevalier left the prison. That is written down in a document in Venice. And there were certainly people in prison which had more powerfull friends than Chevalier.
