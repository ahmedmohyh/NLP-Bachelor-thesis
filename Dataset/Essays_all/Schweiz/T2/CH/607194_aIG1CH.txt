In this essay I want show you, that different historical dukoments can have different views of the exactly story. You didn't understand what I mean? So I will show you by this two examples: 
In the listening comprehension I heard, that Chevalier wasn't poor and had a lot of money. I don't know from where he got it but it wasn't the same person. In this text it was a Swiss merchant who gave him money. But both historical stories says, that he spent a lot of money for parties. In an other part he didn't wrote his memoir in Switzerland. He was in a prison in Venice and there he wrote this. Also he has a conversation with Voltaire but he documented it many years later. I understand in the listening, that he write only with Voltaire and not how the text explain, with other people. Chevalier was a person who was controvers. In the letter and listening are both in the same meaning. 
In the end I can say, that the stories are correct more or less. Both have a different view of his story but in the main thing are both in the same meaning.
