The Chevalier wrote down a memoir about his life. He made a lot of parties and he was also gambling. But we don't know if he even had enough money for all those things because he often borrowed money from a swiss bank. This means not that he was poor but it could be. In the presentation it was said that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire were written down immediately or even at the same day they met. So Chevalier has written down everything he could remember. In this text it is written that the conversations were written down many years after they met.
The escape from prison is also a point which isn't clear. In the text it is written that the Chevalier could escape because he had some good contacts. But in the presentation it was said that this make no sense because there were many other prisoners with even better contacts who couldn't escape.
