The reading and the listening is about the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier. Ciritcs (reading) say that he distorted and invented things to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. Hier are the points where the ciritcs say that they cannot be right and the listing explain why it could be true.

It was said that the chevalier was weathly when he lived in switzerland and he liked to spend his money to parties and gambling. But it is known that he borrowed some money. So when he is weathly why should he borrow money. The listening explains that he had to sell things to get money so there were some days when he had to wait for his money so he borrowed money. 

It was said that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire cannot be as accurate as Chevalier said. Because you cannot remember ever single word from a conversation which was years ago. The listingen says that after the conversation Chevalier wrote down every single word and capted the notes. After years he can write the whole conversation down.  

It was said Chevalier cannot escaped from the prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The critics think that a jailer was bribed to free him. But the listening said that there were documents of Venice that said that at the point of Chevaliers escape were some repairing things going on. So it could likely be that this is true.
