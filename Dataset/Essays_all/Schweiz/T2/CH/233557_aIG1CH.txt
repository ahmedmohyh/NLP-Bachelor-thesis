Contrary to the piece of text, the speaker claims that The Chevalier's memoir is pretty accurate and a reliable source for historic events. She responds to the statements given in the text which doubt the accouracy of the memoir. 

Firstly, he Chevalier states that he was very rich while staying in Switzerland. While it is said in the text that he couldn't have been very rich because he needed to borrow money, the speaker considers that he spent a big amount of money on parties and gambling. As a result, The Chevalier had to wait for new money to arrive and in the meantime had to borrow money.

Secondly, the text claims that The Chevalier wasn't able to capture conversations between Voltaire and him accuratly as they happened many years in the past. However, the speaker seems to know from notes and journals in which The Chevalier was writing everything every night. So it is quite possible to record conversations from a long time ago if you still have got your notes.

Last but not least, the text claims that The Chevalier exagerated by the report of his escape from a jail in Venice. But old documents confirm that the celing had to be repaired through which he had made hole. Also, there were other prisoners with much better friends who didn't get free.

To sum up, the arguments in the text invalid after the speaker's response. It is to believe that The Chevalier's memoirs are quite accurate.
