The woman states, that critics, who are in doubt of Chevalier's accuracy, are wrong. With three evidents she shows why. Firstly, she claims that Chevalier's memoir is an accurate and reliable source. It is true, that he sometimes had to get a loan from Swiss people, but that doesn't mean he was poor. He held a lot of parties and did quite a bit of gambling, so he ran out of money now and then, but he always had stuff to sell and he wasn't a poor man.
Her next thesis is, that Chevalier wrote down every conversation with Voltaire on the exact same day he had held it with him. He kept these notes over the years and when he actually wrote down the conversation in his memoir many years later, he could lean on these notes. In a last step the woman explained, that it is not possible, that Chevalier escaped prison just because of his contacts with politically influentual people. Other inmates of the prison had more influential friends than he did and they didn't even manage to get out! So this thesis isn't really considerable. And the turning point of her speech, that makes listeners really doubt those who critizise, is, that the roof of Chevalier's prison cell had to be replaced just after he had left the prison. So that's an evidence for his breaking out through the ceiling.
