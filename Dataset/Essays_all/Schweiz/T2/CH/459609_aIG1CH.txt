Chevalier de Saingalt wrote a long memoire about his life. The stories are well known in European History. But there are some aspects which seem to be unreal. For example Chevalier lived a long time in Switzerland. There he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. But no one exactly knows where the money was coming from. Some critics think that he borrowed the money from a Swiss merchant. Today this fact is proofed. Another point is that Chevalier wrote down every conversation he had. Afterwards he kept them for a long time and integrated them in his memoires. Perhaps he was not able to remember everything and so he made some stories up. That is why some stories may seem too overdone today. The most important fact which tells us that Chevalier did not only write down the truth in his memoires might be the story where he broke out of prison. Peolpe say that it is impossible that he had friends who payed a bribe. But it is really strange that the ceiling was fine after his outbreak. So Chevalier explained in his memoires that he repaired the ceiling by himself after his outbreak.
