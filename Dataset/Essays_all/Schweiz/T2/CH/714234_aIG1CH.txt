The Chevalier de Seingalt, who live in the 18th century, wrote down what he had experienced in his life. This memoir is an importabnt sourve of information about life in Europe in the 18th century, although some people don't believe in its accuracy.
The first controversal point is Chevaliers life as a rich man in Switzerland. Critics say, that he had to borrow money, which means that he can't have been rich. In the listening however they said, that he only had to borrow money because it took a couple of days for him to receive the money.
Chevalier also wrote about his conversation with Voltaire, who was a famous writer. The important point here is, that he wrote it down years after the actual conversation, so it must be quite inaccurate. Supporters claim, that he wrote down all the things he could remember each night after the conversation.
The third controversal point is his excape from a prison in venice. Chevalier claims, that he had made a hole in the ceiling in order to escape but some say he probably just bribed his jailers. However there is information, that the ceiling of his cell had to be repared after he had excaped, wich supports Chevaliers stroy.
