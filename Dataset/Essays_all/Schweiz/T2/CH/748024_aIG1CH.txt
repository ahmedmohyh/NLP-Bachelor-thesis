In the text the critics said that Chevalier lied about many things in his memoir. But the woman who did the presentation says otherwise. They both agree that Chevaliers memoir is a important source for european society in eightteenth century. 
The critics say that Chevalier lied about being rich in Switzerland. He wrote in his memoir that he threw big parties and gambled all night long, but they found out that he had been borrowing money from a Swiss merchant. The woman explaint that you first needed to sell a property to get a money in that time. That's why he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Because he was waiting for his money, not because he was poor. 
The other event on which they both disagree is the conversation between Voltaire and him. The critics say there's no way he can memorize every single word which has been said in this conversations and repeat them in exact the same words. The woman corrected them again and said that Chevalier always kept notes after a conversation with Voltaire so that he doesn's forget anything valuable. 
The last thing was his escape from prinson in Venice in Italy. The critics claim he birbed his way out of that prison but the woman again says otherwise. She says that ist is impossible for Chevalier to have birbed his way out since another one, who was much bigger than him, wasn't able to birb his way out of prison. Also, his prison widow has been needed to be repaired. Why would they need to repair a widow if it isn't broken? That is the proof that Chevalier really did escape the prison in Venice as he wrote it in his memoir.
Those were the biggest differences between the text and the presenation.
