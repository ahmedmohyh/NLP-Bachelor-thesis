Chevalier was a reliable source of information in the 18th century. He met many famous people and kings. 
Critics say that he invented many events to make his life seem more exciting. So the stories about Switzerland could possibly be true, because he possessed  a lot of houses an things which made him rich. He didnt have a lot of money before selling his property, so he sometimes had to borrow money.  After he sold the properties, he had a lot of money and he could give the money back.
Critics also think that the things he wrote down about the conversations with Voltaire can't be true because he only wrote them down a few years later. But its said that he took notes while having a conversation and that he collected all these notes and wrote them down a few years later.
They also doubt the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. They say that he didnt escape as he described. It would be more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him. But bribery in this particular prison was hardly possible. Some sources say that the ceiling had to be repaired, so his story could or must be true.
