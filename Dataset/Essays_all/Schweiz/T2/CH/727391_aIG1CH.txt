The first controvers of the text and the lissening part is the question if he was rich during his stay in Switzerland or if he had to borrow money. The text tells us that he was not rich at all and always had to borrow the moneyfor his big parties. On the other side there is the presentation explains us how Chevalier got to his money. He was in a business where he fist had to invest money in order to make profits. So meanwhile he had to wait for his profits, he had to borrow money. But after he got his money he payed back his debts. So he was not poor as described in the text. 

The second point is that the text tells us about the impossibility of writting down a conversation, as accurate as Chevalier did, many years later. But acctually, as we get to know in the presentation, Chevalier always took notes of his conversations short after them. So when writting them down years later he could relay on these notes.

Than there is his breakingout of prison. He tells us something about a metall whit which he digged a hole into the ceiling and escaped throuhgt it. But it is not really possible to dig such a hole throught meters of beton. However, short after his escape from that prison the prison had to renew the ceiling of his cell.
