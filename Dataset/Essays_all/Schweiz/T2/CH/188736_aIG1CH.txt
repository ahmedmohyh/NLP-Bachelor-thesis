While no memoir is entirely correct, the Chevalier's one is a reliable source. He is known to have written down everything he had experienced. He claimed for excemple to have met Voltaire, and some say that this cannot be true, because his notes about it appeared ways to late. On the other hand it could be that he had just been writing and thinking about what to write for a very long time.
Living in Switzerland, the Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. Critics say that this money did not come from himself, but that he borrowed it. Nevertheless, other say that he merely borrowed the money because he was waiting for other people to pay him, because of the land he had selled.
A third controversial point about the Chevalier is that he may have escaped prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling so that he could then escape by climing out. Even if this sounds ridiculous, it could really be true, because we know that after his escape, the ceiling had to be repaired. It could as well be that he was bribed free, but this seems unconvincing since he did not have as much powerful friends as others who did not manage to escape.
