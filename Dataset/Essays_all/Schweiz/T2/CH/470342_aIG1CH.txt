The things that were told by this woman are all compared to the text. In her opinion the memoir of the Chevalier are true and that is also what she is claiming. She is always fixing one of the points that criticises the memoir and explaining why this is wrong. She said that contrary to many other people she is sure that the memoir is true. About the aspect that the Chevalier had to borrow money but he only had to borrow money because his wealth were properties that needed time to be sold and not cash. So he had to ask a Swiss merchand for money. Also they said that the time between the memoir and the dialogues was too long, so he wouldn't have been able to remember them. But he also made notes of the discussions on the same evening so he had the notes and it is very probable that the disussions in the memoir are true. And the last point about his escape out of the Venice prison. He wasn't the one with the most powerful friends in this prison but the only one to escape. And also they had to make a new roof at his room so his story could really be true.
