Both, the written text and the presentaion agree, that the Chevalier de Seingalt has become a valuable historical source.
But in some points, people can't agree. For example in the wealthy of the Chevalier. While the written text states, that he must have been poor, the woman from the presentation is convinced, that he actually was pretty rich and that the reason why he went to Switzerland for financial activity, was because he wanted to sell his worth. People have to, otherwise, they wouldn't be wealthy.
There is another difference between the text and the speach. While in the text it is written, that the things Chevalier wrote about the meetings with Voltaire can't be exactly true, because he wrote it years after the meetings, the women in the speech has an other point of view. She says, that in truth, Chevalier made some notes in the nights after the meeting so he would remember everything better in the future years, when he wrote everything down.
And last but not least there is a disagree in the way he escaped from a notrious prison in Venice. The text states, that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. But the woman says, that he really escaped through the roof. She says that otherwise, the sealing wouldn't had to be repaired the day after.
