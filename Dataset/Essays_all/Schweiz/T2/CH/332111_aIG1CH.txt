The record didn't tell exactly the same arguments but it's similar. In the record they were more likely to believe Chevaliers' texts and notes. The three main topics were his life in Switzerland,his convsations with Voltaire and his escape from the prison in Venice. First of all the text says that Chevalier wasn't as wealthy as we thought because he needed to borrow money from friends, which makes im poor, and the record had just told that he was waiting for his money and therefore he needed to borrow it. Second, Chevaliers notes from the night talks with Voltaire can'tbe that accurate because it's impossible to remember phrases that well. But the record told that he wrote those notes while talking to Voltaire. And his escape from prison is either bribe or a real escape with a piece of metal. The records told that the evidence of escape is that the police needed to renovate his cell and many  wealthy men more lived could bribed the police much better. In the end, both sources do question his work, some more than others.
