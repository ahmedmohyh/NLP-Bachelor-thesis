"No memoir can possibly ever be correct at any detail." "It seems as if he wrote down everything he could hardly remember." "Or is it just what he wanted his life to be like?." Critics come up about the exciting life of Chevalier de Seignalt. It's all about the writings he left, about all his memoires and adventures. 
As an example; Chevalier spent an unknown time in Switzerland, where he needed a lot of money for partying and gambling. Nowadays we know that, whilst living in Switzerland, he had to borrow money. So the question comes up; why did he present his life such as if he would be rich? For sure, borrowing money doesn't mean to be poor, not at all. Did he just wanted others to be jealous of his life? We never know. 
A second example could be his extremly impressionable time in prison, or even more his escape. In his writings he told, that he could escape by using a piece of metal. He made a hole in the ceiling and climbed throught the roof. But others in Prison had even stronger and better connected friends than him, and they couldn't reach the possibility of an escape. So which parts of his stories are real, which are just well imagined?
