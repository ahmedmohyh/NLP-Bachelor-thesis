The first arguement of the text, that he wasn't wealthy because he often had to borrow money, is countered in the presentation with the fact that he had indeed quite some valuable things. These things however needed to be selled first, before he could use this value. This means that when he wanted to use a larger amount of money he had to borrow it first before he could use his own money. The second arguement mentioned is that when he wrote down his conversation with voltaire, it was many years later and he couldn't possibly remember every detail about it. But in the presentation it is said that he actually took notes the day after the conversation which he used when he wrote down his story. The last arguement is that it is more likely that his jailers were bribed instead of him escaping through the ceiling with only a piece of metal. But the other prisoners, as it is mentioned in the presentation, had more powerful friends than him and even then it was not possible for them to bribe the jailers. However after his escape, the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired which let's assume that his story is true.
