Toward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. It also includes meetings with famous people, including kings and writers, of European society in the eighteenth century. But there are critics about the truth of the story.

He also still want to know the exactly sentences he had spoken with Voltaire. And is the escape of Chevalier out of the prison in Venice the truth? Or are there corrupt politicans who are Chevalier's friends? We can see that there are many points which are not so clear how they really passed.
