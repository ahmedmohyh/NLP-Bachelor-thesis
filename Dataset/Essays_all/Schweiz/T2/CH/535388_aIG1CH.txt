Chevaliers memoirs seems to be an accurate source in european history. Every statemant about him lying can be disproved. While in switzerland, he had to lend money but seemd to live very wealthy. How come? He had to overpass some days where he had spent all his money on partys and had to wait until he got his income back. His conversations with Voltaire he had written down and kept for many years, as proved from his nearliving friends. That means also these written lines in his memoir have to or at least are pretty likly to be true. His escape from the prison also seems true because they had to repare the ceiling of his cell afterwards and there where much more powerfull people in the prison wich would had bribed before him if possible. Long story short: his memoirs are true and accurate.
