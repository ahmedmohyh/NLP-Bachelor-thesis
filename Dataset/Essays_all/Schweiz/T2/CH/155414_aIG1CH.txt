The chevalier is a human being, which wrote a long memoir about his life. There are many things written in his memoir which are doubted to be correct or not.
First of all, the chevalier claims that he has been very rich during his stay in Switzerland. There is no proof for this, but it is sure that he had to borrow a lot of money from someone durin his stay in Switzerland. This is a little bit suspicious, as the Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he was very rich. And usually, rich people have no need to borrow money.
But there is a explanation. The Chevalier had a lot on money in form of propriety, and to get this money he had to sell propriety, and this takes some time. So until he had the money from his propriety he borrowed money from someone else. 
Furthermore, the Chevalier writes detailed phrases of what Voltaire said to him when they met. This is not possible, as there is no chance of remembering an entire conversation which took place several years earlier. 
But this point aswell is disputed. It is assumed that the Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered about the conversation with Voltaire the morning after. This would explain why the Chevalier can give such detailed information about the conversation.
To end up, he also wrote in his memoir that he managed to escape out of a prison in Venice with a piece of metal. Even thought this is very unlikely there are documents of the prison saying that the prison bars of the Chevaliers cell had to be replaced right after he escaped.

There are many points which speak for the truth of all these stories, but after all, the Chevalier is a person who lived in the 18th century. And it is impossible to confirm such kind of events which happened 200 years ago.
