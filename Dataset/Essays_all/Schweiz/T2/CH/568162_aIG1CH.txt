Chevalier was a well known and importand figure from the 18th century in Europe. Besides his encounters with famous people and heroic adventures, he was a controversal person, because the accuracy of many memoirs are being doubted.
According to his journals he was a very wealthy man during the time he lived in Switzerland. So why did he still had to barrow money? Another criticised point is his encounter with Voltaire. He wrote down their conversations almost word for word, which is impossible, one would think. So he might have added a sentence here and there.
And what about his gloriously described escape from a prison in Venice with only a piece of metal? It is speculated that besides lots of lucky coincidents, he must have had help from his politically well connected friends. But in the end, in every story there is a bit of truth and future generations will still enjoy reading about the adventure of the famous Chevalier de Seingalt.
