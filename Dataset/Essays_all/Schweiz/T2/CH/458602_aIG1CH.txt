The lecture rejects the accusations stated in the texttha the Chevaliers Memoire is inaccurate. They say that no memoire is completely correct but that the Chevaliers memoir is pretty accurate. The text says that the Chevalier wasn't rich when living in Switzerland because he needed to borrow money from a merchant. The lecturer says that Chevalier only needed to borrow money because he was waiting for his own money wich took a few days to be converted. Another point touched are the conversations between Voltaire and the Chevalier. The text says that the conversations cannot be accurate because they have happened long before the memoire was writen. The lecturer rejects this point stating that the Chevalier took notes immediatley after talking to Volatire and kept them for many years and consulted them when writing his memoire.The last point is the prison escape in Venice. The text says  that Chevaliers powerful friends bribed the prison in order to free him but the audio claims otherwise and say sthey found a document in the Venice archive where is stated that the roof of Chevaliers cell had to be repared which means that he must have escaped.
