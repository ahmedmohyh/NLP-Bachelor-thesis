A memoir could be correct, but it seems that not all in Chevalier de Seingalt memoir is true. Chavalier told that in the time in switzerland he spended a lot of money for parties and gambling. But he borrowed a big sum of money. It would take some days till he gets the money and till he can spend it for parties and gambling. 
The text and the presentation are critical about the memoir from Chevalier de SEingalt, they show facts why not everything in his memoir can be true.
