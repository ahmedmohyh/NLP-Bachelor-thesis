I have read and heard about a man called Chevalier. he must be very famous and rich, because he wrote a book about his life. I had a text and a audio. In the text, there is a lot of critic. but the adio is very positiv about Chevalier 

The women from the audio was clearly one with a positiv mind about Chevalier. The text has a lot of bad critic about him. She sais, that Chevalier was not poor. He just made some business. For those business he borrowed money from the bank. In the Text they say, that he was not that rich how everyone think, because he had to borow a lot of money.

The secod point was conversation with Voltair. The text says, that it`s nearly impossible, that he could remember that many details about his conersations even if they are years bevor he wrote his book. The women said, that this is not true. Chevalier made many many notes. He said, that he made after every conversation with Voltaire, as many notes as possible. That he made many notes during his life was also showed.

The last point is the glorious prison escape. The critics says that this story can not be true. They say it is impossible to escape from this prison by using a piece of metal to makeing a hoe in the ceiling and climb through the roof. The women said that it is true that he was not the one with the best contacts in this prison. But afer he escaped, they had to repair the ceiling in his cell. So why this story should not be true?

My concluion is, that obviously some things are true. There are also a lot points who says that these things are true. But as always there are some things wich cant be true. For example I belive that he escaped through the roof but I don`t think that he did this with a simple piece of metal.
