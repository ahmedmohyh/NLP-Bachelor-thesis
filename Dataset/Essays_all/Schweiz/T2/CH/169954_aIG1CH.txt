In the beginning the woman talks about the general accuracy of memoires. She says it is definitly possible that they contain a certain amount of faults, but Chevaliers memoires are pretty accurate and well documanted. 
For example the borrowing of money could be in relation with liquifying money from goods as it is well known that Chevalier had wealth. He wasn't poor but probably just had to borrow some money while waiting for his possessions to be sold. It is also confirmed that he held many parties and gambled which can't be done poor. 
The important conversation between him and Voltaire is also questioned since it is hard to remember exact phrases after so many years that have passed between the writing of the memoiresand the conversation. But it is claimed that he has written down details in the same evenings athe conversation happened and people close to him confirmed his usage of old notes to write his memoires. These probably were these exact phrases he had written down. 
As the third answer to the critics the woman talks about a document that confirmes the repairing of his cells ceiling a short time after his escape. Further many important personalities were in this prison and no bribe has ever been recorded there, which maked it improbable that he bribed them.
