The first point that was mentioned was the wealthy of Chevalier. He spends a huge amount of money for partys and gambling. So it could be that he ran out of cash and had to borrow cash from someone. But in this time it was usual that you first had to sell and then got your money. So we can say that he had a un income, but otherwise he wanted to partys for getting honour. So he had to borrow money by knowing he gets it later. He was pretty sure that he can pay the borrowed money back.

There are also critics about the memoir. It was said that Chevalier writed the conversations down each night after the  discussions with Voltaire. Also it was regularly confirmed by him.  

At the end the escape from a prison in Venice was the theme. There were found an evidnet document from the governement, which claims that the prison room had to be repaired. He had also more powerful friends. This seems a bribary more possible.
