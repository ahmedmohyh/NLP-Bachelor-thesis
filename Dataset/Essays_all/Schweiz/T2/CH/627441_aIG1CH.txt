The Chevalier wrote a memoir which is still today an important historival source. But there are also many critics that he cheated with a few memoirs.
He spent time in Switzerland where he spent much money with gamling and that he couldn't be that rich. An argument for the truth of this is that there is a long merchant. So first jou have to sell your money hand have to wait until you get it.
An other point of critc is that he wrote a conversation with Voltair word by word in his memoirs. Critical voices say that no one could remember a dialogue exactly a few years ago. But it could possibly be that he wrote the conversation down the next evening und kept it until he wrote his memoirs.
An other story about an escape from the prison of Venice made a few questions. Even other prisoners which hat more friends with influence and money couldn't escape. In his memoirs he writes that he escapes "by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling". In an other document not written by Chevalier there is written that they hat to repare the cell in which the Chevalier was arrested.
