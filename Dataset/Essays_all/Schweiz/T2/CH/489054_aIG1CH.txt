In the audio the person who tells the story is a supporter of the memoire of Chevalier. The person tells many good things such as, the memoire became a valuable historical source, Chevalier was not poor even if he had to lend some money in Switzerland. The explanation is that he had to convert his material things into money. This took him a few days. During these days he had to lend some money. Something else is his speech with the famous writer Voltaire. Chevalier took some notes after he talked with this man. So he was able to write down everything correctly many years later. Another point is his escape from prison in Venice. It is possible that he escaped through the ceiling because after he left prison they had to repair the ceiling in his cell.
In the text these arguments are more negative. It was being written by a critic. For this person it is impossible to  write down a memoire with many details but without any mistakes. He thinks Chevalier invented some thins to make the read of his biography a little bit more interesting. It is unbelievable that he had so much money but had to lend huge sums of money in Switzerland. Another point of critic is his converstaion with Voltaire. Nobody can remeber every detail of a conversation many years ago. His escape from prison is also not very rational. It is nearly impossible to escape through the roof with a metal device. The logical alternative would be that he had many friends with connections to higher people.
