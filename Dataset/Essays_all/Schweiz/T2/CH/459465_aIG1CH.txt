The long memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, is pretty accurate. There are many evidences that what he wrote down happened like he said it did. In the text above there are three experiences of Chevalier:

The first one ist the one with the loans of Chevalier he had back in his time in Switzerland. The miss who presented the presentation argumented, that he had loans because he made so many parties and gambled a lot. But that doesn't necessarely mean that he was poor, because to become money you have to sell something and sometimes he had to wait for his money. In this time where the money hadn't arrived he had loans. But as I said this doesn't mean that he was poor. He was even rich.

The next "adventure" are the meetings with Voltaire. Critics say that there was a long time between he met Voltaire and between he wrote those conversations down. But thats acctually incorrect because neighbours of Chevalier had agreed that he wrote every conversation on the same evening down. So the notes are pretty accurate.

The last point is his escape of the prison in Venice. He said that he only used a piece of metal to escape. Some people say he just had powerful friends, but there where as well inmates who had even more powerful friends and they even had to stay in prison. So it's not that unbelievable that he escaped by unlocking the door with a piece of metal. The prison guards even had to repair his cell after he escaped. And remember: Why should you repair a cell which isn't broken? 

So I think the memoirs of Chevalier are pretty accurate and are a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century.
