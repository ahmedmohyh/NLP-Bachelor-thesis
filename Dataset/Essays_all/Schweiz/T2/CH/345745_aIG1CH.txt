The women told us about the memoirs of chevalier. She underlined that the memoirs mostly has to be true. We know that Chevalier did spent a lot of money for parties and ball gauns while he was in switzerland. Also did he make a lot of notes while he lived so he could surely remember single phrases someone said in a discussion many years later. Also the thing with the escape out of the prison probably has to be true. Because after Chevalier escaped they had to repair the ceiling in the prison. So why would they had to repair the ceiling if noone had escaped.And there were a lot of people in the prison which knew a lot of people which could have get the prisonors out and didn't. 

In the text they're not sure if all that happened. They say that Chevalier is probably overacting for example with the escape and they claim that Chevalier was rather pour while his stay in Switzerland.
