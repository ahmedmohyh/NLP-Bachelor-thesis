The text I've read shows the different critics about the credibility of Chevalier de Seingalts life and in the listening their opinion is in contrast to these critics. 

First, in the listening they believe Chevalier was not poor. In contrast, in the text they are convinced that if he had been rich, he would not have had to borrow money. However, in the presentation they argumented that because he could spend much money, he was wealthy and sometimes when he run out of money, he had to borrow some. 

Additonaly, in the text they claim that Chevalier invented many events to make his life seem more exciting. Moreover, they affirm he wrote conversations many years after they happened, which is an evident that they are just invented. Nevertheless, in the presentation, they said that the next day he wrote down everything he could remember about last night.

Last but not least, he escaped the prison. Critics in the text claim that he invented this event once again. They believe friends of him bought him free, whereas in the presentation, they believe because he was wealthy he could bought himself free.

In conclusion, the text is more critically then the presentation is. Critics in the text claim that quite everything of Chevaliers life is invented, whereas the speaker in the presentation has confidence to what Chevalier wrote about his life and they are sure that all events happened and that the details are true, too.
