Chevalier was a man living in the 18th century. Before he died he wrote a memioir about his life which later on became a important source in history. But there are many critics about his adventutes and people doubt all the stories are true.

For example there is a story of him living in Switzerland as a very rich man. But there is evidence that he was a gambler and owing people money. Supporters claim that this doesn't necessary mean that he wasn't rich. He could have just had to wait for his money to arrive from some other buisness.

Also he has whole conversations writen in his memoir which must have taken place multiple years before he actually wrote them down. Criticians say that it is impossible that they are very accurate because noone could remember that exactly for multiple years what somone said. His supporters say that he took notes the evening he had the conversation and that he had used these notes later when he was writing his memoir.

Another story causing suspicion was the claim that Chevalier broke out of the prison in Venice by using a peace of metal to make a hole into the ceiling. But there are claims that after Chevalier got out of prison the ceiling had to be repared and this might have been a possible reason why.
