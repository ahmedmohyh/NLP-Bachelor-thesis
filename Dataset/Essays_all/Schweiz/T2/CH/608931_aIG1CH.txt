The author of the reading passage claims that the Chevalier had no money and was poor. From the presentation we learned, that he had not the right kind of money he needed and he first had to convert it into regular money namely cash. In the text it is made clearly that it is impossible to remember the exact phrases of a conversation that took place such a long time ago. In the presentation it is argued with the fact that the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember of the conversations with Voltaire at the evening after the conversations. So the gap between the actual conversation and him writing it down wouldn't have been too long to remember. In the text is written that a more believable mechanism of escape is that he had contacts which bribed the corrupt jailers and thus freed the Chevalier. In the presentation on the other hand it was said that there were also other prisoners with even mightier contacts that weren't freed.
