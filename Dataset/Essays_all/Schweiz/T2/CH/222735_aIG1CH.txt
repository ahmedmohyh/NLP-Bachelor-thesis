No memoir is correct in every detail but it is a reliable historical source. First of just because the Chevalier borrowed money dosen't mean he was poor. He selled things and it took time. So because he spent alot of money on parties and gambling he had to borrow some money until he got his money from the things he selled. Second he did not have to remember the exact phrases from his conversations with Voltaire held many years earlier, because he wrote down his conversations with him at night on the same day as he held the conversations. He kept those notes and journals and with that said it is logical how he was abel to have extended conversations in his memoir. At last but not least his escape from the prison in Venice also could have been true. Regarding the facts that others had more powerful friends than him and they could not escape. Also their was even more evidence, after his escape the prison had to repair the ceiling of his cell and that obviously indicates that somthing had to have happend there.
