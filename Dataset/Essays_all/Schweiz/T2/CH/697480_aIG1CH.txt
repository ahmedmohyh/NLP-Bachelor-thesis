The Chevalier was some nobleman that lived during the 18th century and wrote a rather famous memoire later on.
Some people have tried to let it seem, that some passages were not true but invented by himself.
One of the things people have claimed is, that the Chevalier was poor, not wealthy as he wrote, during his stay in Switzerland. In Switzerland he lived a rather expensive life with gambling and partying all the time.
He had to borrow money from some merchant and some see this as evidence of his attributed wealth as being nonexistent. The thing is, he was quite wealthy, but most of his fortune was put into all kinds of things and not kept as money. So when he needed money, he'd have to sell some of his belongins and whilst this phase,
he'd have to borrow the money needed.
Another point doubted by others are his reconstructions of his conversations with Voltaire, whom he spoke quite often. The Chevalier claimed to have had written it all down as notes, as soon as he got home from these meetings,
which has been confirmed by witnesses. Also, they saw him using these notes as well as others too while writing his memoires. Lastly, there is the rumor, that he did not break out of prison on his own, but bribed the jailers.
Yet there were many wealthier men in this prison, with more powerful friends, that did not escape, even though they should have been able to bribe themselves out as well. Also, somewhat after his escape, the ceiling in his room had to be repaired, meaning, there must have happend somewhat with it during his stay.
