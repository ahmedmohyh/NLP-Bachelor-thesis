In the written text and in the listened text there are some different meanings about the Chevalier. 

the Chevalier wrote his memoirs and in these he said he had lived in Swtzerland and had spent a lot of money for gambling. He also said he was rich in this time. Some critics are that when he really was rich why had he borought money from others? In the listened text there is a possible answer. He was a Chevalier so he was a knight. He had a lot of money but not all the time. He got his money when the farmers had to give him their resources. When he spent his money befor the next time the farmers gave resources he had to borough some and later he paid back.
Another problem is his escape from the prison. In the text is said that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the roof. On the other hand is the meaning of the person in the istened text. In some old books is written that the room of the Chevalier had to be repaired for a long time. Why should they repair the room so long if he just made a hole in the roof? In the written text is also said the could had prabably help from outside. But the other side said that this is unrealistic because there werse many prisoners with more connections to outside. And the others did not flie.
 This question how the Chevalier flied cannot be solved now. But we all now : When someone writes his memoirs he also overcomes with some things. What is really the truth that knows just the Chevalier.
