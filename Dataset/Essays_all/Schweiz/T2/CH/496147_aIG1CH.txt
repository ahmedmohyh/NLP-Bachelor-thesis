The subject is about a memoir full of lies and inaccuracy written by Chevalier.
In the presentation it was mentioned that Chevalier wrote in his memoir that while living in Switzerland, he was wealthy and rich. But that couldn't be possible because between the time he had to wait for his earned money to arrive, he borrowed money from another person. That doesn't mean he was poor. But also if he would have been rich, he wouldn't have to borrow money.
He also wrote about a conversation he had with Voltaire. In the presentation it was mentioned, that he made notes from the conversation, right after it happened. So when he wrote the memoir, he could repeat everything. So this can't be an argument against the conversation taking place.
Also Chevalier wrote about when he escaped from a prison in Venice. In a report it was written, that the ceiling had to be repaired. But Chevalier described a different way from escaping the prison. He didn't do it by destroying the ceiling.
