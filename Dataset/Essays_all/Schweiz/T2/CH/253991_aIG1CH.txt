In the text they say that Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure and that he has a lot of critics. They say for example that the Chevalier couldn't have had that beautiful life in Switzeland as he wrote. Instead he had a problem with money. But in the audio they say it could be true that he had a life with lot of parties. And they insist that just because you need money you don't have to be poor. 

The critics say also that it's impossible to write a conversation exactly like it was after a long time as Chevalier did it. In the audio they confirm Chevalier and say that he wrote the conversation immediatly after he mets Voltaire, but kept it for himself. His women told him to public his story and after a long time, he did it. 

The third discussion point is the story with the Venetian prison. The critics say that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him and his escape story couldn't be true. In the audio they say that the story is true. It's confirmed that his prison ceiling has to be prepared after his escape. An other argument from the audio is, that there were other persons in the prison who were definitly more rich than Chevalier and had more rich friends but they coulnd't escape with a bribe.
