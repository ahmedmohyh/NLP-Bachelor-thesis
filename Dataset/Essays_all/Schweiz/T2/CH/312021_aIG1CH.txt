Chevalier said that he broke out of prison with a piece of metal but actually the prison was in bad condition and they had to repair it. There were many other prisoners who had stronger friends and connections than him and they didn`t break out. The amazing prisonbreak that Chevalier wrote down was a fake invented in his mind and the jailers were brided to free him because of the condition instead of his strong body.
It is said that Checalier didn`t even meet Voltaire altough he released a book about the conversation they had. He wrote this book many years later and nobody is so smart  that he can remember the hole conversation. 
Chevalier wasn`t wealthy at all, he spent a lot of money in switzerland for unimportant stuff to mention his rich lifestyle but obviously he was broke and had no money. He borrowed some cash and you are not rich when you do that in my opinion. He just faked a wealthy lifestyle for a good image in his memoir. C
