In the lecture, the presenter puts forward several reasons as to why critics claiming some of Chevalier's memoires are partly made up and/or inaccurate are wrong. She claims that no memoires can be entirely correct, but Chevalier's appears to be largely accurate. The fist point she makes refutes the claim that Chevalier only pretended to be rich, but was in fact poor. Critics of his work argue that Chevalier had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, which would not have been neccessary had he been rich. The presenter disputes this, saying that Chevalier had a lot of personal assets and possesions, which couldn't however be used directly for the parties and gambling he intended to do, the assets needed to be converted first. Converting the assets into money must have left some time where Chevalier had limited money and therefore needed to borrow some amount from the afore mentioned Swiss merchant. This perticular incident therefore did not proof that Chevalier was poor. The second point she makes refers to Chevalier's conversation with Voltaire. Critics say the conversation must have inaccuracies, because he wrote his memoires several years after the converstation itself. The presenter also refutes this claim, mentioning that Chevalier claimed to have taken notes shortly after talking to Voltaire. Many of Chevalier's friends and acquaintances backed up his claim, saying they often saw him refering to many previously made notes when writing his memoires. Lastly, the presenter argues that Voltaire's prison escape must have happened in the way he described it, because Venecian prison guards later said they needed to repair works on the roof. She also refutes the claim put forward by critics that Chevalier used his  political connections to escape, as there were othe individuals in that prison that were far more powerful.
