The text describes why the memory of the Chevalier de Seingalt can not be entirely true. The presentation argues for the opposite side and explains why the memory of the Chevalier can be used as a historical source. There are three points that are  described where the text and the presentation do contradict one another. 

The first one is about Switzerland: The Chevalier described his time in Switzerland. On the one hand, he said that he had been very rich and on the other hand he said that he had to borrow money. The text argues that it is not possible to be rich and to borrow money at the same time. In the presentetion they contradict. They say that it is possible that he was rich but that he runn out of cash because it took ages to recieve his money.

The second part where the text and the presentation don't agree is about a conversation with Voltaire. The Chevalier wrote the conversation years after the conversation itself. While the text claims that it isn't possible to remember an exact conversation years later, the presentation argues that he had taken some notes before. So his writing b he wrote the conversation years later down. 

The thierd and last point ist his the escape of the Checvalier. After his memory he escaped after he had made a hole in the ceiling and climed through the roof. The text describes that it would be more likely that the Chevalier'sjailers were bribedtofree him. However, there have been prisoners with better relations to the jailers and none of them did escape.
