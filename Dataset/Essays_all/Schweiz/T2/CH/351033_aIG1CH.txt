This eassay is a comparison between a article and a lecture about the topic of le Chevalier de Seingalt.He wrote his memoires in the late years of his life. Some historians thinke it is a important historical document, while others think it is not. 

Was he rich or not? The article states that he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. They argue, that this is evidence, that le Chevailier was poor and not this rich person, which his memorials suggests him to be. On the otherhand the lecture states that beacuse he was selling assets he did not have the money immediately.Thats why he had to take up loans.

A other debated point is the accuracy of the conversations with French philospher Voltair. The article states despite of talking with Voltair, he wrote down his conversations much later. The lecture states, that he wrote down the conversation later in the evening. This is means, that those text are very accurate.

Finally there ist the debate about his prison breakout. While the Article states, that he did not breake out of prison. He bribed his way out. The lecture says, that it would have been impossible for him to bribe his way out, because he was no powerful enough. venetian documents also confirme this theory because the roof had to be repared.
