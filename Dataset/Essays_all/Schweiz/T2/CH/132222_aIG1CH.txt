Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the eighteenth century, has had an adventurous life. Many of his outreagious stories are very contagious, and therefore he wrote them down. Since his social life included meeting many famous people, even kings and wirters, his memories build a valuable source for history in his century.
But not everybody believes all of his stories. There are doubters who got some to be taken serious points. For example, when Chevalier was visiting Switzerland, he didn't want to leave his lifestyle behind, so he brought the parties and all the gambling to Switzerland. He spent a great deal of money to afford this, and had to borrow some from a Swiss merchant. Critic voices now say that this is a controversy to his richness. But Chevalier simply didn't take enough money to his trip, and had to wait for it to arrive while still parying. Having to wait for his own money to come and beeing poor isn't the same.
Another point is that Chevalier exposed a conversation between him and Voltaire, that had been taking place half a dozen years before he exposed it. You can't deny that one simply cannot remember the exact conversation, but he also could have taken notes the evening after the conversation, and this way another of his stories was right.
A third argument is his flee from a prison standing in Venice, but while critics say he got bribed from friends, there are documents that say they had to repair the ceiling from his cell, meaning his way he fled, what speaks for him.
