Memoirs are often used as a limited source of historical context, due to inacuracies. The Chevaliers memoir however might have been one of those that were very close to reality. But how much can you rely on his writings?
The written text argues that Chevalier was claimed to be rich, however still had to borrow money from a merchant which woudln't have been the case if he actually was a rich man.
The women who spoke counters this argument with another. She said that it took a few days to convert assets into moneyat the time, and because he spent a fortune within days, he needed to borrow money from a merchant so he could continue his extravagent parties.
The second point made in the text is that the memoir cannot possibly capture the converstion between himself and Voltaire accuratly due to the time between the convrsation and the time when the memoir was written, some years later.
On the other hand the women says, that other sources confirm that the Chevalier had infact taken notes of all important conversations, the one with Voltaire not being different. 
The last argument claimed he didn't actually escape as dramatically as it was mentioned in the memoir, but rather that he got some of his connections to bribe the jailers to get him out.
Opposing this theory, the women tells us for one that there were other people in the prison wih a lot better connections, who could've easily got out this way. It is said however that they didn't escape. Also The ceiling of that prison needed repairs some time after he escaped which further supports his story. It is possible that he made a whole into the ceiling to escape.

Saying how the oral arguments directly counter the written ones, I belive it
