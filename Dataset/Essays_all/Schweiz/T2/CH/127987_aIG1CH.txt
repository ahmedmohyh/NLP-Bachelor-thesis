This historical text is about Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoir and wether it is correct or fake. 

The text critizes that Chevalier had been rich, because it says that if he had to borrow money he couldn't have been rich. The audition have another opinion on that point. The speaker explains that Chevalier only had to wait for his money, so he wasn't poor at all.
The second point the text mention is when the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire was written down.The text arguments that in the conversation can't everything be correct, because he wrote it down so late. It isn't possible that he could remember everything they were talking about word by word. The speaker explains that Chevalier made some notes after the conversation, but all in all he wrote later. 
The last point they aren't agree with each other is how chevalier escaped out of the prison. On the one hand the text mention that Chevalier had good connections to important people and could have escaped with their help instead of escaping through the roof. On the other hand the speaker explains that other people in the prison who had more important friends didn't escaped and the roof had to be repaired after the escpape. 

All in all we can say that he text critizises the correctness from the memoir and the speaker justifies the memoir. They aren't agree with each other.
