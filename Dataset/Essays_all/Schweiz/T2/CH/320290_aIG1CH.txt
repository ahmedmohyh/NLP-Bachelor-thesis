The Chevalier was a very important person when it comes to historical sources. He wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures, but many people are sceptic about the fact, that his memoir are really true. They claim that his life wasn't as beautiful as he mentioned in his memoir. They give examples including the event in switzerland. they say that the Chevalier borrowed money from a swiss marchant even thought he is swimming in money. The fact that he sais that make critics argue about his stories. But you can also say that the Chevalier hadn't got any money at the moment, right there and then and he had to borrow money from someone because otherwhise he had to travel long distances to get his ''money''. Another event critics point out is the conversations between the Chevalier and a famous writer. They claim that he could't remember everthing that the writer has told him because the event was writtern many years later. But you can also say, that the Chevalier wrote everthing down and used his notes years later to write his conversation with the writer. And finally the prison event event, where critics argue that he couldn't escape the prison.
