In the text above and the lecutre I have heard, it is discussed wether or not the long memoir of Chevalier is an accurate historic source. While the text only points out what critics think about three events in the memoir in paticularly,they are better explained in the presenation about Chevalier. 
One of the point critics mention is that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant when he lived in Switzerland. This would contradict his claim about being rich and wealthy. But lending money at that time, didn't mean that you aren't wealthy.
And his notes after each conversation with Voltaire made possible to write the detailed dialogue with the French philosoph after so many years later.
More doubts about the accuracy came up after knowing the escape of the Venetian prison. Critics think, it's probably not possible to escape such a prison through the ceiling. But indeed, some old documents of Venetians government state, they had to repair the ceiling after the escape of the writer.
