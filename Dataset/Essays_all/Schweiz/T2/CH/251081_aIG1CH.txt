Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. His memoir became a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. Crirics aren't sure about the accuracy of the memoir. They say his memoir shows a more exciting world than it probably really was. 
For exemple, in his memoir he writes that he was very wealthy and that he spent a lot of money in while he was in Switzerland. However, there is an evidence that he ran out of money and had to borrow money. 
That he ran out of money doean't mean that he was poor. He waited for the money. 

Another exemple is the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. Critics doubt that some phrases of this conversation are not true. Because it was written many years after the conversation ocurred.

The last exemple is the escape of Chevalier from the prison. Chevalier writes that he used just a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. Critics doubt that. 
But the ceiling had to be repaired.
