In the text the Chevalier is getting critisised because he mention himself as very wealthy in his memoirs. However, evidence has surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a merchant. In the audio record this fact is confirmed but they say that the Chevalier only borrowed money because he had to wait for the arrival of his own money that he has got by selling things. 

Another point in the text is doubting that the records of conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire are not fully accurate because of the fact they were written many years later. On the other side in the audio record it is mentioned that everything the Chevalier has written in his memoirs about Voltaire was based on earlier notices he made.

The last point of critise in the text says that the Chevalier never escaped the Venetian prison in the spectacular way ist was described. They say in reality he had a number of powerful friends who could have offered a bribe. On the other hand in the audio record it is said that a bribe could never had happened, considering that their were prisoners witch much more powerful friends who were not able to escape the prison by a bribe. Another fact their bringing up is that the chamber of the Chevalier had to be repaired after he escaped.
