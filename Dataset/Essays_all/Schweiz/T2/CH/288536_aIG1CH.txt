Every memoir is a historical source but every person has his own experiences of a situation so that is the reason why you can't belive everything that is written in memoirs. Thats what the person in the presentation told but in the text there is written that the Chevaliers memoir just got a historical source because he met a lot of famous people. In the presentation it was said that the Chevalier had wealth when he was in Switzerland but he had to borrow money. But this wasn't a sign of poverness but the text sais that it is 
The presentation said that he had some night talk and directly after he wrote down everything they were talking about with some notes. Not like in the text where it sais that he wrote down the stuff of his conversations some years later. And the last point is that the presentation sais, that he escaped from  prison and we know that some days after they had to repair the roof of the cell where Chevalier lived in. So this may have happened. In the text it is written that Chevaliers jailers were bibed to free him but the audio said that there were some stronger people in prison but he was the one who reached to escape.
