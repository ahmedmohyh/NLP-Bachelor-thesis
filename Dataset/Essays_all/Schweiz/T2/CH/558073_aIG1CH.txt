In both is said, that the Chevalier was in Switzerland very healthy, but he also spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. In the reading clause it's saying, that he get money from a Swiss merchant and that the chevalier wasn't rich, because he had borrowed money, and also the hearing clause is agree with this argument. 
In the second argument is saying, that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. Both text's are were agree with this argument. Because both are sure, that Chevalier can't remember the exact phrases of a conversation who is being many years ago. 
In the last argument both text are disagree. Sure, both are saying that Chevalier is lying about the escape out of the prison in Venice, but with other arguments. The reading text says, that he had used a piece of metal, but they don't believe that. They are sure, that Chevalier has had friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. 
But the hearing text is disagree with this, it says that the room hadn't been repaired after his escape and that other prisonier has more friends than him, for prepaired an escape.
