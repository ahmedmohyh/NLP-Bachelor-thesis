In the text, there are 3 points that are made to prove that the chevalier wasn`t always telling the truth.

- He wasn`t really wealthy

The memoir claims that the chevalier was very wealthy during his time in switzerland. The text says, that he had to borrow a lot of money from a swiss merchant. The lecture however claims, that he had a lot of property but not in physical cash form. So when he neeeded cash immediately, he borrowed it. 

- He didn`t have the conversation with Voltaire

The Lecture claims that the conversation couldn`t have happened as he claims, because he couldn`t possibly have memorized all the details. The lecture claims that he wrote down the conversations the same night that he had held them with Voltaire.

- He didn`t escape the prison through the ceiling

The text says, that the chevalier had powerful friends in venice, so it was more likely that he had bribed someone. The lecture claims that the ceiling had to be repared later and that other prisoners with powerful friends didn`t manage to bribe someone either.
