They talked about Chevalier. He was accused that he disorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life more exicting and glamorous than it really was. Some have the oppinion that this is a lie. They mentioned three events and explained why this has really happend.
The first happened in Switzerland. He had to borrow money. But he wasn't poor how many people thougt he is. He has first to sell his propperty to get to money. And this takes some days. So when he needed money, he needed it now. That's the reason why he had to borrow and that has nothing to do with poverty.
The second event was that he remembered the exactly words of conversations with his friend Voltaire after some years. Many people accuse him that this is impossible. But there is a very simple explaination for this. He wrote everything down he remembered after the meeting with Voltaire. Because of that he could after years write very exactly about the conversations.
The last thing that happend was when Chevalier was in prison in Venice. In his memoires he has written that he had escaped. Many people say that's a lie and he had just many influence to other people. But there were richer and more influence people in that time, who couldn't escape from the prison. So may be he could have really escaped from the prison in Venice.
There are a lot of differents perspectives of what really happened then. It's impossible to say which one is right and which is wrong.
