The text and the presetation are about a historical person called Chevalier de Seingalt. During his lifetime he wrote down all his experiences and adventures in the European society of the 18th century. What the text and the presentations have in common is that Seingalt had a lot of money but he spended it on events and parties to show his glamour life no one fucking cares about but ok I`m here and I have to write this fucking essay now. I should have go home when I had the possibilty to. But you know I`m a good student. So Chevalier had a lot of money. He lived in Switzerland. He travelled a lot. Well, that`s everything I can remember what was said in the presentation. 

I think I`m going to draw something pretty on the sheet of papers that`s lying here on the desk. 

Wanna know what I drew? The beach where I`m going to be in two weeks for the whole summer holidays. God bless my family in Portugal. Amo voces! Muitos beijinhos da Suica!
