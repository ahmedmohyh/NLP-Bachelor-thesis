Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798), was a notorious personality in the eighteenth century. He conserved a great amount of historic information by writing down his life and adventures. Therefore, he is an important historical source about European society at that time.
In contrast to the text, the presentation disagrees with the fact,that Chevalier was poor just because he borrowed considerable amounts of money. The presentation states, that Chevalier had to wait a certain amount of time, until he had cash in his hands again. According to the presentation even though Chevalier borrowed great sums of money, that doesn't urgently mean that he was in a financial crisis.
The second contradiction was Chevalier's friendship with the philosopher Voltaire. The text points out that it is not possible to remember every single detail of a long conversation, after a considerable amount of time. However, the presentation says whitnesses confirmed that Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember each night after him and Voltaire had talked.
The last but not least point is about Chevalier's escape from an Italian prison. In his archives he wrote down, that he fled from the prison by using a piece of metal to cut a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The text criticises that this adventerous story was written down for entertainment of the reader. Additionally, the text claims that Chevalier's influential friends helped him out of prison. In contrast to the text, the audio claims that other jailed people had even more influential friends but they did not manage to escape the prison. In addition to this the audio states that Venitian documents say the ceiling of Chevalier's old prison room had to be repaired after his escape.
To sum up, the audio is rather in favour of Chevalier, whereas the text is sceptical.
