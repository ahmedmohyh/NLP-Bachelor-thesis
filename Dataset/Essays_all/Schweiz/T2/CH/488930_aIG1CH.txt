The woman in the audio file references to three events that a man called 'the Chevalier' noted in his memoirs. 

The first point that she makes, is about his wealth. Altough the text implies that he did not have that much money, because he had to take out loans, the chevalier was actually wealthy, she sais. She confirms that he did borrow money from a swiss merchant,but sais that he did it, because most of his wealth was either land or other materialistic posessions of some kind and not cash. 

Then she goes on to talk about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. She clears up that the Chevalier apparently wrote down his conversations really carefully, each night after the conversation itself which would explain how he could remember every sentence so clearly - a matter that was, according to the text, often doubted by his critics. 

Lastly, she talks about his escape from a prison in venice, where he - again if you believe the critics mentioned in the text - bribed the guards to get free. A lot of fellow inmates also had very influential friends that could have bribed the guards to free them, she sais. Again she brings in new information that was not mentioned in the text, by saying that the ceiling of the chevaliers prison cell had to be repaired after his escape, which implies that his memoirs are accurate and he did in fact flee through a hole in the ceiling.
