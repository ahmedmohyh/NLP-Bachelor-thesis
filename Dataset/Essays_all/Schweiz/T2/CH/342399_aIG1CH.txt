Opinions on the memoir of the Chevalier are very seperated. Some say the memoir he has written is a valuable historical source others are sceptical if he made up some of the things he wrote. For example did he wrote a very heroic story in his memoir that he escaped from a prison in Venice. Critics claim that he escaped through a offered bribe from his well-connected friends while others claim that other prisoners had well-connected friends too and they couldn't escape. Furthermore did he write about some interesting conversations he had with the famous writer Voltaire. Critics say that this conversation can't be interely true, first because he wrote the conversation down many years later and second because you can't retell the exact story. It was very well known that the Chevalier was very rich but recently surfaced that when he stayed in Switzerland he borrowed a large amount of money so he couldn't have been that rich. On the other hand did the Chevalier spend a lot of money in Switzerland and he had to order new money which didn't go that fast. So till he got hi money he had to borrow some.
