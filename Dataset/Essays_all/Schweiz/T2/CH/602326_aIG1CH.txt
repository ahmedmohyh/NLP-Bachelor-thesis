The Chevalier de Seingalt was a very ineresting person. He lived from 1725 to 1798. His life counts as a valuable historical source even though we don't know if everything he told or wrote down is true. 

He said for example that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire and he citated parts of this conversation. But critics complain that the human brain can't remember exact phrases from conversations. But it could also be that the Chevalier wrote down the most important things out of the conversation.

In the end no body knows what really happened, if it is true the Chevalier had a very interesting life and if it isn't true he had a very interesting mind.
