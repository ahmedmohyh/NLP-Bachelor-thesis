Did the Chevalier de Seingalt lie in his book, or did he not? There are many discusions about that. But here are some arguments summed up.

The wealthy Chevalier was ones in Switzerland, where he gambeled partied a lot. Because of that, he run once out of money that he had with him, so he borrowed some from a Swiss merchant. The text on the other hand thinks that he wasn't actually that rich, so that was the reason that he had to borrow money.
Voltair was in the same time alive, when the Chevalier was. In his book he describes detailed conversations. To capture the right phrases said, he made a lot of notes directly after the conversation, something he did reportatly after other conversations too. This he did after a lot of conversations. The text surce otherwise claims that Chevalier could not hold such a conversation so long in his head, because it was written many years after these conversations.
The escape from a notorious prison in Venice probably happend a toled too. Chevalior wasn't the only one in the prison with powerful friends, but he was the only one that escaped, so it had to be done by himself. He made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and climbed through the roof. Reports were found, that after his escape there had to be done repairs on the sealing in his room. Well, the critics in the text mention that this was just a story invented to make the story enjoyable to read. Chavalier escaped according to them through well-connected politically friends out of Venice who could have offered a bribe.
