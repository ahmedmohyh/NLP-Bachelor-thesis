The listening refeerd to the critic and the doubts in the text. The women who talked in the listening refeered to the exact same points and tried to say something towards the criticer. She tried to fight off the criticer. For example: in the text it was mentioned that Chevalier had faked some conversation with Voltaire. The pro argument was that the memoir was written many years after the conversation had taken place. Critics point out that there are phrases in the memoir that have never been said like that or in that context. The women had a conter argument. She said that of course no memoir is totally correct. That is not possible. But it is a fact that Chevalier and Voltaire talked together. Everytime they had a conversation together Chevalier took notes about that conversation. The notes have been found by professional people. Chevalier used his notes to write his memoir. So most of the information are correct and for sure he could remember the situation better when he read some notes about it. 
In the text and in the listening other arguments pro and contra were mentioned.
