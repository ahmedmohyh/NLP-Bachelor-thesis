The question is about the Chevalier de Seingalt that wrote amemoir of his adventorous life and that knew a lot of people according to this memoir.
The text above and the listening tried to discuss this paradox figure and if he just told lies or if it is some truth behind it. 

The first argument from the text was that Chevalier was known as rich because he borrowed the money from a swiss merchant and spent it on parties and by gambling. According to the text he was a poor man and a betrayer. But the fact is that he was not poor. He just waited until his possesions were delivered to him, so he hadtoborrow some money. Now the question is, which of these statuments are true? None of them have any proof.

The next fact which iscontroversally discussed is the fact that he knew Voltaire and had every night contact with him by just meeting and talking with him. The text meets this fact with a lot of unbelief. It cannot be possible that Chevalier could knew all the words and the phrases from the conversation. But there are others that explain that Chevalier noted every night after talking with Voltaire what they talked about. 

At least there is another unbelief in the way how Chevalier could escaped from the prison in Venicerespectively if he was able to do it. Skeptic people read this story and think that in the prison were other prisonners with more politocal connection than Chevalier did. According to thememoir he escaped by the ceilling and people donot agree. But how could people later on find a document that said that the next day  room of the prison has to berepaired?
