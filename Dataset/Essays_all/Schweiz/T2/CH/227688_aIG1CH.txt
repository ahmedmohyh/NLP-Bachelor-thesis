The lecture menntions that no memoir or journal is ever to be perfectly historicaly correct as it is one subjectiv view on how things were. The same apllies for the memoirs of Chevalier as they share the story of his life. The lecture states, other than the text, that Chevalier wrote down the events truthfully and did not make it most enjoyable to read. 
Chevalier did as an example take notes on all his meetings and conversations with Voltaire what indicates that he could still years later reanact the conversations and the topics being covered. 
Other than that his wealth is a subject of constant disscusion. Many say that it was exagerated but even if he did not have as much money as he claimed, it is proven that he borrowed a lot of money and had a lot of assets that could be converted into money. Therefore, he still can be considered wealthy eventhought he borrowed money from other people as he could live an exciting life spending that money on parties and gambling.
To the critics concerning his escape can be refered to a states document of Venice that says that after the escape of Chevalier they had to repair the cells ceilling what leads to a strong suggsetion of his escape.
