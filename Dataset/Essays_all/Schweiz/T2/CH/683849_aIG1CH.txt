Chavalier de Seingalt a famous person who lived in the eighteen century had written a memoire abaut his life and his adventures. He writes about meetings with very famous peoples like kings and Voltaire but also about remarkable adventures like the escape out of a prison. Critics say that many actions that were discribed in the memoires aren`t real and just invented by Chavalier himself. 

Critcs say that Chavalier wasn`t as rich as he pretended to be because it`s proven that he lent money in switzerland. Others say that he was rich and wealthy for sure and he just lent the money because he had to wait for a payment. 

Also some peoples have some doubts about the fact that the speech between Chavalier and Voltaire isn`t retelled exactly like it was. They say that Chavalier couldn`t remember all the phrases which were said between him and Voltaire after five years. But otherwise it could also be true because Chavalier could have documented this conversation earlier. 

At last the critics say that the narration of the escape out of a prison in Venice is also invented by Chavalier. They think that at that day Chavalier just came out of the prison regular.  Prooven is that in a old document from the goverment of Venice is written that after the time of the escape the cell of Chavalier had been repaired. This indicate that theescape out of the prison happened for real.
