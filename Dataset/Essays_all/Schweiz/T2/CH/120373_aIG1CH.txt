Chevalier

The first argument says that Chavalier borrowed some money from a friend while he was in switzerland because when you sel something to get money you get this money a few days later. so it was absolutely necessaire for Chevalier to borrow some money because of that and not because he was poor. He wanted to make the parties and not waiting for the money. So he really was wealthy and rich not as the text says.
the text says that it is nearly unpossible that Chavalier and Voltaire have met one day. But if it really was the case it couldn't be  that Chevalier remembered every phrase in detail.the second argument says that it's absolutely true because after the specific nigth the two man met Chevalier wrote every evening the details down witch he remembered from the meeting. 
The third argument says that after Chavalier escaped from the prison it was necessaire to repair his room. So it might be possible that he escaped with a piece of metal. While he was in prison there were some mans which were absolutely more importent so it can't be right that somebody offered him a bribe.
