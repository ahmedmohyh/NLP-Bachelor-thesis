The women who made the presentation was not as critical as the passage from the text. She thinks, that, even though that not everything in his memoire is not completely correct, because no memoire can be, the things he wrote about and how he did this is still pretty accurate. 
Firstly, it`s known that he has had a huge amount of money when he lived in switzerland and he partied a lot, but he was "poor" before and made it to wealth later.
Secondly, he took notes and used diaries to remember things right after they happened. He has used these notes later to write his memoir, and that`s why he can remember his talks he had with Voltaire so well.
Thirdly, he hasn`t had many friends in prison, so it seems very unlikely that he escaped with help. Bribery hardly seems possible. And, it needs to be added, that the ceiling was in needing of a repair after his escape. Why would it have needed to be repaired if he didn`t escape as he told, ba making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal?
While the text points out the negative, doubting aspects, the presentation gave us some more background details, that may raise araweness, that there are also clues given that should make us think aout the truth behind his memoire.
