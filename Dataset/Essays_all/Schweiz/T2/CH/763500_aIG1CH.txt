In the audio they still claim that the memoir of the Chevalier is still very important for knowledge over this time and very reliable source.
Firstly they claim that the Chevalier wasn't poor as they want it to show us in the text. Because borrowing money doesn't mean you are poor, he had a decent amount of wealth.
Secondly the writers of the text say that his conversations aren't accurately because he should have written them down just years later. But in fact he wrote the conversations down straight after having them and kept all these notes. This also has been confirmed by other people livin during this time.
Furthermore the critics claim that the Chevalier got out of the prison in Venice because of some influential friends. However other prisoners had some much more influential friends and weren't able to escape the prison as the Chevalier de Seingalt did it. Also the prison cell in which he as imprisoned got to be repaired after he escaped and normally a cell doesn't have to be repaired after an easy escape without destroying anything.
