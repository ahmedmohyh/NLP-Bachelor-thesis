It ist true that Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoire of his life and adventures witch become a historical source. But Chavalier wasn't poor like it is written in the text. He was in Switzerand that's right and for a certain moment he didn't have money. But only becaus he spent all his money at events and partys. So he went to the bank and he had to wait for his money. That's why he borrowed money. We can see he isn't poor!

Voltaire and Chevalier were friends. Chevalier kept his conversation with Volontaire in writting text. He always wrote down his conversation with him. So it's not possible that the text was written many years after the conversation like the critcs desribe. 
   
It is sad that Chevalier escaped from prison in Venice because of good known friends who life in Venice witch could have offered a bribe. But ohter prisoner had also well conected friends. Friend witch had more power and they couldn't escape. Another point is that Chavaliers cell was destroid. His cell had to build new. So why should his celling be destroid when his good conected wriend offered him a brid?
