In the presentation she talked about three main points.
1. The loan of the swiss merchant what does not mean that Chevalier was poor because he just lent the money in those few days when his own money was been made. 
in the text they critizise that why he would borrow money when he is rich.
2. The conversations with Voltaire. She said  that Chevalier worte down every evening after talking to Voltaire his thoughts and quotes. He then stored them for many years and only used them then to write his memoire. 
3. The escape out of prison. In the presentation she said that friends of him had even more famous friends. And why should the ceiling be replaced if nobody had escaped.
