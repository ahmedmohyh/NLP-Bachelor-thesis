In the presentation the lady said that chevalier borrowed money isn't a evidence that he was a poor guy. She said that he needed to pay a lot money for exampel parties. In the text it's written that he wasn't a rich guy. In the other case he doesn't needed to borrow money from other people.
About the conversation with Voltaire the lady how made the presentation said, that Chevalier wrote down everything about the talk in the same night. But in the text it's written that he wrote it down many years after the conversation, and that's the reason not everything is correct.
About the escape from the prison in Venice she said that they had to repare something there. So it's necessarliy that Chevalier had broken something to escape from the prison, then otherwise theres no need to repare the stuff. In the text it's saying that he just wrote that he escape alone and in this spectualer way so it's more exciting for the people to read it. But in the text they say that one of his friends payed money for him. And so he could "escape" from the prison in Venice.
