The presenter says that in a memoir not everything can be correct in every detail. But it's an important historical source.
First the Chevalier de Seingalt isn't poor. He has had health and this is just possible if you have money. He has to wait for money, but that doesn't mean that he is poor.  It was normal to spend a lot of money. In contrast the critics in the text  say that he just invented that he was on parties to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. 
The presenter is convinced that Chevalier has spoken with Voltaire. He wrote everything he could remember and he put out the most important. The critics mean that it's not possible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier.
Third there is the escape of the prison in Venice. The presenter believs that Chevalier has escpaped from there. Some other people in there have had more important friends than Chevalier had and they didn't break out. Chevalier writes that he could escape with a piece of metal. In fact they had to repair the sealing of his room after he was out. Why had they to repair the sealing, if he didn't escape through the roof? Critics say that some politically friends had help him and he didn't escape through the roof.
