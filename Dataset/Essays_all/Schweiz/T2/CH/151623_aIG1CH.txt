The arguments are clearly analysed in the listening. Meanwhile the text's opinion on the Cheavalier's memoir is mostly negative and claims that it is fake, the women from the listening does confirm the memoir and reacts overall positiv to the memoir. In the following lines the arguments are going to be broken down into their fragments, to give you a better view over the situation. 

Firstly in the text was written, that there is a leck of accuracy. The text uses the argument, that the Chevalier told everyone that he was rich and spend a great deal of money. In fact there is evidence that the Chevalier borrowed a lot of money to pay for his nights in Switzerland. The lady from the listening confirmed that he had long party nights in Switzerland but she didn't admit that the Chevalier was poor. She said that he first had to convert his possessions to money. This was a pretty long process, therefore he started to borrow money, before his money was converted. 

Secondly the text claimed that the accuracy of the memoir was not good. On of the points which are mentionned in the text is that you could not remember the exact phrases from a conversation many years ago. The lady's reaction to this argument is simple and precise. She told everyone that the Chevalier was taking notes after each and every night and stored all his notes for years. Therefore he could remember almost every detail of his past few years. In fact he used the notes of many years to create/write the memoir.

In condition there are different opinions on the memoir. In my opinion the lady did have definitely the better arguments and I think she does have more information about the memoir or the Chevalier himself as the writers of the text.
