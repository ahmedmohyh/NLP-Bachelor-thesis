In the dialog we heard the woman said, that it is possible to remember de lines. But in the text is said, that the memor channot possibly capture these conversation accurately. In the oral text was said, that he spent a lot of money in buing things for his girls not just for parties or gambling. He was rich and also very smart. He knew how get money in a easy way. So he borrow money from the Swiss merchant. Chevalier didn't distorted or invented many events to make his life seen more exiting. He just wants to spent his money in a nice way. So also other people provite from his money. He did that in a good way and a lot people liekd him because of that. So his life didn't just seem nice, it was nice. All this informations I got from the text I heard and I think they are right.
