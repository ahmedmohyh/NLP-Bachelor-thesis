Chevalier lived from 1725 to 1798. He wrote a memoir about all his adventures in his life. His memoir is a important historical source about de European society but there are many critics who have doubts about the accuracy. In his memoir he writes about how much money he spent for parties and gambling in Switzerland but it was found out that he lent huge sums of money from a Swiss merchant. But maybe he had to lend money because if you have something to sell it takes time until you have made enough money to live on your own so he had to lend some money to start. Another doubt about the accuracy is that for example the conversation with Voltaire had only been written down years later after Chevalier and Voltaire met. To explain this a theory may be that Chevalier may had taken notes right after every conversation and had written his memoir some years later with these notes. The third doubt critics have is about Chevaliers probably not so daring escape from the prison in Venice because he just had some famous friends who payd a bribe for him and he didn't needed to escape with only a piece of metal. But to see it from another point of view there were many other prisoners with much more famous friends than Chevalier had and they couldn't escape from the prison by just having a famous friend who could have had payed for them.
