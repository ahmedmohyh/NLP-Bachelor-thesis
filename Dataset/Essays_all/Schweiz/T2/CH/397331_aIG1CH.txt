Chevalier lived 1725-1798. In the text it becomes clear, that all the informations about Chevalier are not to 100 percent true. Chevalier made his notes many, many years ago and probably today we haven't all his notes and all the texts he wrote. 
In the listening the speaker said, that Chevalier after all the night-meetings with Voltaire, he wrote down every word with Voltaire. But this actually means, that we should have all important informations about him an the discussions with Voltaire, because Chavelier wrote all important things he could remember down. 
The text says that Chevalier was a jin Italy and probably some other jailers helped him out of the prison. Today many people think, he did it by himself with a piece of metal. But in the listening there wasn't any information about this piece of metal and this is a bit strange. The Listening just gave the informatin that he got free and that other prisoners had more force than Chevalier had.
