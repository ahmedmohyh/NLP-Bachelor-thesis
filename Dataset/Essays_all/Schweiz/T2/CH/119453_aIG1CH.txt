Chevalier de Seingalt was a very famous person because he could memorize a lot of things very accurate.

He met many famous people and wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures. But there are a lot of critis about the accuracy of his memoir. They even thought that he invented a few events. 
For example while he was in Switzerland he claimed to be very rich but still had to borrowed money from a merchant. But as we heared in the video he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling so while he was waiting for his money to arrive he had to borrow some, that doesn't mean that he was poor.
Critis are also very skeptical about the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. They say it's not possible to remember the conversations between himself and voltaire so accurate because there're many year between the conversation and his stories. But each night after a conversation with Voltair Chevalier wrote everything down he could remember about the conversation.
The third and last critic is about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. He claims that he could escape because of a piece of metal by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critis on the other side claim that this was impossible and he had known a lof of powerful people and it was more likely that they have offered him a bribe. In the video on the other side they say that after he was able to escape out of the notorious prison the ceiling of his "room" had to be replaced. In additon there're were a lot of other people  in the prison who had much more powerful friends in Switzerland and couldn't escape out of the prison.
