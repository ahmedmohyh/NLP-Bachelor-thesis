In the presentation, there were a few points the presenter disagreed with the text. In the first point where Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, she said this doesn't mean he is poor. He might also wait for his money to arrive so he borrowed some money. In the second point the text stated that it's impossible to capute these conversations accurately because it has been written many years after. The presenter said Chevalier took notes every night when he had a conversation with Voltaire. With that being said it might also be that he reffered to them while writing his memoir many years later. In the third point where he escaped a notorious prison in Venice in the text was said that he bribed his way out of the cell. But in that prison where people with even more powerful friends and they couldn't even bribe their way out. Also she mentioned that in a document in Venice, it said that the cell which Chevalier escaped from with a piece of metal needed to be repaired afterwards. If he had bribed his way out he didn't have to break the seal to escape.
