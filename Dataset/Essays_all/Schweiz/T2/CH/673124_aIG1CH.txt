In the text is said that Chevalier wasn`t rich, but that`s false. Chevalier was a walthy man and he had to borrow money because he was gambling and it took a few days to get his money so he borrowed some and so he could have been rich. 

In the text is also said that Chevalier inevented things while writing his memoir because he wrote what he had talkt years with other people befor but he wouldn`t remember that. This is also false because he took notes after he talked to people and so he hadn`t to remember this things while writing his memoir

The third thing that is fals in the text is that the text says that Chevalier isn`t telling the truth about the escape of a prison in Venetian. He is telling the truth that he escaped through the ceiling because in documents of that time is written that they had to repare the ceiling after Chevalier was there.
