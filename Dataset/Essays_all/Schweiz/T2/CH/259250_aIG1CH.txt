The lecturer said that the memoirs of the Chevalier are pretty accurate.

She also said that the Chevalier had to borrow money in Switzerland because he spent so much money at one time he had to wait for his new money to arrive. That gives a good reason for him to borrow money and the arguments of the critics are not good enough.

The lecturer said that the Chevalier said that he wrote down everything he remembered from the conversation with Voltaire. So this conversation really is not that accurate because he could not possibly remember all the things they spoke about.

It was impossible in the prison in Venice to escape through friends who are out of the jail to free them. The lecturer said that in this prison were other prisoners who had even more powerful friends and they did not manage to escape. Also the prison had to repair the ceiling in which the Chevalier made a hole.
