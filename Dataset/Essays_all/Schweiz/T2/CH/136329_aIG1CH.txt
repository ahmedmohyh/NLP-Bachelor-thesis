Chevalier, a well known person from the past, in the presention was said that the critics are crap, because all the critics from the text arent true. 
The first critic is that, when Chevalier was rich, why did he needed to borrow some money? The not proven counter argument was that maybe he needed to sell a few of his things but the money didnt arrive in time so he needed to borrow some. 
The second critic is that Chevalier overhyped his conversations with Voltaire and often lied in the memoirs. But a few people who knew him personally said that he wrote some things down in the night and then he used them again to write them perfectly in the memoir again. 
The last critic is that he didnt escape prison the way he wrote it down, because he had a number of well connected friends in Venice. But in some documents was said that the roof of Chevaliers room needed to be rebuildet after his time there.
