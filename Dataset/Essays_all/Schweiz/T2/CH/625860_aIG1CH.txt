In the presentation, the speacher researched facts to the arguments of the text. So she had a different view in this three point:

First, the Chevailier had to borrow money because when he solt things in his home country, it took a while up until the money was in Switzerland. In the text, they said that he coudn't be rich because he had to borrow money.

Second, Chevalier wrote, that he did some notes after the evening with Voltaire, also he could remember the evening very well. In the text they did'nt write nothing about notes.

Third and last point is, that others in the prison had much powerful friends than Chevalier, but they coudn't get sold free. Alos Chevalier coudn't get sold free by his firends like they wrote in the text and so he had to escape. It is also written in a document of the old Staat Venice that they had to repaire the room of Chevalier after his escape.

Finaly, a big part of the memoir is true as every time the remembering of things in the past is.
