The lady holding the lecture started with saying that no memorie can possibly be truely true, but they are reliable source. She picked up the three examples given in the text and gave further explanations about the historical backround. Critics doubted the accuracy of the memoires because of the Chevalier inventing facts and situations. They claimed that the Chevalier couldn't possibly be that rich, if he needed to borrow money. The woman spoke up against this critic explaining that the Chevalier would have needed to borrow money because he wasn't liquid and converting his assets into money needed time. 
An other critic to his memoire is that he could not be able to remeber each word of a conversation after years. But the Chevalier is said to have been writing down each night the conversation he had before in a notebook and during writing his memoires he consulted them. 
The last critic about hes escape from prison claiming that hes jailers would have been bribed can be shut down by the information in an venetian document writing that the ceiling of his cell needed to be repared after his evasion. 
The purpose of the lecture was to prove the critics about the Chevalier wrong.
