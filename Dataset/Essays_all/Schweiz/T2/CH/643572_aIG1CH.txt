In the presentation the woman said that it is practically impossible to have a memoire that is totaly accurate but the one of the Chevalier de Seingalt is pretty accurate. There are many critics to this theory as we can read in the text. But the arguments mentioned in the text that claim to prove that the memoirs are not very accurate can be explained.
The first argument claims that the Checalier was not rich and whealthy during his time he lived in Switzerland because he had to borrow money from a merchant every once in a while. This can be explained by the fact that if you gamble a lot it is possible to be out of liquid money. He then would have to sell some of his things frist in order to get money again. But because he needed it fast, he lent it from a merchant and paid it back as soon as he was able to. 
The second point critics are skeptical about are the conversations with Voltaire mentioned in the memoirs. They claim that because he wrote them many years after the actual conversations with Voltaire, Chevalier could not possibly remeber all of the exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier. But it is a known fact that Chevalier took notes very often and reffering to them while writing his memoir. It is said to be a fact that he used to take notes of conversations after he had them, including the ones he had with Voltaire.
The last thing critics question is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. While critics claim that he had powerful friends that bribed him free, others mention the fact that there were other people in the same prison as Chevalier who had far more important and powerful friends that never got bribed out of prison. Furthermore, there is a report that mentions that the ceiling of the prison cell Chevaliers was captured in had to be repaired soon after he had escaped. This leads to the convlusion that e indeed made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and managed to climb through the roof.
