We heard that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt isn't totally correct, but it's as correct as a memoir can be. The three stories we heard of his memoir are criticized in the text but in the audio we hear another story. He had to borrow money when he was in Switzerland, because sometimes he received his money later than he selled something. He borrowed money, but he was rich, sometimes he only hadn't the money at the moment when he wanted to give a party. He waited for his money to arrive and paid the borrowed money back to the borrower.
In his second story Chevalier shows us a conversation he had with Voltaire. The criticants say that he can't know what they talked about many years later, so he has to have invented some stuff. He couldn't know the proper words or phrases they used, but as it's said later he wrote down his conversation with Voltaire right after their conversation. He had some notes with which he could rebuild the conversation, what they talked about and how they talked about it. Chevalier didn't lie, he knew exactly what they talked about.
In the third story we know he wrote about his escape of the prison in Venice. Criticans say that he couldn't escape like this, all on his own, he had to have other jailers to help him. But we know that it has to be true what Chevalier says, because after his heroical escape with a piece of metal, the prison had to repair the ceiling and the roof where his "room" was. 
We know now that the memoir of Chevalier included this three special stories and we know that the opinions about it are different. The Parties in Switzerland, the conversation with Voltaire and the escape from the prison happend, but how exactly we'll never know...
