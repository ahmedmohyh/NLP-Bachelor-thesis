The accuracy of the memoir of the Chevalier has been repeatedly doubted. The most commen critics concern following three points.
-his whealth, because he had borrowed  considerable sums of money from a swiss merchant
-his conversation with Votaire, because they were written down many years later
-his escape from prison in Venice, due to the unlikelyhood of the story and his connection to important politics in Venice

However, their are valid proof and arguments that above-mentioned critics are not correct. 
For example, the borrowing does not necessarily mean that the Chevalier was poor. It much more indicates that he owned property, which takes time to sell. While waiting for his money, the Chevalier had to borrow money to finance his expensive parties and gambling activities. 

Calling a record of conversations which was written down many years after the actual conversation inaccurate sounds reasonable. But the Chevalier claims to have written down the details of the conversations he had with Voltaire each night. This would allow him to recall the conversations very precisely, even years later. In addition, several person hav witnessed that the Chevalier used notes to write his memoir.

Finally, his escape of the prison through the ceiling. We know that soon after his escape, the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired. Why if it was not damaged by the Chevalier's escape? Furthermore, there were other prisoners with much more important friends in Venice and they did never manage to escape. An escape through bribing the guards seem therefore unlikely.

The end, the Chevalier's memoir seems to be even more accurate than expected.
