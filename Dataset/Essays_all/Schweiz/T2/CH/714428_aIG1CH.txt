Chevalier de Seingalt was thought to be a quite inaccurate man when it comes to his memoires. However, there is now new evidence which could prove, that the actions he describes in his memoires were real all along. The text describes how the Chevalier claimed to be rich but used to borrow money in Switzerland. This is countered by the presenter with the fact, that the Chevalier wasn't poor but needed to sell property in order to turn it into cash. While he would be waiting for his money to arrive, he would borrow money that he was going to pay back after he reeived his own. Another claim is, that the conversations which took place between the Chevalier and Voltaire aren't accurately written down. This argument is debunked by the fact, that the Chevalier used notes from the conversations quite frequenly when he wrote them down. The third accusation is, that the Chevalier claimed to have escoped from a venician prison, even though he had just bribed the guards in order for them to let him out of prison. However, there is proof that the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired after he got out of prison which strengthens his own story, in which he said that he escaped the prison through the roof. The presenter also says that the memoires of the CChavalier aren't by any chance, completely true but that there might be a lot more truth in them, than we expected.
