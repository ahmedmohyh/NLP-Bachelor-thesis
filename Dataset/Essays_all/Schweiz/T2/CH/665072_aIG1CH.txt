     The lecture points out that many of the points stated in the text can be interpreted in multiple ways. They also mention, that it is nearly impossible to write a completely correct memoir, and regardig the historical background they seem to be rather accurate. 

     The first point they make is, that just because the Chevalier had to lend money, doesn't mean, that he was poor. They said, that he received his money not immediately after finishing a job for his clients. Therefore there were days, when he wanted to gamble, but his money hadn't arrived yet. So he had tolend money. He could have very well been walthy.

     The critics also say, that his conversations with Voltaire couldn't possibly be accurate, as they had been written, years after the conversations happened. However in the lecture they state, that the Chevalier had wrote down all the conversations immediatly after talking to Voltaire. And that he used them during the writing of his memoir. It has been confirmed, that the Chevalier had notes which he used as reference for his memoir. So the accuracy seems to be fine regarding this point.

     Lastly the critics point out the fact, that his escape from the prison in Venice had been writen down more adventerous then it actually had beeen. They think, that he escaped by bribering the jailers to free him. This however seems less possible, as there were even more powerful beings andeven they weren't able to free themselves usingbribery. The lecture also points out, that there are recordings of the prison, stating that there was a hole in one of the ceilings of a cell. This would indicate us, that the story the Chevalier told, might actually be somewhat true.

     The text jumps to conclusions very fast. The lecture however tries to use as many fact as possible. Therefpore it seems, that the memoirs might actually bepretty accurate.
