At the beginning of the spoken presentation it was mentioned that memoires cannot be correct in every  detail but that Chevalier's is a reliable historical source about the European society. The writing tells us that some critics have the opinion that many events are dostorted or invented in his memoires to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. The female speaker explained afterwards why to borrow money does not mean poor as he is shown in the text. If Chevalier needed money he needed to sell his things. It took some time (around three days) till he recived the money he deserved for his sold item. During this time he still needed some money to survive and borrowed it from others till he got his money. Lastly she explained why his prison escape could have happend as told in the memoire. What speaks against that the jailers were bribed to free him as mentioned in the text that it is known that there were some prisoners with better connection to high ranked persons in the society who were not able to get freed out of the prision. It is aswell proven that his cell lock was exchanged some days after his escape date. There is not another reason to exchange it than the one that is told with the escape in Chevalier's memoire.
