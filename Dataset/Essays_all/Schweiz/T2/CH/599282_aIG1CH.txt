The memoirs of Chevalier are pretty accurat. For example he had to get a loan because his wealth was not just in money but also for example in goods, and to get this money it needs time. Thus until the money arrived he had to borrow money. This clearly does not display that he was pour. Secondly after he spoke with Voltaire he wrote down their conversations. He even mentions in his memoirs that he took notes after he spoke with Voltaire. Finally his escape from prison is resonable because in prison there were a lot of other people with even more influencel friends and they did not escape. And after his escape there are records that the celling of Chevalier`s cell had to be repaired, and this cleary displays that the escape was likley.
