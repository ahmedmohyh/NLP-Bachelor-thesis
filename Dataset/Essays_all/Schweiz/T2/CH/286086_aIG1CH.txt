Chevalier de Seingalt, a very smart guy who wrote even daily a memoir. Some people argue about that he faked a lot of his events which he wrote in his memoir, to make his life seem more exciting. But theese people missbelieve, because in fact, he wrote every day in his memoir, and everything he wrote in there, really happened. Another point is, that a lot of people think he was really poor, but he wasn't poor at all. He lend the money from others to make parties or gamble around, but he did this in cause of he had to wait for his money arrive. On the other hand, he escaped the jail in venice, and a lot of critics mean that he had help from friends. But the other prisoners had a stronger and even bigger amount of friends in venice and they never succeeded to escape the jail, but Chevalier did. Finally the critics also think, the escape out of the ceiling by using a piece of metal is nice to read but didn't happen in reality. So why the workers in the prison had to repair his ceiling after he had escaped?
In conclusion,my opinion is, that there is always something to critizise in a  life of a human being. But we should better concentrate on our own lifes, and don't complain about others what they did in their life and what they could have done better.
