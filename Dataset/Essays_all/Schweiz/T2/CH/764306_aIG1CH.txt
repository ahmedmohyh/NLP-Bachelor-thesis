The text is very critical. There are mentioned some points why the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt can't e accurate. It is written that Chevalier invented many events and they show reasons why it can't be true what he wrote in his memoir recounting his life and adventures.

In the listening, the woman said that it is true that the memoir can't be correct in detail. But the stories about the life of Chevalier are a reliable historic source. The woman was able to give reasons why it isn't true that the events or conversations which are part of the memoir are distorted or invented.

In the text it is wrtitten that Chevalier lived in Switzerland as a poor man because he borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. This argument isn't true said the woman because Chevalier spent a lot of money for example for parties. She said that it is true, he borrowed money but only because he had to wait for the arriving of his own money. 

The next point where the text isn't comparable whit the listening is where it says that Chevalier couldn't be able to write down a whole conversation between himself and Voltaire. The cricital point about the accuracy of the conversation was that Chevalier wrote down the conversation many years after it occured and it's impossible to remember excat phrases. The woman said clearly that it would be impossible if it was like this. But Chevalier wrote down everthing at the same evening he had de conversation with Voltaire. He consulted notes in his whole life.

The last critical point is that Chevlier claims to have escaped from the Venetian prison by using metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The text said that it was possible because he had well-connected friends in Venice. The woman in the listening said that there were other men which had more connections and why should the sealing had to be repaired after his escape if he could flee because of the help of his friends?
