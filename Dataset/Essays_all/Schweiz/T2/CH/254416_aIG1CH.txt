It was disdussed wheter the Chevalier`s de Seingalt memoires where true or not.
The text is critical about the accuracy of his moemoires and claims that there might be a lot of details invented by the Chevalier to make his memoires more attractive, like the fact that while living in Switzerland he was very rich thus he had been lending money from a swiss merchant or that he even met Voltaire. Even that he escaped a venetian prison by making a hole in the roof with a piece of metal.
The presentation held by a woman states the there is enough evidence that those memoires are accurately true. The chevalier was really wealthy. Therefore he had to convertd his assets to money what means that taking a loan doesn`t mean being poor. His conversation with Voltaire are another true point as sources who knew the chevalier state that he always noted down what he talked about or learned during a conversation.
The heroic and adventure like prison escaped wasn`t a fake neither. Venetian documents state that after the Chevalier`s escape, his cell`s roof had to be repaired.
