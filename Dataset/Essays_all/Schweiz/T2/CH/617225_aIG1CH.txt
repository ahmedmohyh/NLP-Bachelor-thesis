In the presentation was mentioned that the critics maybe aren't right. First of all they said that no memory could be perfect.But memories from the past are important, because today they give us an idea how things in the past has happend. The first  argument the presentation gave was the one that the chevalier didn't have to be poor just becasue he borrowed money. Maybe he had to borrow money first because for partying and gambling you need some. Later he won a lot a became rich because of his wins. Furthermore it was mentioned that the critics are also wrong with their opinion, the Chevalier couldn't have remember every single word he talked about with Voltaire. Obviously the Chevalier took notes after the converation with Voltaire and that is the reason why he could remember exact phrases  after sverel years. The last argument which was mentioned was about the escape from the prison in Italy. Actually there were several incidents where other prisoners escaped as well. There exsist also an document in which is written, that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape. When there hadn't been any demolitions in the ceiling the prison hadn't have to repair it. The presentation was all about the critic which was mentioned  in the text, because they give for every critics a logical explanation.
