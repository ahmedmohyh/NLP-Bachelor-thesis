In the reading the Chevalier is shown as a controversial figure and the text depends to say that he's a liar.

The first thing mentionned is his stay in Switzerland. The reading says that he had to borrow money and wasn't as rich as he claimed to be. But the hearing says that it doesn't mean that he is poor just because he had to borrow the money. Maybe he made money out of some business and he had to wait until his money arrived.

The second thing was his conversation with the writer Voltaire. The reading distrusts again the exact memoir of Chevalier. They say that it is not possible to remember every phrase so many years ago. The hearing on the other hand says that there were witnesses who confirmed the statements and conversation of Chevalier and Voltaire.

The last thing was his escape from jail in Venice. The hearing thinks that the escape isn't true because no one would probably repair the hole in the ceiling if someone like Chevalier escaped and he had no friends to help him. The reading says that the escape through the ceiling was not possible but it could have been that political friends helped him out of jail and that they offered a bribe.

The reading doubts more on the memoir of Chevalier than the hearing does but both of them aren't really convinced from the great memoir and life of Chevalier.
