Let's start with the first point in the presentation. The woman mentioned the memoir of Chevalier first and there she said that the memoir indeed is pretty accurate, eventhough some critics claim the opposite. She also mentioned the monetary situation of Chevalier. The Chevalier never actually was poor, he just had to borrow some money after he invested the rest, eventually the Chevalier was not poor.

The second point is that Chevalier allways transferred the conversations with Voltaire in his memoir immediately after the meetings and not like the text claims years later. 

The last point describes the escape from the prison. The text says that Chevalier probably had the guards bribedand that Chevalier had well-connected friends all over Venice but actually other inmates had even better friends but they did not bribe the guards. Chevalier probably had never bribed anybody but rather escaped from the ceiling of his cell.
