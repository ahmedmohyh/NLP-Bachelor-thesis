Both text were almost the same.Both thext are about the chevelar.but there are some different thems to them.
Both text are saying that the chevalier is not poor and historically important.The second texts says also that he escapaed from the prison. but in a different way.The chavalier was wealthy because of different reasons. the chandalier changed his things to money. But the chandalier from this text spend his money. becaus of gambling and  parties.Cant remember the audio sorry.
