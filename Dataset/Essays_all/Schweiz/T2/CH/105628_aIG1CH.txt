The Chevalier was indeed very wealthy. He had to sell his old assets to get to money but and this takes its time just because he borrowed money before he had it doesn't mean that he wasn't wealthy. Rich people may also take loans. And about the conversations the Chevalier had with the famous french writer Voltaire. People say that one can't possibliy remember a conversation one has had years ago, but the Chevalier wrote down each conversation he had with Voltaire that very evening and kept them over the yeas, which makes the documented conversations pretty accurate. And last but not least his escape from a Venice prison. Some say that he couldn't possibly have gone trough the hole he made in the ceiling with a metal bar. They say that one of his powerful frieds he had there bribed him out of there. But it doesn't have to be true. Because some other inmates had even more powerful friend who could have bribed the jailers. And sooon after the escape the prison had the ceiling of the Chevaliers cell repaired. Why would they do that if he hadn't escaped through the ceiling.
