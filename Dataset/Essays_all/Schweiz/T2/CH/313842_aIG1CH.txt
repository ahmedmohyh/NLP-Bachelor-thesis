In this Eassy I will show, why the arguments of the presentation about the Chevalier are different to the arguments of the Text. 

The first argument in the presentation said that the Chevalier had to borrow money because he cant just join the rich ones of Switzerland after one day. And borrowing money isnt a symbol for beeing poor. But the text argues that he cant have borrowed money, because than he wasnt rich. The second theme we have to look at, is the conversation of Chevalier and Voltaire. In the Text the say, that this conversation cant be wroten down by truth, because CHevalier took notes many years later. But the presentation argues, that the notes have already been taken while the conversation. The third theme talkes about the escape of Chevalier. The memoirs of Chevalier said that he escaped by destroing the ceiling, but Critics claim that it was more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him. The human in the presenation argues, that his sailing was destroied and so the memoirs of Chevalier cant be true.
