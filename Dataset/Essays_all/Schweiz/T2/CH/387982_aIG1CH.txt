Chevalier lived in the eighteen century and he met many famous people in his life. His memoir has become a very valuable historical source. But now there are some critics and they raised doubts about the memoir of Chevalier. He is been claimed that he invented some events to make his life more interesting and glamourous. The first point is while spending his time in Switzerland Chevalier was extremly rich and he gave a lot of money for gambling and parties away. Some people are sure that he must have borrowed some money. Because if he were rich why would he have needed to steel money. The second critic point is how did he know every detail of the conversation he had years before with Voltaire. Nobody doubeted that he had this conversation. The people are just skeptical how could he have  remembered every sentence and phrase which they shared to eachother. The third point that escaped from a jail in Venice. Here it is written down that he had many well-connected friends but in the audio she said that the other prisoners had more friends than himself. So they could have escaped too but they didn't. After some years the people there had to rebuild one place. But why had they rebuild this when Chevalier didn't escaped from jail. That's one clue that this might be true.
