First they explained that Chevalier had not to be poor just because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. They explained the money borrowing with the possibility that the richness of Chevalier was not in bare money. It could been in gold or some other very worthfull things. And he had to made these things first to money and until he had this money, he had to borrow some from the merchant. Now this is against the text because they say that if he was rich then he would not have borrowed the money. Second they explained that the conversation of Chevalier and Voltaire was accurate and not fake with the fact that Chevalier always looked up in old notes and journals from him. They said it would have had wittnesses of that. As contrast the text says it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years earlier. Third they explained the story of Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice with saying that also the more rich persons in this prison could'nt bribe them free so why should he have the ability to do that. Also they said that the prison had to repair the ceiling short after the escape of Chevalier what supports Chevaliers story. This also is against the text because in the text they say that such an escape is enjoyable to read but not really true.
