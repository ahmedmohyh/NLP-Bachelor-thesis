The text includes three points of Chevalier's live which the lecture refers to. 
The first one is the time he spent in Switzerland. There he was a rich merchant like he said. We know that he spent a lot of money in parties and gambling. Even though we are told in the text that he always had to borrow money. In the lecture we learn that it's normal for a merchant to borrow some money because he alwys has to wait for his money.
The second point is his relationship with Voltaire and what he wrote later on about it. The text tells us that is true that they met but that their conversations which have been recorded later on by Chevalier could not reflect the truth because  it's impossible for Chevalier to remember all those words from such a long time ago. In contrast the lecture claims that all the things the Chevalier wrote about his relationship with Voltaire were true because he took notices every night after he talked to Voltaire. When he wrote the memoir he consulted the notes.
His third adventure was his  from the prsion in Venice. In his memoir he wrote that he used a piece of metal to make a hole into the ceiling of his cell and then climbed through the roof. The lecture thinks that this is possibily true because after he left the cell we know that the ceiling of the cell had to be repared. To the version of the text, that he just bribed a jailer to free him, they hold against that there were prisoners with much more powerful friends, but they couldn't escape from the prison. So his story with the roof is quiet likely.
