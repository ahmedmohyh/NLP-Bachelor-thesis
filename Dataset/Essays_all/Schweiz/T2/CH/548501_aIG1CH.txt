Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life especially his experiences. But no memoir can be correct in each detail so it has maybe some faults in it.

By the time he lived in the Swiss he sayd he was wealthy but the critics sayd that he was poor because he had to borrow some money. In fact he was making money and also spend a lot on parties so he had to wait until the money arrived and in this case he borrowed some money and repaid it afterwards. 

To the conversations with Voltaire: Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered right after the conversation with him so maybe he forgot somehing to tell but the fact he wrote it down immediatly after the comversation says that it has to be true. 

He wasn't the first one who escaped from a prison and also the ceiling had to be repaired so this is a hint that he has made a hole in it. The Chevalier had well-connected friends but they didn't help him with his escape.
