In the presentation the woman tooks about Chevalier's memoires and how we can know that they are almost accurate. She talks about three points which are also mentioned in the text. Firstly she tooks about why Chevalier had to borrow money during his stay in Switzerland. She claims that he was not poor but he just had his money spent in material things. To get this money he firstly had to sell the goods which needed time. To overcome this time he had to borrow the money for a short time. This is in a strong contrast with the text, where it is stated that Chevalier, not as written in his memoir, was a poor man, because he did not always had cash available and had to borrow money.Secondly she tooks about the conversations Chevalier had with Voltage. In the text it said that the conversation as described in the memoir can not be absolutly accurate, because he wrote them years after it. But she describes that after every conversation Chevalier had with Voltage, he sat down and wrote down what he could remember from the talk they had. He kept all this notes for many years until he published them years later. The third point is about the escape of Chevlaier from a prison in Venice. The talker believes that the escape of Chevalier happened the way he describes it in his memoir, so he escaped through the roof just using a metall to make a hole in it. But in the text it is written that this is not really possible, mostly likely he just had powerful friend, who freed him. The contraargument the speaker gives for that is that shortly after his escape the roof of his old prison room had to fixed, so it is likely that he escaped this way. The other point she states is that there where other people inpriosened with much mor powerful friends who were not able to be freed.
