In the presentation about the memoir of the Chevalier. three points about the memoir and the accuracy of it are made. First of all it is doubet from people that Chevalier was a whealthy man while living in Switzerland because borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant, but that is because the Chevalier had to sell his goods first in order to make money so he had to borrow money to buy the goods then he sold them and paid the money back.
The second statment was that the quotations of the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire are fake. It is in no doubt that Chevalier and Voltaire met and spoke to eachother. The reason why the quotations are true is that Chevalier wrote down everything the two talked about afterwards. He also keept these documents for a long time, so it's not absurd that these quotations are accurate.
The third argument of the presentation was about his escape of the prison. Haters said that Chevalier escaped the prison with help of his powerful friends and bribery. But first of all there were inmates with even more powerful friends who couln't escape and second there is a government document which shows that the roof of the prison had to be renewed just weeks later.
