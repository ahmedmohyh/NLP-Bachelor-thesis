This essay is aboout comparing to diffrent opinions about the memoir of Chevalier. 
The audio and the text have diffrent opintions about the rightness of Chevaliers memoir. The audio thinks that it's pretty relabeble and the text is a critic.

The three points which are broght up are: Switzerland, his friend Voltaire and his escape from the prison.

While the text says that he was poor whilst he lived in Switzerland the woman in the audio tells us that he just had to borrow this amount of money to get over the rounds while he waited to sell his house. Switzerland was never really cheap. And his partylive was expensive. 

In his memoir he wrote a conversation down from him and his freind Voltair. The text thinks, that it can not be possible to write an exact dialogue from a converstaion he had yers before he wrote the book. On the other side the reccording says that he took notes during his lieftime as well as he wrote journals and refered to them later on wehn he wrote the memoir.

And the 3. point is the escape from a prison in Venice. While the text makes the point that the jailers were birbed to free him form Chevaliers politically well-connected friends, the audio has a total diffrent opinion about it. They bring up that the sealing of his room had to be repaird after his stay. So why should somebody repair a sealing if he didn't escaped the way he wrote.
