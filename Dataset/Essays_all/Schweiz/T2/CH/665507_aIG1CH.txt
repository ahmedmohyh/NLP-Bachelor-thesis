Chevalier was a man who wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. Many people doubt that the events in his life happend like he wrote them in his memoir. Such a memoir cannot be 100 percent correct but hes is still pretty accurate and reliable. Chevalier wrote that during his time in Switzerland he was very wealthy and spent a lot of money on parties and gamling. But he had to borrow money. This was not because he lied and was actually poor but because he did not have liquid money. He first had to sell some of his properties to get  liquid money to spend.

He had many conversations with Voltaire which seem to be written down too accurate. In fact, Chevalier made notes right after the conversations and stored them for many years. Later he used these notes to write them down in his memoir. Without the help of those notes he would not have been able to remember the conversations so exactly.

Chevalier was once in a notorious prison in Venice from which he escaped. In his memoir he claimed that he made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. Critics claim that it is more likely that he`s jailers were bribed to free him. But there were people in prison with even more influence than he had and they did not escape. After his escape the ceiling of the cell had to be repaired which is a solid evidence that he somehow destroyed the ceiling and escaped like this.
