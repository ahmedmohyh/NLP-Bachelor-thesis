In the presentation it sais that it would not be possible to have such an accurate memoir then Chevalier had it. He wrote every day in the evening the happenings of the day down, he still could have remembered. Chevalier liked parties and gabling, within he spent a lot of money. Some people said the he would have been poor, because he borrowed always money from other people. But if some borrows money he isn't poor. Chevalier alsow told other people that he escaped from the prison in Venice. He buried a way through the roof. Critics doubted that, but a short time later, the prison had to rebuild the ceeling of Chevaliers cell. That is a big evidence, that what he said was trough. 
But in the text they say that this story about climbing through the ceeling would just be enjoyable to read, but it would just be a lie. Chevalier escaped with the help of other big numbers of politicaly well-conected friends in Venice he knowed. Also the text sais that if someone would be rich, he would not have to burrow money, so Chevalier had to be poor.
