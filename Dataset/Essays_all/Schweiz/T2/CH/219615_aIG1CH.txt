A woman having a presentation about Chevalier in front of students tells us how to explain the memoir of Chevalier.

In the text about Chevalier is written that Chevalier was very wealthy but did borrow money. Although Chevalier had a lot of money, he didn't have all of it with himself. So he had to wait for his money to arrive and the time between he spent his last money and the new money, he had to borrow some. 

The second thing that is written in the text is that Chevalier never had met Voltaire because he remembers the converations between them accurately, years after having them. The explanation for this is that Chevalier was known for writing down notes about his conversations. Perhaps after the conversation with Voltaire, Chevalier went home and wrote down what they talked about. 

The last thing that is written in the text is, that Chevalier escaped from a notorious prison in Venice, but it seems more likely that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. The explanation for this is that weeks after he escaped from the prison the sealing has been repared. It could be that the sealing was old and broken and Chevalier could escape.
