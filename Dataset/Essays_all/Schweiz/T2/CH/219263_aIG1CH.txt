The Chevallier memoir is a very accurate source of historic information. While the text states that there are parts of his writing thaat seemto describe a more interesting story than what actually should have occured, the speech contradicts all of the texts examples. The loans that Chevaliier hat to assume during his time in sitzerland had to do wit the low liquidity of his assets and that he often needed his fortunes before they could be cashed out. Since he still owned his fortunes worth in other assets, he could not be considered poor, just out of cash. His detailed conversations with Voltaire are also an aspect of the memoir that the text criticizes, by assuming that a memory of a spoken conversation can not be accurate after many years. What the text fails to take into account are the notes that Chevallier supposedly took after every meeting with Voltaire. While writing his memoir whitnesses tell us that he consulted personal annotations to complete his work. 
The third point the text makes concern his heroic escape of the venetian prison. The composers of the text seem to believe that he must have been let out due to bribery. Yet he is the only convict who manages to leave the institute before his time was up. Plenty of other inmates also had benifitial contacts in Venice, but none were able to leave. Another hint leads the speaker to think that hi story about climbing through the ceiling: After his escape repairs were needed in his cell. 
The text gives reason to believe that the memoir is flawful but the speaker proves these examples to be misleading.
