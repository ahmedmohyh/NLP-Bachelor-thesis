The person in the listening exercise had three main arguments against the critics complaints that the information in Chevaliers memoirs are inaccurate or wrong.

First she argumented, that taking a loan from a swiss merchant does not mean that he was poor. in his business he often had to wait several days until he received his money. Therefore he had to take small loans (of a million dollars) during the time he was low on money.

Also, she said that the accuracy of his discussions with Voltaire in his memoirs come from him, writing down every discussion the two had. He did that each night the two were talking, wich is weird. If someone did that to me I'd change my name and leavethe country. Kinda crazy isn't it?

Her third argument, on the critics claim that his escape was through a bribe and not through the ceiling, was that a bribery was very improbable due to something. Also, apparently after his escapethe ceiling in his cell had to be repaired, which supports the thesis that he fled in that way. But, if I was the jailer who got bribed I would damage the roof and say that he fled through it, to not raise any suspicion on me. Just saying.
