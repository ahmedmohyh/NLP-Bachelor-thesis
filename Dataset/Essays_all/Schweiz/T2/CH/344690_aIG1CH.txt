The text about the memoir of "The Chevalier" states that its perfect accuracy makes his book seem doubtful, as no memoir can be written with such specific memories, which led to a lot of critics.
On the other hand, a lecture given on this memoir defends it using different arguments to state the truth and make it seem reliable. 
One point of discussion are the conversations with Voltaire the writer recalls, which seem to be perfectly remembered in exact phrases. The lecture contradicts this argument saying that, in fact, Chevalier wrote everything down in a journal after meeting his friend, which is said to be confirmed by witnesses. 
Another doubtful subject is Chevaliers description of his wealthy way of living during his years in Switzerland, while evidence surfaced that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. However, the recording defends the fact that it is possible by saying that he too had to start somewhere, and this loan does not make him a poor guy.
The most discussed subject of this memoir though is his escape froma prison in Venice, Italy, which he presumably had done by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say that he must have bribed the jailers to free him. While this could have been a believable option, the lecture acknowledges the fact that he was not the only one in that prison with well-connected friends and money, which makes it seem weird that only Chavelier would have thought about that option. However, some old venician government documents have made for a pretty good argument for his presumable escape, as they show evidence stating that a ceiling has had to be repaired during that time in prison. 
The memoir may seem too precise, and critics may claim a lot of the facts had been invented, but the lecture contradicts this using reasonable arguments that speak for the realness of his memories.
