The presentation gives us arguments for the accuracy of the memoir and that it is not written to make the Chevaliers life seem moreexciting and glamorous than it really was.

In the presentation it is explained that while living in Switzerland the Chevalier needed to borrow money because he had to wait for his own money which he invested. So he was not poor and lived a wealthy life exactly how he described it in his memoir. 

Secondly the text claims that he could not remember the exact conversations he had with Voltaire years ago. But in the presentation we hear that there are some sources that he wrote those conversationd down the evenings after they took place. And used the notes by writing his emoir.

There are two arguments, that Chevalier really escaped the Venetian prison with climbing thought the roof. First the there is a historical source that the prisons ceiling needed to be fixed which leads to the part that he made a hole in the it. Further on there were many other men in the prison with more ore higher politically well-connected friendswith should helped them to come free.
