Nowadays there is a heated debate among historians wheter the memoir of Chevalier is reliable and accurate. By comparing two sources, a text passage and a presentation, two different viewpoints are outlined. 

Firstly, the text passage considers the memoir of Chevalier as mostly untrue and made up to some extent. In comparison, the presentation sees it as a historical and reliable source of information. On the one hand, the text states that Chevalier was not as rich as  it is thought since he borrowed lots of money. On the other hand, the presentation explains this by saying that Chevalier did not have much cash as he spent it straigth away and when he ran out of it he borrowed more. However, he owned an immense property. By selling and buying, it is said that he made a fortune.

Secondly, the presentation contradicts the text by argumenting that he did not escape the prison by bribing the jailers as there were even more powerful people in the prison that couldn't flee by that manner. Moreover, the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape, supporting the fact that he escaped in that way.

Lastly, the text states that Chevalier couldn't have remembered teh exact phrases of their conversations, despite the assumption that he might have taken notes. This is exactly what the presentation expresses, by taking notes he was able to reconstruct the discussions accurately.

In consideration of all the facts it is clear that these two sources have completely different opinions on an issue that will never be fully resolved.
