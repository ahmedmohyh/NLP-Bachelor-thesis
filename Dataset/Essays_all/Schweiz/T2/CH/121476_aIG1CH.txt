Chevalier de Seingalt created a big histroical source - a long memoir about his life and adventures. There are three specific point to talk about: First, the length from the mergant. Chevalier was rich and went to many partys, but he borrowed money from people, so the maybe was not so rich. Second, the conversation with Voltaire. He wrote the sentences form the conversations down from the memoir after many years, so they could not be so accurate anymore. Critics thought that the conversation with Voltaire took place but that the memoir wasn't good enough to remember every single sentence. Third, the escape from the prison in Venice. He escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics said that the escape makes the book enjoyable to read but in truth he had a few well-connected friends in Venice. There were many ciritcs in Chevaliers life.
