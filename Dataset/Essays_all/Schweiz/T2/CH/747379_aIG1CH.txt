In the text they claim that not all of the events of Chevalier's life, how it's written in his memoir, are correct. In the presentation however they come up with some arguments which prove, that Chevalier did write the truth. At the time he was in Switzerland he made his money by selling his property first.It took some time until he received the money for it. In the meantime he maybe had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant but that doesn't mean that he was entirely poor.
Even though he wrote his memoir long time after the conversations with Voltaire, it is known that he kept journals and personal notes everytime they spoke to eachother. This means he could simply take out his previous notes and use them in his memoir which states, that everything he wrote down about the conversations must be true.
After he had broken out of the prison in Venice, documentations say that the ceiling of his prison room had to be repared. There's no point to that if he hadn't broken out of it by making a hole into the ceiling. Another aspect to this is, that many of his friends who were way more influentional and had better connections in the prison than he did, couldn't get out of there in any way.
