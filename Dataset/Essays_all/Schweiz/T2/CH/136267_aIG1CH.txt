In the text, a alot of critics claim, that the memoir of this Chevalier are not accurate. It's true that a memoir can't be accurate in every detail, but when you look at the past, you can finde some detail, wich make this memoir accurate. 
The first point: his loan. It is known that a Chevalier in the 18th century spent a lot of money at parties and had a very wealthy life. But still, he had to borrow some money because in this century it took a while until they got their loan. So he had to borrow money, until his loan arrived but that doesn't mean he wasn't rich. 
The second point: Voltaire. Critics claim, that the memoir cannot capure these conversations accuately, because it was writtern many years ater the conversations occured. But in fact, the Chevalier wrote down each conversation he had with Voltare in the night, a coversation between these two took place. He just held back these notes for years.
The third point: Prison escape. During the time the Chevalier was prisoned in Venice, there were a lot of people with more politically well-connected friends than he had. So it can be possible, that he really escaped from prison because why should somebody help him, if there were people with more important connections? There's also the fact, that after the time he spent in his prison room, they had to repaire the ceiling. So if he didn't escaped through the roof, why did they have to repaire the ceiling?
