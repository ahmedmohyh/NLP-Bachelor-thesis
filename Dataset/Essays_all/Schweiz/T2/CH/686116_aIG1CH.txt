This essay will examine the summarize the most important points of the lecture and will show to what extent they contradict the text above.

Firstly, the text claims that, when the Cevalier de Seingalt lived in Switzerland, he borrowed a lot of money, and could not have spent the amount of money on gambling and party, as his memoires claimed he did. The lecture says that those points do not have to contradict each other. Sometimes, the Chevalier had to wait for the money he has earned to arrive. As soon as the money arrived, he could pay back his debts.

Another arguument of the text is that a lot of conversation mentioned in his memoires happenedcd a long time before he wrote down his memoires, and therefore could not be wrote down accurately. On the other hand, the lecture claims that the Chevalier used to write notes shortly after he held his conversations, and that he was refering to them in his memoires. Thus, it can be said that the conversations were written down accurately.
The last point to which the text refers is his escape from the prison. The text claims that the spectacular escape about which the Chevailer wrote was a hoax, and that his friends in Venice might have helped him to get out of the prison. The lecture contradicts this point, claiming that none of the Chevalier's friends have been released. Furthermore, it claimes that sources indicate that the ceiling of the Chevailier's room has to be repared shortly after he left the prison. This again indicates that the Chevailier's escape might actually have happened.

In conclusion it can be said that the text claims a lot, which can be misinterpreted in another way. It is important to look at as many sources as possible.
