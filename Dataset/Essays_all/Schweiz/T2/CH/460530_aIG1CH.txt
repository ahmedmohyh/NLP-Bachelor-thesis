The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoire about his life. According to the oral presentation there are no doubts about its objectivity. But in the article I read the author presents several aspects why the memoire can't be completely honest.
First of it is argued that Chevalier wasn't a rich man because he had to borrow money. But anyway in the presentation is said the he had had to invest first and then he became a wealthy man.
Secondly the in oral presentation it was talked about the presentation with Voltaire. According to the presentation Chevalier collected some notes the first night after the conversation and years later he wrote about it basing himself on his notes. On this aspect the article disagrees with the presentation. The article doesn't mention the notes. Furthermore it is argued that the conversation must be invented because it has been wrote years later but contents anyway exact phrases.
Also Chevalier's escape from the prioson of Venice is controversial. In the presentation it was said, that he broke out. Then his seeling has been repaired. The article doubts the heroic escape from the prison and says that probably someone just let Chevalier escape.
