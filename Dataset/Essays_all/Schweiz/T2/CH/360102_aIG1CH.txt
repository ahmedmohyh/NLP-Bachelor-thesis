The woman speaking does obviously not agree with the person, who wrote the text. While the text critises the memoir Chevalier wrote the woman claims that the memoir is very accured and relieable. The text mentions three different points in the memoir which are according to the text untrue. The first point mentioned in the text is that Chevalier explaines in his memoir how rich he was while living in Switzerland and that he has had many expensive partys. But as the text says this can't be true because it is proved that Chevalier while he was living in Switzerland had to borrow money. The woman on the other hand claims that he only had to borrow money while he was waiting for his wealth to come in and that this is not being poor. Something else the text critises is that in his memoir is a very exact dialogue between him and Voltaire but this conversation has happened years ago and no one can remember a conversation the so many details years after, claims the text. But here too the woman knows what to say. She explains that Chevalier imediately after he talked to Voltaire wrote down every detail he remembered. And years after when he was writting his memior he pulled out his notes again. As the text says that Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice did defenetly not happen through the roof but that some og his mighty friends in Venice paied his bill, the woman pulls out the fact that while Chevalier was imprisoned other people with even myther friends didn't get out. and that after he escaped thax had to redo the ceiling in his cell.
