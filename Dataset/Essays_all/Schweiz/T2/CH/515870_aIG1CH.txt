The lecture indicates, that, despite the critics complains, those three events might still be true.

 Let's look at the first situation. Why would a rich person borrow money? The lecturer says, that most of C.'s assets were fixed ones. This means, that to get liquid money, he first had to sell part of his assets. To do that, he obviously needed money; or he could've just borrowed some money to stay liquid instead. 

The second point are the records of voltaire. According to the lecturer, he kept notes from all his conversations with V. and there are reports, that he used journals and notes to write his memoires. With the help of these notes, C. could indeed cite Voltaire correctly. 

Now to the third point. There are old documents that indicate, that right after C. had escaped the prison, the ceiling of C.s former cell had to be repaired. This and also the fact, that there were other prisoners in there that had wealthier and mightier friends than C. indicate, that he might've indeed escaped the prison in the way he described.
