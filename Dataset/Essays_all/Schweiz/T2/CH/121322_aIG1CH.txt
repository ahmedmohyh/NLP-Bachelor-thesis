The first thing the reading says is that Chevalier could not have been rich, because he borrowed some money. In counter the listening said that he was rich. They say he only borrowed money because he was waiting for his. The second thing the reading mentioned was the conversation with a famous writer called Voltaire. He wrote down the things they talked about but many things seem to be invented because he would not been able to know what they talked about a few years ago. However, the listening said that nothing is invented because he wrote every night a summary of what they talked about before. Last but not least, the prison escape. On one hand the listening they believe that Chevalier escaped trought the roof, because they had to repair it when he was gone. On the other hand the reading things that he made it out , because of his good connections. But the listening denies that, because they said that they were many prisoners with much better connections but they still didn't made it out.
