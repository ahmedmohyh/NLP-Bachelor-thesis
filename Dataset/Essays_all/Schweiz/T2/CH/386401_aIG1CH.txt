The woman talking explains, that Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs were really accurate eventhough the text says the complete opposite. To make her point she lists a few stories and explains why they must be true.

First of all she talks about the considerable sums of money Chevalier borrowed. The text accuses him of not being rich since a rich man doesn't have to borrow money. The woman explains this by saying, that Chevalier had to wait a few days until his money arrived and in those days he didn't have any money. He wasn't poor but he had to borrow some money in those days.

The text talks about the conversations of Chevalier and Voltaire. Critics complain that the memoirs can't be accurate because he wrote them years after the conversation had happened and he couldn't have known everything perfectly. 
In the presentation the woman explains that Chevalier had noted the conversations down after every meeting he had with Voltaire. While writing the memoirs he consulted his notes and could write the conversations accurately.

The last thing critics aren't sure about is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. He claims to have escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling but the critics assume he bribed his jailers.
But the woman in the presentation highlightes that there were more powerful men in the prison who could have bribed the jailers too, but they didn't get out of the prison. She also ecplains that there was an official paper where there was written, that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier's escape and that shows that his story was accurate.
