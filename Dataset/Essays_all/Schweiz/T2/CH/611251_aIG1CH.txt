The text says that the Chaevalier de Seingalt lied in his memoires about his life. However the woman sais that he is not a liar. In the following three statements in the Cevalier's memoires I want the explain what the text and the woman say about them.
The first statement is that the Chevalier is rich. The text says that that's not possible because the Chevalier often borrowed money. But the woman thinks that the Chevalier was in fact rich. He just needed to sell money first so that he can spend it later.
The second statement is that the Chevalier wrote conversations really exact word by word. The text says that it's impossible to memorize every single word in a conversation and that he probably just wrote anything. The woman however thinks that all the conversations are true because the Chevalier made notes after every conversation so that he didn't need to remember every word. She says the the conversations were exactly like the Chevalier wrote them.
The last statement of the memoirs is that the Chevalier escaped from a Venetian prison through the roof by using a metal. The text says that it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him, because he had so many politically well- connected friends in Venice. But the woman's statement is that there are notes from the government which say that they needed to repair the ceiling from the Chevalier's room in the prison.
All the statements from both the text and the woman are not proofen facts. In the end only the Chevalier knows what happened in his life and all we can do is guessing.
