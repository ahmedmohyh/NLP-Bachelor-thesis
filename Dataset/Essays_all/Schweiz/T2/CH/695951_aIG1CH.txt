The text criticises the accuracy of the events in the memoir while the audio supports the truthness of them. 

It is known that Chevalier spent a huge amount of money on parties. In his memoir is written that he was a wealthy man. Nevertheless he had to borrow some money. The speaker said he was not poor and just needed some time to convert the goods into money. During this time he had to borrow some. On the other hand the critics argue that if he had been that wealthy he wouldn't need to borrow money.

Chevalier and Voltaire met. The critics are not sure about the accuracy of the conversation because it was written down many years after. But the speaker said that Chevalier wrote everything down after their meeting and just published it years after. 

The third disagreement is about his escape from the prison in Venice. The critics point out that Chevalier had good connections in Venice which could have offered a bribe. Supporters (the speaker as well) mention on the other hand that some prisoners had more powerful friends and they didn't offer a bribe to them. Another argument is that his room had to be repared after his escape. 

There are three different events with two opposite opinions and point of views.
