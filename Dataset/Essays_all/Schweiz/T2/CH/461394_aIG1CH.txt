Chevalier de Seingalt noted a long memoir about his life and adventures. He was quite famous and rich. He was also much into gambling. So, may be this is one of the ways how he earned his money. The problem is that he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant even though Chevalier had more than enough by side. He would not have needed to borrow money. We know that he liked gambling but the thing is that you do not receive the sum immediately, so he had  money but just not at the moment. This is why he had to borrow money! When he needed his money he actually already had it but not on this day. So, he borrowed it from a Swiss merchant. It is not risky at all and it is understable. 

The other thing is about Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. We learned that Chevalier escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and he climbed through the roof. First, it is a big question how he did get this bribe. Critics say that he had conactions in the prison but actually he had not been the only one with conactions there. So may be it demands on his intelligence to escape the prison. Apparently, the other prisoners could have been also able to escape but why did not they do? Chevalier was just another sort of human.
