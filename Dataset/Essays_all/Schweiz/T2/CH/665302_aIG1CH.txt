The hearing task of Chevalier dicussed the critics of his book. The hearing has not the same opinons like the text.

The text for example said, it is not possible, that Chevalier was rich because he have needed to borrow money. The hearing do not agree. He thing that it is possible.  A person do not has poor only because his borrowing money.

In the point with the prison the text thing that Chevalier did not escape like he described. They think that one of politcally well-connected friends in Venice would offered him a bribe. The hearing disagree with this opinion because the prison would be renolved after the escape. With other worlds, Chevalier defected the prison, so that they had to renolve it.
