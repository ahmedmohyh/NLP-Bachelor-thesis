The text doubts the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir, in particular three episodes concerning his wealth and his expenses while living in Switzerland, the accuracy of the conversations between him and Voltaire and finally the episode in which he bousts about escaping a Venetian prison.
The reading tries to prove the accuracy of the memoir. It states that the Chevalier was indeed very wealthy and known for his vast expenses, but had to convert his property into money and therefore had to take on loans while waiting for his money.
Apparently, the Chevalier used to take notes, also after the conversation with Voltaire and other sources confirm him using those notes while writing the memoir.
The by far most bizarre episode, telling his escape from a Venetian prison, seems to be confirmed on one hand by an old Venetian goevernment document which ensures the reperation of the prison roof and on the other hand by the fact that others, far more powerful prisoners, wheren't able to bribe the guards either.
