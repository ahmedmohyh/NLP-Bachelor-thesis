The heared presentation is saying that the memoires of the Chevalier de Seingalt are pretty accurate. It says that the Chevalier had to borrow money while he was in Switzerland because had to wait for his own money to arrive. But critics say that he was not as whealthy as he said he was.
About the conversation between him and Voltaire the critics say that he would not have been able to remember the whole conversation after so many years. But the presentation says that the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember from the conversation the night after they met. According to it he kept these notes until he wrote everything down in his memoires many years later. 
It also mentions his escape from a prison in Venice. The Chevalier said that he escaped because he made a hole in the ceiling of his cell and climbed through the roof. But the critics do not believe his story. They are claiming that he had some political well-connected friends who buyed him free. The presentation says that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he left the prison. So why was this necessary if he did not escape this way?
But we will never find out which version is correct.
