Chevalier the Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life and adventures. But some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of his memoir. They say that sometimes he distorted or invented many events to make it seem that his life was more exciting than it really was. 

They claim that when he was in Switzerland, he could'nt have been rich, because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But others say that he invested money to become even more rich and for that he had to borrow some. Other critics say that he can't possibly remember the conversations he had with Voltaire because he wrote the book a few years later. And it is proven that no one can remember the details of a conversation after such a long time. But friends of him claim that he sometimes wrote things in a journal and that he wrote the conversation with Voltaire down too. So he had used this journal to write his book. Another critic is, that Chevalier had bribed the jailers to free him from the prison in Venice, Italy and not, like he said, had escaped through the ceiling by using a piece of metal to make a hole in it. But reports from this time say that after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling had to be repared. So it is quite likely that he escaped prison by making a hole in the ceiling like he said.

So in the end there are explenations for all the doubts and it is quite likely that his memoirs are accurate.
