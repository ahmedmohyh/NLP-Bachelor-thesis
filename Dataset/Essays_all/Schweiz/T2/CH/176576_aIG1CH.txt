There were three major arguments in the text and in the lecture, those from the text were against the Chevalier and those from the lecture were for him. 
The first argument which was refuted was the loans he took while living in Switzerland. It was said that he always had to wait some days for his money to arrive, so in that time, he took a loan and later paid the merchand always back. 
The second argument said in the text and the lecture were the phrases of conversations he with Volatire, which he could remember. But it was proven, that always on the same night, when he had talked to Voltaire, he always immediately wrote down what he could remember, and years later he consulted this "diary" and wrote down some phrases in his memoir.  
The last argument which was told in the lecture was the prison-escape in Venice. In the text it is told that had some powerful friends in Venice, but the lector said that there were prisoners in the same prison, with more powerful friends, and they couldn't offer a bride. And in the archiv of the venetian prison, they found a document which said, that shortly after the stay of the Chevalier in the prison, the ceiling needed to be repaired. And why should they want to repair the ceiling if no one broke out of there? 
So the stories of the chevalier might actually be true.
