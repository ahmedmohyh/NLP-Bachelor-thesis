Chevalier de Seingalt was obviously a really controversial figure. Nevertheless his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the past. Even though his memoir might not be accurate at all. In the text it says that there is proof that he had to borrow considerable sums of money from others even though in his memoir he is telling about living a luxury life. If Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. But in the listening part we could hear that he was not poor, Moreover he had wealth but he had the kind of property that you had to sell first. The money will follow later so that in the meantime he had to borrow some money. To the accuracy of the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire we could hear in the listening part that Chevalier wrote down everything that he could remember about their conversation every evening. So it makes in possible that he could write down pretty accurate conversations in his memoir with those notes. The prison escape is also really controversial. In the listening we heard that other prisoners had more powerful friends and they were not able to escape. But there is also proof that that the ceiling had to be repaired so it might be true.
