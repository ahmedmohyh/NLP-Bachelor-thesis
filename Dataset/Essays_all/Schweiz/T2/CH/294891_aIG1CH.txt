The text is very sceptical about the truth of the memoirs of Chevaliers life and adventures. In the listening on the other hand it's said, that the memoirs  are very accurate. They both brought three examples, why they think they're right. The first question is, if Chevalier was rich when he lived in Switzerland. Because Chevalier borrowed big sums of money, the critics, wich are metioned in the text, don't think he was rich. The woman talking in the listening didn't said so. She said, that it was normal during this time to borrow money from someone, while waiting on your one, even if your rich. The second question was if the conversations with Voltaire, that Chevalier wrote about in his memoirs are true. The text says no, the listening the oposite. Finally, it's asked if his escape from the prison in Venice was, as he wrote it in his memoirs. Again the text said no, it's unbelievable. But the woman talking in the listen had an other opinion. She is sure, that it happend, as Chevalier told it in his memoirs.
