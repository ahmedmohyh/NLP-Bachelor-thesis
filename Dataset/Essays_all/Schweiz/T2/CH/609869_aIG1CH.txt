During the lecture many points have been listed against the points in the text. In the lectur, it was said that Chevalier borrowed much money from the merchant because he waited for the money, which people owed him for selling his property to them. While he was waiting, he had no money left, so he had to borrow some from the merchant. The woman from the lecture says also that he must have been rich because he went to many parties. The text says the opposite. The critics ask themselves why he had to borrow money when he was that rich. A rich person still has money  left while he has to way for the money people owe him. 
Another point is that Chevalier kept notes for years. Right after something in his life has happened he would make notes and rewrite all the actions at a later point in his life. The critics, as it is mentioned in the text, doubted how a simple human being can remember all the words so exactly that he had heard some years ago. 
Thirdly, there is the question about his escape in the prison. While critics say he only escaped because of his good connections to politicians, other people say that the escape, as he had discribed in his memoir, is absolutely true. It is the truth, they say, because in the prison, there were other people who had connections to more powerful politicians but they could not rescue them of the prison. So the only possible way, they say, was that he had made a hole into the ceiling. This is confirmed, say people, by the fact that the Venetian prison had to repare the ceiling afterwards.
