In the lecture the Chevalier is said to be am accurate memorial. While living in Switzerland it is true that the spent huge amount of money on parties and  gambling. But he wasn't poor. It is also correct that he sometimes borrowed money from other people. But just because he had no more money in Switzerland left and he had to wait for new money to arrive. 
It is also true that the Chevalier conversed with Voltaire. It is known from witnesses that the Chevalier regularly consulted notes after a conversation like he did after he conversed with Voltaire. He didn't publish his writings for a long time and just kept them by himself.
Furthermore it has been proved that the Chevalier really escaped from the Venetian prison. It is true that he had the help from other jailers to escape. But it is important to mention that those jailers weren't the most powerful people in prison. There were many more groups that held more power. On the other side it's true that he fled thorugh the ceiling. Old Venicien documents say that, after the Chevalier ran away from the prison, the ceiling had to be replaced. But it isn't sure wether he really used a piece of metal to make a hole in it.
