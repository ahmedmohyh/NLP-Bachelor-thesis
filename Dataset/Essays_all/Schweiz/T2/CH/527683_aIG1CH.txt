The Chevalier is an interesting person. 
He wrote a memoir about his life and his adventures.
His memoir is very helpful to understand the historical European society.
Some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir.
It`s said that the chevalier invented things in his memoir to make it more interesting.
First theres an evidence that he borrowed money while living in Switzerland.
Why has he done that if he was so rich?
There`s an easy explanation: Of course he was rich but it took some time to get cash, because his money was invested in like cars, yachts, houses etc.
Secondly he wrote done that he met Voltaire and  that they got along very well.
It`s said that he wrote down after every time they met everything about they`re time together, what they`ve done, what they`ve been talking about etc.
Last point is that he told about his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. The doubts say that he had important friends and money, so they bribed them to get Chevalier out of the Prison.
There`s an evidence that Chevaliers cell was repaired after he left the prison. Why did they have to do this if he didn`t escape? Another point is that in this prison were even more important prisoners so why dind`t they get out of the prison with money and influence?
In the end there are some easy explanations to run de doubts down, but we`ll never really know what`s true about this memoir and hof course his life and what`s wrong.
