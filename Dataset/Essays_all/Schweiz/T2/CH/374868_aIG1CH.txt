The Chevalier de Seingalt had to borrow considerable sums from a Swiss merchant eventhough he described himself a wealthy man; that's why some criticts of his memoir think the Chevalier had distorted or invented many of the events described in his memoir to make his life seem more exciting than it actually might have been. But in the before heard lecture it was said, that the Chevalier actually had property, which he couldn't sell so quickly, so that's why he had to borrow money from the Swiss merchant. Critics are also very skeptical about a conversation between Voltaire and the Chevalier which is written sentence by sentence in his memoir instead of paraphrased, suggesting he remembered all of the conversations years later while writing his memoir. The person holding the lecture argues that the Chevalier said in his memoir, that he had written down the conversations he had with Voltaire every night, so he didnt't have to remember them years later, because they were already written down. Another point critics find questionable about the memoir of the Chevalier is, that when he was in a Venetian prison he allegedly escaped through a hole he made in the roof with a piece of metal. They believe, that this is untrue, but he much rather bribed the jailer's to let him get out. The lecturer says that other influential and well-connected people with equally politically well-connected friends couldn't bribe them. There are also reports from the prison, after the escape from the Chevalier, that they had to repair the ceiling, but why would they have to if he didn't escape?
