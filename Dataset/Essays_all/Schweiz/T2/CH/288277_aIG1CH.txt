The Text and the part of the lesson talked about the controversity of the person Chevalier de Seingalt and the memoir he wrote. It is not clear until now if his histoires were wright ore invented. The Text says that the memoires are wrong where as the Professor in the lesson says that there is evidence that the events happend.

An argument that would support the thesis that the memorie is a true story are that there are events that where described in thememories that are reported in other documents. For example he wrote that he escaped from the prison of venice. There are documents in the prison where it is written that they had to repair the ceiling of the cell during the period of time where Chevalier was there and escaped. However the text has the opinion that sameone helped Chevalier to escape. An other controversary part is with which accuracy the conversations with Voltaire are described. The Professor says that he wrote the text about Voltaire the night after he talked to him. The text however says that they where written many years after the conversations.
Probbably I think the histories have bean distorted to make them more interresting.
