The text says that the Chevalier has borrowed a huge sume of money from a Swiss merchant so that's why he can't be a rich man. However the presentation gives us another impression.Their opinion is that he had to sell things to get cash and that needs a lot of time and that's the reason why he had to borow soums of money from a Swiss merchant. This doesn't automaticly means that he is a poor man.He also spent a huge sum of money at parties and gambling. And this is also a sign that he is moreover a rich man.

On the one hand we have the text that tells us that it's impossible that you remember a conversation after many years. On the other hand the presentation says that Chevalier had many night conversations with Voltaire and he has written down every single information and that's how he could remember the dialoge and so he could write a memoir. 

The differences in the last arrugement is that the text says that he could have some friend who offered him a brible. The presentation says that he has done this all on his one. Why otherwise should the prison have to repare the roof again.
