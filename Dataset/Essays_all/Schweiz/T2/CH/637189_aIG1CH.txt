In the lecture the woman said that she thinks that the memoire is pretty accurate an reliable. she also gives an argument for every possible doupt that was discovered in the article. The article sais that Chevalier borrowed money in Switzerland and that in fact he wasn't as wealthy as thought. But the lady explains it that he  had to make his money liquid and that he had to wait till the money arrived in Swizerland and becaus of the parties he threw sometimes he hadn't enough money. So he had to lend some till his money arrived.
The article sais also that Chevalier had a conversation with Vorltaire and in the article they are questionning the memoire of Chevalier because he wrote whole sentences of the conversation into the memoire. But he lecutre lady sais that he wrote everything down right after the conversation with Voltaire and that for writing his memoire he consulted the boock with his notes. 
And third the article doupts that Chevalier escaped the prison in Venice with a piece of metal. it is said that he made a whole into the ceiling. The lecture lady defends this theory saiing that it was a fact that there was a whole in the ceiling after that Chevalier was out the prison. So the ceiling had to be repaired and for her this is evidence that he escaped the prison.
