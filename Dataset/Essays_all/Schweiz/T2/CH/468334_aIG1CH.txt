Chevalier de Seingalt wrote every evening a little text about what he did during the day. He collected all this textes about his life and adventures. In his life he mets many famous people for exemple kings or writers. He lived also for some time in Switzerland and he was very wealthy. He spend a lot of money there, but he was not rich. He borrowed all his money from a Swiss merchant. Critics are not sure if all his memoirs are really real. They don`t belive that he mets so many well-know people and Chevalier wrote down some textes about the conservations only few years later. Chevalier was in a prison in Italy and he sais that he escaped the prison. He made a hole in the ceiling and climed trought the roof. Critics also can`t belive that ponit of his memoir. Its a impossible escape for the critics.
