Chevalier de Seingalt

Critics are complaining about the way of life of Chevailer and his long memoir recounting his adventures, but are all of these complains true?

It's true, that Chevalier had reliable sources about the European society in the eighteenth century. Another correct point is, that he has a quite big wealth, but that doesn't mean, that he borrowed money. It just took a few days to make some money.
Critics complain, that the memoir cannot possibly capture the conversation between Chevailer and Voltaire. This mustn't be true, because he just wrote down everything he could remember.
A true fact is, that Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice. Critics saied, that he actually escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, but why should he prepare a ceiling?
Also the critics complained, that he was only able to escape because of his well-connected friend in Venice. In fact others had far more well-connected friends, than him.
