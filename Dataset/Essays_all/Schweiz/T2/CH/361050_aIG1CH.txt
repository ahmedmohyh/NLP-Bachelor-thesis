The woman holding the presentation, seems to be well informed about the topic. The presentation gives us the impression, that she has done a research on Le Chevalier.
She started out, explaining that borrowing money doesn't mean being poor. In fact she told the reader how wealthy people make more money while borrowing and "investing" it. After that explaination, she spoke about some historical facts which have real evidence, in form of documents. She mentioned how Le Chevalier wrote everything about his conversations with Voltaire shortly after having the conversation. She also mentioned, he'd refer to those notes and while writing his memoirs. There is even more historical evidence about Chevalier escaping the prision. In fact, no one had ever got out of that prision with a bribe and there are documents stating, that the ceiling of a cell in the where Voltaire had been in, had to be repaired.
On the contrary of the text, the woman gave us real historical references and explainations, instead of just making assumptions, like in the Text.
