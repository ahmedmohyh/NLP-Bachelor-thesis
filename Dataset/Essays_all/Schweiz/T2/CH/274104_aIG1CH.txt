Borrowing is a sign for poorness, is it not? The lecture says the same thing, but takes it one step further: Chevalier may had no money in that specific moment, but he had a lot of property. It took several days to make that propeerty to money, and during this time, he needed to borrow some money, which is a good explanaition to combine the statment of his richness and the merchant.

Not that they never took place, but it were impossible to recreate them word by word after so many years when he was writing his memoir.
