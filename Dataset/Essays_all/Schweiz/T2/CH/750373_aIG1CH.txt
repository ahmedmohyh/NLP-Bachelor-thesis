The two texts are related by the following three points:
First, critics say that Chevalier wasn't that wealthy because he had to borrow money form a Swiss merchant. The speaker has an explanation for thtat: Chevalier used a lot of money for parties and gambling. When he run out of money, he sold his property which took a few days. For this days, he borrowed money until he could pay it back. Just because he borrowed money doesn't mean he was poor.
Then the author explains that it's impossible to remeber a full conversation word by word years later. The speaker explains that he might wrote it down right after the conversation and the used it again years later to write his memoir.
Furthermore the author talks about the Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice. Critics claim that he used his politically well-connenctged friends to break out which would make more sense. The speaker doesn't agree with that by pointing out that there were many others kept in the prison with even more powerful friends which could not break out. Furthermore she says that they had to repair the cieling which makes only sense if Chevalier had escaped through the roof.
