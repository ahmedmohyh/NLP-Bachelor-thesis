The accuracy of Chevaliers memoir is discussed and in the following three points, some people disagree. According to the author, he himself was not poor but rather rich. Later it was found out, that he took a bigger loan from a swiss merchant. Some people wonder why he even borrowed money if he was so rich and directly make the conclusion that his wealth was made up to some extent.Others are sure of his wealth and understand his action of loaning money while waiting for his large sums to arrive. The next point is his detailed extract of his conversation with Voltaire. Some have it hard to belive that he remembered that much while writing his memoir years later, while other argue that he took notes of it the same evening and looked them up during the writing. The last small dispute is how he managed toescape from prison. In his memoir he stated that he escaped from the Venetian prison on his own by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing out. The roof was in fact repaired right after his escape, but still there are those who doubt this. 
It is indeed hard to know which parts are true and which ones are made up, especially when the euthor writes a memoir of his own and had a bit of a controversial life. Therefor it is good to have some doubts, but unless they can not be prooved, not much can be discussed.
