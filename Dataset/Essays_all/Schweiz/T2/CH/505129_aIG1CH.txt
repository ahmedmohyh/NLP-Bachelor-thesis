No memoir can be correct and in Chevaliers case there are some historical resources which showes the truth. It is true he met a lot of famous kings and writers but there are a lot of doubts.
 For example he wasn't poor but there are documents showing he spend a lot of money on partys and gambling in Switzerland. But we also know from new resources thats he borrowed great sumsof money from Swiss merchant.
Some critics think that the part with Voltaire's not the whole truth.These two really met but Chevalier wrote everything he could remember from this conversation on a note and rewrite it with his memory into his memoir.
The critics have also questioned the escsape from a prison in Venice while using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. But there were other prisoners with more powerful friends than him in this prison why didn't they help them to escape? If he really have escaped, they would have repaired the ceiling and reported it. So there would be some reports about the escape. A logical explanation would be that Chevalier had some politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe.
Critics think that these stories are for enjoyable reading and he was somewhat or is still a controversial figure.
