Chevalier de Seigalt lived from 1725 to 1798. He spent most of his life in Switzerland and he wrote a memoir of his life and adventures.His life is thrilling because he met many famous people, like kings or writers.It is said that he had a lot of money, which he spent on gambling and partying. The text says he exagerated his stories by adding untrue details, but the voice record does not believe he invented these stories. The story about his prison escape cannot be invented,the voice said, because they had to repair his ceilings. So it cannot be that he bribed someone, as well as he had politically well-connected friends there. His memoir is a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century.
