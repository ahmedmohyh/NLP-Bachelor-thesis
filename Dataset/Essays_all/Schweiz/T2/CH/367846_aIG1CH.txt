In the text above it is claimed that the Chevalier wasn't as wealthy as he said he was while living in Switzerland. In the time period of him living there he had to borrow quite big sums of money from a Swiss merchant, but does that mean he wasn't rich? No it doesn't. There's a simple explanation for his action. The Chevalier spent huge amounts of money in this country, had incredibly big parties and enjoyed life, his money had to come from somewhere and it surfaced through things he sold and merched with. Everytime he had sold something it took some time until the money reached him, and during those periods of time he had to borrow the money to live his life with his mentality.
It's also claimed that the conversation between the well known Voltaire and le Chevalier can't be completely correct because the text was written years after the occasion, but it seems like le Chevalier had written down the conversation on that same evening and then used that note while writing the book. The fact that he used old notes in the writing process is confirmed by many friends and other people that knew him.
The text above sais that le Chevalier never escaped the prison in Venice through the ceiling, it sais that he had a few politicly well-connected friends in town who helped him which isn't a lie, but many other prisoners had even more important people as friends and they never escaped. The story of le Chevalier seems to be true because old prison statistics show that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape which indicates that he really escaped by himself.
