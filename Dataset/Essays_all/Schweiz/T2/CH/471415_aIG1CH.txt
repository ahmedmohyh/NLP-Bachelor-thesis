There have been many controversies regarding the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt.
Chevalier claims that while he was in Switzerland he was very wealthy. Critics nowadays think that it doesn't seem to be true as he had to borrow money and if he had been rich there wouldn't have been a need for that. The lecturer however says when rich people converted their assets into money they usually had to wait for a longer period until that money arrived. For that reason Chevalier had to borrow money and that act doesn't make him poor.
Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the writer Voltaire. They say that it is impossible for some to remember conversations with such accuracy so many years later and thus part of the conversations had to be fabricated. The lecturer though says that people who were familiar with Chevalier confirm that he has been consulting many notes when he was writing his memoir. Every time after he had a conversation with Voltaire he used to write down everything they said. So it is possible that he just rewrote those conversations written in his notes many years later into his memoir.
A third point critics have questioned is the amount of truth in the memoire concerning Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. They claim his act was impossible and Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. The lecturer mentions that other prisoners in Venice had even more powerful friends than Chevalier and those prisoners weren't able to get out with bribery. Also in some documents in Venice evidence has been found that the ceiling of Chevlier's prison cell had to be repaired. Thus it would make sense if Chevalier's memoir is accurate in that aspect because else there wouldn't have been a reason to repair the ceiling of the prison.
