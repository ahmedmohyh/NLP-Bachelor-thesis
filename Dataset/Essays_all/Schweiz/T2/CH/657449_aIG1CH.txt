It is correct, that no source is a hundred procent correct, but there is some evidence, that proves that the memoires from Chevalier de Seingalt are mostly true and that the events aren't invented. 

For example there's a logical explenation why Chevalier had to borrow the money from the Swiss merchant. It does not mean that he was pure, it just means that he was waiting for his own money to arrive and meanwhile he had to borrow the money and could easily pay it back to the merchant a bit later.

We can also know that the conversations with Voltaire did happen the way he wrote them down because we know for sure, that he always wrote them down the night after the conversation. So he could read all of them again when he wrote his memoires.

After his escape from prison, the ceiling had to be repaired and this is no surprise after we read Chevalier's memoires. This shows, that he had really escaped from prison the way he describes it. 

So we can actually believe that Chevalier's memoires are quite reliable and that he didn't just want to make it a more interesting reading experience.
