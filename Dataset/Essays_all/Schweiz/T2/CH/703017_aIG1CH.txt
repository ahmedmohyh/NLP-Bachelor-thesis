We have heard that no memoire is completely correct, there are always things missing or not mentioned, but the memoire of Chevalier is pretty accurate. In the text however that's not the case. In both cases Chevalier is described as rich and that he likes partying and gambling.
Critics in the text argue why did he had to borrow money than? We have heard that in some cases Chevalier had to wait for his money and to borrow money doesn't necessarily mean that someone is poor. In the text critics argue that all those conversation with Voltaire can't be accurate enough, but we have heard that Chevalier wrote down a lot of conversations when they actually happened.
In the text it's said that it was only possible to escape from the Venetian prison because of his mighty politically well-connected friends but we have heard that other prisonairs had connections with even more might.
We can say that the text we have heard tries to counter the arguments of the critics in the written text.
