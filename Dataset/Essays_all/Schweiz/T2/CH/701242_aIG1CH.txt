Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 up until 1798 wrote overall correct memoires about his life and his adventures. He was a controversial figure, since many things he wrote down are believed not to have happend this way. Many say that his storys were made more intresting to read. He met indeed many famous people like kings and writers, so many of his own memoires are believed to be from high historical value. There are three occasions where people disagree with their oppinion, if the storys could have happend in that way.
The first event is where Chevalier was living in Switzerland. He gambled alot and spend much money on parties. He had sometimes to borrow money from friends, which lead to the believe that he was poor. But other people defend him and said, that he had lend money only in the times where he has sold his property and in this time until he received his money he had to rely on his friends. But after two or three days he has gotten his money and probably was able to give back the lended money, so he has not to be poor, he had only a bad way to save his money.
The second occasion where people disagree are in the meetings with Voltaire. Many believe that he wasn't able to receite the exact words Voltaire used an sofor his memoires whre sometimes maybe a lie or just written diffrent so it would sound nice. Others believe that he made himselfe after every meeting notes which he was able to use when he wrote his memoires.
The third occasion was in Venice where he was in a prison an freed himselfe trough a hole which he dug with a metal rod. Others believe that he had bribed himself out of prison because he had many powerful friends in Venice. But there is proof that there were other inmates who had freinds who were more powerful, and there is also an old document of the state of Venice where the ceiling of a prison cell had to be renewed.
