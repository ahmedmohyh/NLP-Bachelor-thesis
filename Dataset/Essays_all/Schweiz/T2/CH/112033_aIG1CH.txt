There are many controversial stories in the Chevalier's memoir's. The first one is about him explaining his lavish lifestyle which he lived while staying in switzerland. He was said to have spent huge amounts of cash for partying and gambling. But other reports state that he had to take a loan from a merchant and that he wasn't as reach as he claims. People defending the Chevalier say that all of his money was invested in property. Asking the merchant was just a last resrt because he didn't have any fluid cash at the time and had to wait for a someone to buy some of his property. 

The second story is about him meeting the famous writer Voltaire. People claim that his memoir's were written many years after the conversations between the two so it couldn't have been possible for the Chevalier to know so much details about the converstaions even remembering many quotes of Voltaire. The Chevalier reacted to these accusations by saying that he used to write down some notes every night after the conversations with voltaire and then keeping them until writing his memoir's.

The last story is about his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. He claimed that he escaped the prison by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and climbing through the roof. Many claim that his influental friends in Venice just birbed the jailers. But there is the argument that some of the other prisoners even had more influential friends and they weren't able to escape. There also a gouvernement report about his escape from prison and there's a part that talks about the need to fix the ceiling in which the Chevalier had been locked up.
