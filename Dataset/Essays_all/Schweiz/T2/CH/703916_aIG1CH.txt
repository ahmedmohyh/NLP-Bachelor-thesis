In the lecture the woman explains why Chevaliers memoir is true and not invented by him. First off she explains why Chevalier had to take loans from a swiss merchant even though he was very rich. His problem was that he had to sell his properties first to get money and had to wait some days for his money. So while he was waiting for his money he borrowed money from a merchant. This shows us that the argument of the critics about Chevalier not being rich is invalid. The second point in the memoir which the critics pointed out is Chevaliers conversation with Voltaire. They say it is impossible that Chevalier could've remembered the whole conversation after all theese years. But theres enough evidence that shows us that Chevalier wrote that conversation down. His friends said that he often looked at his notes while writing the memoir. And finally there's his prison escape. The critics point out that the escape as he described it is impossible and that he just wrote that because it makes enjoyable reading. They say it's more likely that he bribed jailers to free him. But this is wrong. Inside the prison had been way more powerful guys who were not able to bribe the jailers. Also his escape probably happend because shortly after he had escaped the prison had to repair the ceiling inside his cell.
