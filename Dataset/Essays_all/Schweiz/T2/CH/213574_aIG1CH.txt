The first argument in the presentation was that the Chevalier, while he was living in Switzerland, was rich. A lot of Cheavlier used to play with their money or gambled. Probably, the Chevalier had to wait for his money, because he had won something, therefore he had not any cash and he had to borrow some money. Borrwoing money had not the significance that you are poor. On the other hand, the text says that if he had been rich, he would not have borrowed money from a merchant. 
The second argument in the text is that the memoir, which was written some years after the conservation with Voltaire, is incorrect. Why he wrote the memoir some years after, when it had been possible to write the text after the conversation. But, it exists a lot of evidences, which prove that the Chevalier had written everything after the conversation. Later, he attached it to his memoir. 
The third argument in the presentation was, that it was possible, that the Chevalier escaped from the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal. The story with the the bribery doesn't make a lot of sense, because there were a lot of prisonniers, who had more power than the Chevalier and they were still in the prison. The biggest proof is, that the roof over his ceiling had to be repaired and why they had to repair the roof when the Chevalier bribed a jailer to free him?
