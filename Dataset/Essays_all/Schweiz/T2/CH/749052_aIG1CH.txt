In the spoken presentation, the lady states that the Chevalier had borrowed money for the long wait of his properties being sold. He apparently had to because he had no form of cash, as bank accounts obviously haven't existed at that time.
The presentation also states that the Chevalier had taken notes of the conversation he had with Voltaire. He may have taken several years to come to the idea of publishing this to the public, which explains the past years.
Evidences also contradict the suspection of him having been freed by bribes: an old document proves that the ceiling of the jail the Chevalier was kept in had to be repaired right after he escaped.
These are quite direct and trustable assumptions, but historical mysteries stay as assumptions unless concrete evidences are found. Who knows, we might find more.
