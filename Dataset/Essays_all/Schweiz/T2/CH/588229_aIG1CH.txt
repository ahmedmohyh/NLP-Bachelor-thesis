During the presentation about Chevalier it was mentionned that not everything about the memoir can be correct but it is a relieable historical source. The text says the chevalier is a good memoir about the society in the eighteenth century.
The presentation says you can not say Chevalier was poor. He did spend a lot of money on gambling but he he had a lot of properties he could sell and make money again. He had to borrow money because he could not sell his property in one day and had to wait several days to have his own money again. The text does not mention this information of selling properties. The text insists on Chevalier not being rich. 
Chevalier did have conversations with Voltaire the presentation says. After every conversation Chevalier wrote everything down and kept these notes for ages. When he wrote his memoir he used his notes. At this point the text does not agree with the presentation at all. The text is convinced that Chevalier did not speak with Voltaire.  
The presentation mentionned it was impossible for Voltaire to escape out of the prison. He did not have enough connections. Other people in prison had much more connections and even these people could not escape. At this point the text does not agree with the presentation either. The text says Chevalier clearly had enough connections to escape out of prison.
