The memoire of Chevalier de Seingalt is a discussed subject. The written text doubts the actual accuracy of these memoires. It specific points are, that the Chevalier might not have been as whealthy as he stated in his memoire while being in Switzerland, because he borrowed money, that his conversations with Voltaire can not be correct, because nobody can remember such conversations accurately after such a log time, and that his escape from the prison in Venice was bribery and not an escape through the ceiling. The professor on the other hand states, that everything can be explained and that the memoire of Chevalier is pretty accurate. She explains that the Chevalier needed bigger sums of money in a short amount of time and while he was whealthy, his fortune was not liquid and he had to borrow money, because it took him time to sell his stuff. The conversations with Voltaire were also accurate, because he kept a journal and he made notes about those conversations in the night after said conversations. The last argument of the professor was, that after the escape of Chevalier, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, which indicates, that Chevalier must have escaped throught the roof of his own cell. Also she states, thet there were more men with far more powerful connection that Chevalier himself and that these did not escape.
