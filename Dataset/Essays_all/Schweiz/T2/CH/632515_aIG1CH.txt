Lots of people had doubts about the memoir of the chevalier.So no one really believed him that he escaped from the prison in venetia.But after his escape exactly the room in which he told he were got renovated. And I think that this can't be a coincidence.Because if they were brided to free him they had no reason to renovate the room.But if he really had escaped with making a whole they had to renovate.And in fact they renovated so that speakes for the chevalier.As well the people speculate about the converstion he had with Voltaire.They believe that he had a conversation but they didin't belive that it was the one he wrote in his memoir because he published the conversation a lot later than he had hold it.But in this situation as well the chevalier could have had this conversation for sure.But just kept these informations for himself and made it later official.In conclusion there is no proof that everything he wrote was true but there are no proofs that he hasn'ttold the truth.You can speculate as well about the fact if he was wealthy or not.He had enough money for gambling or parties but had he a lot of money left after all these games? We don't know it exactly but what we know is that some things might be worng and some might be right.
