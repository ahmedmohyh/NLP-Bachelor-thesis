About Chevalier de Seingalt are a lot of stories and legends, he had written a memoir in which he describes his life and his adventures. The question raises if his memoir is true or not. Critics say that he pimped his memoir up with some events to make his life more exciting. He describes himself as rich and wealthy, he claimed that he raised many parties. But an evidence has recently surfaced that he borrowed a lot money. So how can it be that he claims to be rich and borrows money at the same time, is this an evidence for the falseness of the memoir? Chevalier had to wait for his money, because he it came from somewhere else so he borrows money for the time between, this is not an evidence that he was poor.
An other event in his memoir is his prisonescape from the prison in Venice he claims that he have escaped by using a piece of metal. Critics think that this is not locical they believe that he had to escape with the help from a powerfull friend. But an other source sais that there where other people in the same prison who had more powerfull friends and could not escape. An other evidence for his story is that the prison had to be repaired after the escape, why should a prison be repaired? 
At the end you can not say what is right and wich story is true so you have to decide for your own.
