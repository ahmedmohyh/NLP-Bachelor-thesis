The text shows us some examples why some of the events in the memoir from Chavalier de Seingalt about his life and adventures could or must be invented. The first critic is about his wealthy lifestyle in switzerland. The critics question the action of borrowing money eventhought he was very wealthy. In the presentation the speaker explains this action. Chevalier had to borrow money because it takes a long time till he can change his fortune in real money which he uses to throw a party. Another doubt about the accuracy of the memoir is, that Chevalier wrote down the conversation he had with Voltair, a famous writer. Critcs say that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversation accurately. The speaker denies this doubt, because there are conformations from people who lived in the time of Chavalier that he used a lot of notes to write his memoir. And one of the notes is from the conversation with Voltair. The last critic point is about the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. In the memoir it says that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling throught which he climbed out. Critics say that this story must be invented. They think that Chavelier had politically wel-connected friends which helped to free him. The speaker does not agree with this point, because in this prison there were imprisoners more powerful than Chevalier and they didnt escaped. The story in the memoir of Chevalier could be true, because there are documents which say that the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape of Chevalier.
