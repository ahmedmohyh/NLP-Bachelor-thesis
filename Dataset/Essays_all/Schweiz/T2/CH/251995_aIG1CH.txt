The woman defended the Chevalier. she explained that many sources are proving that the Chevalier was rich and only had to borrow the money because he could not convert his properties and wealth in to cash very fast. So when every he needed some cash the Chevalier went to the merchant and borrowed money. Also she pointed out that the memoire was written many years after the encounter with Voltaire but the Chevalier actually wrote down his conversation with Voltaire way earlier and only copied his notices in his memeoire. On the matter of the miraculos escapre out of the prison in Venice the woman mentioned that a lot of more influentiual and weathier people were in prisoned there that could not bribe there way out, which by the way is the only argument that does not proof anything, and that the roof of the Chevaliers cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape. Overall the woman made a mockery of the people who wrote the article because now the look like complete uniformed fools.
