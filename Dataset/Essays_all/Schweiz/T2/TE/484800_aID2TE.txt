In this essay I want to talk about the importance of the way teachers teach.

On the one hand I think it is important that the teacher get well with his students and that he relates well.
But on the other hand I think it is way more important that the teacher is a master of the subject. In my studiing career I had to deal a lot with teachers with a little knowledge and the students hat to explain them some things. I wasn't very amused by that time because teachers earn way to much. I don't like our system with this too wealty and to left-side politican army of teachers. They should be more thankful at the fact that they got a job and got so many days of holidays. Our english teacher is the worst. In every lesson we lose important time to study just because he is complaining how "few money" he earns and how much his colleagues form school earn. (He always compare his salary with the salary of the employees form the Julius Caesar bank.) Of course he earns less than them but he still has a very good, I have to say too good salary. The once should think about the farmers in our land and how much they work and earn. A farmer has to work every day and he always has to stand up at 5 o clock. And the sadest thing about farmers is that they earn almost nothing without subventions. And with subventions they earn maybe the half of the salary of a teacher. I think daily food and a good ecosystem is way more important than school education. 

Sorry for this excourse but it really was time that somebody starts to say that. It is not okay how life goes right now. Even does anybody know how much this "MEWS"-thing cost. I my opinion we have more problems to solve in switzerland that this "Measuring English" right here. I am sorry for my badly done work but I just don't know what to write in the 10 minutes I got left. 

btw: the "MEWS"-stick is boiling hot and I think that he will pass away in a few days or weeks.
