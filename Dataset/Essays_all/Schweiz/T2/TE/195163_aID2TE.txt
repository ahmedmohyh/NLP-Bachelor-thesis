Is a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than the actual knowledge of his subject? I don't think there is a perfect way of teaching, because it depends on the individual student. A teacher sends out way more than just his words, with his gestures and his whole being there, so it's quite possible that one teacher seems to be the best for some students, but is also hated from others.
In this case i don't think it's worth discussing about what's more important. A teacher shouldn't have zero ability to relate well with students, but is also useless without satisfying knowledge of the subject. To make a student learn well, a good mixture of both things is needed. There are over 20 people in only one class, so no teacher is able to be perfect for everybody. In my opinion, there is no right way of teaching, no objective truth to hold on to as a teacher. If you want to success in your job, take your individual situation and make the best of it. The most important thing is that you try and give your best. Nobody can determine what's right or wrong in the end.
