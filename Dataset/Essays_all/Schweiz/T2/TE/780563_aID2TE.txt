Teachers methods are a well discussed and actual subject. Everybody knows it, you will always have some good teachers and some bad ones. But what is the better method to teach students, the teachers ability to relate with students or an excellent knowledege of the issues being taught? A difficult question, whereas the older method is rather based on exclusive knowledge. 
In the beginning it is to say that a relationship between students and teacher is a countinuous system. That supports the teacher and increases the ability to learn for the students because the teacher knows each stundent individually, their strenghts and weaknesses. As a consequence the teacher is able to give individual help or critique.
Additionally to relate with students makes a relationship between teacher and students possible. For that reason the students are motivated and they rather interact.
Furthermore it is prooved that everyone represents a different learning type. So it should be a teachers task to explore, what is the best for each student. This may be an additional effort but the students will profit being more efficient. 
Also, if the focus is on konwledge, it is simply more boring and the students' concentration is reduced more and more. Even for the teacher it is way less interesting without any interaction or relation with the students. Within the word teacher there is the word to teach but teaching is not possible if there is no relation to the students. Teachers - yes they do - are pedologically experienced. This should be used to relate well with students.
