Every day children wake up in the morning, eat their breakfast, prepare for school, go outside and walk with their friends in school. Children in the primar class see every day the same teacher. So a teacher has to get on well with their children. At this young age it isn't so important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject. 

When the children get older, they're going to a high school. They have other interests than young children. Now they are students. They are more in front of the computer, learn a lot and chill their life.

At the age of 18 they need a good school carreer. They have to prepare a lot for school, they have many tests and they all want to be good in school because they want a good job one day. So I think the teacher has to have a excellent knowledge of the subject. In high school the students have different teachers and they don't know every teacher very well. This is another way around in the primary school. A teacher has to get on well with his students, that's clear.

But I think the older you get, the better you want to be in school to have a great job one day. So for students it's important to have a great teacher who knows many things about his subject. When it's like that the students understand what the teacher want to say. So they can learn a lot from their teacher.
