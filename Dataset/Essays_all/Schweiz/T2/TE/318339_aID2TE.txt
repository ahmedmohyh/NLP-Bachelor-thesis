Everyone knows that a teacher is a person to look up to, especially for young children, so it is very important that the teacher is well educated but is this the most important point about the job?

Firstly, it is good for a teacher being well educated but too much education can influence students negativly, even if someone knows well a subject he maybe can not explain it to the students. There is a big difference in knowing a subject well and explaining well a subject, not everyone can do this. So if the subject is known up to a high level the explications get very hard and not understandable.
Another point is that the real subject itself, known by the teacher, may be larger than the subject being taught. So there could be a big confusion by teaching too much or the wrong things and this would be very contraproductive. 
The last point is that if a teacher relates well with the students the learning is often easier because the students come to school happy, open to new things and with lust to learn. The teacher has a big influence on students and their capabilities to learn and understand new subjects. The better the relation between students and teacher the better the classes and exams.

To conclude, in my eyes a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. There are many negative things about knowing much about a subject and later teaching children or young adults this subject. There could be big confusions and bad marks as a result.
