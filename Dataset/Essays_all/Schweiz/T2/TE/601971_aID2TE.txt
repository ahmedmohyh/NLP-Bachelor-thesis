When I sarted school, or more precise kindergarden, my teachers name was miss Simmen. I and as far as I know everyone else could immediately relate with her. We saw her as a role model and what she said was right. Even tough we didn't learn anything nearly as complex as in todays school back then, we understood and accepted every single thing she tried to give us on the way. Surely we were influenced by our innocence but why isn't it possible in higher grades too? And more important is this even important? 

In our school, the Kanti Uster, every teacher is responsible for his subject. This makes sence since it would simply be impossible to have enough knowledge in every subject thaught in school. But this does not exclude the other and still I have the feeling that teachers and students drift more and more apart as they climb higher in their school-career. 

Since teachers are humans too I think it's possible to have a good relationship with them. If you get along well with eachother you listen better, you absorb the content far better being able to relate to the person you're talking with. Much better. Learning aside, it's far more enjoyable for both sides.

Now if you'd have to trade knowledge to gain some psychological abilities I'm sure it would be a hundred percent worth it. And even if a teacher could answer a question or two less, which I doubt, you would still be able to profit more from school.
