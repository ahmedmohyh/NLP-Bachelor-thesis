Is it more important to have a nice teacher who is friendly and you can relate to? Or is it more important to have a teacher who knows everything about a subject and is perfectly informed on what he or she is teaching? I believe this is a complicated question and it is not that easy to answer. Of course we all want funny und friendly teachers but what is more important?
Firstly I think that it is impossible to say one point is correct and the other one is fully false. If the teacher is well informed but can't relate with the students it will be a weird lesson and neither the students nor the teacher will have any fun. However if you can only relate to your teacher and you're not learning anything it won't be good for you either. In addition I believe that relating to a teacher won't automatically make you learn more. So both of the quotes can't be completely wrong so there has to be a mix between knowledge of a subject and being able to relate to students.
Furthermore it depends on which grade the students are in. Older students don't need to be able to relate to the teachers as well as younger students. The knowledge plays a bigger role in a older students life because he should be able to learn something without being able to relate as well to the teacher. On the otherside younger students don't need to learn a lot in a young age so the focus is set on relating to the teacher. Teachers should be able to see what is more appropriate for a class.
As a conclusion it would be perfect if a teacher could do both and then adjust his teaching method to each class. To do this he has have these two abilities but finally I don't agree with the statement because in older ages this isn't true anymore.
