I think it's important to give the teachers their freedom to teach how they want to teach. If they want to shine with a great knowledge and a rather "strong, hard" way of teaching that's fine because then they're authentic and if another teacher is just "cooler" and is more the "friend" kind of teacher who is supergood with all students that's good. Teachers should just be theirselves - I'm sure that's their biggest chance to be taken serious. Because students won't take anybody serious who they recognize is playing someone who they aren't. 
My opinion is that I think if a teacher relates well with his or her students, then they tend to show more interest on the teacher's subject and listen to the person way better than if they can't stand him or her. And if the people listen well, they'll be able to understand the most things better. But still: For sure it's important, that a teacher has an idea of what he or her is talking about, so they can also answer questions. But I think as a normal teacher at a high school for example it's not in need to have an excellent knowledge of the subject - you just have to be able to explain it in a more or less easy way.
