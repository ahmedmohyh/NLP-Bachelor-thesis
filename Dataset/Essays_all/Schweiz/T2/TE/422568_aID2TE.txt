A teacher's ability to relate with students is a often discussed question. One of the problem is that it differs on wich schoolniveau he is teaching. A primary school teacher needs better understanding about the psycholgy of a kid than a teacher in university. There is a huge difference between teaching a nice year old or a eighteen year old.

I need to specify. To relate well with kids is one of the most important abilities of a primaryschool teacher. His task is not only teaching mere math. His task is also to teach the kids morals and ethics even if it is indirectly. The parents are not the only persons who play a huge role in raising a child but also the teacher. After the parents the teacher is the one who is most in contact with the kid. Also it is a lot easier to make mistakes with kids when they are younger. You have to understand them otherwise you could in the worst case damage the kid mentally for the rest of his life. For example letting kids bully eachother. Especially younger kids tend to do that. 

The case is compeletely different for a high school teacher. His task is to greatly deepen the knowledge of a teenager and not to rear him well. High school teachers also need much better understanding in their subject. The extreme is a universtity teacher because he is working with full age students.

But in my oppinion the ability to relate well with students, is very important for teachers in every grade. When he hasn't got this ability the students will obviously not like him. For me as a student myself, i can't stand teachers who have no fine feel for teenagers.
