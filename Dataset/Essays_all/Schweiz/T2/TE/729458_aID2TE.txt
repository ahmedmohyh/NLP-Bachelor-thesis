Being a teacher means to bear a big responsability. You influence your students and so it's very improtant that you are well qualified. Two skills, which teacher have to have, are compared in this essay: be able to relate well with students and have a great knowledge of the subject you taught.  
A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

If the teacher can't relate well with students, the students aren't motivated to learn something in his subject. For  example I used to like chemistry and I wanted to study chemistry at the university but then I got a new teacher in this subject and he was mean to me and gave me very bad oral marks, so he couldn't relate well with me. Because of that I didn't like chemistry at all and I wasn't concentratet in the class and so I wrote worse marks. It wasn't a good time. The teacher had a very good knwledge of chemistry but that doesn't belong because I wasn't motivated and concentrated.

On the other hand it's very improtant that a teacher has enough knowledge of the subject he is teaching. When he can relate students well and all of the students are very motivated and really want to learn much but the teacher can't teach them more than what stand on the teacher's plan, it's also bad. Because these students want to learn but they can't and this isn't motivating as well.

I think it's very important to be able to relate well with students as a teacher but also to have good knowledge of the subject being taught. I think a teacher needs both of these skills. But I think it's a bit more important to be able to relate well with students than have an excellent knowledge of your subject. You cat't teach the students anything when they aren't motivated because you can't relate wih them well. But you can teach them at least a bit when you don't have an excellent knowledge of the subject you are teaching, but you can motivate your students for learning
