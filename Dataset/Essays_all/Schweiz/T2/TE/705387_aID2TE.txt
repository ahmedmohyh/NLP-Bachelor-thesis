The ability to relate well with students is very important for a teacher. The teacher is able to adapt his exercises and his explanations to be understood by his students. Furthermore, a good relation to the teacher often causes more motivation and in the end better marks. Sometimes is only a bit more motivation needed for a student to improve his skills.

But since school is meant to teach knowledge and to get pupils ready for the world of work, it is very important that the teachers know exactly what they are talking about. A techer who is not competent in the subject being taught is not going to help the students evelope their skills. And if a student does not have skills, he wont be succesful in findig a job or in starting up a buisness. Students only learn what teachers tell them. 

In my opinion, both of these two abilities are needed to be a good teacher. But not having excellent knowledge of the subject is still worse, especially in high level schools. For example in primary school, it would not be too bad, if a teacher was not that competent. As long as he knows how to handle the diffrent types of children and how to help them in learning, he is doing his job pretty well. But for example in highschool a great knowledge is needed to prepare the students properly. Ability to relate with the pupils may help a lot, depending on the person, but in the end does it not bring any knowledge to the students. 
To sum up, i would say, the knowledge of the teacher is the most important thing, but the ability to relate with students may lead to better results and supports the pupils in any ways.
