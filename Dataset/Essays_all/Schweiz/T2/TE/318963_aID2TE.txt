Who does not know the situation as a student, when you have arrived to class too late and the teacher is very mad about it. This shows how concentrated to their own subject teachers are. But now there is the question if the school life would be easier if teacher would more relate with the students or would it just make everything more difficult? 

For me as a student it is crucial that the teacher sometimes forgets that he or she is a teacher and sometimes just relates wih the student. This would have an positive impact to the teacher as well as to the student, since the student would feel much more comfortable in class and school in general. As I told before the teacher has also some advantages of it, due to the increasing concentration of the students. As a result the teacher enjoys more to give class and the students enjoy to sit in class and learn something new. 

On the other hand, it is hard for the teacher to relate with the student. Not only the age gap between teacher and student is too big, but students are also known to come up with an excuse for everything. Nevertheless, the teacher can not always estimate correctly if the student for example was actually ill or not. 

To sum up, it is essential for the teacher to relate with the student, due to the opened comfort zone between them. I can only talk out of experience that it is much more easier to learn for a subject or concentrate in class if the teacher relates with your problems in class or anywhere else.
