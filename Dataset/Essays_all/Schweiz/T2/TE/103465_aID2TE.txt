I think it really is important that the teachers have a good relationship with their students and that he can relate with them. It makes it much more fun for them to go to the class and they will study more and get to the informations, they need, faster and better. For example if a teacher, that I like, tells me something that I didn't know before, it's more likely that I will look it up and learn about it, as if a teacher, I don't like, would tell me the same thing. 
Also if the students like the teacher and his class it makes it easier for him to teach the students because it's more likely that they are calm and interessted in what he says and in what he teaches them. So it is a better situation for both sides. 
But on the other hand if the teacher has no knowledge the students can't learn from him and the relation is automatically bad. So in my opinion these two characteristics of a teacher are in a way connected. Of course right now we (the students) would also like a teacher that is funny and nice but later on we will remeber the teachers that taught us the most. 
As you can see a good teacher needs knowledge which he can pass on to his students and the ability to relatewith his students. So like I said in my opinion both characteristics are important to be a good teacher.
