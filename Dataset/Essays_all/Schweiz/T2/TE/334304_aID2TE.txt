Teachers are supposed to specify on a certain subject in order to teach this later on. But is it more important that teachers can relate with the students rather than have an excellent knowledge of the subject they're teaching?

First of all, a teacher should definitely enjoy teaching and sharing her/his knowledge with other people, in this case students, which would automatically lead to a good teacher-students relationship. Students feel more comfortable and are more willing to go to school when they know they can trust and get on well with their teacher. In this way, a lot of the students would show more interest in the subject and at the end, the results would most likely be better. 

But what should teachers teach their students, if they don't have an excellent knowledge of the subject that is being taught? Of course there are some things you can teach even if you don't have an excellent knowledge, but questions from the students will come up and if the teacher, who is supposed to know everything about this subject, can't answer this questions because of a lack of knowledge, who will? Students are suppposed to learn from the teacher but if the teacher herself/himself can't provide the adequated information, even if the teacher-student relationship is good, it just won't work. 

In my opinion, a good balance between both the ability to relate well and the excellent knowledge is necessary in order to be a good teacher. This way students can show their interest as well as learn something new and true from the teacher, which ends up being a win-win situation.
