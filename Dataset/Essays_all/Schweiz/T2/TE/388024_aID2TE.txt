The ability of teachers is a hotly- debated issue and does not seem to come to one solely solution. As the main task for teachers is to, quite obviously, teach students more about certain topics, you might well had at least on teacher in your school career that certainly knew a lot about his subject but not about students.

First of all, we all know that knowledge is something that nobody will ever be able to take away from you, something inheritent and something you may explore yourself or quite common to at least some bits through school. What for should we go to school, if not for a teacher who will be able to impress us with his knowledge and maybe enables us to understand why he or she is so passionate about a topic? But that will only work, if the teacher really knows what he is talking about and doesn't just do his reaserch the night before on Wikipedia.

On the other hand all passion and knowledge of a teacher for or of its subject won't help the students in getting better, if the teacher cannot present the information in a conventient and understandable way. This requires a high ability of the teacher to actually relate to what the students might be thinking or are able to take out of a lesson. Another important point is to understand and know the students' capacity of processing new information, in order to set up a manageable schedule and curriculum.

After all it can be said, that of course the teachers ability to relate well with students is of high importance. But in my eyes it's rather blatant to leave the knowledge of the subject behind, as we don't necessarily go to school to be understood or to relate to teachers, but to gain knowledge and hopefully leave one day, ready for life and whatever it may bring to us.
