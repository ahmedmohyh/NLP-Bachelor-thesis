A teacher not having the ability to relate with the students or not having extensive knolwedge on the subject being taught are often points for criticism. The question is, which of the two factors is more important for the progress and education of the students.

If a techer does not have excellent knowledge about the subject being taught, the danger occures of not teaching the students the right things and not making links clear enough. If this is the case, students will have trouble with understanding further additions to the topic. Also, the teacher will not be able to answer any further questions the students may have that go beyond the teaching plan. For example,a student who is very interested in the subject being taught will be disappointed if the teacher cannot anser his or her questions. Or the teacher might get confused while teaching and muddle up the information, which will prevent the students from getting a clear overview of the topic.

On the other hand, one could argue that if a teacher is not able to relate and connect with the students, then all the knowledge in the world could not help the students to understand the subject. The students will be less motivated to learn and frustrated when they do not understand what the teacher is trying to tell them. The knowledge of the teacher could not be given to the students. Furthermore, knowledge is not everything and a teacher should make sure that the students are taken care for emotionally as well.

I think that the ability to relate with the students is a more important skill than having far reaching knowledge about the subject being taught. Although an ideal situation would be for the teacher to have both, a good connection to the students is essential to convey the knowledge. While knowledge can be aquired, an understanding relation to the students has to come first.
