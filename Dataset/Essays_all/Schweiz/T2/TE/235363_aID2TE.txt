If teachers would relate well with their students, the students would pay more attention and would be more interested in the subject or better the subjects. So they would get better marks. On the otherside if teachers don't have excellent knowledge students won't learn enough so they might struggle later in their lifes because of that. If teachers are able to relate well with their students it's easier for evrybody, because then nobody has an anti position to this subject, it's fun for the teacher to teach and the students are motivated for these lessons and aren't annoyed. But it's also important to consider that if teachers want respect from their students it's impossible that they don't have a great knowledge because then students might know more then their teacher, so they couldn't work seriously with that person anymore. I don't really have an opinion about this topic, because I think even more important than the above is that evryone is treated with respect and is open so everyone is comfortable and feels good. Because then they could communicate open and the students wouldn't dislike their teachers as much anymore and the teachers wouldn't be that anoyed anymore by their students.
