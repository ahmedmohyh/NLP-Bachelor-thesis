In this essay I am going to talk about teachers and their realations towards students. And if knowledge is more important than this realation.

Knowledge is very important for a teacher but he does not need to know the topic perfect. There are various things that a teacher might not answer a stundent during a lession. He needs to look it up for the next lession for sure. But it's not important to answer every single question during the lession. He needs a good knowledge of the topic but not a perfect one. As an example I asked my biology teacher so much stuff she could not answer half of it. But she looked it up for the next lession and simply gave me the answer later.

The relation towards students is far more important than the excellent knowledge of a topic because for a student to lear something he needs to  feel well during the lessions. With a bad relation you are allready working against this feeling pretty hard. The best inviroment for a student is when he is happy. With a good relation the whole lession is more relaxed and the stundents as well as the teacher are not under tension. This makes the students feel good and acepted. For example our class had an argument with our history teacher and we all were very angry. The next lessions were strange because he did not talk to us he just made us watch a film. After two or three weeks we talked in a small group and it was revealed that we were mistaken and were not even talking about the same. Ater this he was happy again and the quality of the lessions increased drasticly. Our relation is this good that we are going to eat pizza at his place. And he said since this little incident we are the best class he ever had. Our averege mark went up 0.5 during two test.

As a conclusion you can say that a good relation towards the students is by far more important than the excellent knowledge. So I agree with this statement.
