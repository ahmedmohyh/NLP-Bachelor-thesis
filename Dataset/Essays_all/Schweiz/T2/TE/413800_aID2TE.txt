We all have a teacher we didn't like but he has an excellent knowledge of the subject and we also have one teacher we admire a lot even though he isn't the best in his job. What is more important? To have a teacher you like or not? I say clearly it is better for the students if he or she has a huge knowledge than be a nice person.

In the end of the career in school it isn't important that you liked all your teachers it is important what you learned in the 12 years. But on the other hand if you didn't have a sort of connection to your teacher how can you learn good enough to pass the matura? It could be more neccessary to have a good relationship that a huge knowledge to be fit for the final exams. If you're interessted in the subject you do something for your mark and who could teach the subject better than a sympathic person?

Especially for the young students it's more important to have a sympathic and trustful authoritiy person in front of the class than an old and grumpy teacher with a huge knowledge. As older as the children get it is less important to have a teacher with the abilitiy to relate well with students. You can handle the situation better and you can learn something new also without the help from a teacher.

But in the end it make a big difference how the students think and how they need to be taught. And it depense a lot from studetn to student. There isn't one solution because all students are different and you can't make it wright for everyone.
