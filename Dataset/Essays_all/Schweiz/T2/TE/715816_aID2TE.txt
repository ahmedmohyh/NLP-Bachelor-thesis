The aim of this essay, is to discuss the question if it is more important that a teacher can relate well with students, than it is for him or her to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

Especially students who are in their teenage years, can often be rebellious and tend to dislike their teachers, if they are way older than them, because these people often can not relate to their students as much as younger teachers could, simply because of the age difference and their different opinions which are often formed by the society they grew up in. Therefore, students tend to prefer younger teachers, because they are more likely to be able to relate well with their students. And if the students like their teacher, they probably will feel more comfortable coming to class and taking part in things like class discussions etc. This will most likely significantly improve their grades and self esteem.

On the other hand, it is not enough to just be able to relate well with your students as a teacher. You also need to be able to communicate and teach your subject well and that is impossible without an excellent knowledge of the subject you are teaching. So, a teacher should definitely have studied or at least collected experience in the subject being taught, before starting to teach. 

To sum up, I do not fully agree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because I think, that it is important to have a good mixture of both as a teacher. You should have a decent amount of knowledge of your subject and you should also be able to relate to your students well. If you have both of these qualities, I think, you will make a very good teacher who will be liked by students as well as teacher colleagues.
