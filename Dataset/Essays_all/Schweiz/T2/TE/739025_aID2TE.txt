The first things that come to my mind are how strong our teachers relate to the students. This is realy different by teacher and by subject. When we have to work on our owns you don't feel the attention of the teacher anyways. So is the knowledge more important?
First of all I think it depends by the grade on which the teacher is working. In primeri-class it is for example more important to relate with the students because they have to be thought also social skills and the rules in ouer society. In higher-classes it is important to have both. It is necesary for the children to learn sientific things as also behaveior. In university the professors are in need of excellent knowlege because the students need knowlege tought and not behavior or how to conduct in society.
But I want to add, a teacher, who can relate good to the students has got an easier job on every level of schooling, because when you understand the point of the students you can make the lesson how it fits the students, which helps you to have their attention. 
On the other hand what do you want to teach without any knowlege? Theres nothing to do for you, if you are not abel to teach the students anything you can't make a lesson. 
As you can see from the previous arguments, I think it's important to be abel to relate to the students and to have knowlege. The ability to relate is like the street to the students for the camions who transport the knowlege. The camion has a hard way without the road and the road is useless without camions driving over it. So thers not the only one that counts, both abilitys are important for a teacher to educate the students well.
