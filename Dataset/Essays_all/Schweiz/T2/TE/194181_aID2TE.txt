The statement raises the question wheather it's more important for teacher to be well-informed about the subject or if the ability to relate well with students is of higher importance. According to the person who wrote the statement, being able to relate to the pupils is more crucial. But is that really the case?

The first contradiction that comes to mind is the fact that teachers have to teach, thus needing to educate others about the matter. It's no secret that in order to be able to teach well, one must have extended knowledge about the topic being taught. For example, a teacher should be able to answer questions regarding the subject, also if the answer is not needed for the exam. As a bonus, interested students can suck up the extra information and widen their horizons even more.

However, one might say that a good relation with the stundents is more critical for successful teaching. When a teacher knows what's going on in their stundents' heads, they can address problems or, to some degree, adapt lessons to the stundets' interests. Learning is easier and more fun if the topic is appealing. Students will also enjoy lessons more if the teacher is likeable and thus pay more attention to the lessons. (In some cases they are also more likely to even attend lessons if they like the style of teaching.)

In my opinion a mixture of both the ability to relate to the stundets and good knowledge about the topic are key to successful teaching. A teacher that might be very close to the students, but is not very well-informed will fail just as badly as one who knows everything about the topic but has no idea what's going on in their stundets' minds. It can also be said that it depends on the type of education. If we look at kids going to primary school, it's of more significance that the children feel understood. On the other hand, the teachers knowledge is more important in universities.
