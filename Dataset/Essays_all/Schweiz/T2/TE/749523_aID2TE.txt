Knowing isn't teaching. To be fully informed about a subject doesn't equal being able to bring students to a good understanding of said topic. Even though profound knowledge is necessary to become a successful teacher it isn't everything you need.

First and foremost a good basic knowledge of a subject is required to teach others about it. You can't make others understand a complex math equation if you don't understand it yourself. You can only respond to questions in an adequate manner as long as you have thoroughly gone through the process of aqcuiring this knowledge yourself.

Nevertheless, knowing thousands of historical dates and all the relations of world politics is not going to get you far as a teacher. Teachers are helpers. They are supposed to give aid and to lend a hand to everybody who isn't as quick to grasp the information. Teachers ought to be able to relate to their class and communicate well.
Additionally, what can't be neglected is that the teacher needs to understand how his students work, how they think and in what way they best understand and learn in order to quide students through the most efficient learning process.

Teachers are in some way tools to build the future generation. They are used to build bases of knowledge bridges relating subjects. What makes a good teacher is his ability to keep up your attention, to generate interest, and to make you learn easily. Otherwhise they could be binned. Nobody likes being planless and confused. Or do you?
