In this essay I've to support my thesis that a better relationship to his teacher will bring more improvement. First I'll tell the points against my thesis and than I'll come to my points suporting it.

First of all a good ability to relate to their students won't improve your language if we're talking about languages. For example our french teacher has a much better relationship to us students than the english teacher. But we haven't improved our language at all. That causes the problem that we have our matura exam in french in three weeks and we really don't know if we're gonna pass the test.

But a teacher with a better ability to relate to their students will better taught his knowledge because all students are interested in english.
That leads me perfectly to point supporting my thesis. A better relationship to a teacher will improve your english more than only a techer, who has a big knowledge and also taught this to his students. I've got also an example for this point. Namely in biology the teacher has relationship to us but he is much more tuff than the french teacher and that brings also a big improvement and good marks because all students are interested in his knowledge and knows if they talk during the lesson they've to bring a cake. But we can't generalize this point because it also depends on your interests at all. 

To sum up a good relationship is important and good for the students but if the teacher is to friendly to his students it would be counterproductive.
