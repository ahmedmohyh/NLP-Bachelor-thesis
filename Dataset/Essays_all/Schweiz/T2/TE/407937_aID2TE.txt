Everyone visited school but not all had the same experience. Specially the teachers, who were not loved by every student, could give nightmares to some people. But sometmes they tought you some very important stuff that you may kept in your mind. That's why, it's important that the teacher knows his subject even though he isn't the nicest one. 
To be a teacher is a very hard task because they must show responsibility and educate the kids at the same time. But sometimes, there are some students who will not like you because you are to strict with them. For me the rejection is the best why to see if your methods are good because humans are lazy and when they see that they have to work than its cristal clear that they will protest. It's more the hard work that bothers than the techer's personality.

In the future, it will be easier for the student when he has knowledge in his office because we live in a society where we have to work and it's like "survive of the fittest" but more in a pressure kind of way. Everyone is replaceable nowadays and so it's importent to have knowledge to survive in the markt. The teachers want to avoid that you will lose in the future, so they have to be strict.

It's important that the teachers know what they teach because there work is to prepare the students for the future, so they will have a work and to learn how to survive.
