Pro arguments:
The way a teacher relates with his students is an important psychological point. If the students get on well with the teacher, the class is more interesting and the students are propably more active during it. I personally know this situation. If the subject is very boring, a easy-going teacher can make the difference. In this case, the teacher builds an discussion with the students, he`s not gonna have just one of those presentations where he is the only person who speaks. Thats a very bad way to treat a subject. The students and the teacher can have a well argumentated discussion which is very interesting, not only for the teacher. 

Contra arguments:
Even tho the relation between the students and the teacher is important for an interesting class, the teacher should as well and of course have a specialized knowledge in his subject. I mean, he is an specialist in what he does, and what he does is to teach. His job is not to have a good relationship with his students, it is to teach the students the right stuff, that they learn something in school. Furthermore, the students have to know the important things later in live.

All in all I can say from my personal experience, that it is rather more important for students to have a good and an interesting class with the teacher, than learning something important during it. It is also very dependable from the subject and from the teacher, of course. 

y tho?
bcuz!
