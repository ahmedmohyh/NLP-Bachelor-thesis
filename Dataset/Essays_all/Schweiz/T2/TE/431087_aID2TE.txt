A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught:
Our class had two teachers who were in their education when they were taughing us. I liked them both very much. They were young, funny and explained the things in a way i could understand it not like  all the other teachers. But this two had to go to gratuate at their university. So the teachers changed and we all realized, that the two young teachers just did the half of the stuff with us from the stuff they had to taught us. The new teachers had  to start very stressed beacause they had to explain us many stuff in a short time. And now I don't love these two subject in the way i loved it before. But with the new teachers I definitely learn more but I don't understand it as good as before. So for me the ability to relate well with students is more important. But of course the two young teachers should have learn wirh us the whole stuff. And I think they would have managed it when they had an excellent knowledge of the subject they taught.
I think an excellent knowledge is not necessary a long as the students don't realize it. Becaus then the teachers wouldn't be taken so serious. We had such a situation in my secondary school. The french teacher couldn't explain anything and I think I still feel that now when I have french with my new frenchteacher who has french as their motherlanguage.
So I think it depends on the exactely situation. In which school and which niveau. But the perfect circumstancies to learn something is a teacher with the ability to relate with students and have a good knowledge in their subject. Then it's easy for the students to trust totally in the teacher.
