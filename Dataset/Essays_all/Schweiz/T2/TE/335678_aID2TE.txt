Yes I think this statement is true.

One argument for this ist, that it`s easyer for students to learn if the teacher has this ability. So the teacher knows how students think, how they can memorise the stuff they have to learn faster and how he has to teach the stuff.
With this ability the teacher has also a better connention to the students. If he can think like a student he may knows the difficulties and were he has to explain it more precisely and were he has to give the students more time.
And if this points are reached the students may like to go to school because they know that the teacher in front of them can feel with them. I cant talk from personal experiences. My Physic-teacher just taught the stuff in a way I really didn`t understand. No, I have to be honest. Nobody understood something. He just stood in front of us. He had a enormous knowledge bu ha hadn`t the ability ro relate well wirh us. So in the end ha had to deal with our bad marks.

The disadvantages are, that the teacher may forgets the importance of the learning stuff. So he focus more on thinking as a student than teaching the right thing. If this happens the students got to know false informations and that would be something bad for their future. And another aspact is, that a teacher ist still a teacher and the students are students. The teachers are there to teach their subject and the students are there to learn something. So the relation between student and teacher shouldn`t be like between friends.

To sumerise the whole thing I think that it`s more important that the teacher has the ability to relate well with students because if the students feel understood they will lern everything easyer than if in front of them stands a teacher who doesn`t understands the students and their problems. For this reasons I think the statement is absolutely true.
