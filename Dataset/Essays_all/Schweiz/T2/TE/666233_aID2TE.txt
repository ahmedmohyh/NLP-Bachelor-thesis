We already had a lot of teachers in the whole schoolperiod. But there are alway teachers the students like more and others which are less liked by the students. But what does it use that a teacher is a "good teacher"?

To answer this question we have to think about the most important things that a teacher should learn their students. The most obvious thing is the knowledge in the specific subject that the techer should teach to the students. But there are a lot of other important things which children have to learn in school age. An enample is how to live with oher students or to learn methodsabout how to learn efficient. But what is the more important part for a student? What does a perfect teacher now look like, which skills shoul he or she have? 

The tatement that is given isn't a statement which you culd answer witch a simply "no" or "yes". To relate well with students and an excellent knowledge do both have their advantages and disadvantages. First it's important which age the students have. because in the age of the promary school the students have to learn things like how to get on well with the others and how they could learn in the best way. At this age its more learning about live and the learning material isn't that important. At this age it's important that the teacher is able to relate well with the students and he or she should also be able to motivate them. 

But later when the students get older they should already know how they could learn in a efficient way and they should also be able to motivate teirselves for studying. But it could be a teacher which is very good in his subject but the lessons nevertheless are very boring when the teacher isn't able to communicate in a good way with the students.

It is used both. but in a younger age in my opinion the ability to relate with the student's maybe really
