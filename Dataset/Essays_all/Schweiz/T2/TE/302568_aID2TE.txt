It is a common believe that students get a better mark when they have a good relationship with a teacher. in fact this believe is true because the teacher can connect better with the students and may help them better to understand   the subject. The teacher's ability to relate well with the students is also important to create a good vibe in class which makes it more easier to learn and understand something. Another point is that teacher understand the students personality better when they have a good relationship, so they could help them more in different cases and show them that they are interested in them. 

On the other hand it is important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because the students understand the subject better if they know more details. It is also important that students got a deeper view into a subject to avoid just some small knowledge. This is a very important task for the teachers, because it is very important to have a deep knowledge of an subject. 

In my opinion both aspects are very important for a students good education. A teacher which relate well with students but hasn't an excellent knowledge of a subject isn't very good to students education, because he may not answer students questions. But on the other hand a teacher wich an excellent knowledge of the subject but without a good relationship with the students isn't good too,because he the students may not get the informations the teacher taught.
