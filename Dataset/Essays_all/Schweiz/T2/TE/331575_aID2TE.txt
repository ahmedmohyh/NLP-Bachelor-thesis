For a very long time, teachers have always been a good example for the children and someone they can look up to. Even tough teachers have been much more strict in the past, their students were always impressed by them. Teachers have to have an excellent knowledge of the subject that they are teaching in order to make sure the students learn something. But a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject.

First of all, teachers have to be educated in their subject and also have an excellent knowledge of it. If not, how could they teach the subject? In my opinion, teachers have to have a good knowledge especially in higher schoolclasses like for example in college. Professors have to be very inteligent in order to teach the students because they are already mature and know a lot. Compared to lower schoolclasses like primary school, where teachers just have to know the basics to teach a subject.

Secondly, a teachers ability to relate with the students is a very important point. Most of all with young students because they depend on a teacher they get along with well. If there is not a good relation to these people, they are not willing to learn from them. On the one hand, a teachers ability to relate well with the students is very important especilly if they are young. On the other hand, this aspect is not overall important to some students. I do believe that college students do not alwys relate well with their teachers but although they accept them and learn something.

In conclusion, a teachers ability to relate with the students as also a good knowledge of the subject is very important in order to be a good teacher. In my opinion, it depends on how old the students are. The older they are, the more they can relate to one of the two statements.
