Is the a teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? 

Students can learn more from a teacher they like and they relate well with than from one they hate. The interest from the students of a subject is then bigger. They want to learn something from the teacher and they are better listener.

The excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is also very important. If the students listen and believe what the teacher tells than they could learn a wrong thing. The wrong taughed thing about a subject could have a massive influence in the students future life. They first would have to learn the wright thing before they could learn more from the suject. Of course there are subjects in which a wrong teached thing woouldn't be that bad but there are some subject in which it would be really bad. For example in the subject maths it would have a big influence to the knowledge of a student.

I think the teacher's ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is very important. There should be a good balance between the two things. But the excellent knowledge of the subject from the teacher is getting more important the higher the school level is. But also the basic knowledge of a subject is very important that it's being taught right and with no mistakes. The teachers in lower school levels have more contact with the students than at a University. The ability to relate well with the students is there more important than in a University.
