A teacher has all the knowledge of the subject you're listening in the classroom you're sitting right know. A teacher has an answer to all your questions of that subject. A teacher should not be the students friend. Having a good relation with your students comes second but first counts that the teacher is best at what he teaches his students.

First of all a teacher has worked hard for the job he is doing and knows everything about that one subject he has his bachelor and master in. A teacher probably has studied four years to be at the knowledge he is now in this particular subject therefore I think his knowledge should be appreciated and a new teacher should be chosen by his experience and knowledge of the subject.

Secondly a teacher doesn't have to be a students best friend. The teacher should be the one helping his students by teaching what they are best at and improving their scolar career. Students are in high school because they want to learn and because they are interested. A teacher who knows exactly what he is talking about is the best push for students to have.

On the other hand it is improving for the class when a teacher gets on well with the students, understands them in a way and knows what to say although he does not have all the answer and the knowledge of a teacher that has it excellentaly. The students don't want to disappoint a person they like for example a teacher who relates well with them and therefore they are willing sometimes to make more of an effort if they like the person in the front  teaching them.

In conclusion a teacher should have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught because although it is good for both the teacher and the students to have a good relation it's more important that the teacher knows what he is talking about. Most of the students are willing to learn and give an effort in subjects they are interested in and want to be good at and a really good teacher can make any subject interesting.
