In our society, education is one of the most important things leading to a successful career. How students learn best is an issue that is discussed all over the world. The ways of teaching is relevent for everyone; parents, teachers, students and employers. Education ensures that there is no decline in the stanards of society. Whether teachers need to be able to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject is a really controversial question.

If a teacher can relate to students they are more likely to listen and pay attention in his class and therefore they learn more and better. Having fun in a lesson and finding it interesting also leads to the students faster picking up facts and remembering them better. Therefor the overall performance of the students is better and they are much more motivated to study and to learn new things.

In contrary to that a teacher just having excellent knowledge but not being able to relate to the students is not an efficient teacher since in order to bring knowledge to others you need to be able to motivate them and to get their attention. Not being able to do that leads to students not enjoying the class and therefor to an decline in the achievement they make.

In conlusion I think that a combination of the two is what makes an excellent teacher but in general my personal opion is that it's more important to be able to relate to students and have empathy for their situation and how they see things. Only in that way a teacher can learn and also improve his class and what he tries to teach the students. The school curriculum is something that teachers can't adjuste but what they can is adjuste the way in how they teach it.
