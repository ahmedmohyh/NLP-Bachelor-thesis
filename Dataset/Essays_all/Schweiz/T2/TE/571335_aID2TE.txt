This theme is quite a difficult subject, as two key elements of education are being opposed to one another.
However, both have their merits and flaws, which I will now discribe.

For the teacher to understand and relate to the students is a key element of education, as it motivates students to like the teacher and thus making them want to go to class with him/her as a teaching instance. It is also important that the teacher has a rough idea of how the students feel while studying a subject. If the teacher is oblivious to the fact, that the students don't understand the subject, or if he simply can't understand why they don't get the theme, the group comes to an impass which is very hard to overcome.

It has to be said, that without excellent knowledge of the subject, the teacher can't fulfill his role in his line of work. To be able to teach someone, one must have accumulated enough knowledge to apporach the teaching method in different ways, to suit each individuals learning experience. If the teacher is not able to deliver the core information to the students in a comprehensive manner, the teacher is not capable of successfully doing his job. This might sound a bit harsh, but it's the truth.

That I disagree with the statement can be quite easily seen in my last statement. I think that it's nice to have a teacher who understands the problems of his students, while at the same time enticing his students to come to his class. However, it is more important that the students have a teacher who can competently teach them what the school standard requires them to know. The mentality of "you are here to study, not tho have fun fun", which we are often told at many educational facilities, correlates with this theme. I have to say, that the ideal case would be, if the teacher is sympathetic and knows his teaching subject in depth, however if I had to choose a quality, I would prefer excellent knowledge and a good learning experience over a friendly teacher.
