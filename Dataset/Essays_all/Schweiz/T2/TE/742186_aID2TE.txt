There are many discussions of how the teachers should teach students at school and which ability of a teacher is important. For example is it more important that he relate well with students or that he has an excellent knowledge about his subject?

The function of a teacher is to teach the students in their specific subject. If the teacher has not an excellent knowledge of the subbject he is teaching then how can the students learn important and difficult materials? If the teacher is not qualified enough for teaching his subject his students cannot learn it really.

If a teacher has an excellent konwledge about his subject then it often happens that for him everything seems to be so easy and because of that he cannot understand the students problems. It is very important that the students understand what their teachers teach them. A teacher who gets along very well with his students may understand the problems of the students better.

In my point of view a teacher should certainly have a good knowledge about the subject he is teaching because otherwise the students cannot learn something from him but I think that the ability to relate well with students is more important. If a teacher has this ability he may understand the problems of the students better.
