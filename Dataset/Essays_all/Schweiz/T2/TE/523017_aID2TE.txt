The realation between teachers and students is very important. It affects the atmosphere during the lessons positivly  and this is essential for the motivation of the students. But most of the time not characters and personalities are essential points for an employment because employers prefer to employ people with an ecellent knowledge. Hardly can we say, that employers only care about the knowledge. 

Knowledge is the base of everything.How should someone be able to teach others without knowing about what he or she speaks. If lessons are well prepared and organised the motivation of the students will rise automatically. Realtions are important but it is even more important that students get thaught to get on with people they might don't like. 

Motivation is a result of achievement, achievments are a result of a good structer before tests and having a good structured mind is depending on how teachers design their lessons

I like to have a good relation with my teachers because it makes me happy to go to the school and keeps me motivated althought I might hate the subject.
