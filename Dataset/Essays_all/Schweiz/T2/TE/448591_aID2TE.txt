Every teacher that I know has an exellent knowledge about their subject. If they didnt have an excellent knowledge, they would not have passed the exam of becoming a teacher. There is no point of asking this question.
 
It's nice to have, if the teacher can relate well with the students but like I said, it's not needed. We are in school to learn something. In this case it's totally irrelevant how the relation between teacher and students is because if you listen carefull you will learn something and if you don't care, it's your problem if you get a bad mark or the teacher doesn't treat you well or the same like the other students.
Someties it would be more interesting if the teacher coud relate better with the students but I don't think that this is a big aspect in teaching a subject.

I don't even want to write more about this subject. But it seems like I have to. I just don't get it, how someone could say somehing like that. They would not have become a teacher, if they didn't know as much as they had to.
