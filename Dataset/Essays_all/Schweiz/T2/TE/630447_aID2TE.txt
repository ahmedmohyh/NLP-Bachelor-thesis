Is it more important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or the teachers ability to relate well with students?

I think it is very important that a teacher has an ability to relate well with students. Not many teachers have that in these days. There are many teachers who have an excellent knowledge of the subject which they teach to the students but they are really bad at teaching it to them. They have no idea how they should interact with students. Many teacher mostly stand in the front of the class and want to teach them something about an topic but they don't do it with pleasure. The students can feel that immediately. They don't have any delight to listen to the teacher. So it is unnecessary that the teacher stands in front and sacrifice his time. So it is very importnant to also have a good relation with students. It is also easier for the students to ask the teacher about something which they don't understand because they don't have to be embarassed when they have a good relation with the teacher.

In conclusion, I can say that I agree with the following statement.
