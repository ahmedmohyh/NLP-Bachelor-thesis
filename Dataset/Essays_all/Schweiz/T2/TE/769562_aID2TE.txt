A teacher teaching a subject without having the ability to relate well with students but having an excellent knowledge of the subject is just as useless as a teacher teaching a subject with having the ability to relate well with students but not having an excellent knowledge of the subject. This statement is one stamtement to argue about but which of those two aspects are more important? This essay shows main arguments about this topic.

First of all, what is a teacher good for if he doesn't know a lot about his subject that he teaches. Why would a teacher be hired if he doesn't know anything about his subject? If you hired any kind of people as a teacher by this criteria you could hire anybody. You can even put a tree in front of a class. So what a dumbass statement that is.

If a school hired teachers just by their ability to relate well with students school wouldn't  make any sense any more because just by that all teachers would be hired to be best friends with the students and what is the point of that?

So what is important then? There needs to be a good balance between the ability to relate well with students and an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. In this way the teacher will be most effective in teaching his students and they will learn most and profit as much as they could.
