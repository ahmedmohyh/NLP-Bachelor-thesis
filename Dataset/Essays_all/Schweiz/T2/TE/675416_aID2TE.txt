A university professor has a new work position in an elementary school,where he teaches mathematics. He had the best certification in his university in the year he gratuated, so he actually has a lot of knowledge. But when he's teaching the nine to twelve year old children, they are not understanding anything at all. It's just like if they would live in a diffrent universum. 

This example shows, that the knowledge is only the second important thing of being a good teacher. What is even more important is that you as a teacher can connect with the kids and you can understand how they can learn the best way possible. If you aren't able to understand the question a stundent asks you, how should this student ever make a progress in learning? Never. He will be stuck at the same point where his brain isn't functioning as the one from the teacher. In the worst case he even would be called dump only because his teacher isn't able to help him. 

On the other hand we need to see, that somebody who doesn't know anything at all, is also uncapeable to explain anything to a student. As fundation to even become a teacher there must be some kind of knowledge, if not there won't be the ability for the students to learn anything at all. Or at least they would't learn stuff from a actual subjet like maths, german, biology. 

To sum up, you can't be a good teacher if you only have either the excellent knowledge or the ability to relate well with students. The balance between both of them would form the perfect teacher. For me personally, I think i can say that the ability to relate with students is a bit more important, because I'm a lot more motivated to learn if someone can connect with me an give me the answers to my questions. If a teacher is able to do this I would also understand if they mabey had a litte less knowledge, or mabey even unnecessairy knowledge.
