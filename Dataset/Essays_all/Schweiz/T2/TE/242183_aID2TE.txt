A teacher normally has to know everything surrounding their subject and be able to teach their clase well in it. But if they are able to understand the way their students think isn't that even better?

If a teacher is able to relate with their students, they usually like the teacher more. As a result they prefer the subject and are more interested in it as well they listen more carefully. In that way you can talk to your teacher on the same level and not be discriminated by them or feel less important. 
Knowledge does matter though because students are in school to learn relevant things and if teachers and students can not understand each other most of the time it has a negative outcome.

It should be possible for teachers to combine both things. If they are able to relate with their students they will eventually teach even better. Because if you can understand your oponent and still tell about your subject in a way everyone can understand, than you are a better teacher than a lot of others. 

In the other way I think it is actually more important to have an excllent knowledge in the subject they teach, because as long it is told interesting and they can catch the students attention it is not about relating to them rather being able to teach well and effective.
