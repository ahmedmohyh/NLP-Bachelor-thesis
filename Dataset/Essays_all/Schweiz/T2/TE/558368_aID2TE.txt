Teachers's abilitiy or the excellent knowledge ot the subject?

As we know it's really important that students learn something in the lessons. But what's more important? The excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or a techer's ability to relate well with students? In this essay I will try to explain what I think about that and what's really better for a students.

Nowadays teachers don't have a easy job because it has to be hard to teach students who don't want to learn something or are lazy.  But the excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught is more important for their future. The reasy why the excellent knowledge ot the subject  is better for live in general is that they need good marks to find a good job. And this is impossible if they just have a good relationship with the reacher. These students need to think about their life because their life will go on and it's worthless to visit a school and learn nothing in the lessons. However this is too hard for students because they are young and can't understand that the life is not easy. In the future they will have many problems because, as we know already,finding the right job is not easy.


In my opinion the excellent knowledge is more important because students don't need a a good relationship with the teacher. They have to do something for their future and they can use their knowledge of the subject everywhere. For instance, if a student have chosen the language spanish as a subject, the student can go to another country on own, understand the people there and speak with them. This is an evidence that a teacher's ability to relate with students is not more important.
