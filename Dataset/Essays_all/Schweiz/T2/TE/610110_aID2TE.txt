I disagree with this statement. 

On one hand it's very important for the teacher to relate well with is students because the students are then maybe more concentrated and silent in the lessons. They don't want to dsturb their nice teacher, who is always very kind. On the other hand it could be problematic for a teacher to don't have a good knowedge about the subject. The reasons why it could be probleatic is that if the students remark that their teacher has not the ability to teach them the subect well and foundaded they are no more interested in his lessons and begin to do play with their mobile phone during the lesson.To say that the teachers ability to relate with students is more important than te excellent knowledge is wrong. The perfect solution is a combination of boh things. If the teacher has a goood relaton to his students he is accepted and he can do his kessons probably more relaxed beacuase the students like him and dont want to go on his nerves.But the knowledge of the subject must have the same importance than the relation between teacher and students. If the teacher has both abilities the students want to learn something and if they learn it correctly they can maybe use it in the future.To conclude I would say the most important thing is that the students learn the subject well and then comes the relation. Maybe you go to a teacher for four or less years, afterwards it only counts which knowledge you have and not the relation with your teacher. I do not hink tha somebody has achieved something because he had a good relationship to his teacher. The most imortant thing is ability to leran an knowledge o the things
