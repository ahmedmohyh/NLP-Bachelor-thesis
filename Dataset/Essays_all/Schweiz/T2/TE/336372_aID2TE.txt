It is common for students to critisize their teachers. We only hear a lot of the mistakes the teachers make. Everybody knows the students are getting lazy nowadays. Nobody wants to learn something. They want go out and have fun. But why do the students dont want to learn? Is it because the teacher  dont make the lesson exciting enough?
All of the teachers were being taught to teach, but not everyone has the passion for it. We can see how interesting the teacher is during the lesson. There are two types of teachers:some who really show interest, we can see this with how they relate with the students. Others are interested but cant show it, they only got the knowledge and for them everything that they teach make sense. The question is which type is better for the students.

This is a often discused question. The teacher who can relate well with their students can make a connection between them. The students trust the teacher more and probably are paying more attention. blablablablablblablablablablabalblablablablablablablabl. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930
