Some people say that the ability of a teacher to relate well with the students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject. But is this really like that or not?

Firtly we should mention that getting well with the students is always important for a teacher. It is much easier for teachers to teach the students and to "control" them, if they understand them and know how to deal with them.
Of course it depends also of the age of the students, some ages are easier to teach than others and some ages do not need as much knowledge than others. For example a teacher who teaches children in the groupage of seven do not need the same skills as an a teacher who teaches teenagers in the groupage of 18. So an excellent knowledge is not always nececarlly. Obviously the teacher should know very well about the tihngs he is teaching but in the normal case the teachers know a lot more about the subject than he had to teach.

In my opinion the teacher have of course to have a good knowledge of the subjects he is teaching. But it is not the most important to have an excellent knowledge but to get on with the students very well and to know how to deal with them. The teachers are like the second parents of the children. As a result it is more important to understand the children, to help them in dificult situations, to have a conection to them and know how to deal with them, than have a perfect knowledge.
