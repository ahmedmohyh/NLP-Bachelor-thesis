Everybody who went to school once knows that there is a wide range of different teachers. Some are very friendly others are severe and some of them are very in love with or bored in their job. An important question is, wether a teacher should be competendt in his subject or if he rather should be a friend towards students. Some arguments about this question will help to find an answer.
It's definitly important that a teacher should know very much about the topics he's teaching. If a teacher is not good in his field he can't do his job good and a teachers job is not being a friend it's educating and teaching. If he can't explain math becaouse he doesn't understands it he is no good teacher.
If a teacher has no relation to his students they learn less than they should because they aren't interested. When a teacher with almost infinite knowledge isn't able to transport and share this knowledge he can't do his job as well. Back to the math example, if a teacher understands his topic perfectly but can't explain because nobody wants to listen it's as useless as if he understands nothing. But if he understands much and is friendly the results are ways better.
After those arguments it's clear there ist not just one single solution. It's not possible to categorise in big kowledge and good relationship. For a teacher it's very important that he has a wide range of kowledge but it's more important that he is able to suport and educate on a friendly level as well. My experience has shown that teachers with just big knowlege are worse than some with reduced kowledge but a very confortable behaviour. So for me it's far more importatnt that they are able to relate well if they have kowledge as well.
