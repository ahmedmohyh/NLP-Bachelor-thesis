"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

What if a student like the subject very much but he doesn't like the teacher, does he still like the subject or does this change? Or if he doesn't like the subject but has a good relat with the teacher, does this make the subject better?
A teacher isn't just here to teach you how it works exactly or what it is or how it was, the teacher has also  to give you some motivation to learn it. Motivation can grew if the teacher has motivation or if you like to sit in this subject and learn something. If the teacher relats to the students the students imediatly have more motivation to visit this subject an to learn. If you don't really like a subject and also the teacher isn't really the most friendly one the motivation isn't there. Importent is that you can't just stand there and try to put all the knowledge you have as a teacher in the hat of the students whitout trying to help or understand them. 
An other side is that it is very importent to learn all about a subject that meaans that you need to lern everything of the subject. SO it is important that the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject he taught.So if the teacher just has a good relate with the students but doesn't know much about her subject how can she really teach them everything. 
So in my oppinion i thinks this statement isn't realy right because to relate well with students is as importent as the ecellent knowledge of the subject being taught. One doen't work whitout the other. A teacher need to have the ability to relate well with students and to have the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
