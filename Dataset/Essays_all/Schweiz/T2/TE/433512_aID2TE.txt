I agree with the statement that the relation between students and their teacher is importent but I do have to admit that the knowledge of the subject is as important.
When a teacher is able to have the controle over a class and has the students attention, he/she will be able to teach them even more into depth. Strict teacher may not be a students favourite but at the end of the day they may get more out of a strict taught subject.  
On the other hand for a good taught lesson is the motivation of the taecher so as for the students as important. I think if teachers are motivated to share their knowledge with the students, they will be even more motivated to revise for this peticular subject.
I also think, thought, the relationship of a teacher should be in a good condition as students should see their teacher as a rolemodel. As well should students have the ability to ask a teacher for advices and should not be afrid to ask for help if it is needed in the taught subject. Therefore I think a good relation between teachers and students is usefull.
In conclusion a teacher needs to have an ability to relate well with students but at sametime he/she must be well inforemd about their thaugt subject to have the students attention to keep them motivated and to keep them revising.
