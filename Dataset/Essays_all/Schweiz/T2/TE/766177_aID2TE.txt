Schools are made for learning. Education is one of the main matters in life nowdays. Without education the likelihood of being successful at a certain job or career is very low. That is why teachers have to make their biggest effort in order to spread their knowledge.

First of all, teachers have to be reliable as they play the most important role in our academic career. Students have to be able to trust them. Only then students can open themselves and show their potential.
Furthermore, a crucial ability a teacher has to possess in order to be successful at teaching is the the understanding for their students. Students have to attend several lessons. Many teachers expect from their students to make their best and push them to their limits. This leads to a lot of pressure and stress which some of the students can't handle. 

On the contrary, teachers schould be objective. Their task is to provide knowledge, not to be friends with students. If teachers relate all the time with students, the students are not going to take their teachers serious which may lead to a decrease in the authority of the teacher. 
What is more, students need to be led into the right direction. The teacher's aim is to teach the next generations what they know to create an educated society.

To sum up, a good teacher is someone who is able to understand their students. It requires not only the ability to relate well with students but also authority, patience and professionality. Objectivity wins in this case over subjectivity.
