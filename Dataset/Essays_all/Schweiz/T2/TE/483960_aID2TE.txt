Is a teacher's ability to relatewell with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? 

A teacher who isn't able to relate well with his students cannot taught his subject even when he has a absolute knowledge of it. If the students don't like their teacher they cannot be interested in what he sais. Even if they are interested they won't be it for a long time. 

A teacher, who doesn't have a good knowledge of his subject but is beeing liked by his students, will have a great time with them but they don't really get better in this subject. Sure they will be more interested in this subjet but that is nothing worth if the teacher cannot teach them.

In the first case in which the teacher isn't able to relate well with his students, it is still possible to teach them somenthing. It is not nice but possible. In the second case in which the teacher doesn't have the neccessary knowledge it's not possible to teach the students something. That means that the teacher has to have a good knowledge and if he doesn't have this it's not possible to educate someone. 

In my opinion it's really important that the teachers are able to relate well with the students but it will never be more important than an excellent knowledge of a subject.
