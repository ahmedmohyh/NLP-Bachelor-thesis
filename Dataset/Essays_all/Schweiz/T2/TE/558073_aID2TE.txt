Going to school is an important thing. Now in this time and in the future when you will get a job, you must can reading, writing and oftens other skills. And all that you can learn in school. 
The school is there for learning. Teacher just must teach the students and do not anything else. Because then students learn the diffrents subjects and do not other things. Also mustn't the teacher relate the students well, he must just do his job, teach the students and don't has to care to the children. 
The positive aspect of this statement is, that when the teacher relate the students well, the students going more likely to school. And when the students have fun to go to schoole they have also more fun to learn the diffrent subjects. Then they have better results. Also important is that the teacher like his job and have fun to teach students. The students notice this and then they are more interested to going to school.   
I'm agree with this statement. I think it's very important that the teacher's relate the students well. This give a positive athmosphere in the classroom and that's a better basis for learning. Then also the students have more fun to go to school and are more intersted in it. Also they have better results.
