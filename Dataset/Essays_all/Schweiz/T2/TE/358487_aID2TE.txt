When it comes to the abilities a teacher should or should not have there are many different opinions. I will discuss two of those in this essay. 

The first ability is that a teacher should have excellent knowledge of the subject he or she teaches. This ability gets more important once you teach on a higher level. In order to explain the topic to the students properly and in a way the students understand it, the teacher must fully understand it himself. The subject cannot be taught efficiently when the teacher is not an expert in his subject. A problem that could occur is that he teaches it too complex or that he is too fast for the students.

The second abilitiy is that a teacher should relate well with his students. When teaching it is vital to teach the subject in a way that is not too complex. The ability to relate with the students can be extremely important for this. A teacher should be able to know what and also how students understand the content best. It is very important to understand what your students are capable of doing and what not.

Taking everything into consideration, I would say that the ability to relate with the students is more imoprtant. A teacher can be a genius in his subject but if he cannot teach it comprehensible enough all the knowledge he has will not help the students. Whereas emphasising with the students and knowind where problems might occur can help them to make progress and to learn efficiently.
