Many headtechers want to have teachers with excellent knowledge at their school, because they want that the students learn as much as possible and get a good education. But isn't it more important that a teacher is able to relate well with students?

If a teacher has excellent knowledge about a specific subject the students can ask him or her any question and he or she will be able to answer it. That's especially good for students who have difficulties with this subject and need the teacher's help. But also for ambitious students who want to learn additional things is it important that the teacher can give them exercises which are more difficult.

But on the other hand it's dangerous that the students can't understand what the teacher wants to explain when he or she talks to difficult because of her big knowledge. Another point is that the students are much more motivated to learn something when the teacher has a good connection to them. And if the studendt's motivation is higher the atmosphere during learning will be more agreeable, so they will work more efficient and write better marks. 

Based on the arguments above I think that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge. Because motivation is one of the most important things in school
