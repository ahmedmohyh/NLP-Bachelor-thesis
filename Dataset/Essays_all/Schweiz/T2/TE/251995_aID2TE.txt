A Teacher nowadays is not limited to stand in front of a silent class explaining his subject on the blackboard. there are many ways of teaching which bring new experiences and interactions between the teacher and the students. Having a teacher that understands his students and can relate to them is way more important than having the best possible knowledge. And in the following paragraphs I will explain why.

The teacher has to teach the subject, even if he knows a lot about a certein matter tif the students do not understand he is not a good teacher. If he cn relate to some that does not understand amd can help him or her with maybe new learn techniques or adjusting the tempo of the class if it is hard to follow he might be way more helpful than if he just tells what he knows.

tFurthermore the teacher might be confronted with situations that have nothing to do with school but happen in school. In these cases the teacher has the be a good person, if form exaple there is a fight then he has to stay calm and deal with the situation or a student might have a personal problem and even if it isn not the duty of the teacher to help he might be the right person to do it and could have a big impact with a small effort.

Lastly it should be fun for the students and the teachers aswell to go to school. This can only happen if but parties comiunicate well and understand each other. It should be a calm atmosphere for everyone and nobody should feel singeld out or missunderstood. if there is a problem the teacher should be able to solve it.

i think esspecially today teachers human qualities are really asked for especially when working with younger kids because these years form the human for his entire life. I mean everyone experienced it that he disliked a subject because the teacher was not good but also started to show interest in a subject because the teacher was friendly and i think thats why it is important to be able to relate well to a teacher.
