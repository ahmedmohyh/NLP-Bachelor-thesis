Whene you want to become a teacher you also have to be sociable and kind to children or students, but you also have han excellent knowledge of the subject you are teaching. So the question is, is it more important that the teacher has ability to relate well with the students than the teacher has en excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching.

Firstly the ability to relate well with students is very important because you have to find out and know how to teach something to your students. Whene you realte well with them you know them so you know also how that person learns the best. For exemple a student has problems with maths and you sit together with that student and encourage them so they learn better.

In addition the students like going in your subject whene they know you can relate well with them and so they also like the subject you are teaching and whene you like something you are better in it.

On the other hand whene you doesen't have an excellent knowledge in the subjects you are teaching, you can't teach right and meaby you teach them someting wrong. Whene I try to teach somebody something I notice whene I know something not so propre and than also the other person on which I'm explaining the thing didn't understand it.

Finally whene somebody has a question and you don't have an answer for it, the students think you also have know clue about it so why they have to learn it from you. Whene you have to answer question from students you have to know the subject excellent.

In my opinion both is important that you can relate well with students and that you have en excellent knowledge to be a good teacher. But whene you doesen't know your subject you can't teach it.
