What is a good teacher? Is it a teacher with a good connection to his students or is it more a person with a bright knowledge? Is it a person that can help you with private stuff, or more a person that can explain you for example biology?
I think it is very important, that a teacher knows and understands exactly what he explains to the students. So if a pupil has a question, the teacher has to answer it easily and clearly. It is necessary that the teacher has a good eduction, but he has to know, that he can't explain the things like he studied at the university. 
But in my opinion, a teacher that has a good knowledge can only explain his subject good if he has a good and deep connection to his students or children in generell. So for me its fair to say that a teacher needs to relate well with his students. Otherwise its almost impossible to get on with his students. It's even possible, that the students don't take him serious. 
I think, it's very important that a teacher can relate well with his students. But the teacher also has to know what he says. So for me it's a mix of both, because if the teacher can relate well with the students but don't understands his subject it is as bad as the other way. He just gets maybe respect and is more a friend than a teacher in the eyes of a student. It also depends on the age of the students, because younger students like in primary school need more a teacher that can relate well to his students. And the older they get, the less they need a person which talks with him or her intensly. It's fair to say that the older the students get they have mor self-confidence and do more things on their own.
