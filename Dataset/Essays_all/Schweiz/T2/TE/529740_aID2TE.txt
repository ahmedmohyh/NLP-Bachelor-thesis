What makes a teacher a good teacher? What learning environment is best for students to achieve a good education? Are the teachers teaching skills or his knowledge more important? This question will be discussed in the following essay.
First of all a teacher, wo has the same amount of knowledge as his students is not a teacher. He does not have the posibility to teach anybody anything. He has to have a deep and special knowledge in a subject to teach it. Also not expected questions have to be answered immediatly and correctly. Otherwise the students can not profit, which is also the case right now during this mews study.
A really well educated person, who knows a lot can not suceed in the task "being a good teacher" if he or she does not know how to interact which students. The students will be either sad or stressed or angry (like me right now), which is definitely not a good learning environment. The teacher has to be understanding and has to be able not to make the impression that he is the enemy. 
To conclude it is worth mentioning that a good teacher has to have on the one hand great wisdom and on the other hand has to relate well with students.
