To have a perfect teacher seems to be impossible. As students we always tend to complain about the qualities a teacher doesn't have. There are people who say that a teacher needs to have excellent knowledge about the subject he is teaching and there are others who think it is more important to that the teacher is able to relate well to the students.

Obviously it is important for a teacher to know about the subject he is teaching or else he should not have been able to become a teacher. A teacher should be able to answer the various questions regarding a topic and it is impossible to do so if the teachers knowledge doesn't exceed the basics.
On the other hand a teacher needs to be able to relate to a student if he or she is having difficulties and help them if it is needed. If the teacher is only perfect in terms of his knowledge about the subject, the students soon might start to struggle to keep up in the lessons if it is too difficult for them.

Because of these reasons I think that it is important for a teacher to have a good balance of both abilities. That way he can help students who are facing difficulties and provide answers to all questions his or her students have. The teacher should understand if a student needs help and should realize when a student cannot keep up with the lessons. And since it is close to impossible to have perfect knowledge about anything, I think it is fine when a teacher doesn't know answers to some questions. In that case though the teacher should provide an answer when the next opportunity comes up. In school that would probably be in the next lesson with that teacher.
In this way the relationship between students and teachers can stay healthy and the students will be able to learn a lot from that teacher.
