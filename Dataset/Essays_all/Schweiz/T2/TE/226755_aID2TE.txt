Should a teacher rather relate well with his students or is it more important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? In these short essay this converse theme will be answered:

Firstly, the students are not in school to have their teachers as friends, no, they are in school to have their teachers as teachers and nothing more. They will just learn from them, what could be useful for their future.

Secondly, when the teacher has a less excellent knowledge of his subject being taught, then it is possible that the students learn something false by him, what would have an infuence on their future.

Nevertheless, the counterarguments can prove that a teacher's ability to relate well is more important: Firstly, because when a teacher is more friendly and when is more bounded with his class, then he will also give fairer grades as a teacher who does not like his class. Such a teacher would for example in an oral test ask more difficult quetsion and really would bring his students to sweat. As result, the students would not achieve good grades and they would loose maybe the passion for a subject.

And finally, if the teacher is a really friendly person, then there will be good mood and a strong bound between the class and the teacher, which would also influence the passion of the class, but in a positive way. The lessons will be more fun for all students and they would be more likely to visit them, which woould also have a good influence on their grades.

So now, after all these arguments, it is proven, that a good teacher's ability to relate well with his stdents has a very positive influence in the grades and the passion of the students to visit the lessons.
