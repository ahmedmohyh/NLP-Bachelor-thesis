The optimal teacher is hard to find: Nearly every teacher has his or her weakness, either in his knowledge or in his social competences. The question is: which one is more important to be an excellent teacher?

First of all, students often get annoyed if the teacher isn't able to answer questions or tells something wrong. It is for sure important that a teacher knows enough about the subject he teaches otherwise the learners won't stay serious in the lessons beacause they start thinking they knew better. And the teacher must of course be able to teach the students some knowledge they didn't know yet. Therefore, a teacher that does not know enough about his subject will soon be facing problems.

In contrast to that, one can say that a teacher with no ability to relate well with students won't have any success because the students won't understand what the person in front of them wants to teach them. For example, a teacher in our school that was quite bad at explaining topics to the student soon got fired and is now replaced a new one that is far more social. If students don't like a teacher, they will soon start to hate this subject and automatically become worse in this topic.

To summarize these points of view, both parts are necessary for a good teacher. There will never be a good teacher that only has one of these two qualities.
In my opinion, a good teacher must have appropriate social competences. I think these are even more important than the knowledge of the subject as long as the teacher knows enough to be an acceptable teacher beacause the better the students like the one that teaches the better there marks will be and at the and the teacher will be rated by how good marks the students get.
