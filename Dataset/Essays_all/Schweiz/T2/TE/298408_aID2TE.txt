Is a teachers ability to relate well with students more important than exellent kowledge of his subject? In this eassy I want to give you some points for and some points against this statement. 
To start with lets talk about the students motivation. Students aren't motivated to visit a class, if they hate the teacher. And they hate him, because the teacher can't handle some situations with his students. If the students for example have a problem with the teacher, a teacher should be able to accept the critic, instead of raging. If the students like the teacher, they mostly like the subject too. And if they like the subject, they are listening better to teacher and pay more attention on him. 
But if the teacher can't relate well with students, they will hate him, just like every studnets does to let their frusting minds out. Tey also wan't pay attention to him anymore and start to disrespect the teacher.
On the other hand, if a teacher hasen't a good knowledge of the subject he teachs, he isn't able to explain a subject well. The students might get frustated und start to hate the subject, althought they like the teacher, as I discribed befor. Also they will not be able to pass any test and won't reach the level, which is expected to be reached. 
Furthermore if you didn't undersatand a chapter in a subject like mathematics, where you have to understand all the stuff befor, to understand the new theme, the students will have problems later at university. 
In my mind teacher should have the ability to relate well with students and should understand their subject well. Otherwise it might get confusing. For the teacher and for the students.
