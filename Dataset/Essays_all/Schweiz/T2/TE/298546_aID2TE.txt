When you can relate well with your students as a teacher you can also make your lessons more interesting and the motivation of the students to be more active during the classes increases. However, this ability has no use whatsoever if the teacher does not know what he is talking about. Therefore I would rank the ecxellent knowledge of a subject above a teacher's ability to relate well with srudents.

On the one hand, if the teacher is able to relate well with his students he knows what sort of teaching makes his lessons more interesting for the students. This is supported by the fact that the lessons of younger teacher are often more interesting and students like going to this classes because this teachers are neare to the age  group of the students and can therefore understand them better.

On the other hand, both the higher motivation and the more interesting lessons does not matter when the teacher has not got excellent knowledge of the subject, because either the teaching would be insufficient or simply wrong. Furthermore, the better the knowledge about the subject the more interesting the lessons get and if the teacher can relate well but does not have excellent knowledge the student motivation might even decrease because they are feeling that they do not learn anything or not enough from said lessons.

To sum up, I would rather say that excellent knowledge is more important than a teacher's ability to relate well with students.
