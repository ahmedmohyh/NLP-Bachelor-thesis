In school we have to deal with a lot of different teachers and subjects. Some of the subjects are liked by more students than others. But this has not only to do with the subject itself. It also has to to with the teacher and their way of teaching,their approach to us students. The statement above rises the question whether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than ecellent knowledge of the suject being taught.

First of all I want to mention, that a lot of us students are asking tricky questions during class. Not only because we are interested in the subject but also because the teachers want us to ask questions. Without the excellent knowledge of the teacher, these questions could not be answered sufficiently.
Second point that supports the thesis is that a teacher without excellent knowledge loses the respect of the class pretty quick. We can see this in our physics class where the we currently are being taught by a trainee.

But without a good connection to his students, the classes are less interesting for the teacher and his students. No matter how excellent the teachers knowledge about a certain subject is, without a good connection to his student it is useful.

Therefore it needs a combination of both- excellent knowledge and the ability to relate well with the class.
