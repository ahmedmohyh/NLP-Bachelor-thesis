The purpose of a teacher is to educate students in a specific materia. Must they have the ability to relate with students?
Clearly. Teachers ave to understand students well. if they don't know how students think and act, they can't explain  anything. teachers don't do a teacher education for nothing. Do they? But is it relly more important than excellent knowledge? What ist the use of the ability to relate if you don't have a clue what your relly talking about. School shoulb be a place, where students can ask question about everything and get anwsers from a qualified and educated teacher. So in case a teacher can't relate with students, it shouldn't b a desaster. As a student you can always ask your classmates.
So in my opinion a at teacher should have an excellent kwnoledge and the ability to relate. In case you have to chose betwenn two teachers the excellent knowlege shoul be priority one.
