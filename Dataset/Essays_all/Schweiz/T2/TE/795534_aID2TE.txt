There are many different types of teachers. There are some, that are brilliant with their subject and some, that are very friendly to their students. Not very often, there are teachers, that are good in both parts. If you ask students which type of teacher they prefer, they will probably say the student friendly type, because they have a better relationsship with them than with the others. In general the ability to relate with the students is more benefical for an educational relationship than outstanding knowledge. This has several reasons.

First if a teacher just is talking about his subject and no student can follow, no one can take an advantage for his studies. A teacher, that can relate with his students, adapts with the speed of his course for the slower students and everyone has the possibility to pass his exams. 

Furthermore a teacher that doesn't care about his students but knows every detail of his study field, won't have many succesful students because his exams will be very specific about small details which the students don't have to know yet.

 These are some of the reasons why the ability to relate well with your students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject.
