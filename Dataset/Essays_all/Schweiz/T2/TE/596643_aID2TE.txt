I don't think that this statement is that easy to confirm.
It's possibel, that a teacher is highy sociable and really friendly and nice to his students,but that isn't all it needs to be a good teacher. The goals of a school is to get the students to achieve academic grades additionally to the skill of planing and presenting. By being able to relate well with students, the teacher can create a good atmosphere, might find out where the pupils have difficulties and help them, but this is useless, if he hasn't good knowlegde about his subject. For me personally it's challenging to take someone seriously, if I don't get the impression that he knows what he's talking about. This would be the nice teacher, everyone goes to, when they have a problem, but does not prepare you enough for studies on a higher level. 

On the other hand a teacher, who is very educated on this topic can be a horrible teacher, if he hasn't enough empathie and omprehension with the students. He doesn't see if the pupils get along with the speed of the lesson, or if they understand anything at all. He knows a lot, the problem is that he can't manage to catch the attention of the students, because he isn't able to relate with them. This would be the genius but boring and maybe even mean teacher,which I am sure we all experienced at least once in our scholar carrier. 

As conclusion I d'ike to say that a teacher has to be a combination of both, an empathic person, but also skilled in his topic. I'm not saying that he has to be a coryphäe in what he teaches, but he should be able to persuade his students that he knows what he's talking about,and be in the position to teach them his topic, without going over their heads, losing their attention, because it's simply to much.
