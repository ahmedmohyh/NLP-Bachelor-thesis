In today's society, whitout education it's nearly impossible to get a good job. Thus, in order to get those good grades it is helpful to have a good teacher. But what is more important? The ability to teach well or the transmission of information?

I think it's a combination of both. When having classes with a teacher you can relate to, pupils might feel encouraged to study hard, since they don't want to disappoint their teacher.
At the same time, when going to the classes is fun, less pupils will be missing and more information might be carried along on the part of the students.

On the other hand it is vital that you learn how to cope with comlex problems in school and it isn't only supposed to be fun. That's why teachers, which students can relate to, are not enough. As a student, you need to be well educated too and need to be able to solve problems even if the source (the teacher in that case) might not be the best one. 
Another problematic aspect is that pupils might forget that the teacher actually is the teacher, if their relation is a friend-like one, which again would be problematic.

To conclude both sides provide pros, but in the end I don't think that one side completely overshadows the other one.
This is why I think that it might be helpful if you can relate to your teacher, but is not exclusively important.
