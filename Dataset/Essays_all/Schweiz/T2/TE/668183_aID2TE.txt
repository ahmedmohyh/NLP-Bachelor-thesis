A teacher ability to relate well with students is important. On the other hand the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is also important. It depens how old the students are. For example in primary school it is very important to relate well with students. When they grow up the subjects becomes quite more difficile, so the teachers have to know exactly what they want to say.
You can see that both are important. In this time of computers the ability to relate well with students go more and more away. But with this also the knowledge. More and  more books have a online book too. In the internet you can find also quite a lot. Not all but enough.
For me both are important. I think you cannot teach students if you don't do this as your dreamjob. So you have to be related to them. If you have this it is much easier to teach. The students can see if you like your job or not. With this the excellent kowledge of the subject is a good conditional. I think that in this time you can't teach if you haven't a degree. There is no job in Switzerand where you can work well without a degree. In my opinion a teacher must have both abilitys to be a good teacher, so I disagree with the statement.
