Kids are going to school to learn. It's necessairy to have teachers with excellent knowledge, in that way our children learns the right stuff. 
But to learn includes not only the correct informations of a subject - also the social part of developement is really important for the students, who are growing up. So if we have a teacher in front of our kids, who can relate well with his students, they will learn a lot about social life, relationship, worthship and fairness. These are facts we also need to graduate our life the best and which is useful and very important in every backpack of every children. 
It's more successful to imploy a person who can refer to the kids. For exemple: You can't teach a group of childern how to play handball if you don't know yourself how to play it. But a professional handballplayer can't teach his abilities if he don't know how to teach them. On one hand is the knowledge missing and on the other one the ability to relate well to the littel players, because they can not understand the way he or she teaches. 
So in my opinion the idealistic teacher has not the excellent knowledge of his subject being taught, but the excellent mixture of giving korrect informations in an understandalble way for the children.
This disgussion is a different one in a higher type of school.
