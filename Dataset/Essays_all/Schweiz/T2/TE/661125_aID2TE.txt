If you have a teacher who knows all, but doesn't have  the ability to relate well, you won't learn much. You can find the lessons boring or you hate the teacher, so you're not paying attention during the lessons and that's bad for your notes. Maybe you won't even learn for the tests just because you don't like the teacher. Based on that I think a teacher must have ability to relate well with his students to give them motivation to learn.

But a teacher who relates well with his students isn't good, if he doesn't know what he's talking about. If he doesn't have any knowledge of his subject, he can not teach anything to his students. So the students won't learn either, even though the teacher's lessons are very interessting. Futhermore the teacher is not able to answer some of the student's questions and they can not profite of the knowledge and interessting stuff the teacher knows, which isn't teach in school.

To sum up I would say that both relate well and have excellent knowledge is important. Maybe for some students one point is more important than the other but for me it isn't. In my eyes the best teacher is a mix of both points. If he or she knows much and has the ability to relate well with students, the students will learn the most, they will be having fun by learning this stuff and really enjoy school and I think that's the most important point because when you enjoy something you're motivation to make an effort is bigger.
