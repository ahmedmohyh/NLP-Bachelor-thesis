Because I am a student, I know many teachers. Many of them are very good, but there are a few, which either don`t know their subject very well or just can`t teach things to other people, because they can`t relate well with students. What I mean with this is, that if you want to teach something, you have to help children or sometimes encourage them to do something. If a teacher isn`t able to interact with his students, they might get bored and won`t focus on the subject. This means, that a teacher has to be sometimes on the same level with his students, which results in interesting and somehow funny lessons. In this way I agree with the statement, that a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
 But on the other hand, if a teacher is just fooling around and having a good time with his students, the reason of school would be getting lost. It is important, that you can learn at school in a nice and supporting atmosphere. This is the reason, why a teacher should know as much as possible about the subject he wants to explain to his students. When the teacher can`t respond to a question someone has asked, it will lead to an uncomfortable situation for both the student and the teacher. Furthermore, one should be able to understand his subject if he wants to explain it to others. If he or she isn`t understanding his own topic, you can`t be sure, that the topic will be well taught. For example, if an history teacher should show to his class, what the greatest inventions of the Roman Empire were, but has no clue if there were more inventions than the toilet, he won`t be able to withstand the storm of questions from the class.
Because of these facts I think that it is important that a teacher knows how to help help and support students and to be nice to them, but he also has to know the subject he is teaching to don`t get into weird situations.
