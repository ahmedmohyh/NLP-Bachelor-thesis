"This is a bad teacher", "This Teacher is unqualified for that job" are accusations we hear a lot these times. The question is, what is it that makes a person a good teacher. Is it the ability to relatee well with the students or excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
I think if a teacher has the ability to make a dull subject interesting, and I think that requires excellent knowledge of a topic and/or subject, he really is a good teacher. Because that way the students are motivated and without motivation it's difficult or even impossible to stay focused while studying. I found that out by observing myself while I was studying.
On the other hand, I think a teacher should have the ability to relate well with the students, and actually because of the same reason. If you have a lesson with a teacher you don't like or even a teacher that treats you bad or unfairly, you are definitely not going to stay motivated and thus you are not going to study appropriately and thherefore not going to have good marks in your certificate.
These two things considered, I think the right amount of both of these characteristics make a good teacher.
