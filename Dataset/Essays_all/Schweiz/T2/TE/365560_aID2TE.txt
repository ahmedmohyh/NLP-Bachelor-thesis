First of all the knowledge of a teacher is absolutely necessary. There is no use if a teacher has a good relationship with his students without being able to teach and explain them anything. If you have finished school it counts how good you are prepared for the following life. 
On the oher hand the school is also here to learn to communicate with other people. It`s also useless if a teacher has "excellent knowledge of the subject" but is not able to transfer it onto the students. He might know everything about a subject but isn`t able to explain it to the students. 
But this should be the most important skill of a teacher. Being able to explain something. For me the statement is controvers. A teacher should have a good knowledge compared with the ability of sharing it with younger people. And with sharing I mean making the students understand an unknown subject. 
To the question "what`s more important" I`d rather say the ability to relate well with the students. If he hasn`t a good relationship, if the students aren`t willing to pay attention while class, if the students don`t like sitting in school, every knowledge of the teacher is useless. 
For many people the most important thing is to learn ever possibley thig  in school. In the end the grades are the goals. But in my opinion the goal of a school should be to help building up young people with the ability to live in our society.
So to finish I have to admit that I agree with the statement. The pefect goal of any school, which I admit is impossible to reach, should be to have teachers which are comparing with the knowledge and with the ability to build up a relation. Because without a good relation the teacher won`t be able to make the students understand anything.
