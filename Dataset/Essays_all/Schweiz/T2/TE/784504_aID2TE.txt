We all know the different types of teachers. One type is acting like a friend, and he's spending more time with talking to the students than teaching to the students. Another type is the freak, mostly known in science, that knows everything but is mostly not able to understand the students. I know that I've construct those types. There are teacher that aren't able to relate with students but they also don't have a good knowledge of the subject being taught. Others can do both. But the question of this essay is: Which of those two extremes is better? 

Let's start with the friend-teacher. I think that it's quite hard to motivate the students without a emotional connection to them. A teacher needs to understand the students, if not he's not able to help them. As a math teacher you could know everything, but without being able to understand why the students don't understand something, you can't help them. Also, nobody can now everything. But in our century it's a smaller problem than in the past. You can find hardly any information very fast in the internet.

But there is also another aspect. If students are having the feeling, that the teacher isn't interested in his own subject, why should they be motivated? A very interested teacher is always learning more about his subeject. You can test this motivation easily. You ask the teacher a very hard question. Now there is the option one, that the teacher tells you that he doesn't know everything and you should google. Option two is, that the teacher tells you he doesn't know the answer, but he will inform hisself. And option three is, that he immidiately knows the answer.

I don't think, that option two or option three is better. Not the excellent knowledge is important, but the motivation of the teacher. So I think it's important that the teacher is interested in his subject, but he doesn't have to know everything.
