A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of subject being taught. 

People always thing the only thing that counts is knowledge. Teachers are there to educate and after they've done their job - giving you as much information as they possibly can - everythings okay and they can go home now. I totally agree with the statement that knowledge and education is important because life does not get easier and if you have more knowledge and titles you will have less difficulties to find a well-payed job.

But the majority, especially adults, forget that students are at an age where they need somebody who understands them. Sometimes it's not possible for them to live up to the teacher's expectations. At this point the teacher has to realise that his help is needed. Because the way things are explained is equally important than the things he wants us to teache. In a way he has to feel if his students get along well with his way of teaching and explaining. If this is not the case he has to find another way. In the end his job does not contain only putting out informations but also giving information so that people wo did not study this subject can understand it.

For me personally it is much more important how the teacher is able to relate with his students than if he knows everything in detail for every piece of his subject. Best example: We had to choose an additional subject for next year. My decision? Economy. Why? Because I know that this teacher's classes are amazing and I know that I'm going to enjoy this lessons.
