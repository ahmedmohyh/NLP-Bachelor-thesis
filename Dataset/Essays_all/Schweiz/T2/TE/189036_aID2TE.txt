Nowadays students always argue with their teachers and do not have any respect. So they do not only need a teacher with a good knowledge about a specific subject, they also need a person who is able to build a relation.But what is more iportatnt, the quality of the topic or the way it's beeing tought? The following text will talk about it.

On the one hand the teacher has to know the subject by hard for teaching his students about it, because without a knowledge you can not tell someone something about it. Furthermore you go to school for learning new stuff and if you already know more than the teacher you won't improve your skills.

On the other hand if your teacher only has interests in knowledge and doesn t care about being a good teacher it won't help you getting better. For example if you are scared of your teacher you wont be able to give your best, to improve because you are scared of doing something wrong. The teacher has to be able to make you feel comfortable durig class, that you are able to give your best and that u can improve with every second.

To sum up, there are important points on both sides, that means you can't ignore knlowledge, neither the abilit to relate with students.
To my mind both are essential for making progress. Because you can t learn without someone who knows the topic by hard but if that person isn't able to make an explenation in an easier and in an sensitive way. The knowlede itself worth nothing, it depends on what you do out of it.
