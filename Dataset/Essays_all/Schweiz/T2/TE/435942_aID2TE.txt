School isn't just a place for absorbing knowledge. It is a place that should teach you important things for life. It should teach you social competence, tolerance and other interhuman abilities. If a teacher is not able to teach these things, the person in the front of the room shouldn't be called "teacher". Those interhuman abilities are taught especially in primary school. In later school levels, the teaching of those things are disregarded most of the time. There it is only a teaching of knowledge. Even later, in universities, professors don't care how their students feel or interact with each other. They only care about how much knowledge they can teach their students.

A primary school teacher has to relate and talk to students more as well as look after, how their students are feeling. That is why teachers have to study pedagogics and don't have a big focus on another subject. Teacher on later school levels have to concentrate on one, maybe two subjects at university. pedagogic is only a minor subject. 

Another aspect is, that if a child doesn't like the new school or his new classmates to well and the teacher doesn't approach him, he will never feel better. This will lead to the child not doing anything for school and just hating the time spent at school. He is not happy to see his friends, as he doesn't have any at school and then he loses interest in school and his grades will go down more and more. 

In primary school a teacher doesn't have to be specifically good at the subjects, because for the teacher it is all base knowledge. A teacher at gymnasium has to be good if not superb at his subject. He has to have studied his subject and has to be able to teach his students the same knowledge. Then you don't care that much if a teacher teaches you social competence. He just has to know his subject and be able to give on his knowledge to the new generation.
