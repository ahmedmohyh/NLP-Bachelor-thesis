In the modern area, education and school are one of the most important things for us. Without it, we woulnd be here where we are now with all the modern technique and computers and iphones. There are a lot of different schools and also different teachers. Some of the teachers can relate very well with the students and others have a huge knowledge. But which of these two points are more important for a good teacher?

The school is here, to spread out knowledge and to bring it to the students. Knowledge is maby the most important thing of a school. Without it, the school wouldnt make much sens. That means that a teacher with a tiny amout of knowledge of the subject being taught is not a good teacher because he cant teach te kids something, that he cant do by his own.

But what is a teacher with a huge amout of knowledge, when he cant relate to the students? Without a good relation between a teacher and the students, its very hard and unlikely, that the stundents are very motivated. The teacher can also have the biggest knowledge of the subject being taught, if he cant realte to his stundents, his knowledge is not worth anything, because at the end, the knowledge have to reach the student and dont have to rest in the head of the teacher. And also if the teacher dont have the biggest knowledge of the subject, if he can reach the students he can motivate them to do more at home and to learn the stuf in the books.

At the end, i think that the statemant is correct, because its very important to have a good relation to the students and to motivate them. They also can have fun at school, if the teacher is good. And if the students are motivated and have fun, the chance of learning something is bigger than if the teacher have a huge knowledge but cant bring it to the students.
