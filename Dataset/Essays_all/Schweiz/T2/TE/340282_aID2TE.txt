Do teacher have to relate well with students? I think they should be able or at least try to. A teacher is someone who should not only have the knowledge but also a connenction with the students. It is important for the students to have someone who they can relate and also talk to, which doesn't include knowledge and learning for the subject. If a teacher expierences a lacking ability to realte well with the students, I think he loses them - losing in the way that the students won't be able to focus and be motivated for the subject. It also may have the consequence that the students won't understand the material because the lacking and therefor not makeing it understandable for them. A teacher can make a lot of diffenrence, how the students learn, are motivated and behave during the subject. If the teachers are mor relatble the students will enjoy having the subject and be motivated for it. Which increases learning and focusing what may make a difference in the mark they get afterwards. 

The knowledge of a teacher is  the base, which one should have. The knowledge won't make the lesson, it won't motivate the students and, from my point of view, the students offen don't even really care. What the students want is a lesson which is fun, at the same time very interesting and taughtful. For sure does an excellent knowldge increase the teachers lesson, but it won't increase the motivation of a student. 

At the end, I think, it is important to have a balance between having the abiltiy to realte well and having an excellent knowledge.
