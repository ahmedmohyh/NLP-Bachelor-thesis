If I would agree with this statement really depends on of what stage of school we're speaking of. In classes with young children I think it is much more important, that the teacher is able to relate well with his students. It's his mission to set the fundament for their future learning. A teacher can't achieve this just by having a good knowledge of the subject he's teaching. The things he teaches are really basic and it wont matter how good he is in the more complicted parts of his subject. What the kids need in this age is a techer who knows how he can build a good learning condition for his students. 
Speaking of older students, as in universities, I agree with this statement muvh more. At this age, the students should be mature enough to learn on their own. The major qualification their teacher has to bring up is that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject he's teaching. Sure he also has to be able to teach it in an interesting and effective way, but this useless if he's a noob in his subject.
My opinion is that in all cases both of the qualifications are necessary, but it really depends on the age of the students, where the focus has to be.
