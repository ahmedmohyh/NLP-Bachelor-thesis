I am a student. I can tell that teachers are not always abil to teach the knowledge, because they have problems to understand the problems uf the students. So I have to say, when some want to work as a theacher you shout have the ability to relate well with children or teenager, choose  the age you want to teach wisly, than you have to understand they questions. Even than when they can not be precsicly with they questions.
On the other hand, I also want to have a teacher witch can give me ansers on my question in this subject he is teaching.
For example: I am good in chemestry and I am really intresting on it. When I have e question wich goes over the normal topic of normals lesson, the teacher shout no the anser or where he have to look for it.
So I understand both sides. And I  woud say a good misture of both would be the perfect solution. But in the real live it is not always hat easy. That is the reason why I would say that teacher, how works with children in the age six between sixteen, the abilitiy to relate  well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of subject beint taught. Because the stoff they have to learn in this ages is easy for adults to understand and they are not that much question in a heay level. But when a teachers works in a school that is no loger obligation, he shoud have a excellent knowledge. Than in this leve the studiens beginns to learn being critical and have more questions. To have a good anser in this level, can be important for the life after his school. 
I have to say on this point, that my opinion is just basiend on my on expiriens in the school life.
