A teacher is a person who should give knowledge to other people who know less about a subject. Therefore, it is obviously important that the teacher has a bigger knowledge of the subject being taught. Otherwise it would not make sense if the students know as much as the teacher or even more. On the other side, a good relationship with the students can make a teacher's life quite easier and maybe even bring a little bit of fun into school.
Kids go to school to learn things and to know them afterwards. The biggest goal of education is to teach the children as much information as possible. One possible way to reach that goal are well-educated teachers which have a good relationship with their students. In my opinion, a student is more likely to learn things and go to school if they enjoy being in class. A good relationship with a teacher motivates and leads to good results and marks. I do not want to say that a good relationship makes every student having the best mark possible, but it inspires to reach the full potencial.
In my point of view, this statement is a basic of primary school. In Switzerland, it is common that one teacher teaches all subjects of a class, maybe except one or two. I think a reason for that is exactly this relationship between the two sides. If the young children in primary school always stay with the same teacher, they are able to gain confidence and build up a good relationship which leads to better result and a bigger will to learn. 
To conclude, I would like to share my own opinion. In my point of view these two parts of a teacher's life, relationship with students and knowledge, are over all equally important. I think it is especially a question of age. The further a student get in his or her career, the less important the relationship and the more important the knowledge of the particular subjects gets.
