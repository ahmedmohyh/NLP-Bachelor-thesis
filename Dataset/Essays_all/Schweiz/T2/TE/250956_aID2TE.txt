When learning, it is necessary to understand the subjects taught. This is the point where teachers come in. There is no use in teaching when one does not have the ability to teach it in a way that everyone is able to understand it. The knowledge is only secondary. It is more important to be able to relate well with students than having excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Especially in scientific subjects, most teachers are really talented and know what is going on. Therefore, it is not possible for the people concerned to know what might be difficult to understand. This leads to students being confused and the teachers not being able to relate why they do not understand the theory behind everything. Teachers need to relate to students as well and need to remember how youth works. 

Both arguments show that knowledge is not the most important treat a teacher needs to bring. The communication skills are the ones needed because otherwise the knowledge cannot be given to students. As soon as a teachers lacks communication skills students lose interest in those subjects and stop paying attention, thinking the whole class is pointless.
