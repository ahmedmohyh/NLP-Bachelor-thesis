I almost fully agree with the statement, that a teacher's relation with the sudent is a bigger point than his knowledge of the subject. 

Normaly the lessons are feeled as borin if a teacher does not have any good relation with his students and I have never heard about a pupil who likes to sit in a unliked teacher's lesson. That is why normaly hardly any students would ever pay as much attention on a unliked teacher than on a teacher who is charismatic. A good tacher can give the knowleage of his subject to a student, even if it is not the students pation. Surly it is give that the teacher knows well about what he teaches, but he does not have to be a speciallist is every topic of his subject. A teacher just has to know enough to be hisself sure what he tells and how to answer possible questions. 

But the opposit case would not work well. However, a teacher who is absolutely an expert in every discipline of his subjects maybe can tell more interesseting thing or giving better examples, but what does this matter if the students prefere to talk to their neighbour about weekend or playing tic tac toe on their skripts? Even if the topic interessts some of the students, who maybe try to pay attention, it will not work that well as if the teacher would have a better ability to relate well with students. That is because all the not interessted students would case nois and a bad learning atmosphere. So it will be harder for every single student to pay attention, even they would like to learn something during the lesson.
