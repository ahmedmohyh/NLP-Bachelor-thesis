Students have to come to school everyday, it is their profession. But students also want to learn something in order to achieve their dream or they are just forced to wright good grades. However it is very important that a teacher is able to relate well with his students in oder to teach them something.
Often students like a subject because of the teacher. If the teacher connects well with his students, they will have a much better behaviour and they will be motivated. If a teacher knows everything about his subject, but he is not able to relate with his students, it is useless. Because even if they would need the information desperatly, they would not be able to lisen or to concentrate porperly.
After you chose to go to school for a liddle longer in order to be able to go to university, students become more critical towards their teacher and they have the feeling to have the right to have a good one. If this is not so, they start to rebell and skip classes. However this is useless, because the teacher gets angry and everyone gets frustrated. 
To sum up I think it is very important that a techer has the ability to relate well with his students, however he still needs to have enough knowledge to teach.
