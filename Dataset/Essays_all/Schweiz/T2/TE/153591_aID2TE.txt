Nowadays, education is as important as never in human history. A country spends millions of dollars to make education even better. The future of a pupil is influenced quite hard by the opinion of te teacher how a good school should work. It is a contreversial question if teacher should have the ability to relate with students or if the teacher should behave an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

On the one hand it is really important for young pupils to have a teacher who does understand his chldren. A teacher should be like a good friend who you got respect. Another aspect that should be considered is that, pupils are learning better if they have a good relationship with the teacher. That is why even the best knowledge of the subject could not be usefull if you can not find a way to understand their feeling and atitudes.

On the other hand it is as well useless if you have a good relationship to your teacher but he has no knowledge of the subject which should be thaught. However, the world does not stop and that is why every teacher should be up to date in his subject. This is why education for teacher is getting more important as well.

In conclusion I would say that it is most worth if a teacher has excellent knowledge of the subject and a good relationship to the class. Only if a teacher got a lack of both he is able to teach a class in a proper way. I had already both types of teacher, the one with plenty of knowledge but no ability to relate with students and as well the one with a good relationship with the class but not enough knowledge of the subject. And I can tell you that both types of teacher are not worth it.
