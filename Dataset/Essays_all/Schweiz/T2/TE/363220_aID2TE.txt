The knowledge of a teacher
All the students are sitting in the class. Nobody is listening to the teacher. They play games and build paper planes. The teacher can not control the class and relate with his students. So a teacher`s ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beeing thaught. 
If a teacher can not control his own class, the students learn nothing. They have to be concentrated and must see the teacher as a person, how they also want to be. You can not learn from a man or a woman you do not respect. The pupils need some heros. A teacher should listen to his class. He should be in contact and understand, what is important to them.
On the other hand the teacher`s knowledge is also really important. He can not teach his subject if he do not know what he should teach. A teacher needs a lot of information and competnces. Nobody respects someone how does not know anything. If you want, that somebody is looking up to you, you have to impress him or her. 
I think a good teacher should do both. He has to listen to his students, but he also should have a profound knowledge of his subject. I hate narrow-minded teachers. A teacher should have a wide horizon but also the ability to relate well with his students.
