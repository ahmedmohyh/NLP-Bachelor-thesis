There are several different opinions about what features a good teacher shoud have. Some parents think that it is very important that a teacher is able to relate well with their child, while others think that it is more important that the teachers' knowledge is perfect. In the following essay are some reasons for and against both of the opinions mentioned before.

If a teacher is able to relate well with the students, he can help them and they are not afraid to talk about their problems. This can be very helpful, especially for young and shy students. But some parents are afraid that their children won't learn a lot if they have a good relationship to their teachers and if the teachers do not care that much about the quality of their knowledge. 
If the quality of the knowledge is not important to the teacher, it can cause problems if the students do not learn that much. However, having a teacher who has an excellent knowledge but he can not really explain it is not very helpful for (young) students who are trying to learn something.

In my opinion, both of the features mentioned above are very important. If the teacher is able to relate well with students, the students are happy to go to school and motivated to learn something. But a teacher also needs to have a certain amount of knowledge about his subject because otherwise he can not teach his subject properly. Due to these reasons I think that both skills are important and something that a good theacher needs.
