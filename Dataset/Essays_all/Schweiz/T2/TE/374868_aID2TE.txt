We all know this one teacher who doesn't really care if their students understand what they're teaching. They just seem to be so into preaching their knowledge that they completely forget to check if there are any students who may feel left behind. Then there are teachers who don't really teach after the curriculum, they more so look after the students to make sure they learn something that they can use later in their life. However there might be students who are quicker at understanding difficult things than others or some who like a bit of a challenge; they might feel the opposite of left behind.

It's a teachers job to pass on his knowledge to his stundents in some degree. So one would think; the more a teacher knows, the more they can pass on to their students. But most of the time teachers can't teach their students the facts, they have learned, at the same degree of difficulty as they have learned them themselves. So some of the knowledge is lost either way in the way teaching works. Also a certain time-factor comes into play because a teacher just has a set amount of time to teach their students, so the teacher has to kind of hold himself back so he has taught everything he has to and doesn't miss something important because he taught something he didn't have to.
On the other hand a teacher has to be nice and still have control over their students. A student will learn more or will be more willing to learn something if they are in a safe atmosphere and are comfortable. So it is important for teachers to be in contact with their students because they'll be more inclined to learn something if they know their teachers means well and doesn't just list fact after fact.

A teacher should be a person who you are happy is teaching you something not just the other way around. For me, the better a teacher is at adapting to different students, the better he is a teacher.
