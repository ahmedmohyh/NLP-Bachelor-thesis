I also think that this is very important. A teacher can know a lot about a specific subject, but the students still don't get the topic or have fun even though he has a wide range of knowledge. If he tells the students everything he knows, it's not guaranteed that they will understand everything to a 100 percent. A math teacher can talk about some kind of formula and know every thing behind it, but if he's socially not connected with the students and doesn't pay attention to their state of mind, they won't get the point of the whole lesson. So a teacher rather "clicks" well with them and has some kind of relation to them. Because in this case they'll have more fun learning new stuff and it will be easier for them to do so. But at the same time the he shouldn't be too easy on them, otherwise, they won't take it as serious anymore and won't learn anything neither. 
It's pretty important that he has the necessary knowledge though. He can't teach them anything that he isn't sure or taught about. The students will get false information and will pass these on or they won't have capable knowledge for university or the job market. A teacher should be in the middle of these two types; not too clingy to the knowledge that he has, but also not too unserious about it. He should teach in a learnable speed and in a kind, which is understood by everyone.
