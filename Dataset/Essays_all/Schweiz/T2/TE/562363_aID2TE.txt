Without a good realtionship from teachers to students the school would be boring and a hard thing to master. Students who like their teachers will like to go to school. But the task of the teachers is to teach and prepare them well for the following school, the profession or the life. When the teacher doesn't know what he is talking from, the students won't take the lesson serious. So the teacher has to be serious and should do the lessons from time to time  differently. With different ways of teaching the chance is bigger more student will learn the theme easily. To do that, the teacher has to be well prepared and must have the knowledge. Also when students want to ask something and the teacher has no idea of the answer or solution then the students can't handle the theme very well. 
When students have problems with their familiy or bulling for instace, they should can go to the teacher which offers their help.  
Whitout the basics they will have problems in ther whole life, they will have problems with the following schools and to became their profession.  The school has to be paid and when they won't learn something the money is away for nearly nothing. Especially for the younger children a good relationship is important. But when in primary school the basics aren't well taught, the children will have problems their whole school and at some point they won't like to go to school anymore. A good relationship is important but the aim of the school is to teach them well and give them the basics, no matter in which school. The school is a preparation for life and should be funny sometimes too. Whith a good realtionship the learning for the students is much easier, but the knowledge of the teacher has to be there. School woudn't make sense without that.
