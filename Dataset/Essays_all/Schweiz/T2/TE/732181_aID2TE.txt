Teachers these days need to have many abilities. Obviously it is important that they can teach well so that the students learn a lot.

In my opinion, teachers need to have both abilities. It is important that they have an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. It is also important that they can answer the questions of the students also if they are not basic questions.

But to teach well it also needs that a teacher can relate well with the students because this can have an impact to the mark. For example if a student is not good in a subject only because he does not like the teacher because he is not able to explain things in a way the students can understand easily, the chance to get a better mark is rather low. But if a teacher sees where the students have problems, he can think of other ways of teaching so that the students can understand better.

Often theachers who are getting retired soon do not have a style of teaching which is specialized for the students. That is because 30 years ago, it was not normal that the teachers teach i

To conclude, in my opinion, a teacher nowadays needs to be able to relate well with the students so that they can teach in a way that it is easier to understand.
