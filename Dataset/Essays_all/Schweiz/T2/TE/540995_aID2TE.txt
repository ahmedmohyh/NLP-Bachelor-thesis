Everybody knows the fact that it is important to understand what the teacher is telling in front of the class. So it's a big problem when the teacher doesn't say the trouh or the teacher can not explain it well. In this litle eassy I will try to explain you what is more important: the knowlegde or the ability to relat somethng to the students.
Everybody knows the moment when you do not understand the bolasie flick. That's the moment when you realise that something was good but also in a way no really important. It is like this News-Study. Good but no important. The real important point is that the teacher can explain it well. Beacause then most of the students will understand what is going on and so they will have more motivation and more fun in school. An another very important point is that the teacher know what they are telling. But in my opinion it is more important that they have the ability to relate something to the stundents. 
In the end both of this points are important and you have to find  a way to conclude this two points. But most important thing is that: When you can not do a Bolasie-Flick your are not a five star skiller and you will not be a famous person. You also will not get a hod dog for every goal you score. At this moment you know: Always learn a lot and do not be stupid then you will have a very very beautiful live!
Ps: this litle wunderful eassy is sponsored by the coffies and they are very good this season so they will give a lot of young childreans a good jobs. So this is for the directors of the schools.
