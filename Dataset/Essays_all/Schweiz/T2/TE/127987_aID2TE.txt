The statement contains that a teacher's relation with the students should be better than his knowledge of the subject. 

First of all I will look on the first part of the sentence: That teacher should relate well with the students. I think this point is very important, because I don't want to learn something from a teacher who isn't interested in me. So the teacher have to built a good relation that he can reach the students. Otherwise the students aren't enough attentive. 
The second half of the statemant contains that teacher's should have a very good knowledge about their subject. That's important, because the more you know about something the more thrilling you can tell it. For example in Maths it is useful to have a perfect knowledge so you can explain how the students have to calculate something. And in other subjects it's the same.
Now this statement expresses that the first part is more important than the second part. That's not my opinion, because the knowledge is as important as the relation is. If you have an outstanding relation with the students and nearly no knowledge, they will hear what you say but you can't explain them anything although you have a good relation. On the other hand. If you have an excellent knowledge but a bad relation with the students they don't want to follow you even if they want to learn something about the subject. My experience is that students have better grades in subjects they are interested in and in subjects, where they have a good relation to the teacher.

All in all I can say that I disagree with this statement, because the ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge have to be balanced.
