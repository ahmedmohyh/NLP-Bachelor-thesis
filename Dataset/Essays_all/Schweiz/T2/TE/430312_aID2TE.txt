Knowledge isn't of any use if your not able to share it. Therefore I'm going to explain in the following essay why a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Without any doubts, a teacher has to know his subject, but doesn't aquire an excellent knowledge, nobody is perfect. And often people with a big intelligence aren't that capable in human interaction. Furthermore the stundets don't profit from the teachers knowledge if he is unable to transmit it to the students. So it's more imortant that the relation between the teacher and his students is good. Even if there is something the teacher doesn't know, he and his students can work together and find a solution. The students learn more if they have fun during work and someone they can rely on.
