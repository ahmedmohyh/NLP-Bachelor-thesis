I think yes, it is more important that the teacher can show things to the students in a way, how the students understand it. Because when a teacher is an expert in something but the students unterstand him he isn't a good teacher. On a school in switzerland for exaple (the redaction knows the names) :) there is a teacher wo is good in math but he doesen't understand the problems of the students. When someone asks him a question, he doesen't get it. Also his sheets are not really good for students. Maybe he would be a good professor at the univerrsity but the normal school ins't on a good place for him.
