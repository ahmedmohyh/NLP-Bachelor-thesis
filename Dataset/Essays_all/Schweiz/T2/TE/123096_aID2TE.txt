A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

There are many intelligent people on this planet. Some of them create truly wonderful things with what they know, some of them help mankind. Others make it possible for us to advance in technology, and others again strive to pass on their knowledge onto people that do not posess it. 
People belonging to the latter category however do not always get it right; even though they may be capable of telling you about every single little detail of what they are teaching, they might not be able to think from the student's perspective, who does not know anything about the topic, and thus do not have the capability of making it very comprehendable for them. This often leads to students not having a clue of what's going on in class, hence the bad grades.
On the other hand, does the teacher not know much about the subject but can relate well with his students, it is probably because he himself, as well as the students, do not know much about the topic, so they're both in the same situation. This, in the end, leads to bad grades for the people who're learning and studying once again.
The thing is that in both situations one could say that the teacher is to blame for the students not learning anything, which is correct. So if in both situations the advancement of student's knowledge is hindered due to the teacher's incapability of either teaching or knowing the things that he should know, to what conclusion does this bring us?

Both aspects are equally important. Is one of the two missing, the process of teaching cannot be executed properly and flawlessly.
