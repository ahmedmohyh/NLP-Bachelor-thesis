There is no clear cut answer to the question whether empathy or knowledge is more important for being a teacher. It is well-known that students benefit from an understanding teacher and can  possibly produce much better results if there is mututal understanding. This factor can hardly be ignored but it would be foolish to ignore the quality of lectures because of sympathy. No matter how well-liked a teacher is, if he does not know what he is talking about he is failing at preparing his pupils for their life. Misinformation can do more harm than no information.
On the other hand, if a teacher knows everything about a subject but is unable to connect with his students in a meaningful way his teachings will fall on unfertil soil. Children and teenager are not the most cooperative people and will sometimes be unreasonable if they do not like someone. Feeling belittled because the teacher does not take their concerns seriously can be a rather frustrating experience and lead to a lot of hostility towards the teacher which is scarcely a productive state of mind.
Most importantly, the set of skills required for a teacher change depending on the demografic of the students. It is unreasonable to expect an eight year old to do well under an unempathetic teacher because small problems have much more of an impact on their minds. Teenagers on the other hand will not profit from a teacher who lets things slide to easily because he understands why they could not possibly do their housework today.
It is essential to take both qualities into consideration without disregarding the other because a good teacher needs both. I do not think you benefit if you feel good but did not learn anything important.
