I agree with this statement. A teacher should be able to teach in a way that students understand the subject. If the teacher has an excellent knowledge, it does not mean that he or she can explain it in a way that students understand. The teacher has to know how students think and learn, this would be the ideal method of teaching. A lot of students struggle nowaydays to comprehend teachers, because they teach on a level of adult thinking.
But the teacher also must not have a lack of knowledge. The students should be learning from the teacher and if he or she does not know the subject exquisetly well, the teacher cannot teach either. 
It is always difficult to find the right method of teaching, but it needs a lot of experience to know how students think.
