A teacher should have a deep knowledge of the subject being taught because if the teacher doesn't knows how should then the students know? To have a closer look we take for example somebody who studied maths and was one of the best test absolvents. The person has a really deep knowledge of the subject and probably knows most things. But how things are he isn't really socially active means he has difficulties to ineract with other persons. He probably couldn't understand what students don't understand in maths and why it seems sometimes so difficult for them to understand an exercise. He wouldn't be a very well teacher because he has difficulties to relate with students. But who would be a good teacher if not one of the best math study absolvents? The person of course should have studied maths but he or she doesn't has to be the best and maybe if he or she also had struggles in maths he or she will have a better ability to realte well with students and is going to understand what students can't understand in maths. To make a final decision we have to see that for sure it is important to have a good knowledge of the subject being taught but also a teacher's ability to relate well with studets is very important otherwise a subject can't be fully taught to students because if the students don't understand what the teacher is saying and he can't explain it differently the students can't learn anything.
