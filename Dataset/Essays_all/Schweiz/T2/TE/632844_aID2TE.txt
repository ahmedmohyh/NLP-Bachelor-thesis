My physics professor has a doctor in physics. His knowlegde of physics is great and also very deep. Nevertheless our class got problems with his lessons. He can't explain that good and the relation between professor and the class isn't to good. I think the problem of this professor is that he thinks diffrent about physics then we do. He can't feel our situation. Maybe it would be better if he would be closer to our situation of not knowing that much. So he can see were our strggles are. then his relation towards us would improve and we would have more fun in the lessons. 

On the other hand side are teacher who are always joking and talking about there life also bad. Of course there is a good mood in the lessons of such teachers but it's dangerouse because you lose time for the education.  
 
I think it's a mix of a great knowlegde and a good relation between the class and the teacher wich makes good lessons and a good teacher. A good learning clima is good for the productivity. A lesson with intersting inputs and easy mood is nice for a student and also for the teacher.
