It's important that a teacher can relate well with students so he can transmit the informations better. He can find a way which the students learn best. He can help the students if there's a problem and explains things better. If you have problems or an illness, for a reason, he knows how to give you the best opportunity to learn for school. So also people who can't learn by their own or aren't that good at school have a luck to get a good school education.

But it's not in off if the teacher just know how to teach. He also have to be good in his subject. Then when a teachter doesn't know in off about the subject, the students can't get better in school and won't learn that much. If I have a question, for example, and the teacher doesn't know the answer, I won't come far. So it doesn't play a role if he can teach or not. 

And that's my opinion. I don't agree with the statement. If my teacher can teach well but doesn't know much about the subject it won't bring me further. Additional I like it better to learn the material by my own. So I don't need someone who can teach that good.
