"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

This thought provoking thesis is quite often heard and is worth to be answered. So let me try:

I think there are obvious reasons why a teacher should relate well with his students. If the students absolutely can't stand their teacher they won't be learning anything. They won't have any motivation to invest time and energy because they miss the most important thing to learn: Fun! Only a teacher with good social skills can translate his knowledge and motivation to his students. 

On the other side one could say, that without a profound knowledge in a particular subject you won't be able to teach it to other people. It's not enough to just be a cool person, who's able to relate with others. No you most importantly have to understand the stuff you're teaching. 

For this reason I don't agree for 100% with this thesis statement. I surely do think, that it's important for a teacher to relate well with his students. But one thing is bound to the other. Being a teacher should always be  a mix between knowledge and teaching skills and you can't separate them. And you neither can say, that one thing's more important than the other.
