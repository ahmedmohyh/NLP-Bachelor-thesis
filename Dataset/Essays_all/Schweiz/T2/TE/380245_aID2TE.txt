The most important aim in school is to bring as much important knowledge as possible to the students. They may need much of it in their future life. So actually the question is not wether a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important or the excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught, but wich is more important to teach as much useful information as possible.
Therefore, we can refer to the question as in electricity. The ability to relate well with the students is the potential, just as Volt in electricity. Without it, no knowledge or wisdom will being brought to any of the students. But just as Volt, something else is needed to reach the goal. In electricity, it would be the amount of Ampere, in school it is the grade of teacher's knowledge. The higher the teacher's knowledge, the higher the teaching success.
However, both of it is well needed, one isn't working without the other. On one hand, Volt or a teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important, because if there's no or only little Volt, not even a high amount of Ampere would be enough, but on the other hand, Ampere or excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is as much necessary, because with a high relating-ability and no knowledge, nothing would be taught to students.
Therefore, two things are needed:
First, there must be both of it, knowledge and relating-ability, and second, the relation between those two. A good teacher should have it both.
However, there are other important things. For example a students interest or the level of the material.
