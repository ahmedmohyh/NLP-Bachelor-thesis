I do agree with the following statement.
If a teacher is able to relate with his students he will learn something from the young Zlatan. Because if Zlatan is in a class then he is the teacher. The question is not if a teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught because Zlatan knows everything.
If Zlatan thinks that he should relate with the teacher then he will do it. So i thinthat this is a really stupid question. If Zlatan comes to your house you are the guest. How many push us can Zlatan do? All of them. Unfortunately He is injured at the moment, but he will come back stronger and win the champions league next year. If not he will carry on. Probably transfer to a new club. Please dont let anyone ever write this mews study again.

And make the time to write this text shorter.
