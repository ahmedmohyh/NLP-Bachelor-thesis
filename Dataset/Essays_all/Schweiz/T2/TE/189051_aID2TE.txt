Nowadays, there are a lot of teachers who are just capable to teach a subject. But teaching is not just talking about stuff to students. It is more than that.
Because of that I agree with the statement above "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" for the following reasons.
To begin with, it is essential that the teacher knows the subject being taught. But if he does not like his students he will not be very motivated to give his knowledge to others. For instance, at a mathematics lesson. The teacher knows everything about the actual theme, his students not. If his motivation is not big enough, he will not say everything that is important to solve mathematically problems.
Secondly, there are not even any teachers at schools that do not have a huge knowledge about what they have studied in their past. They need to be tested and accepted to become a teacher. This means that a teacher is always intelligent enough for his job.
Moreover, there are many teachers that do not like some students just because of their personality. This can influence the motivation to teach a student like this or it can even have influence at the marks.
Furthermore, a teacher needs to be taught to relate well with other people. It is a part of his job and also a part of his life to cope well with others.
Lastly, a student needs to like the lessons being taught too. The motivation of a student is also vital for the learning process. For example, there are many students that hate school. And this can not bring enough motivation to be good at a subject in school.
In conclusion, both is essential for an optimal learning und studying. The teacher's ability to relate well with students and his knowledge of the subject being taught. It needs to have balance. Otherwise, something can be missed.
