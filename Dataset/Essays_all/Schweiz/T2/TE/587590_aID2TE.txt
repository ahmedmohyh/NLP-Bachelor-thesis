The teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important, because if the students feel understood and respected, they are more motivated to learn. If he for example tells the students his own experiences, they will listen to him and they can better relate to him too.
If the students like the teacher and they have a good relationship together, they want to learn, what the teacher is trying to teach them, because they want to impress him in a way. They don't want the teacher to think that they are stupid or that they were too lazy to learn properly.

The knowledge of the subject, that the teacher teaches, is important too. Without the knowledge the students would'nt learn anything, and that would be bad, because the reason,why students go to school, is that they usually want to learn something. The teacher can be nice and cool, but if he doesn't teach anything to the students, they will become bored and won't listen to the teacher anymore.
If the teacher isn't able to teach a subject well, the students will have problems in that subject later, for example at an university, that will affect their ability to write good grades.

In my opinion, both knowledge and the ability to relate well with students are important. The combination of these two things is the best, I think, because a teacher without knowledgement isn't good at all, but a teacher, who isn't able to relate to his students, isn't good too.
