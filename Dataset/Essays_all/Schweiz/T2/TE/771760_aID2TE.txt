Being a teacher isn't as easy as it sounds like. Teachers have an important job to do. Their task is to teach students about their subject in the best possible way and also in a not so boring way.

For a teacher it is more important to have excellent knowledge of their subject. If the teacher would hardly know anything about the subject they are teaching, what do you need a teacher for. Students wouldn't need to come to school anymore. They could just stay at home and do some self-study. 
Furthermore a wide knowledge about a subject is important to a teacher to gain respect from the students. If you have a teacher standing in front of you who doesn't know anything about the topic they're teaching, student's won't have a lot of respect for them. Students go in a class room with the expectation that their teacher has a great knowledge about their subject. Teachers made a dregree for that and they also get paid for this job. If this isn't the case, students will look down on their teacher. ALso, the students simply just don't want to listen to them. 
On the other side a teacher should also have the ability to relate well with students. Teachers have to understand their students and their feelings. There should also be a good relationship between the teacher and the class members. That way school would be more fun for both sides. 

For teachers it is important to have a wide knowledge of their subject in order to gain respect from their students.
