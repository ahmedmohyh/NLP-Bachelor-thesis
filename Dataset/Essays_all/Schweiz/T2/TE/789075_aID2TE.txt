This question is an importante one, especially for my daily routine at school. It's clear that I got a lot to and spend a lot of time with teachers when I'm going to school five days a week. And during my three years of school I've often asked myself questions like this. I think a perfect teacher, so far we can speak of a perfect teacher without writing a fantasy-story, should be able to have a good relation to his students and at the same time he should have enough knowledge of his materia. To have just one of these advantages isn't a good permission to get a teacher. Because an immense knowledge of the teacher is useless for the students if he's unable to teach the kids in a right way. On the other side it's also useless to have a super friendly teacher who can't count to ten. The problem of those teachers with a big knowledge is often that they can't imagine how the students or kids are thinking. They can't put themselves in the situation or mental level of a kid or a student and so it's also almost impossible to teach the students in a simple and understandable way. A 'perfect' teacher is in my opinion someone who understand the whole theme, who can look through it and probably remembers his own struggle of this theme in the old days, and teaches the kid in a structured way including a basis-knowledge.
