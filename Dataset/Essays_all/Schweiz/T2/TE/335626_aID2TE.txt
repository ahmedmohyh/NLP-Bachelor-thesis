In school nowadays, the teachers and students have a close relationship in order to help the students in the most understanding way. Many teachers are therefore more interessted in relating to the students instead of teaching them the subject. So the question arises, is it more important for the teacher to have a healthy relationship with the student or should he be more concerned about his knowledge in the Subject?

There are many good and bad teachers, but what defines a bad teacher is not necessarily the knowledge in his subject, but more his attitude towards the class. For example a highly studied teacher with excellence knowledge in his subject may have troubles to communicate with the students, so that the student may not understand the teacher or may even loose interest in the subject.

On the other hand, a teacher that is on the same level as a student may not have the skill and knowledge to teach the student properly, resulting in a lack of information that can be important for continuation of that subject.

In conclusion, both scenarios are bad for a student, and will be inconvienient for the students future. My personal opinion is that a teacher should absolutely have the knowledge of his subject, and that a good relationship is only an advantage. So the final answer for the original question is that the teacher should be mostly concerned with the content of his subject, and as a second priority he should try to relate to the students.
