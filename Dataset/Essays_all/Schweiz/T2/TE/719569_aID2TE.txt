A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. This can't be the right way, beacause why do the students go to school? Exactly, they want to learn something and this is only possible if the teacher have a excellent knowledge of the subject. Without the knowledge of the teacher, the students don't have to go to school, because they wouldn't learn something and they wouldn't know something about a subject. On the other hand, a good relevation between the teacher and the students is very important to make qualitative school. But you don't have to forget, that the teacher isn't a friend or a familymember, so you can't have the same relevation to your teacher like you have to your friends. You have to give respect to your teacher but the teacher also have to give respect to his students.
I think, if you want a excellent knowledge of a subject, a good relevation between the teacher and the stundents is important. Without that you won't learn as much as possible and you won't be happy. So a teacher's ability to relate well with students is important but the knowledge of the subject is the reason why the students go to school.
