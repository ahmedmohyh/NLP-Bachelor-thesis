One thing you could say against this statement is that teaching is useless if you are passing on the wrong information. No matter how good the teacher can relate to the sudents and if the students are learning the wrong information teaching is pointless.

On the other hand it is pointless aswell if only the teacher knows all the information precisly but the students have no clue because the teacher has such bad relaing skllis that it is impossible for him to explain what he is thinking.

The last but probabely the most important argument is that the teacher is working witch childern or teenagers, young people often struggeling with finding themselfs, selfconvidenc and social interaction. In this part of life people are often looking for a rolemodel sombodey they can talk to and somebody who listens to them. This part in life is really important. Young people can not go through this alone they need someone by their side. Sometimes partens can't offer this desperately needed help. In that case it is a teachers job to listen to their students and help where ever they can. And thats excactly why it is important for a teacher to be able to relate very well with people.

The perfect teacher is a person how understands what he's talking about and not passing on wrong informations but has really good relaing skills. It is more important to have the ability to relate with people than knowing unnessesary stuff.
