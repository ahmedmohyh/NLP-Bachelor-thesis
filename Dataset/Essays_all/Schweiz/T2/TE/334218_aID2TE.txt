Beeing able to talk to your students as a teacher - an ability which is sometimes the one thing missing in a class. But as a teacher you have to do more than just beeing able to cooperate with your class. To what extend does the ability to talk to students ristrict a teachers performance and how important is it in general?

First of all, it depends clearly on the subject and especially on the age of the students. As a 2nd grade primary-teacher, one of the most important things if not the most important thing is to be able to talk to your students in a way that they understand you. At this stage there is not any need for a big knowledge, since you are getting prepared to be able to learn later in life. 

On the other hand, if you work as a professor at a university for example, there's nothing more important then your personal knowledge of a topic, because what the students need in this stage is not an assistant who helps them learning, they need somebody who knows what he is talking about and who can give them as much information as possible.

You could show this in an easy experiment. If you were to put a primary teacher to a university and a ETH-professor to a primary school, they both lack of skills in the areas I was talking about. The professor would hardly be able to teach the students anything, eventhough he knows everything. On the other hand you have the primary teacher, who barely knows anything but who can perfectly relate to the university students, which as well makes him a useless teacher. 

To sum up, its impossible to generalize the importance of a teachers ability to relate to students, since it is very depending on the grade and the skills of the students.
