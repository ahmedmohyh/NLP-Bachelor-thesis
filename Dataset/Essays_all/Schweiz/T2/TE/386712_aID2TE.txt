Imagine a teacher who has great relations to everybody. Every student like him because you can laugh with him, he makes easy lessons and you can easily get good marks. But they only like him because they get on an easy way good marks. So good marks are more important to them than If the teacher is very sever the students maybe dont like him as the other one  but they learn more with the stricter teacher. So for the future of the students is it more important to get all the knowledge they can. Not to have good marks by learning nothing. But it is also a problem if the teacher is really clever but none of the stundets understand him

I think it is more important to have teacher who has an excellent knowledge about his subject. Perhaps I get some bad marks in his tests because they are really difficult. But that is better than having a teacher who can relate well to me but I dont learn anything in his lessons. So for my future I would say, bad marks aren`t the end but bad knowledge is it. So I dont agree with this statement.
