It is important that the teacher know his stuff, 'cause when he doesnt it's hard for the students to understand the subject. The Otherside is that it isn't that good if a teacher always understood the subject, so he can't really see where the students have problems and also it would be hard to explain it easily for the students becasue for him everything makes sence. When teachers know where the students have problems because they had the same problems as  students, they will know how to explain it, because they understand there stuff and can relate. When teacher always just knew it then he will need alot of expirence to understand where the problems of the students are, and even then he will not explain it that good. The problem could be, that they know not enough about the subject, in this case they cound't explain it that good because they also don't understand it.

My expirience right know is, that we have a teacher who dont really understands the stuff, but even cant relate to us, and thats the badest thing that can happen to student, because like that you really have to do alot on your own to understand the subject. We also have the kind of teacher which just go throught the topic that much so that you just know it, because you repeat it that much, I think thats a good way, he understands the subject and because of his experience he knows what the students need to make great marks. We also have a teacher which is young knows her stuff and can relate to us, so thats the best way. Because she understands where we have problems and can help us throught that because she really knows something about it. So in the end I would say bouth is as important as the other.
