To be misunderstood is one of the most annoying feelings during a lesson. There are so many complicated subjects which are not easy to teach. The fact that a teacher ignores a student's question is well known. Especially, when the teacher assumes that the student already knows everything about the information being told. A teachers's excellent knowledge about a subject does not ensure an usful lesson. 

There are so many teachers who think that it is enough to stand in front of a class and show them their skills. Unfortunately, the students can not follow the huge amount of information they give them. Additionally, there is a confusion and misunderstanding between the stundent and the teacher. Often, the students try to ask question but do not get an appropriate answer in return because the teacher thinks that it must be clear what he has told them. If there is not enough communication between these two, the lesson will be for nothing. 

Given these points, I agree with the statement that a teachers's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. If the teacher does not try to have a relaxed relationship with the students, the students will not listen so carefully as the teacher would like to have it. In conclusion, the teacher has to find a way to win the stundents for his lessons.
