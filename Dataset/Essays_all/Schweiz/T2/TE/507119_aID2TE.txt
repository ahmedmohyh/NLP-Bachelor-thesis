The statement to be discussed is: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Firstly, one must say that it is possible that communication is a very big key point in teaching. Having to present your subject in a way that the students aren't bored to death by it is a very important, and being able to relate wih the students might be helpful in that situation.
 Contrairy to that, a subject's quality cannot be very well if the teacher has no or little knowlege of it. A teacher needs to know what he's talking about, or else he will have difficulties answering questions coming from students. The educational aspect of the situation is clearly affected negatively if you put the ability to relate over knowledge of the subject. And if the subject is taught in a way that it is possible to tell that the teacher has no clue about it, the communicational side would also suffer.
Furthermore is the attention span of a student much longer if he likes the subject's teacher. Getting along with the people in your working- or school environment is quite an essential point to be happy where you are. But the lection's quality might suffer if the teacher gets too close with the students, which would cause the teaching to lose it's seriosity. 
Personally, i do not agree fully with either of the two statements. I think that a mixture between good knowlege and being able to relate well is the solution to this duscussion. One should not give one of these possibilities more priority than the other, because they only work if they are used the same way.
