First I'll talk about the things that make me disagree with the statement.

I think that the knowledge of the subject that's being taught is really important. If a teacher doesn't know a lot of things about the subject, she/he won't be taken seriously. Especially if she/he can't answer any questions because they go beyond her knowledge and what she/he prepared for the lessons.

Secondly the students don't have to "be friends" with their teachers they just have to study in school. The understanding students seek is something parents or friends should give them.

There are also reasons why I could agree with this statement.

Teachers should be conscious of the students not being roboters but humans. They can't always make the best grades or be concentrated and sometimes everything is just too much. Teachers should try to remember how they felt like, being a student and how much things they had to think about besides of school.

The last argument I want to talk about is how much time students spend in school. It's practically their whole day and if every teacher doesn't understand how they feel it would be an unescapable situation which you'd have to relive every day.

In my opinion this statement is false because the understanding isn't more important than the knowledge. I can't deny, that how much a teacher can relate is really important, but I feel like the most important task of a teacher is to teach.
