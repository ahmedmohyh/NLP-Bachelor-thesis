Teachers should have an excellent knowledge of the subject and the ability to relate well with students aswell. If teachers can relate very well with the students their classes will automatically be more interesting for the students and they will be more willing to learn new things. But you also have to have a good knowledge about your subject. If not, your ability to relate well with your students will not be helpfull because students know that they don't learn from you. If a student needs help in understanding something that is hard to get, you should be able to relate well with it, otherwise you couldn't help him to get through the problem. Then you also need the knowledge to explain the problems from different views because it could may be that the student didn't get the task because of the way the teacher explained it. 
The ability to relate well with students and to have an excenllent knowledge about your subject are linked to eachother. That's why I think teachers should have both traits to be a good teacher and to teach the students in an interesting way. If your knowledge is very bad the students will realise that and won't be concentrated in your class. But if you can't relate well with students you also have a problem because they may will be disrespectful in some ways or aren't interested in your subject anymore because you can't create an interesting lesson.
