The Teacher's Dilemma

   It has been a controversal issue for some time now: Expertism or the ability to relate? What should be the more defining property of all teachers. No doubt, an excellent teacher would have and should have both properties, but which one more so?

   Relation from the teaching party to the learning one will ensure, or come closest to ensure, a fair chance for everyone to have a shot at good grades. Not just those who have a general talent for whatever subject and need no helping hand, but for those in need of just that. Those that don't get things right away. Those that need a relating teacher.

However, if hypothetically a teacher sacrifices expertism in favour of relation, the quality of class will suffer. That would lead faults and wrong facts to settle within the memories of students. If decreasing quality of class is what brings forth more students being related to, it's questionable if the meaning behind teaching is fulfilled.

    Without expertism, there can be no teaching in the first place, or at least a faulty one at best. However without relation of any kind, teaching is still possible, even if a fraction of the class that would profit from said relation is disfavoured. Thus, I believe a teacher's knoweledge to be more important than her or his ability to relate.
