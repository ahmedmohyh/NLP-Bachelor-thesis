Ability to teaching a subject 

In High School and University most teachers and professors hold their classes as if they were the only ones in the whole entire room. Most of them are extremly knowledgeable about the subject they teach, which is also a very important factor to being a good teacher, but is that enought to  become an excellent one? 

My awser to this possing question is most definitelly not, in order to becoming an excellent teacher one must not only be vastly knowledgeable about ones subject, but also be able to peek the interest of ones pupils. This on psycholocial side can only be achieved when people/teachers are able to relate with their students. 

Also everybody has the ability to study a subject and try to understand it what makes it difficult is trying to explain that topic to a person who has not the furthest clue of what that topic inclines. A teacher is an outstanding teacher, when students at the end first of all grasp the subject in itsself and secondly when they become interested and show the desire to study further into that topic. This is exactly what makes a good teacher stand out from the average. 

To conclude studing a subject only to understand it yourself does not pose to be too difficult, however what complicates the task of a teacher is the ability to transscribe your knowledge to other people.
