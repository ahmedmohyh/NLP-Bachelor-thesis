What is more important for a teacher? His knowledge about the subject or his ability to well with students.

I think it's more important for a teacher how he realates with his students.  I mean imagine following situation: You are a student  and the teacher wants you to explain something. So he does it with a special game to show you how it works. Now your friend asks the teacher a question and the teacher has no idea about the solution. The teacher could now look on the internet what the solution is and then he can explain it to your friend. And at the end all children know how the subject works.
But when the teacher is boring and he doesn't relate good with the students and he just explains them his subject, it could be very difficult for many students to understand the basics of the subject, so they would never be able to solve problems in this subject. And because the teacher can't relate good with the students, they will have problems to understand him when he explains.

Another Argument is the motivation of the students. I mean it's important for a student that he's motivated. And a student can only be motivated, when his teacher can relate good with students. When the teacher isn't able to motivate the sutdents. The students would never be able to perform high marks in the exams.

A pro Argument for a Teacher who only knows his subejct very well is, that he is always able to respond the questions from a student. And he can always explain his subject very well. 

In the end I have to say that it's importand to have certain balance but when i would have to choose what's better i would say it's better that a teacher relates good with his students instead of only knowing his subject very well, because a teacher who organises his lessons good, can often more achieve than a teacher who only knows his subject.
