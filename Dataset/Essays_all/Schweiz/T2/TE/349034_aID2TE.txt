Some students say that teachers need to be able to relate with the students but ohters say that teacher need an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. Here I list some reasons why to agree and why to disagree.

If a teacher is able to relate to every student it can help explaining a subjct better because the teacher knows what the students understand and how to explain it. Because the teacher knows what the students need for example in maths. A student doesn't understand a subject in maths and the teacher can help because she knows how it needs to be explained to that student.
On the other hand though if a teacher hasn't an excellent knowledge of the subject she/he teaches than she/he can explain total nonsense because she/he has just a good to little knowledge about what she/he teaches. For example in a language the teacher could explain the tenses totally wrong maybe even use them wrong but the students wont know it. They just learn what the teacher teaches them.
But a good thing could be that student like the lessons better. For example if the students understand the subject during the lessons they are more motivated to learn more and to study for the subject. But if they don't understand thei're just confused and don't feel motivated to study.
The problem though is that the teacher is teaching a suject she/he doesn't know much about. So the teacher can just say anything but there is a chance that it's wrong because the teacher hasn't the right knowledge of it.

Personally I disagree with the statement because a teacher studied to get the knowledge of what she's teaching and if she/he hasn't an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach it doesn't make a sense that thei're a teacher.
