You have to imagine a lesson in which the teacher tries to make jokes with you, wants to talk with your class about the world and forgets totally the actual reason he is in front of you. After a week you have a test but you can't solve the exercices because nobody trained them with you. And all that just because the teacher want to relate with you. Now you know a lot about his life and he knows a lot about yours but the school isn't important anymore.

Maybe you got luck and the teacher doesn't makes very difficult tests also because he doesn't know a lot about his theme that he has to teach you and also because he is a bit lazy and doesn't want to but a lot of effort in the test and the class. But at the end on at matura exam or on every other final exam you have to know all of this things perfectly and in the right way. And that's the problem.

So for me a teacher isn't a person with who I have to have a good connection. For me he is here to teach us his materia as good as he can and also that we can understand it. That means that he sometimes has to explain it in different words what is just possible if he has a excellent knowledge. It's the most important point that a teacher can teach his stuff in a good way and that he takes his job serious. Teachers aren't here to listen to our problems, that isn't their job. They doesn't have to stay at our side if we are in strugle or somthing like that. They just have to teach us something for our lifetime.
