A statement is a generalizing thing, but I often struggle with generalizations like this one. I think in most cases they don't tell the the whole truth because they cannot deal with every single possible situation. The same goes with this statement.
First of all, yes, I think a teachers ability to relate well with the students is more important in most cases. If a person knows everything thers is to know in this world but he isn't able to spread this information, society cannot profit from his knowledge. I'd rather have a teacher that knows less, but is able to connect with the students and actually makes them understand the topic. By doing that, he hands his knowledge down to the next generation, which is the main purpos of school.
On the other hand, there definately needs to be kind of a mix. Obviously, if the teacher just barely knows as much about a topic as the children, it's going to be really hard for him to consistently provide them with new information and his ability to relate well with the students would be useless.
So, overall I agree with the statement but I feel like its necessary for a teacher to make a compromise between excellent knowledge and realating with the students.
