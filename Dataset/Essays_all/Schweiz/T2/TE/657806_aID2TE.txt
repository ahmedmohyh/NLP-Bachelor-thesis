Education is a key point when it comes to planning your future. There are many different educational paths you can choose that sometimes are quite different to each other. But one thing all of them have in common. No matter what path you choose you will always have to interact with your teachers. Teachers are also qute different to each other especially when it comes to relating to students. This is why in the following essay I will take a closer look at whether it is more important for a teacher to relate to his students or to have excelent knowledge about the subject.

As a student the most important thing is if a teacher is kind and makes tests that are not too hard to take. You can say that these teachers have a closer bound to their class than a teacher that is disciplinated and severe. Often students like teachers who make easy exams better because they get good grades. But eventually this will be a desadvantage in a student's later life. Because, of course, students won't study as hard when the tests are easy. Maybe a teacher with a better knowledge of the subject makes harder tests and will force students to study more and therefore have a better education. On the other side teachers who can relate to their students will make the information last longer in a student's brain  because maybe students are more willing to learn because they like the subject better. Also having excellent knowledge about a subject doesn't mean that a teacher can teach it well. It takes way more than just knowing what you talk about for yourself.

In my opinion having a teacher that relates to me and understands me is way more important than having a teacher that knows absolutely everything about a subject. As I mentioned, information will stick longer in my brain if classes are fun. So it may help me even some years in the future.
