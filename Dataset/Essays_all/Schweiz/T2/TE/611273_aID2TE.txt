First of all I want to say, that I agree with this statement but as anytime there are arguments for it and against it. For teachers it is often difficult to explain the subject in a good way to the students. Because they have studied the whole subject for many years and students hear the things mostly for their first time.
Therefor I think the ability to relate well with students is much more important than the knwoledge. Teachers know anyway much more about the subject which they teaching, because it is their own interesst. Of course there are exceptions but only if there is a student, who is a super genius.¨
An other thing is, when the teacher is a nice guy and has a good realatinship with the class, it is for me much easier to learn something. 
On the other side a teacher should not be and act like a friend. The teacher need a big knowledge of his or her subject, otherwise it is embarassing. The students have to take their teacher serious. This only works, when they know, that he or her is good in what he is doing.

In the end it needs both. A good realatinoship between the teacher and the students and the knowledge of the teacher, which he can explain well. Anyhow the teachers have to be treated with respect and the opposite.
