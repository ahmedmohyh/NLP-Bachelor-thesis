I am half agree with this statement.

It is very important that the teacher's relate well with the sudents. If this is the case, student will learn easily and faster. They like to go to school when the relatinsship is good between students and teachers. For sudents it is very important that they had a good contact to the school and allsow to the teachers. 
If the didn't like the teachers, they dont't will learn for thougs subject. And they will come to school without motivation. 

But the secont part of the statement is alsow very importent. A teacher that isn't excellent wellknown with his subject couldn't teach the sudents. The sudents will recognise it that the teacher isn't in touch with the subject. Therefors it is allsow very important that the teacher shows the interssting things of his subjects. With interseeting facts, that is helpfuly for your live in the past, you can students animaded to learn new things.

At the end i didn't agree with this statement. The three wordes "is more important" can't be right. Bouth parts are important. If a teacher now this and do it in his job he will be a very good teacher.
