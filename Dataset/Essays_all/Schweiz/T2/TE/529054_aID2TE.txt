I agree with this statement, beacause a teacher who knows everything about a subject, but can't explain it to their students may run into trouble when trying to explain something to some students. But I also think that a teacher should have enough knowledge of a subject to actually teach their students something.
As an example why being able to relate to someones studens I would like to mention a former teacher from secondary school. She had knowledge of the subjects she was teaching, but if you did't understand how something worked she wasn't able to explain something and she sometimes didn't even really understood your problem. I such a case you have to rely on other studens and hope that they know the subject. I personally never had a teacher with no or very little knowledge of their subject, but it whould probably be disastrous for the students. The best would be someone that know their subject well and can relate to their students. Then the teacher has something to teach their students and can help them if the have problems with the subject. Lacking in one of these two things is bad for the education of the students.
In conclusion I think its really important for teachers to have the ability to relate well with their students, but this shouldn't effect the amount of knowledge the teacher has I the subject being taught.
