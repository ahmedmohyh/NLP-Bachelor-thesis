Teachers and their subjects- the difference between knowledge and lesson atmosphere

For students it is always important to have a good relation to their teachers. A good atmosphere and the ability to realte to the students creates a well working relation between teacher and student. But is the relation more important than the actual knowledge of the subject being taught?

The relation to the teacher can be very important. If during the lesson there can be a laugh and a joke with the teacher the learning atmosphere is better and the students might enjoy and pay more attention during the lesson.  If the teacher can relate to the students he might understand if there are homework missing or if someone had a bad day and wrote a bad exam. He might understand the stress of many exams and that there is not only his subject but also a lot of others. Teachers who don't care for students and the rest of the school subject are often less liked than the others and the learn atmosphere in class gets inefficient. On the other hand a teacher who can teach with passion and has an excellent knowledge on his/her subject and can answer interesting questions and you can see that this person is fascinated about the subject, can teach more and more intersting things than someone who does not always know the answer or is not sure about specific things. Also if the teacher as a person may not be my favourite one if he is teaching well, the ability to relate with students is less important. If students know that they will learn something, they will look forward to the lesson.

There should be a mix between the ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge. I think that it is not possible for a teacher to know everything but it is important that he shows knowledge and passion for the subject he is teaching. A good ability to relate is important for a good learning atmosphere, but it must not be too much of a friendship between the teacher and the student.
