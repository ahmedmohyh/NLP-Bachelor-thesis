A teacher's ability to relate well with students is a very important skill. Many would even say that it's more important than having good knowledge of the subject they are teaching.
 On one side, it is very important for a teacher to know a lot about the subject they are teaching. Teachers need to be able to explain things clearly, which requires having a deep understanding of the subject. Students may also have questions that require more background or knowledge than planned. For example, if a history teacher is talking about the Second World War, and a student asks what the situation was before the war, the teacher needs to have enough knowledge to answer the question.
 On the other hand, having the ability to relate well with students is an extremely important skill. A teacher needs to capture the interest of his/her students, for those students to even listen or show any motivation in class. Also, it is more likely for a student not to pay attention in class if he or she does not like the way they are being taught. Different people also learn differently, so if the teacher is able to create an environment where he or she can connect to all students and all students feel comfortable, it will ensure a better understanding of the subject generally within the class.  
In my opinion, a teacher's ability to relate to students is much more important than their knowledge of the subject they are teaching. Of course, knowledge is required to even be able to explain and teach, but in many cases, the student has to be willing to listen and learn in the first place. I have been in many situations where I don't pay attention or participate in class, not because I don't understand the subject, but because I don't feel comfortable with the way it is being taught. It motivates me when teachers are understanding and actually care if I understand, and they aren't just going through the curriculum without even paying attention to how students are doing.
