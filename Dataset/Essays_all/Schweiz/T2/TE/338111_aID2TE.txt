It is very important to understand what the students want. There are many schools, where teachers are not able to teach, because they have not the ability to communicate correctly with theire students.

The knowledge of the teachers in primary schools, secundary schools and also in gymnasist depends on, how they got taught in university, but also how they record theire learning stuff. For the students it is very important to get taught from a potent teacher, who knows what he or she says. If it is not like that, the stundent can not follow them, because it is too confusing for the mainpart. 

But for example in primary school, they have to know how to communicate with theire children, because they can not learn very much if they do not understand what the teacher wants to say. For example: the teacher have to repeat the real important things many time, so the students can imagine, what does this really mean. If the teachers do not repeat that all the time and continue by saying it, for example an important word, only one time, they can not follow the thinking steps of the teacher. In the university it is not such a problem because, the students know very much on that theme before they get into a lesson. 

I think if you really want to teach something to other people, you have to create your own style, how you can communicate with students, but also teach them your knowledge. It also depends on which knowledge from the students you get. In primary school it is not the same like in a university. In primary school the children want to know everything, but in a high school they want to create theire knowledge, so they can build up a career for a job with that. And not every student learns on the same way. A few have to listen it much more times, what the teacher say, than other.
