I think it's true...
On one side you have to know how to handle with kid's or even whit older student's. I say when you just know the subject well and you don't know how you lead a lesson that everybody is going to take an advantage out of the lesson, the whole knowledge of the teacher is for nothing.

The task for the teacher is not that he could improve his knowledge rather he should give his information in a easy understandable way to the student's. I think it's also important to show passion by the thing your teaching. Whithout that the student's can't make an emotional connection to the topic or the theme and without tis emotional influence you learn much less than with emotions
.
On the other side it's vital that you know the subject of what you're teaching. When you just have the ability of relate whith student's you don't have a chance to survive in this profession.

You can do anything but when you'haven't the knowledge which is needed you're going to fail in front of the class and nobody will learn something. So it's more important to know the subject than to handle with sudent's.
When you're just explaning the topic it even helps the student's so maybe a few are listening and learning things. But when you can handle a class and just teaching unvaluable things, it's not worth it.
