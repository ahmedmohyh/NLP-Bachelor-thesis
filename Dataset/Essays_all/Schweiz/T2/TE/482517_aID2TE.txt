In my opinion this statement is absolutely true.
For sure it's important that a teacher has knowledge of his subject, but what does the excellent knowledge helps, if he/she can't teach it to the students. Also it's important to motivate the students to learn things and to make them like going to school. A student who likes going to a certain class and is motivated is easyer and also more fun for the teacher. I would say it's important that the teacher has some knowledge in his subject but he/ she doesn't have to be the best. Another point is that if there is maybe a difficult strange kid in the class, that the teacher also can handle it.
From my point of view, I see a big difference between the secondary school and the gymnasium. In secondary school my math teacher didn't study mathematics, he was just a teacher whith some knowledge about science. I used to be very good at math, because my teacher was able to teacher the subject the way everybody could understand it. Now here in Wattwil my math teacher has way better math skills than my secondary school teacher, because he studied mathematics. But he is not able to give his knowledge to us the way we can understand it. Here is a little example: I don't understand a task so I ask the teacher to help me. My secondary school techer tried to explain it differently to me so I was able to understand it. My current math teacher just repeats and repeats the things he said before, because he just learned the definitions. The opposite example is my biology teacher: She didn't study biology at university and sometimes if I have a difficult question she says 'I have to look it up'. But I really like the way she teaches the subject and I'm much more motivated to attend her class than the math class.
