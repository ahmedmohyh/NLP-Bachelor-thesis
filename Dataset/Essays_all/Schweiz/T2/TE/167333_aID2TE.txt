Abilities of a good teacher

In my school, there are two kind of professor's I like. The ones that are funny and can relate well with us students or the other ones that are very strict but have an excellent knowledge to share. Now I ask myself, which one of 
those two types is the better one? The teacher who relates well with students or the teacher with an excellent knowledge about his subject?

First of all, it is very important to have a good relationship to your teacher. If you have struggles in a subject, it is much easier to ask a teacher for help that you like than a teacher you don't like. And if you have a fight with your teacher you can talk about it and get rid of the problem. 
Second, if a teacher can relate well with his students, the students are motivated to participate during the lessons and pay attention to the teacher. This is especially important for students that are lazy.
On the other side it is very important that a teacher has a good knowledge of his subject. If he is not able to explain us the topic properly because he doesn't have enough backrond-information, the students won't be thaught the knowledge they should be.

Im my opinion the teacher should rather have an excellent knowledge than a good relationship to the students. In a high school the students should be able to study by themselv
