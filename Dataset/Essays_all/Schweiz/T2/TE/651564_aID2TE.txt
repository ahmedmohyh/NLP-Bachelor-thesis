It is certain that a teacher has to be able to communicate well with his students and therefore be able to transfer his knowledge. Otherwise the students might struggle learning and the learning process might fataly be slowed down. 

On the other hand does it seem quite useless having a communicative and relateable teacher but no knwoledge to transfer. The worst thing to happen would be an ecco chamber like classroom, confirming everyones opinion, without correcting or informing.

In my opinion, both abilities are unarguebly important, but the excellent knowledge of the subject beeing thaught is more important than the students feelings. One could argue that the needed abilities may differ from age to age, for a first grade child having different needs than a University student. Small children may need less specific knowledge but more relatable teachers than older students. 
An adult however should be concerned with the accuracy of his teacher, and only second with his relatability. The same goes for the media, it does not have the duty to show you whatever you want, but to inform.
