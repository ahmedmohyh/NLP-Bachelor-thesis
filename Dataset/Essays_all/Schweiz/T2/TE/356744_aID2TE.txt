To find a brilliant teacher has become a real problem. Nowadays we always try to help the studenst for their futur life. In this essay I try to find out if a theacher who kows better how to relate well with the students is automaticly better than a teacher who knows well the subject.

First of all I think that everyone should know how he can learn the best way. So this is why it would be better to have a teacher that can help other because there a many students who don't know how to success with learning. A teacher with this ability could help them to success. 
Another reason why this type of teacher would be better is that they would care more about the students and this would also mean that everyone would success better.

However it is important to know the subject very well because otherwise the students would believe everything a teacher says also if it isn't the truth. And with wrong informations they wouldn't be prepared as good as the other for their later working life.Moreover I think that the students have to have their one motivation to go to school and learn and so it's neccessari that the teacher knows well the subject and it should not be their work to help motivating the students.

To sum up, I think that a mix of both abilitys would bring the best success. In my point of view I think that every teacher should know his subject and know how to work with their students. So let's hope that every student has the possibility to work with theacher who wants their best and know a lot about their subject.
