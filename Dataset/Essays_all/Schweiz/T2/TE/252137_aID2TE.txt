At my school there used to be a professor I will call by the name of M.S. By the end of our first year with him, our class received some of the worst marks ever and he was never seen again at our school for some more or less ambiguous reasons. While, as our entire class agrees on, he had huge knowledge of his subject, he failed terribly at relating to the big part of students. Now I want to find out what is more important: Knowledge of your subject or "interhuman" capabilities.

The first topic that has to be adressed is that students are never the same in a classes and that there can be major diffenrences in the abilities of the students. Therefore, for the sake of making a clear argument, I will take a mathematically perfect class consisting of a quarter for which knowledge is more important, one quarter which relies on a relatable teacher and half of the class who has mixed feelings. And a successful teacher should at least have three quarters of the class on his side.

Regarding the real world we always search for the perfect path in the middle. For knowlegde does not help anything if you do not manage to get it across and the other way around aswell. But one still has to look at the different levels of school teaching. In primary where knowledge is low relatability is highly important and at university where knowledge is high relatability looses some of it's importabce.

To me personaly knowledge is slightly more of importance than relatability as it was the case with M.S. Because great knowledge for students with a lot of exitement and enthusiasm for the subject also results in a high relatability.
