The ability to relate well with his students is really important for a teacher. When the students dont like him, it can be extremely boring for them. They don't listen to the teacher anymore and dont do their homework eventhough the teacher knows a lot about his subject. I think it helps when the teacher relates well with his students but this is not the only thing which is needed to create intersting lessons. Its in my opinion more important that the teacher has a good knowledge of the subject. It is easier for him to make the lessons interesting and he can explain something a lot better to his students. And that is what a teacher has to be, I think.Others may argue with me but it does not help a student when the teacher is kind and friendly but he can not learn him anything about his subject.
In  primary scool it might be a bit different. In this period of time its more important that the children feel good in the subjects and that the begin to like some of the subjects. But after the first few years, things are getting more difficult and therefore explaining is getting really important. 
Thats why I tend to say that an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is quite more useful than the ability to relate well with the students. For that reason I disagree with the statement.
