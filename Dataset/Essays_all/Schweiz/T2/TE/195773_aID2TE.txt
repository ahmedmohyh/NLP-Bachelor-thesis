In the following essay I am going to talk about the situation between teachers and students. What is more important: The relationship between those two human beings or the knowledge that is being transferred? I will be working out the pros and cons of this theme. 
Firstly, it is very important that the teacher knows what he is talking about. He has to be aware of his subject and completely sure about all kind of problems that could appear concerning his lessons. The students need to have a person who can answer their questions professionally, only this way they can respect the person standing in front of the blackboard.
Secondly, I am connectiong to the last point I was exaggerating before. Someone who is respected and being looked up to, will probably be motivating for the students, because they can be sure that their work is being judged correctly. 
On the other hand, there are lots of arguments that can weight more than the knowledge itself. 
A relaxing and calm surrounding with good social contacts is essential to create a good atmosphere to learn. So if the teacher has very little ability to interact nicely with the students it makes them feel bad or unable to learn when he is around. However, this way the teacher could be excellent in his subject but the students can not take a profit out of that because the relationship does not work. 
In conclusion I think it is very important that the teacher has both, social and knowledge ability. But I know how difficult it is to concentrate when there is a person around who puts a lot of pressure on me, so if I had to choose I would definitely weight the social relations as being more important because I think that a good relationsship helps a lot in terms of motivation and ability to learn something.
