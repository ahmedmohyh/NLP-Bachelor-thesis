I can't say I "agree" or "disagree". The statement tells, that it is more important that a teacher has a good relation to the students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject. In my opinion, this statement is not true for every situation. What I want to say is that it depends on how old the students are and in which grade they are. Of course. In primary school it's very important that the teacher is able to support the children and help them individually. He should not only be interested in their marks or educational progress. In this grades, teacher are not only teachers. They should be a person who the children can trust and where they can tell their problems if it's not possible for them to talk to their parents, friends, siblings or other people. They should teach the children important basics that they are well prepared for higher levels, but they should also teach them some social aspects.
In higher grader, like high school or college, I think the relation between a teacher and his students isn't such an important point. The students are older and often they attend school voluntarily. The want to learn facts instead of how to act with other people. But, even if the relation between teachers and their students get more and more unimportant while the children get older, it doesn't mean that a good relation is not helpful anymore. Also in the higher grades they should treat each other with respect to guarantee a good learning process. 
So, the relation between a teacher and a student is important during the whole school time, despite that the relation changes with the students ages and their independence.
