To answer this question you need to think about what the school needs to teach their students? Is it about knowing about a subject as much as possible or preparing them for their lives? Most schools thrive toward the first one which in my opinion  is destructive. A society cannot survive with people who only have knowledge of certain matters but also needs people how know how to live and how to interact with each other. 
The schools are too concerned what the job market and the companies expects their future employees to be, rather than what society as whole and the indiviual students need. Capitalistism should not affect what schools teach their students. 
If a teacher has exellent knowledge of a subject but fails to get through to the students resulting in them not understanding and learning the subject, is as bad as a teacher who has little to no knowledge but is great with interacting with the stutents. Therefore, i think a mixtue of both would make the perfect teacher. One who not only can relate with students but also manages to teach them things they need for their live and has knowledge of the topic.
