On the following lines I am going to talk about the statement: "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." What this statement actually wants to tell us,is that a teacher`s social and psychological abilities are more important than his or her education or knowledge.


The most important thing for students is to pass their final exams in order to be able to study at university.What they really need for that, is an excellent education and somebody who knows about his/her subject perfectly.In this case, who cares about their relation to the teacher?

On the other hand,a teacher that has a good relation to the students will make learning things and listening in the lessons much easier for them because he/she then functions as a motivator.

In the end,what counts are the grades.It can`t be, that students don`t pass their exams due to a teacher,that has social skills and is on good terms with the students, but has no idea what he/she is talking about.

School should also act a little  as an education for life.In life, being able to communicate and socialize with other humans, is the most important thing.Also when you`re starting to work or go to university,those features will always be in the center.Most teachers, that teach on our level,have an excellent education ,so you shouldn`t worry to much about that.Not all details are important,just that the person is able to explain the most important things.

In my opinion, a teacher`s ability to relate well with students is the most important thing.Whenever I have a teacher, that doesn`t interact properly with me,or is rude and pessimistic,i lose motivation for that subject.Because I feel like the person who teaches you a certain subject,can influence so mucg , about how you get on with that subject.And also,an agressive or just passive teacher is very contra productive.
