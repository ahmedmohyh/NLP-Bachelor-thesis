The first thing we have to think about is what are the qualities of a good teacher. I've experienced a lot of them having a excellent knowledge but they were unable to explain it in a way the stundents understand. I rather have a teacher that can explain the things that I have to know, than a teacher that knows everything. The best example is maths. A lot of stundents have problem with this subject, not because they are stupid but because the teacher is not able to explain things the way these students understand them. Many stundents don't raise their hands when they don't understand something and then they get into trouble.
So a teacher's ability to relate with their students is clearly more important for me than an excellent knowledge. Of course the best case scenario the teacher is able to do or to have both of these habits but not many have them. I've experienced that in subjects with teachers that were not able to like deliver their knowledge in a certain way so that everybody understands the point I've had worse marks than in other subjects, even I liked this subject more than another.
I think the most important thing a teacher should be capable of, is to teach in a exciting and interesting way. Good teachers work with examples and relations to the real life so that you can remember better. There are a lot of teachers that just stand in front of their class talking monotone and with no excitement, so the students are bored and not concentrated,  result there are bad marks. Of course your interest and your willing to learn depents on that what you like or what your interested in. 
An ideal teacher doesn't have to know everything, instead the taecher should be able to encourage you and make you interested in subjects that you usually not like or that bored you.
