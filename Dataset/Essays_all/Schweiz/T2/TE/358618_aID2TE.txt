Teachers have a very important role in a student's education. Students learn in many cases better when they have a teacher they can trust and refer to. The teacher's job is not only to educate his students but also to lead them in the right direction. It is proven that students learn much better and efficient with a teacher they can relate well with. The better the communication and relation between teacher and his students the more effective they learn and also the lessons are more fun.
But isn't it worthless if you can learn good but the things you learn are not correct? Learning wrong things is as inefficient as having a teacher you can't relate with. What's the advantage of effective learning when everything is incorrect?
What really matters is the balance between a good knowledge and the ability to relate well. If a teacher has an excellent knowledge but he doesn't have a good relation with his student then the learing curve will be rather small. It the same with the opposite. If a teacher relates outstanding with his students but he has a very poor knowledge the result is the same as the one stated before.
In my opinion it's very important to relate well with the teacher because you are less afraid to ask something if you don't understand something. But the teacher should also have a good knowledge. Luckily at at my school the teachers have a good mix between a good knowledge and teh ability to relate well.
