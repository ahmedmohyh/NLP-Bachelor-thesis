It's a popular topic in school. The ones thinks that it's more important that a teacher has a good relation with the  students. Other people argue that a good teacher needs an excellent knowledge of the subjects being taught.

In fact students are going with more motivation to school if they have a good teacher. And as a "good" teacher the majority of students unterstand a teacher who relates well with students. More motivation results also in better marks. 

On the opposite side it doesn't helps anybody if the teacher isn't able to spell something according to non existing knowledge. This can results in less difficult lessons easier tests. First this sounds maybe great because every student wants to have as much freetime as possible. Yet imagine when after two years the teacher changes and the new one is more strict. A lot of students would be in truble then, because they in learned in those two years "nothing" and now they should learn new things which are based on the old ones.

But if all teachers only have an excellent knwoledge whithout a little pice of social comptences there's a risk by upcoming problems. For example students begins to lose the respect of the teacher or if there are problems they can't be resolved by discussion. All this factors which firstly seemed not dangerous could result in a non social generation. 

In my opinion a teacher needs both. It's difficult to decide what is more important.
