There are many diffrent kinds of teachers in each school. Some are very kind, others are very well educated, some want the kids to know every single detail about their subjet and others are just not very good with the students. The question now is whether a teacher who's got the ability to relate with students or one that has excellent knowledge of his subject is more important.

In my opinion students like the more relatable teachers more but if he's only a nice guy and doesn't teach them anything he's just a bad teacher. It'd be almost the same as if you'd hire a good friend of yours to teach you some stuff but you're just having a laugh together and so you don't learn a single thing.
The teacher that knows everything about his subject but treats the students very bad is also a bad example of a teacher, because the kids don't like him, so they won't listen to him even though they would get better at school.

A one sided teacher isn't good enough. The "perfect" teacher is a mix of both worlds, that's my answer to the question from above. I understand that these teachers are pretty rare, but with them the students will have fun listening and also learn very much from them.
