I think I have to disagree with this statment however it isn't completly false. But I think that you can never make this statement in such an absolute form. There are many points which influence if somebody is a good teacher or not and you can't just narrow it down to those two points. 

Of course the ability of the teacher to relate well with his students is extremly important for the climate in class. There's a huge difference for the student's enthusiasm for a subject if the teacher is friendly and enthusiastic himself. However it is also abslutly necessary that a techer has a profound and wide knowledge of the subject he's teaching. After all he get's paid to teach the students in this very subject and just because he bonds well with his students doesn't teach them chemistry for example. Never the less a teacher who has an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches but who lacks in comunication and interhuman relations is also not the best choice since he wont be able to teach his students much because they are going to get borred and they will probably lose their intrest for a subject if the get taught by a human how behves just like a mere robot. 

I think in my opinion you have to find a good ballance between knowledge about your subject and the ability to bond with your students and to motivate them for your class. But I have to admit that it is probalby a little bit more important to have an excellent knowledge of your subject than to be able to relate to your students since the primray goal of school is still to teach you. Altough in my opinion having an excellent knowledge about the subject you're teaching and being able to relate to your students aren't two things that exclude themself from each other so as a good teacher you should be able to do both.
