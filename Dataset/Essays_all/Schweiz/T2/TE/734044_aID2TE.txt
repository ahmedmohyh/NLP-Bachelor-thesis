How teachers have to work
Every Students know this lessons, which are very boring, because the teacher is speaking the whole lesson about a subject but nobody understand the topic. the teachers is talking about something that you normaly learn at the univerisity. He starts at one point and at the end of the lesson he ends on the other side, than h began. And every time I think why are they doing that? Want they show us, how inteligent they are?
I think it's much more important, that the teacher talks about interesting things. Things that the students like to hear and to learn. Some actually things, like what we can read every day in the newspaper. If the teacher do that, the students like him more, and it makes the school clima much better. The relation between the teacher and the student is much better if the teacher talks about the things which are students interestet in.
But on the other side, we can say, a student grow up on difficult things. The easy things he can learn at home. He only have to learn the difficult things at school.
I think, a student learn better if he likes the teacher. It makes it much easier to start to learn, if you like the teacher.
I know it, because I have also two tyeps of teacher. One teache is very inteligent but the lessons are very boring, because he always talks about stupid things. The other teacher, which we have, takes every lesson an article from a newspaper and we discuss with this article. He take some actally things. I like hes lessons so much. He is my favourite teacher. so its more imp
