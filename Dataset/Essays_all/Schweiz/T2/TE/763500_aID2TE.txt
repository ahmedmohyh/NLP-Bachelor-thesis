First of all a good relationship between the teachers and their students is very important for the interest of the student. As we all have been to school and had our hated and liked subjects, every suject somehow was depending on whether you liked the teacher or not. Because if you walked in the school room and saw the teacher you liked you already had a little smile in your face after you had a short smalltalk with him or her.

On the other hand you go to school to learn something and not try to build up realationships with your teachers. The teacher should give you the information you need to understand a specific topic in this subject and also should be able to help you if there are any questions. So a teacher needs to have a very good knowledge about their subject. Otherwise the students can't really learn what they should and the goal of going to school hasn't been reached.

Furthermore you have to look at the point, that the teacher doesn't fullfill his profession and gets sacked. If the teachers don't have the knowledge they should bring with them they either get sacked or don't even get the job on which they are applying to. As an example you also can't apply yourself for a job on a bank without having the knowledge about economy and other important stuff.

At the end I personally would say that the teacher should have a better knowledge of the subject than the ability of relating well with students. Because if there isn't any bride knowledge of the teacher about his subject, the teachers and students could have the best relationships to each other, but at the end of the day the students haven't really learned anything.
