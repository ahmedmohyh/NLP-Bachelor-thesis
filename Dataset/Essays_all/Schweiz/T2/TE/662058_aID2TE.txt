It gives many reasons for and against the argeement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". One of the main reason against this statement is, that a teacher have to be a person who have a excellent knowledge to teach a class than without this ability the teacher couldn't answer the questions of the students. Another reason against is, that the teacher also have to work with other teachers, they have to do tasks for the students and when a teacher wouldn't know something about the subject being taught, it would be bad.
But now to the reasons for this statement. In every situation in life, the main task is to have a good realationsshipt to people. Is it as a mother, as a leader or as a teacher, you have to be nice with people. So the teacher. The student have to trust his teacher. When he would have a problem he should can go to the teacher and ask for help. It is very important that the teacher and the students have a good relationship. Then it is also easier to learn new things. 
In my opinion it is more important to relate well with students than to have a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But the teacher have to know also a basic of the subject being taught but it haven't be excellent, to relate well with students is more important.
