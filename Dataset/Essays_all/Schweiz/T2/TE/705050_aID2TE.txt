The point of language class is to learn a new language. But how do you learn a new language? Where do you start? And how do you structure a lesson? Is it better to relate well with the students ore is it more important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

In my opinion the best way to learn and practice a language is to talk. Its really not important what you are talking about and how intellectuell your topic is. But you need to put yourself together and try to start an interesting conversation with the whole class so all students have the chance to get better and better at talking, the main part of a language.
Unfortunately my teacher doesn't share my opinion. He's has the believe that grammar is the most imporant part of learning a new language and sure it is an important part but not that necessary like in his believe. Grammar becomes important when you really want to analyse the langage, want to understand the strucutre or if you study the language at the university. And right now, in eleventh grade, I really don't care if this sentence is activ or passiv. I don't even think about this in my mothertongue! I just want to prepare myself for situations in which ones I have to speak english. You might ask yourself, how can you learn a language if you don't know the grammar. but hey, I did not say that we should expell grammar because the basics are important, tenses for example, but all this stuff about strucure of the sentence and so on is in my opnion just not useful.

In conclusion, I think it's better to relate well with the students so you can have interesting conversations than a person standing right in front of me mumering down what he or she had learned in university.
