Today the people discute about, if it could be more important, a teacher ralate well with students than an excellent knowledge being taught.  Could the students learn more, if they have a good relationship with there teachers? Would they have a better knowledge, when the teacher wrelate well with the teachers?
Everybody was in school and know the problem of a bad teacher you did't like. The ability of a teacher to relate well with students, could this change. If a student have a good relationship with a teacher, he likes to go in his lecon and probaly likes to learn better, because he won't to disappoint him. 
Also the ability to relate well with students is very important, because of this the students are more intrestet in this theme and are motivated to be active in the lecon.
But in case the things you learn in school are very important for the futur and you need them to flourish in life. Without the learned material in scool you can't grow.
Furtermore a student wich have a good relationship with a teacher, could be privilege from the other students. 
So I think the ability of a teacher to relate well with students isn't more impora
