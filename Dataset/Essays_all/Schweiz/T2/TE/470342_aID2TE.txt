It is very tough to build a clear opinion on this statement. At first, it is clear that the teacher should be able to relate to the students and the problem that the students have. It is their role as teacher to understand where the students have problems and where they understand what is tought. 
But in the other way I'm sure that the knowledge of the teacher should be very high. The teacher is there in the first place to give his knowledge to all the students. And if he has not got enough knowledge the students won't learn anything from him. So the knowledge is very important, that the teacher is able to teach new things to the students.
The difficulty is that every student learns best in another way. Some work visual and some audial. Next to this some need to work with examples and other just need enough theory. So that's very dificult for teachers to choose the right way of teaching. 
For the question what the best teacher is there is no absolute answer. The answer to this is relative. But I think that teachers need to have both. They need an excellent knowledge of their subject but also the ability to relate to students. In my opinion, off of one point of knowledge, the ability to relate to students is more important than to have an even better knowledge. Because when you have got enough knowledge and you are able to relate to the students and explain things in some different ways you are teaching them better than in just one way but a way that is "too right".
In the end it's the teachers choice of how to educate the students. But what I have experienced is, that teachers that relate to students and are able to explain things that the students understand it are way better. Because they are motivating the students like this and they are also teaching them more and better than the others, because the students understand it and if not, they will try more to understand it.
