Teachers are the most important persons in our education. To incresase the students level every teacher has a different way. One thing is often forgotten though, the teacher isn't only an educater he also raises the children, which means that the relation between the teacher and the student has a big impact on the progress. 
From my perspective a sympatic teacher increases the motivation and the will to learn of the whole class. When one is in a good mood he's willing to learn and wants to make progress. A teacher with the ability to relate to his students can solve social problems in the class and improve the social environment for every students.
When a teacher is able to relate with his students, he also understandds the problems they have with the matter being taught. This means that he is able to explain the difficulties better and faster. 
The knowledge of the subject being taugt is without discussion very important. It is not necessary though for the student to know every last detail about it.  
To summarize it, I believe that the most important ability a teacher has to have is to understand and relate to the students. This doesn't only improve their education but also their character.
