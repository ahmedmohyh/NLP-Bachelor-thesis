In my opinion the realtion between the sutendts and the teacher must be a good relation. Both of them must show confiance. The teacher must be helpful and careful in a good way. He must to spend lot of time for his students. For the relation this is very important. The student doesn't can show some rudeness. He also must be careful and he must obey the teacher. The way I see it the school lessions only can be helpful for the student when this goals are achieved. 

Maybe a too good relation between teacher and student can be a problem. The concetration isn't good enough for learning things like math. At the other hand teachers could prefer somebody. And excattly this is the point. In the badest case they will forget to teach some excellent knowledge. Maybe the lession must be neutral and very objectiv to learn something with students. Is it better if the students doesn't know the teacher? Maybe the resultats would of the students would be better, because the concetraion only would be in education. 

For me it's difficult to say which option is better. In the end the teacher must able to be an helpful to educate students. This is the main subjet in school. And this is the reason why I go to school.
