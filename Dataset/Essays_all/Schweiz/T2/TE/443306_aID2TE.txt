First of all, I'd like to say that the ability to relate well with students is one of the most important things teachers should be able to do. If a teacher can't relate well with younger people not knowing as much as the teacher himself does, the ability to explain or teach would be hard for him or her. As a teacher you should be able to understand your students in order to understand their thinking. If a teacher can't see the problems of his students, he/she actually can't know how to react and how to teach them his/her knowledge in an understandable way.

On the other side, a good teacher isn't just a man/woman, who can understand those children sitting in front of him/her in the classroom. It actually wouldn't be a classroom then. It would be more some kind of a kindergarten. Of course a teacher needs to have a good knowledge of the subject being taught. The school wouldn't make any sence otherwise. Like I said already, it would be a kindergarten and not a school. Without some knowledge, a good relation between teacher and students wouldn't be a big plus since the students couldn't learn anything.

In my opinion, a teacher therefore needs a good knowledge of his subject in the first place. But the better the relation between the teacher and his students is, the better is the teacher him-/herself.
