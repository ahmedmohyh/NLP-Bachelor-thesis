Teachers play a vital role in every students life. Students spend a majority of their time at school and are in contact with a lot of different teachers every day for several hours. But what is the role the teachers play in a student's life? Is it their duty to not only teach the students about their respective subject, but to teach them life lessons as well?

In today's society, many children don't live in a family in the conventional sense anymore, meaning, they don't have both a father and a mother at home but live in a patchwork family instead. At times, they barely know one of their parents or their relationship with a parent is damaged. A teacher who listens to students facing problems at home can be essential for the psychological development of these students. Furthermore, he or she could potentially serve as a "substitute parent", as you will, by giving life advice to children who don't receive that from their parents.
 
They way a teacher talks about life can have a huge impact on students. Teachers can be their biggest role models and make students strive towards a greater life. On the other hand, if a teacher cannot give his students a positive outlook on life, he or she can have a horrible influence on them. Especially at a young age, students are very impressionable and teachers have the opportunity to shape their attitude towards many issues. 

We often neglect the fact that teachers do influence their students, which basically means they are able to shape our future. Therefore, it is essential for us und for our future to look after them by picking teachers who have a positive attitude and affect their students in a positive manner. Nevertheless, it is up to each students whether they want to build up a relationship with their teachers and eventually benefit from that relationship or not.
