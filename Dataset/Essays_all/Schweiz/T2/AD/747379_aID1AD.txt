In modern time television and other technical instruments such as computers and tablets became normality for a lot of young people and even childern. But is television for young children beneficial or rather the opposite?
I think it depends on the subject and the way, how the information is passed to the children. Children of a very young age can take up information a lot better and faster. In the first years, everything that is essential sticks to the mind of the children. Therefore it's possible that television advertising to young children can be helpful. If they see the pictures and hear it simuntaneasly, it might help them to remember things better. Also if the parents contribute to it and watch the programm with their children together, it might improve the effect.

On the other side, starring at a television-screen isn't the very best for a young child. It may cause headaches or even hurt their eyes. Childern at that young age still can't read properly or at all. Maybe it would make more sense if the knowledge and informations of the tv programm is being passed through books and textes. It's essential for a child to learn how to read a text and to understand it. Reading improves the intelligence whereas watching television does almost nothing to it since you only have to stare at the screen and listen to a voice.

Summerized, there are many aspects that speak against televison advertising toward young children but there are nevertheless also benefits. Despite that readig is much better for children, television can be used as an additional help. Therefore I wouldn't ban it but as a parent I would make sure, that my child gets both, books and televison. So I disagree with the statement since it only would be contraproductive.
