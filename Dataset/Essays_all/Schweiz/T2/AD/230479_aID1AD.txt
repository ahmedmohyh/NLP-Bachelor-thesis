Every day when we turn on our television there is advertising. Famous people are promoting things so that we get almost forced to buy them. Advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children, especially not on young children. Should television advertising directed toward children aged two to five be prohibited?

Firstly, television advertising is directed toward every group of people. Everything is getting promoted by everyone. This is what makes the things attractive. Because if everyone sees the same television advertising, almost everyone gets affected by it and wants to buy it.

Secondly, television advertising has not always a good influence on people. Supermodels and actress with a body and face with no mistakes have an influence on especially young women and they are like a role model. This is a prove that everyone is at least getting a bit influenced. 

Thirdly, small children will grow up with the perfectness of life which the television advertising shows. And even more, childrem aged two to five are not supposed to watch TV. Furthermore, children remember a lot and if they see toys and plays every day on TV, they will always have the feeling, which a lot of human beings have, to not posses everything what they want. 

So in my opinion, they should not allow television advertising toward small children. They do not realise the affect of television advertising yet, but when they grow up, it is going to have an influence in their thinking and behavior. Nevertheless, it is not proven, but TV makes people stupid, so I think that we should protect our children from bad influences and do something about it like prohibiting it.
