Imagine wathching TV with your little child. Its 6 p.m and your child have to go to bed soon so she's wathching a good evening serie for kids. After the little episode, she also sees the advertising. It's about a new sinderella film in the cinema. After that, she just want to see this film with you. But you don't like Disnay movies. Television advertising should be allowed because parents, grandparents and her childs have to lerne to deal with adverticement and her concequences. 

Firstly, parents often don't like kids advertising on the television because kids take it very seriously. They realy think that for example the new film of sinderella is the best and they realy have to watch it. They can't seperate the real life and the TV world.
But how other children learn the bad absicht of adertissement as when parents watch advertising with their children and explain them, that they can't do all the funny things in the TV because its expensice and it isn't as fancy as it is shown. The parents have to show them that they can't buy all the things they want.

 Second, it would be easyer for parents if there would be a rule to manage the advertising for children. But i thing parents have to make rules for children and have to look that they don't watch the bad adavertising.
