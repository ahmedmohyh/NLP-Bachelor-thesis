Today a lot of people watch a lot of television. Most of them watch series regularely. And everybody of us knows that feel when somebody is pointing with a gun on somebody else, the intensity increases and then, suddenly an advertising break comes. Those advertisments are even most of the time absolutely boring and either face 50 year old people or children. This leads us to the following question: Should television advertising directed to children be allowed or not?

There should be a free market which allows everybody advertising their group of aim with their news about their products. It would not be fair if you can't advertise directed to young children because the companys who produce things for young children would have an enourmous drawback to other companys who can advertise freely.
There would also be the question where the borderline is and what advertising is directed toward young children or not. 

On the other side you can say that children can't think all that rationally as grown-ups can do. Little children often don't know what they really need and what isn't necessary. They see a product once in an advertisement and then they really want it if it is fairly affordable. Kids then often also don't use the things they bought or they only use them for a very short period what makes it sort of a waste of money. 

You may now think this wouldn't be all that tragic because children have parents that pay attention that they wot't buy all that much thing they don't need but in fact often kids can controll their parents pretty well and by threaten them yby doing certain things they often get what they want. Parents often can't say "No" because it's the child, they wan't to make happy and the one they love. 

Generally it wouldn't be fair concerning the free market and such a changes impact on it. But morally one has to say that it's also not all that fair to influence their customers, the parents, trough their children.
