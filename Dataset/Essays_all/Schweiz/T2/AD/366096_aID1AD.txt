Television advertising has become quite a common way of introducing new products to the population nowadays. But should young children already be confronted with such ads? On the one hand children of the age two to five shouldnt be watching too much TV anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group. It is the parents responsibility to monitor their childs television consumption and decide if its good for their well being or not. If they notice that the televison advertisements directed at their spouses isnt benefiting them and their behaviour is changing it is their job to find new activities for their children.
On the other hand some parents dont have time to constantly watch over their children and might allow them to watch short sequences of TV daily. As children can be influenced very easily and are usually persistent in what they want it doesnt take a lot of advertising to plant and idea or a certain product in their head. Parents usually have enough to worry already  so they shouldnt have to be worried about advertisings changing their childs mind aswell. Also it can be annoying when children start whining about wanting something they saw on TV. Our society is already very fond of consumerism which I personally find shouldnt be encouraged even more, especially not at such a young age. It will make them materialistic when they grow up and ubable to spend their own income a reasonable way. At this point the government should take some precautions and responsibility and stop persistent companies of directing such commercials at children. 
I am against such crommercials as i find them wrong and terribly bad for the mindset of such young humans. It doesnt benefit very many people either as in the end still the parents decide what will be bouoght and what not. Children should be able to form their own opinion about something instead of constantly having advertisements telling them what is best for them.
