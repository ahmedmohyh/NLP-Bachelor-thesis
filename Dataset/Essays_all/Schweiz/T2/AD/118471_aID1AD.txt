"Television advertising directed toward young childern (aged two to five) should not be allowed." This statement should be discussted very well because children haven't built an own opinion yet and so they belive everything that they see. So what are the arguments against and what are the arguments for this statement.
First of all as mentioned before, children can be influenced very easily when they are younger and there are ads everywhere. So if children see how the children in the ads play with many different toys, they want to have that too and they grow up with the idea of having everything in their lives. With our ads we create a society of people who belive that owning a lot of things is important and do we really want that?
On the other hand you could say that small children can't really do things on their own, expecially if they are 2 years old. So it's in the hands of the parents to look after their children and decide wether an ad is important or not.
In the end you could say that it is in the interest of the parents how they want to raise their child and how much they let their children be influenced by the media.
