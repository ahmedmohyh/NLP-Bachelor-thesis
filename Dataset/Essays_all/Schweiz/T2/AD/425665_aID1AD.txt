Everyone saw advertisements for sweets and toys in television. Every company has the sweeter swts or the better icecream. Now there's the question if it's fair to use unknowing children to sell their products? In the following text I'm going to talk about this.

Adults are responsible for there child. For there education and their consumation of modern media like Television. They have to tell their children tha they should not belive everything they see or hear in TV.
If the children want to buy those toys they should do it. Otherwise they'll never learn ho to properly deal with money and our free market system in our capitalistic world.
Otherwise a child should have other problems than having to save money to buy the newest vidiogame represented as so calling good for them. They should play outside and meet friends and play with them. 
Therefore its ruthless to start propaganda that five year olds always have to eat unhelthy stuff and play with rubbish produced in China.

After all children shouldn't be an advertising target. They often don't know how to deal with money or are to naiv to get the point that they get used for profit. Modern media shouldn't be a crime.
