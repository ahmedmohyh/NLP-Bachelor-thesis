On the one hand it surely isn't a good idea to  use television advertising toward such young children, because at that age you aren't able to judge the situation properly. Children often don't have a proper opinion yet, because they leak of experience. That's why they often take the statements as they hear them without questioning them critically and give them theire believes just because they don't know it better yet. In consequences the children could get influenced in a bad way by advertisng they see in the television.

Secondly, it's essential to see that one's childhood plays an important role in the construction of a Life'a basis. The way you grow up and the particular influences like for example family and friends have a strong impact on who you're going to be as an adult. So if you get wrong ideas of the world or you learn to set your priorities in a bad way as a child it can hount you in the future. Even if your environment is able to build a contrast to the capitalistic advertisning a child is confronted by the TV, it's better not to underestimate the power of it.

On the other hand it seems important to me that parents see theire duty of having children by protecting them from bad influences like that in a healthy way. Even if the advertising clearly isn't a good thing but for economies, it really is part of a parents exercise to watch after theire little children.

On conclusion, I'm clearly opposided to advertisnig which are directed toward children. It isn't human to use a childrens good belief to rise the capitalism just more. It's essential to protect them from bad influences like that and I'm persuated that an enterprise with good intentions wouldn't even think about using advertising that way.
