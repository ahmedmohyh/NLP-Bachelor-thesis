Our modern world could not be thought without television. People from young to old are watching on daily bases. If that is healthy for little children is an other question. Because so many people are watching, the television is a good place for advertising. Now are we asking if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

Advertisments for young children are not only bad. When children never saw advertisments, directed toward them, then they do not know that not everything that is advertised is needed in life. So if the advertising is forbitten, young children do not learn how to handle it and when they are adults they buy everything thats advertised to them.

On the other side advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something. The most people can think against that and deside for themselves whats good and what they need. But young children are not able to think for themselves and want everything they see in the advertisments. Especially if it is directed toward the two to five years old. We should forbit this to protect the children from all this things.

in my opinion adversising to the young children should not be allowed. Because they see too many things they do not really need.
