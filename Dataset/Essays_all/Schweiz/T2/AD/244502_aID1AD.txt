The advertisings are often doing it on purpose to impress children, so that they want to have the product and are annoying their parents until they get it. But on the other hand it is good to desensibilize the young generation with the diversity of all the products. And also the children need to learn to get on with this situation, that they can not always get what they want. 
And if they will never see an advertisement on the television and then suddenly when they are adult are confronted with this, it could be that they can not handle the situation. 
Sometimes the spots are not amed for children and show them things that could disturb their developement.
A solution for this conflict could be that those advertisements are not allowed to be showen during a film for children. But sooner or later they will be in contact with all those kind of things so why should they not learn it as long as they have a parent or an adult they listen to. Many parents who complain about this are often just too lazy to invest their energy into argue with their children.
I think we should not totally ban the television advertising, but we should also not use the naivness of kids.
