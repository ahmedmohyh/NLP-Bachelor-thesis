A human being of the age two to five is a very sensitive creature. In the so called sensitive phase people are like sponges. We take in every information possible from a certain topic for example the language. Many of these sensitive stages in our lives happen as a child. Therefore children, especially young children are very likely to get influenced by television advertising. But could it almost be considered as brainwashing or just a great way to find new potential customers.
First of all are children customers of today and for the future. Once they are stuck with for example a brand of cereals they'll buy them and maybe other products by the same brand for quite some time and maybe one day for their own children too. Another point why television advertising is a great way to reach out to young children is that it's very eye cathing and can be made very funny and colourful and may also create a bond between a character in the commercial and the child and because children are attracted to these kind of commercials they are very easy to impress and influence. So this leads us to the points why television advertising should not be allowed. In most countries people are considered adults by the age of eighteen which menas only then are they really able to make their own decisions. Children of the age two to five are not. They aren't sure yet what they want and what they need.They still need to learn what's good and bad for them. Clearly children are taken advantage of by companies. They take what children like and put it into a commercial, it doesn't even have to relate to the product.
In conclusion I find it kind of disgusting that they use innocent, easy to be influenced, young children only to make money and to benefit them.
