We see it everywhere: the advertisement for the newest car, praises for the tooth paste that makes your teeth the brightest or a huge poster that claims that this is the drink that you need in order to become happy. Advertising plays quite an important role in our society. The more interesting gets the question whether televison advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not. 

On the one hand one could claim that advertisement doesn't do any harm - at least not if no violence and sexual language is used. Advertising might be an option to show adults as well as young children what kind of possibilies they have. It can be an inspiration and give us a clearer view of our desires and needs that we have. 

But here comes a big but. Showing us all the kind of options that we have might create needs and wishes that we wouldn't have had if we didn't watch the television advertising, which can be negative as it leads us to desire things that we don't need in the first place. Especially young children should not be contronted with opinion influencing advertising for they shouldn't be determined by pictures and clips that brings them to a demand of products where there is no actual need. 

Another reason why I am against television advertising towards young chilren is that I believe that advertisement impresses the viewer with false standarts as it tells you want you need for a great, successful or famous life, it makes you believe that you need this certain product in order to have a certain status in your life. Children, especially ages two to five are very easily influenced. Presenting them these standarts gives them a wrong view of the real life and might even be the reason for the lack of self confidence later in life. 

This is why I agree with the statement that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
