Young children are very naive and don't have their own opinion yet. They have to get some things teached befor they are ready for this world and they have to get a certain amount of maturity. But until they have this maturity they are very influencable. Influencing a child in a bad way is wrong. But isn't this exactly what TV adds are doing?

Well it depends on many factors. First of all, is the adversment influencing the child in a wrong way? Influening s child isn't allways just wrong. You have to influence a child somehow - Most people call it parenting. That isn't wrong. You have to influence a child to teach him whats good and bad. So if the add doesn't infleunce the child in a ady way I think its totaly okay. 

But adds aren't allways good for a child. Getting a kid to buy toys just because it was super cool in the adversement isn't right. And "brainwashing" them with some "propaganda adds" (political adds) is even worse. 

In genereal, the lack of expirience and the innocents of a child shouldn't be used against them. You can't ban all adds from TV but you can surely censor them so young children can't be influenced in a bad way. And if you can't do that because of the freedome of speech, it's allways the parents decision if their children should watch TV and see these adds.
