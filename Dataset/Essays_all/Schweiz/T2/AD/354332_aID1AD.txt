Television advertising directed toward young childern schould not be allwoed

In our society in europe, it is nothing new, that television contain a lot of advertising. It let the people think, that advertising is something normal. Something taht a lot of people is not even more questioned. In our society in europe, it is also normal for a child to look a lot of television. They grow up with television. And also with advertising. In what a society do we live in? And more, waht happen with the childern, who look advertising every day?

First, I think adverstising should not be banned. It is a part of our society.I dont say, that it is a good thing. But childern have to know, for waht advertising is existing. It is existing to make the people buy a lot of things. Advertisinges are never, or mostly not critiqual. It is up to the human, to find out about advertising. If the want to.

In the second place, I think it is important to learn how to live with advertising. If I walk through the roud, I always see advertising. Not always just in the television. Childern have to learn, how they can protect themslefs of the world of advertising. 

In the third place, I'm anyway against things adult people wanne forbidden their childern. I mean, they live in our wolrd. They grow up in it. They should now, in what for a wolrd they are living in. And from where should an adult know, what a child should see and what not?

In conclusion, I think it is important to let the childern now, and letting them making an own opinion about advertising. Not an other person from outwhere. 
Basicly because he is not the same person.
