TV-shows or movies do have an extrem big influence on the spectaor. Horros movies for example make some people cry or leads them to a slepless night. An advertisement is shorter than a movie, but is also able to influence the spactator. At least, this is the goal of an ad. The behaviour of small kids therefore could change a lot, if they see someone doing or having something. Even without the parental influence. They believe, what they see on TV is true. Mostly, in advertisements for children, a toy or something else to "use" is presented. If they like it, they really, really want to have it too. Escpecially if all their friends have the "thing". The parents get stressed a lot, because there is no way, not to get the object of desire, without getting the kids sad.

On the other hand, if the advertisement for children is funny, but the kid is not interested in it, it's a good way to make the TV more attractive. Besides the advertisements for adults, there is something for children to watch, and the spectrum of what you can watch on TV gets enourmous.

Another positiv thing about the advertisement for young children is, that it is not only for young children. If an older one needs a gift for the son/daughter of a friend, and he sees something good on TV, he doesn't have to come up with a strange gift-idea.

But still, it is questionable, if there should be anything for children at the age of 2 to 5 on TV. This doesn't really help the new generation, to learn to go out into the fresh air and do something on its own. My opinion to the whole thing is therefore very simple: I would not allow television ads directed towards young children, or any other thing on television at all.
