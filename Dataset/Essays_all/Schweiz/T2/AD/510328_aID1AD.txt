Advertising

Advertising is the driving force of economic growth. Without advertisments our economic system would not work. And television is one of the most important medias to find access to the majority of consumers. That's why there should be no ban for television advertsing, even though children are the spectators.

Many people say that advertisement for children is manipulating the childhood. Parents, who want to protect their children from this  manipulation should generally not allow them to watch tv. But they have to keep in mind that television is not the only source of advertisement. The whole enviroment is carriying advertising objects, such as brand signs or posters on streets. Protecting children from all advertisements is just not possible in the 21st century.

The new-age capitalistic system has brought wealth and power to many countries. One key to this success was undoubtably television advertisment. It was and it will remain one of the most popular and most direct media of communication from seller to consumer. And without this kind of communication there will be no economic growth. 

Ptotcting children from all advertisements is not possible in such a globalised and media- dependant world as ours. If parents don't want their children in the age from two to five to be exposed to telecasted advertisment, a ban is not the solution. In my oinion, they should not allow them to watch tv. This does not mean that their children would not have any contact to any advertisement, but they would be protected from the most popular and therefore most influencial type of advertisement.
