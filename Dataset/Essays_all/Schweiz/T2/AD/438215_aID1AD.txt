Children (aged two to five) are learning the bases of their life such as knowing wether something is good or bad. Advertisments could strongly influent those bases and so it could possibly change the children's behaviour. It's impossible to avoid advertisments and because of that advertisments should have to go through several tests before being published since even advertisments which target an adult audience can sometimes manipulate children.

One main reason for me to disagree is that the statemens would only forbid "television advertising" but social media is way more dangerous. There are many five year olds who know how to use for example "YouTube" and so they could possibly see things / advertisments which aren't for their age. Those "Pegi 18" or "FSK 18" messages won't help. Parents should be forced to turn on a child safety mode and companies should be forced to supervise their ad system.

The worst thing that ads do is that they transmit subliminal messages. Young children can't really think for themselves yet. They try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages.

Sadly I'm missing too many facts to give a more in depth explanation but I know for sure that there are many studies out there aboubt manipulation through subliminal messages. Subjects were shown a movie wich had some frames containing a bucket of popcorn here and then and their lust for popcorn was way higher than after watching the unmodified movie.

Summary:
I disagree since advertisments, even with a target audience from two to five, should not be forbidden just more supervised. The statement should also include every kind advertisment not just the ones being on television.
