In the following essay we will discus television advertising directed torward young children. There are different channels for children in TV including some adverts which are done only for children. It is very special compared to normal advertising. Children may are easier to prepare with those things because they have not an own opinion about products which are shown in adverts in a chilren tv-channel.

For discussing these statement we will start with the positiv aspects and after that I will give you some neativ arguments against this statement.

In the statement you can see that those advert are made for children between two and five years. This is a very young age and maybe it is not very relevant because this children do not realise what it is or can not put it in the  right order. So it is not very dramatic and the children can not take this things seriously.

Another reason is that this television advertisings are made for children and so they are very friendly and also helpful for children. They can also profit from them.

At the other side there are also some negativ aspects. For example it is not very healthy for children in this age to watch television. Also the producer from this advertisings want just money and see the profit they can make. 

Also the children are very young and they are not able the connect things like that in there brain and so they are very easy to catch and also you can easily bring them to buy something.

In my opinion it should not be allowed to produce television advertisings for such young children. They have not the abilties to connect things in the right order and so they are just loosers of the industry.
