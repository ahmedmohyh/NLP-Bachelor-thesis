Television is a part of the modern society and can be bought freely. As the parents have more or less full authority of the children I don't really understand the point of the statement. The question if television should be allowed for young children in general can be decided by the parents.
But if it's a a question about my personal opinion I would say that there are television programmes that can actually have a positive effect on children and help them in the process of learning (e.g. languages, or even simple things like colours). I think it's more important to control the time the child spends in front of the TV. Children should spent more time playing outside. In my opinion the smartphone is getting to be the bigger issue than the television. 
(At this point I realized that the question is about advertising)
But advertising, well I don't know, children in that age can't go the store themself and buy stuff. So the statement makes even less sense.
