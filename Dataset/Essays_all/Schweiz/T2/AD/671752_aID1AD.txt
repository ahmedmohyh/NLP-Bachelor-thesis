A lot of children are watching television eventhough they are very young.
On one hand the question comes up, if young children aged two to five should already start watching television. Often, when the parents do not have time to carry for their children they put them in front of the television in order to advertise them. But in this young age it is said that it is bad for the children's education. Instead of watching television, they should learn how to play and to learn a lot of very important things and to be honest, I do not think that they really would understand what they are watching. 
But on the other hand, maybe it is not that bad, because with watching television the children can learn the language. Especially the Swiss children could learn the german by listening to television. Despite the fact that they learn the language, I do not support this because when their parents are talking to them, they can also learn how to spell and understand the language. 
An other problem is, that quite often in television is not shown the truth. Sometimes, even in movies for children, there exists brutality and cruality. In my opinion it is clear that a lot of teenagers and generally young adults do have problems in their social life because of having watched to much television. 
Concluding I do not think that children should be allowed watching television, they should learn how to play with other children and how the real life is.
