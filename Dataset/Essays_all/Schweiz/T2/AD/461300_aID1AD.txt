If there is no advertising, there is no market where toys and stuff can be sold and buyed.A company always has to advertise, or no one knows about their newest products. And if no one knows about new toys the company has  to close their doors. There will be unemployed people. And it's actually a big business, because everyone want's to see their kids happy. And if you think about unhappy kids, who have nothing to play with...And to be honest, how sould they control if a kid of the legal age is watching the advertising and how should the kid know what's the newest toy if there isn't any advertising on television?

Kids shouldn't watch television advertising for their age because they always want more, and with these advertisings they get inspired. Slowly the kids are getting materialistic and they only think about the newest, hottes trend they saw on television. And that's what companies want to reach, because children are so easy to influence. And if the kid always has these new wishes, the company never stops producing unneccessary stuff, made of plastic and other chemical substances, mother nature has to keep suffering. Because when they grow up, or the trend is gone, they throw it away,without feeling sorry. 

In my opinion, there have to be companies who produce toys, which includes advertising. They have to make money somehow. But I think they really influence kids in the way they advertise. The child comes to the idea that he has to have it. They don't have the chance of really being a kid, without adverts to care about.In addiction, I think it would be better for our environment. It won't leave so much trash and the KEZO wouldn' have so much work.
