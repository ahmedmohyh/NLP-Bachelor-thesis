Television generally can be a very dangerous subject. Children are very likely to copy what they see on tv. But that is the case no matter if it's normal tv or advertisement. 
So now we can ask ourselves is there really a difference between publicity and normal programs. People might argue that directing the advertisement at children will destroy their imagination and influence the capitalistic behaviour of kids. The destruction of children's imaginations is a wide spread problem in today's world. Thousands of small children already own a smart phone and are using it several hours a day. They can't entertain themselves anymore, they always need this little electronic device to accompany them. 

But isn't it already too late to save children from electronics. Televisions, computers and smart phones dominate our world. Materialistic things are everything that counts in many countries. They helped to revolutionize the modern world so many of us would be nothing without them. So many people depend on them, they characterize who we are today.

I personally think that forbidding advertisement towards children is useless. Even if they're not influenced by the advertisement they will still be changed by the hundreds of shows that appear on the screen daily. So I disagree with the statement on top, I think we should redefine what electronics mean to us and start being less materialistic.
