I neither agree or disagree with this statement, for the following reasons: Reason number one is that I don't believe in capitalism, meaning I don't think it should be allowed at all to make advertisings in televison. But that's an other discussion. To discuss this topic we also have to make clear that I would never allow my children to watch television at the age of two to five. With these believes I can't really agree with advertising directly towards children, especially as young as the ones we discuss. 
Advertising and especially towards children is against all of my morals and with that not enough. I believe that it's a crime to make profit out of naive children. For example, I think that if you ask anybody on the streets, if it was alright to sell something more expensive, than 10 Dollars to a child under the age of five, that not one of the asked would say that this is morally correct. That's because of the brain we human beeings have. We have to learn first, not like deers which are born and then can survive, throughout our lives we learn. And at the age of five an human beeing hasn't learned yet what value is, or how much value something has. 
In conclusion everyone should agree with me that it is wrong to sell objects to kids, and even to advertise directly towards a child is unacceptable. Also someone who lets their children watch television at the age of five or under must be crazy.
