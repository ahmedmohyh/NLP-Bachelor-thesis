I think there is some truth behind this statement. Afterall there are studies which prove, that watching televison isn't good for children. It sais that it has negativ influence on the development of the brain. But on the other side TV doesn't stop influencing your brain, no mather what age you are. Another importent reason, why I think watching TV under the age of five shouldn't be allowed is, that in that age you normaly aren't able to make a diffrence between reality and fiction. Even some grownups fail doing that line. Watching TV isn't in the nature of humans, actually a lot of things that we do isn't natural anymore, and I think in the first years of your life, you shouldn't interact with tecnology too much. Personaly I think that as a kid you should play with other kids or some toys like Lego, action-figueres...
Watching TV from time to time is alright, as long as the parents are careful about the movie choice and make sure watching TV is something their kid doesn't do often. A lot of parents let their kids watch TV so they are distracted or to calm them down. But that is one of the worst things you could do as a parent. Further I think TV can be used as a rare treatment. In the end i have to admit taht there are some good TV shows for kids and they do have fun during watching TV - who doesn't?
I think as long as the parents keep watching TV as a special and rare treatment, it shouldn't be a problem to let kids watch TV. But never the less they should be careful and make sure that the TV consume doesn't get out of hands.
