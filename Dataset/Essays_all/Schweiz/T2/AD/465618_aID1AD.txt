Look here or there, quite everywhere are advertisements around us. While looking television there are a lot intervals of advertisement. Even children are confronted with much advertising, but is ti okey that they got influenced so hard?
At one side, if television advertising is directed towards children, they see something and then ask their parents with their friendly innocent eyes if they might buy it, the economie has benefits, because more products are sold. The children get ideas what they could wish themselves for their birthdays. Another point is, that if something is showed on television, it has a huge amount of viewers and potential customers.

But at the other side, it can't be right when parents are a kind of obligated to borrow things which their child wants to have because of the television advertising. Young children don't know how this advertisements work and they don't know what is going on. They just see something beautiful and are convinced that this must be something nice and it is really important that they have it. So the missing knowledge of young children is needed, and this is really not a good thing. It's a moral aspect, if one want to use young children for his benef

In conclusion, it's a question of culture and moral values if one needs the children to persueade of a product by television advertising to sell more products. There are pros and cons with different arguments. My opinion is, that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed becuase their not knowledge is needed how the advertising works.
