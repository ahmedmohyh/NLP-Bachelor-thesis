Well, newspapers brought up the question if the advertising material broadcast in television for children aged between two and five years are harmful to them. This controversial question is such important to be discussed with regard to the mental growth of young children.

First of all, advertising wants to face all ages of society in order to sell as many products as possible. As Adam Smith formerly said, there is an economical aspect which says that we should not disturb the market so as to provide maximal wealth for the whole world. If there is no evident need of interacting against the market, we shoud not. 

On the other hand, children are not conscious of what they remark when they watch TV. They begin to develop a strong desire for a product shown on TV without knowing what it means exactly. If the marketing group present a product with a lot of colour, children will be attracted automately and as a result of this, parents will be interrogated by them. Children are very patient when it comes to be ambitious for a goal like purchasing a product.

Ultimately we can say that many children nowadays are faced with advertising for prosperitive reasons of a business, but in the end, I recommend not to create new restricting elements to prohibit this things. For businesses it is unbearable to see that liberal ideas of marketing are being destroyed.  

In my opinion we should do everything that there are nearly no restrictions for companies trying to sell their products. Finally it is obvious that we are those who are in charge of reducted prizes if we prohibit trivial marketing tricks of big brands.
