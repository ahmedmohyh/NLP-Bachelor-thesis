Should television advertising toward young children (age: two to five) not be allowed?

Children in the age two to five are easy to influence. Especially through such strong media as the television. Kids at this stage want every object the TV ads show them, because it is set in scene perfectly for the demands of such young humans. This is because the kids associate the toy with the show they are watching before and after the ads. They think when you're a fan of, for example Bob the builder, you gotta have this toy that always comes before the new episode. Therefore many people think TV advertising  for kids should be forbidden. I certainly understand this view, but I also think that it would infringe the capitalism and the free market, if TV ads towards young people were forbidden. (nice conditional there, isn't it) We have to ask ourselves, whether we want to save the children from being easily steered by big companies, who just want to make as much profit as possible, or if we want them to make the profit, because maybe we can directly or indirectly profit ourselves. Maybe the father of a child, who wants the new toy from the TV ad, works for an advertisement company and just because the TV spot runs everyday he can make his boy happy and buy this cool new toy.
