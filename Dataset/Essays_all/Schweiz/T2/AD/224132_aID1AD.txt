Today people all around the world watch television. It's something we do frequently. Instead of playing in the garden todays children are watching more and more television. They not only watch tv shows or movies, they also watch television advertising because it's a main part of tv programms. Now there's the question : Should television advertising directed toward young childern be allowed or not?

The reason why television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed is that young children are easy to ''manipulate''. Most of this kids believe everything what they get told. So it's very easy for firms to let the children believe that they want this product. Another reason against it is that children start to learn that such materialistic possessions are important, because if they always see products in television they maybe start thinking that's what life's all about. 

The reason why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that they, even though as said in the negative arguments, learn how to handle situations where they can't always have(in this example products) what they want. They also learn after maybe twenty times watching the tv advertise that they don't want this product anymore. This could be positive for growing up because they learn how to deal situations in a world where products are everywhere advertised because sooner or later they need to learn that.

In general I believe that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. It's unfair against the children and the parents because the main reason why a firm wants to direct television advertising to young children is because they are easy to impress and that shouldn't be the case. If the products, which a firm sells, good then they don't need to advertise it to children because the parents would buy it by themselves.
