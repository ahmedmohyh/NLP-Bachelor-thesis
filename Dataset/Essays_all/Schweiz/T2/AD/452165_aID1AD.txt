Manipulating the youngsters

Many people say, that advertising directed towards children should be forbidden. But is it really that dangerous? Is it dangerous at all? What does television advertisind do with our personality?

Advertising is always manipulation, so it is a manipulation for adults too. Additionally, the decision wether something is goint to be buyed or not is still in the hands of the parents. They should be able to tell their kids a simple "no". Sure it's hard but it's also necesseray and a part of the maturing process. Children are also a part of the society, so why should they be excluded from the television commercials?

As written in the beginning, advertising is always a sort of manipulating the people. They should become a feeling that they need that product in their life. But a young child can't separate as good between "I need that" or "I don't need that" as an adult. So one can say that the mainpulation is much bigger for the young children as for the adults. 

In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be forbidden, but it should be reduced, because then the kiddies haven't got so much input, but they get to know new toys and the parents haven't to spend much time with always saying "no" to their childs.
