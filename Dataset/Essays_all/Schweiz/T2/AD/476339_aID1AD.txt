Have you ever noticed that when your children watch television they are confronted with a lot of advertising?
When you let your kid watching television, you know that it will see adverts too. You accept this fact by allowing your child to watch television by itself. Companies search for young customers who could buy their products or beg to their parents to buy these so this strategy is allowed. Young children should also get used to watch, comment and think critical about an advertisement.

But young children (aged two to five) are still very sensible and believe all or a lot of the things said in tv. And as the advertising directly thought for these children are sometimes very convincing the children are manipulated. We should not allow the manipulation of our kids. Even the adults are a bit manipulated! But they have experiences that the things told in the television are not always as they should be. Children nowadays are also confronted by advertisements in the streets, in magazines or even in the internet. But it isn't possible to remove all these adverts, there is too much lobbying of the companies. 

For me personally it is clear that I don't support this kind of advertising. But I also think that young children should not watch television too often. And if the parents look after their children they can switch off the television if a manipulating advert appears. In the first line, experts say that watching television is bad for the children, for their eyes and their brain.
