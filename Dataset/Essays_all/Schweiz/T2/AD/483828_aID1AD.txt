Television advertising directed towards young children can heavily and badly influence them, so they should not be allowed. Or so some people may think. But does it really influence them and do they really watch that much TV at this young and prestine age?

Child protection is a  very important matter, and in every case politicians and foremost parents try to protect or isolate them from everything that possibly could hurt or damage their tiny heads. Rightfully so, advertising for a consumer group this young is irritating. Children are in their earliest stages of development and very fragile. On the other hand, do children aged 2 to 5 watch even Tv? And even if they get influenced by advertisements, does it matter? Every good parent wil supervise the kids' hunger for material consume; advertisements do not work when the target audience has no money, can hardly speak correlating sentences and cries a lot. Being no expert in either childrens TV or advertising for said age group, I am not too sure if there is a substantual amount of advertising for children that could be banned.  In this case, banning an non-existentual thing does no make sense. Another important question is, if children aged 2 to 5 really are more influenceable by advertisements than any other age group. At this stage, why not ban advertisements for everyone? Adult humans are much more in danger to act the way the advertisement wants, because of the factors money, frustration, boasting and greed. 

Advertisements for children surely does not benefit them. But if we allow advertisements for any other age group, so should they also be allowed for children. What is important though, is that children should be taught on how to process and react to advertisements directed towards them. If they can be taught to ignore the effect and make advertisements redundant, then the problem solves itself.
