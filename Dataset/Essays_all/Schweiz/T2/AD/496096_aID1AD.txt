In this essay I'm going to write about the controversial question if television advertising which is directed to young children should be allowed or not. First I'm going to say about a pro aspect and later I'm goint to list the negative aspects.

A first point why it should be allowed is because of the economy. If you show beautiful dolls or trucks kids want them and they beg their parents till they get their toys. Those Shops can sell their products and the competition between different toy stores can be increased.

On the otherside the environment would get worse because the normal wealthy countries live in overproduction instead of helping other countries with their essential needs. In addition the plastic toys can't be recycled and especially in Asia they have a big sea pollution problem. Another  point is that the branding of products costs a lot and you pay more for the branding as for the product itself an example is a perfume of Versace or any other famous brand. The price of the production of a perfume is one thing but the branding includes foto shootings with celebrities at a nice place, so you have to pay the photographer with his staff the celebrities and the transport to the setting and at least the transport to the stores. 

According to the longer list of contras I am against the television advertising for young children. Anyway I think mothers buy a lot of toys for their children because they want the best for them. And I wouldn't let my child watch television, because I think that publicities not directed toward young children could pop up. And a child needs to learn how to spend it's time with that what it has got.
