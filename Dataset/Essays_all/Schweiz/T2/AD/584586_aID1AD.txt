Advertisement is an intelligent mean that's being used by almost every company. It's very important for them to advertise their product but sometimes advertisement is also very manipulative for the people that are confronted with it. Especially children are pretty easy to manipulate. So, should the children be prevented of advertisements on television by a law that doesn't allow any advertising towards children?
I don't think that it's necessary to forbid such advertisements because of several reasons. The first point that supports my opinion is that companies should always be able to show theis products to the customers. If that wouldn't be the case, how should anybody know about the newest lego toy or the new puppet that can even eat? And even if a child has been influenced by the television advertising, the parents will still decide if they want to buy their son or daughter the toy that they've seen on TV.
Another point is that the children will get in contact with those products anyways. For example when they see them at a friend's house or in the kindergarten. So they can also be confronted with an advertisement on television.
It doesn't matter how old an individual is, whether it should be allowed or forbidden to show advertisements or not. Because children aren't able or don't even have any or that much money to buy things by themselves.
