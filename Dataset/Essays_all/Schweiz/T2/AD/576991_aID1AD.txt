"Televison advertising should not be allowed if it is for young children (aged two to five)".
There are two sides about this statement. Advertising for example for toys, is something only young children are going to watch. It is one way to present a specific subject over televison directed toward the young children. It can cause a few troubles. For example children between two and five will most probably watch more televison beacuse it is very interesting and enyoable to see new things you maybe want for your next birthday. They are now more infront of the television to see all these advertisements. The time spend infront of the television they could play outside with other children instead of watching toys and other advertisements all day long.
But it has also a positive factor to advertise directly to young children. For example a family with a three year old son who is going to befour soon, are looking for a birthdy gift. The son watches television one hour twice a week in the afternoon. One day three weeks before his birthday he sees this fantatic new techmobile in an ad from lego. Now he knows exactly what he wants for his birthday and his parents are no longer in stress to find something good. 
We see there are two points, one positive and one more negative point about this statement. The negative is the the time one spends watching television instead of doing more things in real life, the positive side is, that children can actually find something interesting and be a bit happier in the short future beacause of advertising for them.

All in all in my personal oppinion the positive factor about advertising toward children outweighs the negative. If you let your child watch tv for an appropiate time and not four hours every day, it can be very useful for parents and their children, without stealing important time of the real world. A middle way in between is the best for children and parents.
