The critical age between two to five years is a period of time in which a child's brain is the most flexible, which induces the ability to learn as much as possible. Wasting their mental resources on targeted advertising, which would distract theirmindsfrom learningessentialbehaviour, would definitely put harmonto their congnitive capability.
Moreso, brains fromchildren agedtwotofive are not developed enoughto seperate economicallytargetedinputfromother stimuli andthey might bring their parents tostressby expressing their needs.

In contrary to the arguements inapproval ofthe suggestedlaw,parents who expose theirchildren to targetedadvertising would still bring normal advertising into theirlife witherto the fact that advertisingistargetedor notwouldnot change the fact thatthey arebeing shown advertisements at all.

What parents expose their children to should be in their responsibility.
