Advertising is a controversial topic. There are different opinions about what kinds of advertising should be allowed and at what point it should be banned. For big companies, there are different methods to advertise their products. One of this method is the television advertising directed toward young children. In the following I will describe arguments for and against these kinds of advertising.
A first and strong argument for the ban of this kinds of advertising is that the goal of the advertising is to play with a children's feelings. They give them the feeling that they need something, which, in fact, they do not need. 
Children are also not able to understand the goal of advertising like adults do. From this point of view, the advertising directed toward young children is irresponsible and therefore it should not be allowed.
But there are also arguments for not banning this kinds of advertising. Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.
For children it is also important to learn that they can not have everything they want to have.  
In my opinion there is no reason to ban television advertising directed toward young children. In the end it is the  parents job to teach their children that they can not have everything they want to have. This is an important lesson in life.
