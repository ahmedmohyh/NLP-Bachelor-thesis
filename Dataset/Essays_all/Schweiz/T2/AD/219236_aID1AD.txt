Television advertising directed toward young children is commonly used in todays culture. Some people are against it and some say it is very important.

At the beginning, I have to say, that in most of the advertisements for kids, there are plots with morals in it. For example to share your cereals with others or to work together. 
Moreover, they teach them how to differenciate a real product from the product in the television. Surely, disapointment will be involved and it's exhausting for the parents to calm their children, but it can really help to give them a prospective for the real life.
Not to forget is the fact, that the producers of the TV-advertising and of the products themselves earn a lot of money, because children believe everything they see. 

On the other hand, this can also be seen as a bad thing. Children are being manipulated and don't know, what a product can be like in reality. 
Also they are often being taught, that if you buy and own a specific product, like a shoe for example, then you will be cool and can get along with everthing and everyone.
Furthermore, the parents can have a really hard time convincing the young children not to buy something, when they have seen it on television and think it would be cool to have it. Every minute there's another advertisement with a toy or a product they want to have and that can undoubtedly be very stressing for a mother or a father.

Although there are more arguments speaking for television advertisements for young children, the fact, that they manipulate those little kids just to make big money, overweighs in my opinion. So in conclusion, this should get forbidden.
