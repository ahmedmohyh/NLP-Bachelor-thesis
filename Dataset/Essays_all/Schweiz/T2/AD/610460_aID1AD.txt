Today the spectrum of diffrent television advertisings is huge, there are advertisings for man and woman as well as for every age including young children. But are those advertisings directed towards young children a good influance? Or do they even have such a negative influance towards children that they should be forbidden?
Advertisings, especially about food, do not always tell the truth and can have a negative impacked towards the health of the children. For example the advertising about nutella says that their product makes a healthy start in the day, what is clearly not true. Young children are not able to judge wheter the told stuff is true or not. But besides that, the perants should tell them and look for the health of their children and tell them the truth about what advertisings make children believe. 
But when the television advertising should not be allowed, what kind of advertising would be between children movies? It is not reliable to show them advertisings made for adults, because they could scare the children and could cause an even worse influance than children advertising. 
In my opinion advertising towards young children does not need to be forbitten. Every advertising influance people, so either all advertisings should be forbitten or not. It is not a good option to show children advertisings made for adults, because they can have an as worse influance as those made for children.
