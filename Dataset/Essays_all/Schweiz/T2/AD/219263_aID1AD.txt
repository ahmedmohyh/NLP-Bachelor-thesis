Advertisement twoards children of a young age can be considered a good marketing strategy. Children tend to be more naive and can thus be easily convinced by almost any type of media that is presented to them. If the marketing sektor can make use of these "easy cusomers", they are garanteed a higher sales revenue. Although children seldomly have their wn money to spend, they can quite easily persuade parents and relatives into buying specific things for them. This strategy is more affective than advertising products for the children to the older generations because there will always be a doubt about the product itself and if the children would really be happy with the specific new item. 
On the other hand i can be considered practically inhumane to use a childs mind to sell a poduct to their parents. Since the todlers don't have the necessary knowledge to judge things fairly, they are eaily tricked into wanting things that migt not be in their interest or are simply useless. At hte same time stress can be created in the houshold because of capricious behavior from the children that are led to believe they need a specific new thing. The resultscan be tantrums and very unconfortable situations for all people involved. It is an unfair marketing strategy and takes advantage of the childish mind. 
I believe that rules should be made against advertisement targeted at children under a specific age.
