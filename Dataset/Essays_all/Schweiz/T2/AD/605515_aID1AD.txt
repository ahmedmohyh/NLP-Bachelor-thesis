Advertising has a big influence novadays. Youtube, Facebook or aswell the television advertising are influencing us everytime we spend time on this websides/ watching television. Most people that use Youtube or Facebook are old enough to realise that they can t buy everything that seems cool to them, so the advertising is more like informing them of new products and not manipulating them to buy things they don t need. But how does it look like in context with the television advertising?

People from every age spend time watching television. So everyone gets in contact with television advertising and so do kids (2-5). As a kid u want to have the coolest stuff and buy everything that you like. So by watching the advertising kids get informed of cool toys they can play with. Like this its easy for the kid to tell the parents what they like and after the parents buy it they will have a good childhood since they have cool new toys and other stuff they like. The problem here is that some parents don t have the money to afford all these things. This makes the kid feel unhappy and can destory the family atmosphere. An other problem is that kids get manipulated by this advertisement. They aren t old enough to see the tricks behind this kind of advertising and they get one of this kids that we would call "verwöhnt" in german language. This is really bad for the future. 

Personally i think that advertising for kids is bad and watching television as a kid should be only watching his favorite caracters (as Spongebob for exemple) and not get spammed with television advertising.
