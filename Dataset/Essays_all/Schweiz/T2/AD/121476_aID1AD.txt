Do children understand advertisements in the television and do they have an effect on them? This essay evaluates if television advertising directet to young children aged two to five should be allowed or not.

Firstly, children in the age of two to five have not a huge television consume during the day as well as in the evening or at night. In addition, on chanels which are created especially for children there are only adverts for children presented and none for adults. In fact that, most children are allowed to watch one or two episodes of their favorite children serie, so they do not see any advertisements, so adverts directed toward young children are not really effective and a loss for the company who set up the adverts.

On the other hand, it is proved that children love to spend their spare time - and children have a lot of it - in front of the television. But for the kids it is often prohibited from their parents to watch too much or too long television. Outstanding, children realize much more than adults think. In the modern time, the kids are earlier in understanding things than the todays adults were.

Overall, television advertising directed toward young children can be allowed. But if they let the companys make a profit is unclear question. In the point of view form the parents side they should be prohibited because their kids can be affected from the adverts and it could be difficulte to make the kids understand, that they can not get the things from the television everytime.
