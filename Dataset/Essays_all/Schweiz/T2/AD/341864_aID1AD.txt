I agree with this statement. Products are shown and it's told how great they are, but negative parts of the product are not mentioned. Of course they have to do that so that people buy the product. But in a way that is also a form of manipulation. For example: You see on the table of McDonalds how great the burgers look, but if you buy one you get a crumply bread thing that doesn't even get close to the one you saw on the picture. The manipulating part is making you think that you get something better than the actual product. But since everyone knows it it shoulnd't be a big problem, right? But now these manipulating pictures come in form of a short video advertisement between two cartoons your five year old child is watching on TV. And it's about a stuffed animal. Your child absolutely wants to have it, not knowing how to critically watching the video because of it's age. Children get manipulated like that all over the world, they want the new Kellogs they saw on TV or the new Star Wars Lego set and and and... They don't know that it breaks easily or that it has a way too high price for its' value or that it actually tastes like soap, they just see how great it is. And you as a parent get the disaster if saying no and have to explain to your child why, but it still believes more into something it sees on a screen than in the words of its' own parent. The bad part that's left out in the advertisment is the one a parent gets to feel while trying to calm its' child, even though every parent is just telling the truth and the trying to make a five years old understand how the world really is. So companies actually make similar things like some states do with their people, like dictators do with the population of states. And this can't lead to a good thing, could it?
