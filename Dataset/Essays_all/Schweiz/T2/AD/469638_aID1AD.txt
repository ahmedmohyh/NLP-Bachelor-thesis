In the last years the time children watch TV consantly increased. Because of that children are more often exposed to advertising directed towards their age. But should advertising directed towards children aged tow to five be allowerd? There are different perspectives that have to be considered to get e good picture of this problematic.
 
First I have to mention that young children can get influenced very easily, so the society should be careful with whatever they show them. Under the impact of advertising children can get a wrong image of things which can have a harmful effect in their future. 

Otherwise big companies live from selling thigs and they want to sell as many products as possible. With their advertising they can reach as many people of different age groups as possible - from young children to old people - and everybody sees their products. 

On the other hand children nowadays watch too much TV so they are exposed to a very big amount of advertising. If they watched less TV the impacts of ads would not be as big as it is today. Children have to learn how to deal with technology because it is  developing consantly.

The last important thing to keep in mind is that companiey want to find future clients. They attach young children to them so that, when they are older, they will always buy their products. It is all part of a selling strategy.

In conclusion I have so say that both parents and companies have to try to minimize the problem. Personally I think that there has to be a special children's channel on TV where no advertising should be allowed. With this changement the advertising in general on other channels could be without any restrictions.
