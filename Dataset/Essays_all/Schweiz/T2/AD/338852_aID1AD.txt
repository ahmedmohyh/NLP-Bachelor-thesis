Young people (aged two to five) are easily influenced by everything. For example it's impossible to go shopping with a young child without having an argument with them about wether they can have this teddybear or not. At the checkout there is always some candy on the eyesight of the children so they complain about having it. The shops make a lot of money with it because you would rather buy the candy for your child than hearing them cry about it the hole day. If children see advertisment on the television it is the same problem. Children see something and they wand it and won't stop crying until they get it. The shops make it very clever. They place the advertisment at the right time and place so most of the people who see it, buy it. 

On the other side it's useless to cancel advertising on thelevision because advertisment isn't only on thelevision, you are always confronted with it. If you cancel television advertisment you should also cancel all advertisments for children because only then the chilrdren live a advertisment free childhood. But obviously thats impossible. I mean how should we only save children from advertisment on television if the parents should still see it. You can't. If children aren't alowed to do something htey'll do it anyways.

I don't think you should stop children from seeing advertisment. We should learn them how to deal with them and that they aren't allowed to have everything what they see in them.
