We live in a world where moderne media, such as television, is normal for us. We are possessed by moderne media, it has become a habbit for us to check our facebookconto, new pictures on instragram or the stories of our firends on snapchat. And this new habbit is converting to younger generations every day. When I was a kid, the smartphone wasn't invented, novadays a kid, age eight to ten, is allmost dying for likes on social media. But now back to the subject. Are televisionadds good for children, age two to five? Should it be allowed?
Little kids aren't that fast in understanding things or getting them correctly. They have to learn new oppinions everyday.Televisionadds meant for them could influence special points of view and control them like scientology. In addition to that, it controls what they think, therefore their point of view. The point of view controlls their habbits and their habbits their character. At last their character defines their destiny. Therefore television adds could define who they are becoming instead of what they should buy.
In addition to that TVs use special light waves to function differently of those from the sun. The sun send all light colours and creates natural lights, TVs instead create unnatural lights, which could hurt the eyes of the viewers. This could lead to diseases such as blindness or allergys.
To complete my point of view: I would rather send my child to play outside instead of watching TV. Children in this age often go to bed early, if there watching TV a big part of their day has faded away. I want my children to experience nature, to find new laws, like gravity when a stone or a ball falls down, and most important I want my child to play outside and have friends.
Therefore I think that televisionadds meant for kids, aged two to five, shouldn't be allowed.
