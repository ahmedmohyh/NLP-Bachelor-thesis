Television advertisings are supposed to support the companies in question by proposing their rpoducts on screen. HOwever, these can be very misleading and customers have to be quite careful when buying them. Young children are often very unexperienced in that matter and are more easily manipulated, witch in fact can be seen as immoral.

But that fact should not prevent companies to produce advertisings directed towards children. The fact that young children often have little to no pocket money leads to the fact that they are not able to buy the products in question. They often ask their parents to buy them, which then allows their parents to carefully look at the advertised products and later decide whether or not they will buy them.

Every kind of advertisement can be misleading towards young or old, companies are somewhat forced to advertise their products for the income. So in my opinion, any kind or advertising methods should be allowed.d
