Of course it has to be said, that buisness is and will always be buisness. A marketing strategy is not being guided by what is right nor by any moral standarts one may have, but solely on what works. But as the question isn't if ads are being directed towards children or not, nor if it works or not, the question is if it should be allowed. Children are proven to be more submissive and more easily influenced than adults. If you don't believe that, just look at how vulgar words are being learned by children just by hearing adults say them. 
Advertising in Television isn't really a problem, if you have raised your child properly and are financially stable. If you have not raised your child properly it could be a problem, but just a mediocre problem. It just tends to be really annoying for the parents. The child sees a toy it wants on TV and hell breaks lose. The cry and beg until they get what the want, because the mother or the father will eventually give in, in order to get them to shut up.
The real problem is if you are financially unstable, might be working more than one job, and as a result don't have that much time for your kids. You put them infront of the TV as it just is convenient. And if you get home after a double shift, you are in pickle, either you give in because you are tired, as a result you either can't buy the toy because of financial reasons and dissappoint your kid, or make debt, or you endure their nagging. All three are either bad options for the kid or for you. 
ALthough having stated only reason for why it should be banned, I am of the opinion that it shouldn't be, the right thing to do would be to boycott coorperations which use this technique. As we shouldn't be forced to do something by the government but by society.
