We live in a world, in which we can not live without the newest technology. You will find it everywhere
iPods, iPhones, Tv's and more.
People started reading books on their iPads (or iBooks) they are not reading real books anymore. 
In a few years everything will change. 

The point is, that children do not know, whats right or wrong. 
With advertising they can change childrens mind and their opinion wouldnt be right or honest. 
What the children see on television seems right for them.

In the other hand the children can lern in the age of 2-5 if they want to like something or not.
