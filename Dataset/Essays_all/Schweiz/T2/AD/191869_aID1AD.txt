Television advertising belongs to our daily life. Everytime we are watching our favourite show it gets interrupted by various commercials about new hair products or the newest car we could buy. In those commercials the target groups are mostly adults between the age of 18-60+. But what about advertising directed toward young children? Should it be allowed?

The probably most obvious advantage for advertising toward young children would be that companies that sell products for children in that age could directly promote their products to their target group. And with that hopefully have an increase in their revenue. From a child point of view, it can be interessting for them to see what new toys and other items are new on the market. And with that it would be easier for parents to know what kind of product their child likes. 

However, what speaks strongly against advertising toward young children is that they would already be influenced in buying products at such a young age. At the same time young children do not have the ability yet to realize how commericals influences them. In addition, from a psychologial point of view, we do not know how advertising can affect a childs way of thinking. Furthermore, some parents might not have the financial ability to buy the newest toys for their children. 

In conclusion I think that adversting directed toward young children should not be allowed. Children should not already be influenced by advertising at such a young age. They should be able to enjoy watching television without interruption.
