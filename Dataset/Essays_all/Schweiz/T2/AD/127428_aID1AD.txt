This essay is intented to give pros and cons about children who participate in an advertsimnent what is undoubtfully a moving question?

To begin with, the privacy of a young person who cannot make decisions on his own is published by a performance on tv. Despite a refuse of the children the parents can arrange an advertisment.

Another factor to be considered is that an intensive and demanding work in a tv stuio may be too exhausting so as not to feel comfortable. Producing and creating an advertisment is a long process which is why the children cannot bring neither enough motivation nor any experinece. 

On the other hand, advertisments can bring valuable money, new connections and important experiences. To start with a show career, an early start is as useful as habitual training. Therefore, there are just a few grandparents who can show their future children a tv advertisment of them.

Last but not least, tv performances or other participations is fun for most of the young children and bring a new experience in order to widen their horizons.

All in all, advertisments wit young children bring more advantages than disadvantages. A new experience and a day with professional producers puts an exhausting and too demanding work into the shadow. 
I am of the opinion, that these young advertisment stars should keep going and that there is no deciding factor to  prohibit to build up a new generation of tv stars.
