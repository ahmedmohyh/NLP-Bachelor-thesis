"Go out and play, do not watch tv" many parants have said this sentence to their children. In this eassy we I am  going to talke about the youngest tv audience. Should tv channels show advertisments directed toward the two to five year olds?

Firstly ther is the argument that this kinde of advertisment does not make sense, because the young audience does not realise what the goals of the advertisers are. They also do not understand what the advertisement is about.

On the other hand there ist the argument, that young children exactly understand what the advertidement is about.
They are confronted with the problematics of advertising by day one. They think, that only things in advertisements are "cool" and they must have it. Like this they are raised to become the perfect consumer later on in their life.

The opposit argument is, that it is the best way to learn from a young age how to live in a world of advertisement and  temptations.

I think it is not necessary to ban the advertisement for young children. Beacause they can learn how to cope with advertisment, which will be an important part o their adolesence. I think the biggest mistake is made by the parents which let their two to five year olds watch tv. Go outside and play!
