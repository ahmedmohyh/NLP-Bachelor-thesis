In our generation, social media, television and of course with all that, advertising is very popular. Companies target diffrent age groups depending on the products they are trying to sell. It is a very popular buisness nowadays. Should it tough be allowed to target young children, with television advertising? 

With technology always progressing and nowadys in many families, both parents having full time jobs, it is quite comman for young children to often sit in front of the television. Companies can easily profit from a situation like this and advertise specific products directly to the interested children. I seems perfectly planned out. The parents have very little time, with their full time jobs, so it would be ideal for the children to choose their own toys and items that they want, so they can be always be intertained.

Many though believe that television advertising is very bad. Because it would prove and  show, that in our society more children are sitting infront of their tvs all day. This would make them a perfect target for advertising. Parents do not have the time to intertaine their own children, so the television does that for them. Many also fear that television advertising could expose children to certain topics far to advanced for their age and knowledge. 

I personally believe television advertising is not per say bad. I do believe though that perents have should have a strict overview, of what they let their children watch. I also believe that this topic, just show how little time pernts have for theit children and how little attention they give them. So personnaly television advertising wouldn't be a topic, it perents would just do more with their children, like for instance going out, instead of staying in.
