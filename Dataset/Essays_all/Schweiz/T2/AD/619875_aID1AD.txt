Nowadays advertisements are omnipresent, you see them when you leave your home in the morning to go to work,school or university, you see them when you are on your computer and surfing the internet and even when you are at home after a long day and want to watch a movie, there will always be commcercials everywhere and the further our technology develops the more we have to deal with a constant bombardement of advertisements or commercials. 

So the question that posses itself is if it is okay to have global corporations subsequently implanting our desires in our brain, and where do you draw the line between advertisments and brain control, if you take coca cola for example, a lot of studies have been made to show that it can cause serious health issues when consumed every day as well as when you consume too much of it, for example bad teeth (because of the sugar) and other troubles you get, for example stomach ulcers due to all the acids it contents. So the question is where does the urge of these children who drink coca cola come from, most likely due to advertisements which are programming them from young age. The goal of these big corporations is to generate an urge to consume their product, in some way like a drug addict gets hooked on a substance and then needs more every time to achieve the same outcome. 

To conclude I would state that it would be greatly contribute to our health, as well as an economic equality towards the people and a more natural development of a childs brain if it would be possible to stop advertisments towards young children. Sadly this won't be easily done, because there are a lot of lobbies that need to make their point by staying in the game to grow bigger and bigger and make even more money, no matter what the costs are.
