Advertising for young children
The question is if young children between two and five should get a directed advertsiting in the television ?
If young children get an advertising directed to them they become more interessed by the television. And if the young children are more interessed in advertising on the television they learn more words and other things because they see an image and they hear somthing. The consequences are that this child will learn faster and apply the things that he/she learned in their life. For an example they learned a new word. after he/she saved this in his/her head he/she uses this word always.
But what happens if th young children become adicted by television.
On the other hand it would not be a good idea to set advertising specially for young children. They could become addicted by ttelevision and the concequences were that later on their lifestyles is not going well. If they have not many frinds or more worse than that no frinds they can not really intgrate to the socaial life. Thats not good becouse they were then isolated from the society.
In my opinion they should not have advertising for young children in the television because the negative points or the negative consequences are more then the positive points.
