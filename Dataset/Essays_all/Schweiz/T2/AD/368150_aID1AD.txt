Television advertising towards children is a common practise in the advertising industry. Should it be allowed?
The pro argument is that it was always common in our society to advertise. It would harm the economy because it`s part of our capitalistic liberal system. How could a company advertise a product made for children if it wasn`t allowed? Another argument is that it`s just using the same mechanisms that are also used at adults. And even if it`s influencing: In the end, parents have to decide to buy a product and not children.
On the other hand stands the contra argument: Children can easier be influenced than adults. They aren`t as experienced and even more important: as developed. Also they can easily be scammed because of the same reasons. In the end we have to find a solution somewhere between: We can`t just forbid advertising to a whole industry but it`s also clearly too influencing. Why could we not reduce that? It would be a good solution to advertise less agressive and more directed towarts parents.
