Advertising in general influences every human beeing in a different way. So should advertising toward young children be allowed? First of all there are many disadvantages. In my opinion children are very manipulative and easy to impress. Per example if children see toys in the television they run to their parents in order to get the toy.
Another reason why it should be forbidden is because they have so many offers from the beginning of their childhoods, which makes it difficult to learn how to deal with money. In addition young people have to build their own opinion and should not be influenced by huge enterprises.

But on the other hand I disagree with the statement. In our world full of globalization it is nearly impossible to prevent even young kids from advertising. Per example if you walk through a city you will find in every corner an advertisment. Moreover it is important to teach everyone how to deal with such a great amount of offers and sometimes also lies behind the advertisment. But I have to say there are not just bad aspects about advertising. They can be inspiring and bring up benefits for the little ones. Some toys teach children more about language or maths per example even though they are funny to use. 

In conclusion I do not agree with the statement because in our society every human beeing gets confronted with advertising anyways.
