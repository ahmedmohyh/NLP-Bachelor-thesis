Whether it is on billboards, in newspapers, in the internet or television- we can't get around advertisements.
It's part of our culture and our economical system. We're all subconciously influenced through advertising,that's scientifically proven.

Some advertisements may have negative impact on certain people or even society in general. Therefore, one might ask themselves if this is something we need to protect our children from. Infants and young children are in an important developemental stage and their experiences are their foundation for their future lives and leave a lasting impact.

Nowadays, many children spend a lot of their time watching TV and are exposed to television advertising towards them. Some people argue that this sort of television advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed because they could teach them questionable values or impact them otherwise in a negative way.

Others say it's not a big deal and it's just part of our world, therfore we should'nt condemn it. It might even help them to find new interests, they argue.

I think it's fair to say that we need to be careful to what we expose our children to and there should certain rules concerning advertising directed toward young children. All advertising is manipulating in some way, and we need to make our children aware of this at a very young age. We must teach them that in the real world, things are different than on television and that values like friendship and compassion are more important than material things.

 Personally, I don't think banning advertising towards children would be necessary, it's just important to have a conversation about it and to be aware of what they're exposed to.
