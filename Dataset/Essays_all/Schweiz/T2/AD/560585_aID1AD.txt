yes I agree with this statement. I think the social communication gets lost with the television. I think it is very important for a children to play outside or searching friends. You can't do this while watching television.  It could be very stressful for the parents to seperate the childrens from the television. 
I think a children gets influenced very easely. So it is very problematic when the children gets influenced by the television.
I think also that to much television are damaging the eyes of the childrens. So if televesion advertisising directed toward young children did not exist, less childrens would have problems with there eyes.


So in conclusion I think that it should not be allowed to advertisise television directed toward young children because of the bad influence it can have on the children, the problems of the eyes that can produced by watching to much television.
