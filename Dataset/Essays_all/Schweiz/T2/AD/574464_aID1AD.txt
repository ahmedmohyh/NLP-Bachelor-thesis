Television advertising directed toward children aged two to five

Everybody nows it, the annoying television advertising, but if it is a good advertisment it influences you to buy stuff. And is not that the purpose of a advertisment? To influence you. A lot of young children spend a lot of time in front of the television and also watch advertisment. Is that really a good thing? Im am going to talk about if television for young children should not be allowed.

First I would like to define the words young children. When I talk about young children in this essay I mean children aged two to five. 
To start I would like to say that advertising can include violence, sexism and bad language which shoud not be accesable for young children. But I have to say that the advertisment on channels for children is made for children and does not contain things like violence. So if the parents just allow the children childrenchannels or block the others, they not affected by advertisment which are not made for them. 
Another aspect is that the advertising is bad, because children are easier to manipulate. 

In my opinion I think advertisment shoudl be accseable for children, because they may get influence but their not getting brainwashed.
