Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?

In the following essay we will focus us on the question if televison advertising directed toward young childrn (aged two to five) should not be allowed. Imaging a toddler is watching tv and sees an ad occuring on the screen, specially modified for its age group. Is this ad going to have an influence on the later life of this little child? Or not? 

I guess on the one side we live in a free country, where freedom of speach and the press is a common good. Therfore if you say that ads towarded young people have to be banned from tv, it could be seen as unfair towards the guys who want to advertise for their products, when they are just not allowed to make PR for it.
On the other side, advertising always has a critical point because it's main job is to manipulate people in order to make them buying the products from the advertising company.

Now one could say that toddlers won't even regocnize the content of specially modified ads and that the material of these ads therefore won't have any influence on the child, but you could also say (and this I guess is an even stronger argument) that especially toddlers sense a lot more from their environment than we might think and that due to this fact, such ads definitely have an influence on the child, wheter it's conciouss or subconciouss.

So in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be definitely banned from the screens, because we don't want to manipulate the next generation in a way some company leaders would like to.
