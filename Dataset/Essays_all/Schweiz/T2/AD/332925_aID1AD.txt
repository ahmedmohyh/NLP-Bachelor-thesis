A child aged two to five usually watches a spesific type of television prgramm or maybe only carefully by the parents selected series. There are also special shows only for children. 
In my opinion, on these shows and programms, there shouldn't be any advertisement regarding things to buy, even if they are meant for children, like for exemple a new barbie doll or the new iron man suit for haloween! This supports already young aged children to "wanting to habe" everything, especially the things they see in this "cool" television. I think a child should learn as soon as possible, that one can not have everything and like this should apreciate the things one already has even more. What doesn't lead to anything like this is for exemple an "advertisement" for new series or films that would be shown later on ect. So I think these are perfectly fine for the breakes between two films. 
In the end I think the biggest part of responsability rests whith the parents: they have to be aware, what exactly their child is watching and if it's really okay for their age, the advertisements included. Even though the producers have to "match" their advertisement according to the ages meant for the series. For example it wouldn't make sense to show toothpaste advertisement on "KIKA" (a programm for children). 
So I would say, showing real advertisement to children is not very helpfull and could lead to them wanting to buy everything, therefor it should not, or only rarely been allowed. But when and what the children are watchins is still the job of the parents.
