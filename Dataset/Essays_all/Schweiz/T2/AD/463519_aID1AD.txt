You as a young happy parent come home after a long exhausting day at work. As you walk in your home you see your partner sleeping on the couch next to your wide awake little 3 year old daughter who seems to be weirdly mesmorized by a diaper advertisement of a brand which you really dislike. What would you ike to be the effect of it or wouldn't you want an advertisement targeted at such young children at all.

to quote every known politician" the children of our society are the ones who determine and build our future." this quote which has been numerously used sais that if we want to change something we have to influence the sprouts of our generation. Advertising the right biological and ecological products and showing morally important messages might be one of the easier ways to make that happen. Because we're really easily influenced at a young age.

But is it really the right thing to do? It is pretty manipulative to influence such young kids into doing whatever some head of a business thinks is right to do or isn't. We can't take the innocence of these kids to our advantage and form them into some sort of, what we think, perfect civilian of our future. 
Also it's the parents who buy all the stuff for the kids. IT wouldn't be much of a gain for any company to target young kids because they will probably spend more money on making and broadasting the advertisement than making profit out of it.
