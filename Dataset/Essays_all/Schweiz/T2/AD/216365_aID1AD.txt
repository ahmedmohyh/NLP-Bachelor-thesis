Being parents can be very stressful. They need to do the household and at the same time they need to care for their children. Now a days thanks to the new technology it's possible to put the children in front of the television and get their work done. As the children are watching cartoons there are always advertisements. Now the government ask themselves if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not?

The purpose of watching television is to teach the children all the morals in life and to teach them the important vocabulary to speak the language. Another purpose is to entertain the children. Advertising directed toward young children would be the total opposite. Children want the stuff they see and won't live in peace. They start to rely on materialistic stuffs. They want to buy everything that had been showed and think that only having these stuffs can make them happy like the kids in the advertisement always act.
