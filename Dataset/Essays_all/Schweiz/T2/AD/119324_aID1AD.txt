In this essay I will write about hypothetical situation.in which, television advertsising, which is directed toward young childern, isn't allowed. With young children I mean children which are aged from two to five. Most of the childern in this age are allowed to watch television. All the parents are in a worry about the series. But what about the advertising?
On the one hand a  big problem which exists if you ban the advertsing is, that the televison programm doesn't have any insources of money. Because with the help of streaming advertising they earn money to cast the series.
On the other hand you have to keep in mind that the children and especially their future. If they watch lots of advertising, they always want to have everything, which is streamed out.Or they want to live like the children in the advertisment. And when they are younger, parents often buy most of the things, which their children want. So they don't learn how to deal with money or stuff.
But you shouldn't forget that there is advetising for everything in the TV. And if the parents watch televsion, they get ideas what the next present for their children could be, if they haven't got any clue. Our society wouldn't be like that, if we wouldn't have that amount of advertising, because advertisment has got a big influence to us.
Children are a good subject for the project of environements to try out some new theorys how to influence people that they buy the product. So children are threaten like an object.
In my opinion the advertising which is directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. Because I think it's a negative influence to the children which should have stopped. And if we are able to stop one source of influence, than we should to that.
