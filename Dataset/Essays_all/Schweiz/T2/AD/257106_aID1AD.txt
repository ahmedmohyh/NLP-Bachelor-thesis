There are a few reasons why advertising companies aim their adverts at children as a marketing trick.

Firstly, a child is easily influented and is more likely to believe what it sees and what it is told than an adult might be. In its naive beliefs, a child can get easily attracted by an advertising and that is all an advert is used for. If, for example, morning cereals are advertised by a friendly cat and somehow shows that whoever eats them gains supernatural powers, what a lot of cereal adverts do in a way, a child sees the advert and instantly wants to have them. Mostly it a subconcious feeling which leads to screaming children in supermarket because they do not get what they desire. Parents want to calm down their child and buy it.

Secondly, children have a great influence on their parents too. If they want something, they often do not accept a "No!" instantly. And like it is said above, a great amount of parents are too annoyed by there screaming kid and fail at calming it down, so they do it the easy way and get the child what it wants.

I think that adverts aminig at children should not be allowed, because they misuse the children for marketing reasons. Not to mention that it makes bringing up children a lot more difficult for parents, because they have to decide between the two optoins; saying no to their beloved child or spending money to calm down their child, which brings up extra pressure. I have to add that the first option is the harder way, but leads to a child that knows what a "no" means. The second option is, in my opinion, a lack of good parenthood and is just a lazy escape from bringing their child up properly. From my experience I can say that the second option is not the minority case.
