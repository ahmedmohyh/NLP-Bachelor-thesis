Your children are watching their favourite TV-series and always in the middle of the Folge are at least eight minutes of adverising. Annoying but an efficient strategy of the concernes. We can't forbid them to direct advertisements to children, can we? Maybe the ones with questionable content, things they should not been ... with. It is clear that there shouldn't be advertising for smoking or alcohol in a children-channel. But what about bikes or the newest doll or a little boat? They will ask their parents if they could please get this or that because they have seen it in the TV and it is so cool. Pretty intelligent strategy. But is it allowed to influence young children? or why not? The impact on the evaluation of the children is quite high. 
But advertisements don't have to be something bad or annoying, sometimes they show some funny things or they show you a picture of society that is "good".

I think that it would be good to at least reduce the quantity and to forbid the questionable content to be shown to children under five years. You couldn't never be sure if there is a child watching the advertising. And there would be a financial problem to solve.
