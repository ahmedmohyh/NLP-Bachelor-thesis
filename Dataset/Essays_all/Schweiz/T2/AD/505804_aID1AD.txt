Nowadays almost every household has a television and other electronical devices that provide us with entertainment 24/7. The constant accessability of those devices make us rather lazy and dependent. We forget to be creative ourselves. A big part of watching television are the commericals that disrupt the viewers TV shows. While most adults can differentiate between what they need and want, children struggle to do so. Therefore the question arises if advertising should be allowed to directly target young children.

If young children learn that they can't have all the stuff on TV and learn that it is only tactics from big corporate firms it shouldn't pose a lot of problems. Children should learn how to deal with all this media from a young age on so they can handle it when they're older. Parents should make them understand that the hard earned money is better spend on things they really need.

The problem I see here is that not every 5-year old will get this kind of message since they don't have the ability to critically question the message of the advertisement. They probably see something they want and feel the urge to satisfy their needs.This scenario can be well observed in supermarkets when little kids throw a fit because they won't get what they want. 

Another reason that speaks against commericals targeting such a young audience is that puts a lot of pressure on the parents. The kid , being angry about not getting those toys on TV, direct their anger at the parents. In general I think it is not very wise to let the kids watch TV on a regular basis. It rather should embrace the free time for being creative and productive itself. Being creative also satisfys them in a even more rewarding way.

In conclusion I must say that Im against advertisment for childeren especially because they can't handle the situation apropriately. On the other hand I support that they learn how to deal with media since it follows us everywhere.
