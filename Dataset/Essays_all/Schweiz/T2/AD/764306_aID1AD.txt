Television advertising is something, where you can't control who is watching it or how old the person is. So it is nearly impossible to perhibit the young children to watch those spots.
But the other aspect is that you can control what companies produce. The television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed means that the plot of de spot should not have an impact on young children. They should not have the feeling that the advertising is made to impress them. Children should never feel the pressure on them to buy the product they show in the spot.
In addition, children at that age aren't able to afford this things. The parents are the ones who then must explain why they wont buy the product. After the children had seen the amazing television advertising, it is impossible for them to understand why they wont get it. 

Another point is that it is difficult to make clear what the advertisings are supposed to do. Which group do they reach the most? Why does a spot which shows a toy for children should not be allowed because it is directed toward young children? It can be directed for expample toward the parents, the grandparents and uncles as well. So its diffilcult to define which television advertising should be perhibited.

From my point of view it is nearly impossible to stop the television advertisiing which is directd toward young children. First of all, the parents are resposible for their children and what they watch in the tv. So it's their own business if they let their children watching television advertising. The next point is that the spots do not reach just one specific group of people. There are a lot of people who are watching the same spots at different ages but they can all toghether feel impressed and can find reason why they should buy it.
