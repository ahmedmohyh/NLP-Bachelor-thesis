Should TV ads dircted toward young children be allowed?

The television is a common way to bring information to customers by publishing advertising. A lot of people do use the TV to watch their favourite movie, series or the news. Some people do watch TV just because they're bored and do not know what to do otherwise. Because this media is so frequented it's extremely interesting for enterprises to show their products in the breaks between a TV show. If a lot of people do see the advertising, the probability will raise that more potential customers will buy the product. The income of the enterprise will raise too and their goal is achieved. But there aren't only adults watching TV. Also a lot of children love it to watch their favourite movies like cartoons or Disney films. For sure companies have seen the potential to sell children's products in the pause between a Disney film for instance. 
But critical voices say, that children get confused by these advertisings made for them. They don't understand if the ad is saying the truth or not. They can't make this difference. After they have seen an advertising they will go to their parents and ask them to buy the shown product. If they won't, the child will cry until they do it and exactly this mechanism is planned by the company which has shown the advertising. And because this is firstly betrayal towards the children, because they can't analyse the ad correctly about its correctness and secondary because the parents do not have a choice to buy the product or not I think this should be forbidden. Not to mention that it's the parents job to decide what is right for their son or daughter and not the televisions.
