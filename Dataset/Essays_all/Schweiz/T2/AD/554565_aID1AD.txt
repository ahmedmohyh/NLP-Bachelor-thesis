Nowadays many children like to spend their time in front of a television or like to watch something with their parents. It's normal that while you are watching a show or a movie an advertising shows up. There are many advantages and disadvantage of television advertising, especially for young childern in age of two or five years.
But are advertisings in the television bad for young children? Should our country permitts television advertising towards young children? Let's explore the pro and cons!

First of all, let's take a look at the advantage. Television advertising is a good way to show the children something new. So the children can see new things and are able to learn something new. 
 
On the other side, there are also disadvantages. When a advertising shows up, it's mostly an advertising of toys and dolls and other stuff children likes. The children are young and really likes to play with toys and also wants to get the toys they are interested in. So the television advertising gives the children the opportunity to discover new toys and so the have the urge to get this toy. Because parents like to make their children happy they buy them new stuff. 

However, in my opinion children shouldn't generally spend their time in front of a television. The advertising is also bad because it influences the children and so the have the urge to get some new toys. In a way it manipulates the children and grows the desire to have some new stuffs, which not all parents can afford.
