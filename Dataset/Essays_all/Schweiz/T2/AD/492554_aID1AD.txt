There are many advertising in the television which are only directed to children. Often they want to achieve children which are two to five years old because they are easy to influence. These advertisings often show many kinds of toys and cool stuff for children.In this essey I am going to discuss if advertising directed toward children should be allowed or not 

I really agree this statement. Television advertising shound't be allowed directed toward children in the age of two to five years. I think that children don't need any advertising only to see how many toys there are in this world. Of cours this is a good way to achieve more buyers for all the stuff that is produced in factories but in fact children don't need this. In my opinion it is only important that the parents know what there is on the market or not. Because they know the best what is good for their children and what is not. 

In addintion, there are also many people which are poor and can't buy any cheap toys for their children. In this case advertising directed toward this children won't be a good thing. Children will be unhappy if they don't get these cools toys from the television because their parents don't earn enough money to buy it. 

In conclusion I just can say that is isn't a good idea to bring advertising directed toward children in the age of two to five on television because they don't need it! Their parents know the best what their children need and what is the best for them.
