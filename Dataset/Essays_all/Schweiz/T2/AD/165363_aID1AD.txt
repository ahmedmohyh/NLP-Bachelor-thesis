As children have very visual-based beahviour, young children often feel the need to get something as soon as they see it somewhere frequently. Therefore television advertising is probably a very good strategy for the companies to make those children want their product.

However it is questionable if children aged two to five should even already be confronted with advertising. They are still in the stage of getting to know their environment and getting to know their families. During this stage advertising can slower their progress as they get confused between the virtual and the real world.

Do you think the ads should be directed towards these young caracters? Should they even be watching television often enough to get affected by those ads? 
The most amazing childhood is the one, about which you can tell stories to your own children later. Do you really want your child to tell stories about the television series to your grandchildren?

I do not think there should be television ads directed towards two to five year olds. They are in the middle of finding out who they are and who they want to be. I do not think they should be influenced by anything else but their families, their friends or their teachers. Other than this I think they should not be sitting in front of the television often enough to get affected by ads. A child only really wants something if it has to look at it over and over again. They do not admire something after they saw it once. They forget about it rapidly if they are not confronted with it another time.
So I think the more appropriate statement would be; Young children should live their childhood, rather than watching television often enough to be influenced by advertising.
