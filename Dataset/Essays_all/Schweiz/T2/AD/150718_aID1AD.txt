There are different types of television advertisements, that we are day by day confronted with. Some of them contain a drink (for example Fanta), some of them contain toys(for example Lego). Some people think that this could have a bad influence to young children between two and five years old. But is this true? Should television advertising directed to children not be allowed?

Most of the television advertisements are completely harmless for children in that age. (drinks, toys, holydays...). I personally watched a lot of TV when I was about five and I saw those kinds of advertising too, but it didn't take any impact on me. I thought nothing about it. For me, those kind of advertising aren't dangerous for children. 

Besindes that, children often watch TV shows that are specially made for children in that age (for example TOGGO or KIKA). If there is some kind of advertising, the producers are told to make it some kind of harmless for them. In my case, I seldom watched TV with my parents of my older brother. If I did, my mother had always an eye on me, what I was about to see. But that didn't involve any advertising. We never thought about it in a dangerous way.

If an advertisement should animat a child to buy something, it has to ask their parents first. So they have the last word about it. It doesn't pose any risk if a five year old wants a playmobile-house, but the father says "no". Parents must be a able to deny something to their children, so this can't be an argument to forbid television advertising to children.

So in my opinion it doesn't make any difference if a five year old child sees television advertising or not. It mostly depends on the parents how they teach their children to deal with this kind of things. If their doing well, no five year old boy or girl can be harmed by a simple advertisement.
