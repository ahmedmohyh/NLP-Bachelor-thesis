Television advertising is a very common thing. You want people to get your product and that is not a bad idea. But should you target young children to sell your product?

On one hand you could say, children have to be protected against that. They can be influenced very easily and can't decide if right or wrong. So you sell something to a customer wich hasn't got much experience in life and also can't think very rationally. They are helpless against the wave of information and maybe do something irresponsible. 

An adult on the other hand can spot the difference between just good marketing and a really good product. The companies use this, to get more money from parents with kids who want the product. It's a good source for money and a big market gap but it's not a very fair way to get profit. 

I personally think it should be forbidden to target children that are this young. They haven't seen anything from the world yet so why do we want to get them in front of a tv to have fun? They should experience their life without any unecessary influence from a company. At least at a age this young.
