First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not. It is just there if you want or not. There is advertising that is nice for children to watch because it has a lot of colors and cute music. In the evening the advertising is a little bit different. But i think this is not really important because children aged two to five don't get it for what the advertising is for. Maybe they talk about dating sides or condoms and so on but the kids don't even know what this is. They look at it and think: Oh what a nice color. Or something like that.

The only reason why we think that this should not be allowed to our children is because we don't think like kids. When the television is on and then we see a spot about condoms we instantly want our kids to close their eyes but they really don't know jet what this thing is. They think this is advertising for a ballon. 

Maybe we should worry a little bit less about that. It is just in our minds and not in the minds of the children. They don't care what about this advertising is they just look at it and listen to the music in the background. So I disagree with this statement. It would be an overreaction.
