We all know the feeling, when we are watching an exciting movie in the television and suddenly it gets interrupted by annoying ads. But when we were children, these ads were very interesting and we got really fascinated by them. They tried really hard to motivate a young child to buy something. Is it correct to make a child, which cant even make their own decisions, buy something?
At first I have to say, that these ads can be extremly manipulating. They just show the positiv sides of the product and they never tell you the whole truth about it. When we are grown-up, we know that we shouldn't believe everything, that we see in the television. But children often do. They don't know the difference between an ad and the real life. Because of that ads directed to young children are very maipulating.
On the other side I have to say, that children should also have the right to discover new toys and games and to build their own opionion about them. And an easy way to do this is watching ads on the television. Many amazing toys, that I had when i was a child, I discovered by an advertisment. 
In conclusion i have to say that I think eventhough ads can be very manipulating for young children, they should stay allowed. One reason is, that childrens should also be allowed to discover new things and the other reason is, that at the end, its anyway the mother or father, that has to buy the toy.
