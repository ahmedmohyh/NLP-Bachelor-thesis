I don't think that we should vorbid this, because it doesn't hurt somebody. If the content does not match what the parents think that their children should see then it's their job to prevent them watching TV. Normaly if you watch TV on a normal time, not at night, the advertising is pretty child-firendly. Advertising has always been and will be to leed us buy somthing. To do that they will try to enfluence us and I think that it doesn't harm them on the other side they maybee learn even to not fall in the traps that the advertising company do. 
An other point is that children at that age should not have enough money to buy their own toys or at least their money should be managed by their parents. So you can prevent that children spend to mutch of their money.
Finally I remember when I was a child my parents asked me for every birthday or christmas what my wish was. I think if I didn't saw some interesting toys on TV or in a magazine then I wouldn't know and this is probably pretty annoying for the parents to find every birthday etc. somthing new that their children like.

Because of these point I think that I disagree. We shouldn't vorbid Television advertising toward young children.
