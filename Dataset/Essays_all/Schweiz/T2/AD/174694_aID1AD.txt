Television advertising is since its beginning a much discussed theme. Who does not know those ads where they promise you the world or even more? Or the new trend, getting younger insteead of older seems to be the most important thing for so many people, especially for those who reach the thirties. So what my question would be is, should television advertising be allowed in common? But thats none of my buisness.

The television buisness is not dumb. They are aware of their strengths. They know that they are able to give a reason to buy something which is in its whole unuseful. Especially the aged two to five have no idea about the tricks an advert has in its backpack. They will just see the good-looking new toy in the Television and the next thing they will do is to annoy its parents. "You have to buy me this, please Mum and Dad, please."

But what if the adverts get used in a proper way? In a way that children would learn something? For example it would be nice if the adverts could visualise some serious themes as criminality. Children at this age take much more infos out the pictures than by hearing.

Another point I do not understand in the statement is the fact that it only should be disallowed if it is directed toward young children. I think every kind of advert, which has no pedalogical effect for the children, should be disallowed. So all in all, all adverts. We all know that this never will happen.

So instead the parents have to overtake this part. In my eyes they should not let their children watch television adverts and if they watch those adverts, they should explain them that this is not the reality. Furthermore the best thing they could is to prevent the children. Before they start watching TV, the parents should search for a discussion with the children. The pedalogical effect would be much more than when the parents would explain them afterwards.
