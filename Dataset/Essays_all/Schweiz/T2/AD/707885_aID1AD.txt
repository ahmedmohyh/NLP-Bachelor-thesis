Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

Well, today there are lots of televisison ads. You cannnot watch one single film without any ad break all twenty minutes. At least in free-tv. On the other side i can understand why there are so many ads. The tv companies need a huge amount of money for there channels and there is only one easy way to get to it. Yes, you guessed it right. Advertising. But should five year old children also see those ads?

On one side we can say that there are many ads which shouldn't be watched by young children because they are to complicated or maybe they scare little children. The imagination of a young human is much bigger than it is by an old one. So advertising isn't just advertising. For a child it could be much more in a bad way. It depends on what is shown in the advertisement.
Children are also much more influencable than older people. And I think that the ads are aiming for that. Especially toy-advertisements for example.

On the other hand there is no other option for a lot of tv companies because somehow they need to get money. For some chanels we need to pay taxes which are called "Bilag" in Switzerland. But most of them dont have any other way to get money.
Also the fact that younger children are more influenceable isn't a good reason because the decision over buying something that appears in a tv spot is still the parents decision. And not the decision of the five year old.


In my opinion it isn't that horrible or bad if younger children watch tv ads. So if you, as a parent for example, don't want your children to watch such ads just don't let them watch tv. This may sound a bit to strong but there are lots of series and films which they shouldn't watch anyway. So why you don't go out with them and play football or some other outside activities. That would be healthier either.
