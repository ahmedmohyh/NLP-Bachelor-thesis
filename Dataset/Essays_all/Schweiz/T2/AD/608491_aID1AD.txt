Television advertising is something we see a lot when we watch TV. It is a way to promote new products and make it appealing enough so that people want to buy it. Often, it does work because a lot of adults and also children watch enough television to encounter these. 

Television advertising directed toward young children has its positive and negatif sides. If someone promotes a product for little children, like for example a new toy, the children can talk to their parents and maybe they will buy it for them. Therefore, the children are used by the promoters to get the parents spending money on something they have seen in television. At the end, children get influenced a lot by television and the producers gain a lot of money from this. Promoting something over television can also be good since children see things they have never seen before and maybe they want to try out something new and exciting. 

As for negatif facts, the children just follow what the guys in the television say and of course, they don't really think that hard about it if it's right or wrong. Therefore, I think that adults, who are not their parents or family, should not meddle in a life of a child and decide fot it which toy it wants to have or not (except it is dangerous of course). It should have the right to choose! Though, if a friend of one of the children has got a new toy and the other child wants it, it's still a way of promoting the new toy but at least the child saw it in real and not only in a screen.

In conclusion, I think it's fine to use television advertising for children but one should consider that children still should be able to choose by themselves if they want something or not. I would prefer it, if they could choose what they want in an actual store.
