Television advertising towards young children plays a major role in modern society since already the youngest and most volnurable of us are being adressed by major companies in order to make them want something or a state wants them to think something. This could be a problem for the children, if they are "brainwashed" with views that a company or a state wants to distribute. 

Therefor my opinion on advertising towards young children is, that it needs to be regulated so the children aren't brainwashed with for example political statements that are hidden in the ad. On the other hand I think adverts directed towards children could be a great possibility for giving children something that they can think about and while doing that, devoloping their thinking capacity at a very early stage. This means, since ads are normaly very short, they give the children something that they can think about or discuss with their parents afterwards. 

In my opinion, advertising towards young children should be regulated but if done right, television still has a big potential that should be used in the future.
