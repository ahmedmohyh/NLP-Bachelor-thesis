Advertisements are meant to sell something by presenting the product to viewers. Making purchases are only accessable to people (mostly adults) capable of making transactions. 
Children of the age of five aren't able to fulfill a purchase and don't understand concepts of money and the market. So it is very useless to direct advertisments to children that age, because they can't understand. 
But most advertisements are trying to convince childern that age, because they don't understand and take advantage of their lack of knowledge. The people who make advertisements know that children watch TV and when they happen to watch an advertisement the childern go to their parents, becuase they know their parents have the power to buy things. It's a stategy that avoids directing advertisements to adults, because adults ignore them, and taking advantage of their children to convince their parents of purchasing. It isn't right to use childern as their "marketing machine", because they're incapable of knowing the purpose behind TV ads. But it's a better way to sell the product, because parents won't ignore their childrens needs and buy thigs for them. This stategy isn't unfair at all, because the child watches TV and it's the responsibility of the parents to let children watch. Parents who really don't want them to watch ads, shouldn't let their children watch TV or at least the ads.

I agree with this statement. I think it's just lazy and unfair to think that children can do all the work for the salesmen. In my opinion it's useless for children to watch advertisements without understanding and the advertising producers should do it fair and challenge themselves to make a good ad for adults.
