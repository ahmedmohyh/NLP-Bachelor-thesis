Television advertsing directed toward young children is a very controverse topic. In the age between two and five the children are much busier with things like learning to walk, to talk, playing etc. In the following essay I will write about why I think that Television advertising directed toward young children is a bad idea. 

First of all, why should a child in the age between two and five sit in front of the television and watch this kind of children shows? Our grandparents didn't even know what a television is when they were 20 years old. I mean, this kidswould also make the parents and the children lazy. They shouldn't learn the i just to do nothing. They should go outside with them. The kids should see the world, breath the fresh air and not sit in front the TV on a super sunny day.The generation of today is even enough lazy, why should we teach the upcoming generation also like that. 
But, the must important point is that the child wouldn't learn the essential stuff like walking or crabling. Looking TV is like a drug. If you starts once it's hard to stop again. It would also be very disappointing because at this young age, the children have a very big potential to learn new things. 

In my opinion television advertising directed toward two to five aged children is a extremly stupid idea. We should look after our kids and don't let them being lazy. The teens are even to much sitting in front of this box and looking to their series. We should defend our youngsters of this laziness and connect them more with the nature again. Let's go outside, playing soccer, basketball, hide and seek or other diffrent funny games but don't stay at home.
