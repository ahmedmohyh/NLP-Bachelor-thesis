Children are probably the agegroup which can be influenced most easily from all people. They are very curious about new things and eager to learn, even unconciously. So television advertising is a very smart tool to influence not only their opinion but also the childrens behaviour and personality. But is it really that smart and what impact does television advertising have on a childs daily life and the development of their childhood?

In TV advertising children learn about new things they haven't encountered before. They may find out about the different habitat of animals, places in other countries or even new languages. This is a very easy way to teach children new facts about the world. So why should TV advertising not be allowed for little kids?

On the other hand, television advertising can also influence children in a bad way. Because most TV ads are about products, often toys, which only want to be sold for the own profit of companies. Whenever children see new toys they like on Tv, they want it immediately, because the ads are constructed in way, that people would want to buy it. So then, children would want every new toy they see on TV because it looks cool, but of course their parents won't buy them every item. And this will lead to a dispute between the child and parent. Children at that age don't understand that money doesn't grow on trees. On top of that, a lot of money could be saved, if television advertising for children would be prohibited. Instead this money could be invested for example free daycare for children.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement, that TV ads for young children should not be allowed. I think kids can develop perfectly fine, even without a TV and can grow and discover new things by simply go out and enjoy the nature that has been given to us.
