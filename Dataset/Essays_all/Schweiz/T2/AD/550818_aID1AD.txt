The media nowadays has huge power. In almost every household there is a television, a smartphone, a tablet and a computer. We are surrounded by these technologies and have contact with them every day. Of course, companies are going to take advantage of that fact and try to sell us their product by advertising it as much as possible. Especially the television advertisment has a big impact, because there are a lot of advertisment breaks. Since many young children aged two to five are watching TV and in these young years believe everything they are told, companies will try to influence them as much as possible and direct the advertisment towards them. Therefore, the question comes up wether to allow television advertising directed toward young children or ban it. There are reasons for and against the ban.

Firstly, children aged two to five are easy victims when it comes to believing what they are told. They believe everything they are told, because they do not have life experience and, therefore, do not know that they could be lied to. Since they do not have enough experience to think about wether something is right or wrong, they should not be exposed to television advertising.

Secondly, the uncouncious is taking up a lot of information without us knowing it. Children that are watching TV therefore take up all the information they are told or they see by the advertisment in their uncouncious system and are influenced later on by it. Television advertising directet to these young children schould be baned for this reason.

Thirdly, the companies have a right to sell their product. Therefore, they should be allowed to sell it to whoever they want. Every person should decide for themselves wether to buy teh product or not. That is a reason to allow television advertising also toward young children.

All in all, there are more reasons against it. In my opinion, it should be baned. Young children should be protected since they can not protect themselves yet
