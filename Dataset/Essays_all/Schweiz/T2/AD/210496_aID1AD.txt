Doues television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed?

What is the right way to educate children?
Some people have a clear opinion on this topic. They told that children should go out and see the nature, they should do sport and that they need a lot of fresh air. Other families do not have time to get out with the children, because they have to work a lot. So the kids stay at home and when they told that they do not like to get out because it is boring there or the weather is not good, the parents let them watch tv. Because when they do so, they are silent all the time and they sometimes learn also something. It is clear that it is easy for the parents to let them watch tv because like that they do not have to look after the children.

I think that there will be more and more children who will look at tv because everything is getting digital. This was also find out by the advertismentbusines. So they try to get the money and if they find a new group of costumers it is better for them. But is it dangerous for the children?
Maybe they can see the new things to buy and they always want something new and do not need the stuff they had since then. So they could get really nobel and selfish. 
On the other side, they maybe learn early that the advertisment is something to look at critcal because there are different strathegies to manipulate the people. So if the kids learn it early they wont tap into a hole later.

My personal opinion is that children should not watch tv a lot, so they do not get in touch with all this advertisment. When they are outside they can see the nature and the real life. I think that it is not possible to make a permission on it. Because they will always find a space in the law. So if parents do not like that the kids can see this advertisments, they should not let them watch tv.
