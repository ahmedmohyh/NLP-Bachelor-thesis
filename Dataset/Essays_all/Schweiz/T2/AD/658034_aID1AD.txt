The following statement takes about adverticement directed towards young children, between two and five years old.
The main purpose of televison advertising is, to sell a product and earn money. Each advertise has its own neash and is dedicated to a specific groupe of people. Behind each advertisment there is a sertain promotion, that controlls people and their decisions. 

Televison advertising helps a product or a brand to become famous and to be sold at the end. Creativity can positifly influence an advertising so it will reach out to their comsumers. AD dedicated to children might help them develop an interest in something or makes them familiour with all the options that are out in the world. 

But there are major problems that advertising can cause. Tt leads to consumerism. With their clever advertising they can control your mind and make you want something that you aldready have or something that you do not need. 
An other issue is, that it can promote a wrong image. 

Advertising is a part of our life and comtrolls our decisions. It can help us find a product in a mass of options but it can also lead to unnaiccesery comsumerism and materialism. When it comes to advertising,that is dedicated to young children, I thing that it should not be allowed. Influencing a child from such a young age is just cruel. Children should grow up makeing their own decitions without being brainwashed from the media. Even if their still quiete young they get a wrong image trough television advertising.
