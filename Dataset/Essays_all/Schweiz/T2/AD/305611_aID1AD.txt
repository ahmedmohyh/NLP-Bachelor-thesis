Advertising is one of the key concept of a free-market economy.There are many different kind of advertising, adressing different age-, and social groups. Even young children, with the age of two to five, are exposed to advertising. 

We live in a free-market economy. That capitalism can function well, we need to limit the restrictions, made by the government. Our economy shall be as liberal as possible and a restriction, which permits advertising to very young people is not necessary at all. Additionally, we must not forget the importance of gaining a young customer base. All those very young children will be potential customers one day and you as an enterprise want to reach out for them as early as possible.

Nevertheless, we need to consider the possible damage, children can suffer from, being so exposed to advertisment from young age on. Advertisment aims on stimulating a very special part of our brain. It stimulates our unconcious mind. It is likely, that young children`s developtment is hindered by this kind of intended manipulation. 

Summarized it can be said it is a conflict between capitalistic and health values. Either we harm our free-market economy even more or we just accept that our children are exposed to a potential disruption of the developtment process.
