People's behaviour of what they buy and what don't is influences by advertising. In a world embossed by technology, the way of advertising changed horrificly. Companies introduced television advertising many years ago and since then it never went down once. With the influence on somenone's life, companies gathered power and now they even start to influence the children. So is such a beahviour acceptable at all and should television advertising toward young people be allowed?

First of all, companies are allowed to put almost everything they want into their advertisment. The only border set is one which prevents companies to make a racist statement. I think, that this is really important and I'm glad that this one exists. 
Secondly, if a company focuses itself on the "kids market", why shouldn't they be allowed to produce and screen advertising that can influence a childrens behaviuour. I mean just because they're screening it, nobody has to buy the things, do they?
Another aspect which has to be looked at is the time spent infront of television. If the children nowadays wouldn't spend hours watching TV, then they probably wouldn't be as influenced as everybody says and there wouldn't be such a discussion at all. 

In my opinion, not companies but parents are to blame. Television advertising towards young children wouldn't be a problem at all if parents would prevent their children from watching TV that often. Children should play with their friends outside instead of making a "movie afternoon" or whatever you want to call it. I personally think that countries should be allowed to influence our behaviour even of the small one's.
