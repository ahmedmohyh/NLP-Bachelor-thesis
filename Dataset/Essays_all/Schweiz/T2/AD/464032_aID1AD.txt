Should the television be allowed to advertise to chidren from two to five years? This is a very controverse and actual debate. I think, it shouldn't be allowed, because children can be influenced very easily by the TV. And therefore the parents should check what influences their kids. Therefore I agree with the statement.

First it is important to know, that children this age cannot filter what is good for them. So if they see a good publicity form sweeties they will want to eat them all the time. That isn't good for their health. Or they see some kids playing and fighting with swords, so they want to do it too, but the parents do not. You see, this is very problematic. For me it is really important, that the parents decide and know what their kids are watching.

On the other hand it should be possible that television can make publicity, because just like that they can make money. But I think it is really difficult to make a good publicity for children in this age, as I explained before. In my opinion it is really important that the parents can decide and filter. But this ins't so realistic.
Another solution is, that the television advertises to the parents and not directly to the children.

Finally I can say, that it is still very difficult to find a good solution. For me it is clear that television isn't allowed to advertise directly to young children.
