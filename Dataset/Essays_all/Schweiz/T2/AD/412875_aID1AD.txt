Imagine you are  a four year old child and you like to watch television. Before your favorite program starts there is an advertisment, which shows you exactly what you want. If you are boy it could be a giant fortress made out of legos. If you are a girl you may be shown the barbie doll you desperatly want. After the advertisment was shown you run to your parents and ask them if you may have the shown product. Probably they will not buy it instantly, but after a while of complaining and crying they may consider buying it just to shut you up.

This situation is nothing that I would have wanted to ever exist. Sadly it partually became reality with companies, whose advertisements are directed toward young children. These children are heavily influenced by those ads and they make their parents buy stuff they don't need. Many parents don't have very much money to spend on such things. If the advertised product isn't bought, because of one of many valid reasons, the child will be devastated. If it is bought the parents will often have a bad feeling about it, as the product is almost never a necessity. Not to metion that the advertisments are directed towards children because the parents wouldn't have bought them if they saw the advertisment. The child probably doesn't know where and under what circumstances the product was made and what materials have been used. The product may have been made by children in asia and the materials used may be toxic. The child probably wouldn't even care. It only sees the product of their dreams. These advertisments open up the opportunity to sell products, that couldn't be sold differently and probably shouldn't be sold at all.

In conclusion I think it is clear that this form of advertising should not be allowed, as it influences the children in a way they don't even notice. And if one of the products gets bought, not everyone will be happy.
