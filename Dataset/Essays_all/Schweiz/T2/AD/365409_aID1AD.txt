The advertising toward young children like the statement confirms shouldn't be allowed, because children are very easily manipulated. The children will manipulate the parents which they see in the tv the parents to buy theme. Children can influens the buy-comportation and choose with the parents in which mall they go. The children influens also one below the other by seeing things that other children have, they want theme too. 

On the sight of the commercial this strategy will work for his buisness and he will gain much money. By influensing and manipulating children they will buy his products. 

My personal opinion is that the children shouldn't be influenced by this kinds of things. I think it should be a low so that the children are save. To influence young children isn't a good thing and I wish that the state will do something against this, but I don't think that it will be some change in the next years. 

But the adults are influenced too. May be that no one cares ot^r other think that it isn't true, but I think it is, because I see it by myself too.
