Television advertising directed toward young children has some advantages and some disadvantages. 

Nowadays, nearly everyone has a televsion in their house. Many children like to watch some movies or series on the television. If they watch them, they are automatically confronted with televsion advertisements. 
I think children aged two to five do not realise that much as adults do. For example when we watch a Disney movie in our age, we recognise much more details then we did in the age between two to five.
 
I think the parents are responsible for their children, so they are able to switch off the television when there is something, that the children should not see. On the other hand, children may not recognise details but they understand much more than we think sometimes. Because of that, children can be easily manipulated. And if they learn something in their young age, they keep it sometimes until they are grown up. Children are confronted with many wonderful things on the television for example during the christmas time. If the children want something then sometimes the parents buy it because of the advertisements.

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because I think that the parents are responsible for their children, they should keep their children under controll, that they do not watch to much television.
