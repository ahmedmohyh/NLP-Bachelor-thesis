Today everyone is online. Ofcoarse young children too. Certainly the will also be exposed to the television and their advertising. But is this healthy or not? Would the be strongly biased?
Young children learn everything very fast, especially children aged two to five tend to learn fast from their surroundings, primarily their parents. But TV and media are more and more taking place as a learning and free time platform. Due to this exposure, they will see more advertising, and also be influenced by that. But is that really a bad thing? Well ofcoarse on the one han they will be biased, might want to by a new cereal, a new toy or try the new videogame. So for sure there is an influence, but parents must teach their young offspring how to deal with it. Since the real "grown-up" world, is stuffed more with advertising in everyday life then coke is with sugar. So it should be viewed as part of growing up and learing to live in the overpolluted world. And anyhow, if one was to eliminate advertising on TV, one would have to eliminate poster-advertising too, because parents can stop their children from watching TV, but can children be stopped from going outside? Most certainly not! Now the question is with very young children, but if they are so young, can they really understand what is happening when they are being manipulated by advertisment? If not, then parents can fully control how much their chldren see it, if the can, they are old enough to learn how to deal with it.
So should there be a ban? No! Growing up, means learing to deal with the (free) world, and advertisment is part of the world. (Which in the west is liberal, hence free for the TV to do what it wants)
