Television advertising becomes more and more important in our daily lifes because more and more people are able to afford a Tv. Even though a lot of children between two and five years do not yet watch a lot of television. With that being said advertising becomes totally irrelevant. But if they actually watch Tv, they shouldn't be confronted with advertising because some of them include rude statements. I think children should grow up without being influenced by Tv advertising. If they watch to much Tv, they'll get educated from the tv not from theyr parents. Sometimes Tv advertisor use specific sentences to kind of conrtoll the childrens minds. They know exactly how to get theyr attention because young children do not have as much experience in life as for example theyr parents do. With that being said I do not think that the community should ban Tv advertising. I think parents should pick theyr nose and conroll the television consume of theyr children. If they successfully do so, I don't think Tv advertising will become a serious problem.
