The television a place infron of which a lot of people spend their freetime. Not only adults but young children too. These minors sit infront of that evolutionary box because their parents placed them infront of it, while they were too busy to look after their own kids. 

Adverts, something that influences mankind strongly. Not only in their thinking wise but in what way they handle stuff and in what they say. You don't only find adverts in newspapers and on billboards but on TV too. Advertising changes your state of mind and persuades you to buy things you've never planned on buying. But mostly, television advertising directed toward children are about toys. So if a child sees a new lego car in the TV it naturally will want it. Because it looks so cool in TV and everybody has it, at least that's what the advert says. The kids will beg their parents to buy them the new 'oh so cool' toy and they will cry over it for hours until ther parents finally can't hold their cool anymore, give in and buy the thing their child wants. 

So this brings the following question upon us: Sould television advertising directed toward young chidren (aged two to five) be allowed or not?  

In the last paragraph I told you reasons why it shoulnd't. And additionally it can be said that companies try to sell their stuff even already to kids. Their manipulation is already directed toward people of a young age. But that's what the selling business relies on: manipulation into buying more and more things. 

So that's why I'm not completely against TV advertising directed toward children aged two to five. Adverts are something todays market relies on. And the adverts I've been talking about might be seen by young children, but I think they are mainly meant to influence the parents. So if this kind of advertising would be prohibited then all kind of adverts would have to be forbidden and that's just not the world live in. The economy sector would not work without advertising.
