Save the future of our children

People these days cannot live without electronic machinines. Almost in evey household theres more than one computer and TV. The children grow up with a televiosion, which is on the whole day. But television advertising directed toward young children should definetly not be alllowd. 
One reason is, watching television the whole day, makes you stupid. You are not using your brain anymore and you lose important skills. The brain cannot develop anymore. They are only focused on watching and their brain has no work anymore. In this stage of age it`s absolutly important to learn things. Listening, speaking, physicaly and psychology things. Only if the parents support creativity etc. the children can grow up to an intelligent adult.
Not every show in the television is made for children, but they`re watching it. Sometimes the televionsion shows things, which are definetly not good for the psychologycal developtment. The tv shows us movies full of violence, wars or horror and in this way they can scare the kids. Scaring instead of caring is always not a god solution while growing up.
Relationships get lost, because of watching too much tv. A lot of parents aren`t interested in spending time with their kids. They are always buisy, have work to do or just not in the mood for playing with their children. Instead of caring about their kids, they let them watching tv all the time and this is definetly not the idea of having children.
The problem today is, that many parents have no creativity anymore and because of that the tv is on during the whole day. But this can have negative influences on the young children. We should forbit television advertising directed toward young children, just to save their future.
