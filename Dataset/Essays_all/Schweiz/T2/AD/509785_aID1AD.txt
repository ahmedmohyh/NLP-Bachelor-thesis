television in general shouldn't be allowed for small children, since the content can be very manipulative especially advertisements and even more if the content is directed towards these small children on purpose. If small children start watching television with a time regulation given by their parents the whole thing can be kept under control. But if the children start watching TV  for consecutive hours,days or even weeks I think it's not good for them. On the one side the children could lack in evolved social skills if they are at home all their spare time. They should really be out in the nature and making friends, trying to work in groups and again learn how to socialize themselves. On the other side they probably miss the life-lessons teached by being outside and exploring all the stuff around us. It is lso proven that TV is highly addictive especially for young children therefore parents should give their kid a limit in watching TV in order to prevent an addiction from happening. So in conclusion of the before mentioned points one could say that I clearly support a ban for television advertisement addressing small children. But I don't think these advertisements have an tremendous impact on the life of the children since they are not able to buy the stuff showed in the TV but I think it could make TV more attractive if during the breaks of some series the advertisement is addressed to small children, what again leads to the points mentionend above.
