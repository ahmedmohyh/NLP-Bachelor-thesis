Television propaganda for children?
Babys, if treated correctly, have the possibility to learn every language in existence. Due to this, they are also very widely able to absorb information. So small children are still very receptive to different kinds of information. I myself have a younger sister and she doesn`t watch TV, she litteraly stares at the display with an open mouth. So advertisements directed towards young children too most be highly effective. Let`s see why it is a bad idea to use television advertising directed towards young children.
Let`s look at why we use advertisement in the first place. The one and only goal is, to make a person to buy a certain product. But children at the age of two to five years aren`t able to buy products at all because usually they don`t have any money. So their parents have to decide to buy the product. Most of the time, the parents won`t buy them the toys they want. This puts them in a state of constant desire to have toys, which they can`t get, which makes them unhappy.
So the children are in a complete overflow of information, of which they can`t decide what`s important and what`s not. They might miss information about the importance to be social, but know every possible McDonalds advertisement by heart.
