Television today is something that is extremely present in our modern lives. As are smartphones, computers and electronical devices in general. 
It is almost impossible to prevent that also young children are confronted with the technical development.

Children as young as two to five are very influencable. They are young and they are interested in everything looking funny to them. Adverts that are directed towards them intend to make them want something; there is the important difference between children and adults seeing adverts. Adults can differ between something they actually need and something they only want because it looks nice on TV. Children watch this advert and believe that they need it even though they have enough to play with.

The good thing about this is, that children have more to say in what they get to play with. When children can not see these adverts they won't know that there are certain plays they would maybe rather play with than what their parents have bought them beliving they would like it. 
They are clearly more advanced in a way that they can choose freely what they want.

In my opinion it's not healthy for children to watch TV excessively and adverts encourage this further.
I think adverts should not be directed at children that young because this tells everyone that it is okay if children sit in front of the television all the time.
