Is that good for young children to look televison?

My first oppinion is that young children shouldn't look too much television, because they should for example be in their garden and play with their toys and friends. But when I was young I also loved to look my series.
So I think a good education is when the parents precise a time in which their children can look TV. And the rest of the day the boys and girls have to find other occupations. It is very important that kids aren't addicted to the television.
And than it depends also what the young children look. If they look things too violent, films with murders and wars, that isn't good at all! In this age the young children learn very quick and are imrpessioned by many tings. So if the parents show them bad films, these young kids maybe don't understand that the scenes that they see aren't good and than they will imitate this bad things with their friends at school. Or maybe they are afraid and make very bad dreams. So I think that it is important that the parents show their kids films which are appropriated too the childrens ages.  

So the first point is that parents must give their children a fix time for televison and the second point ist that parents should control what their children look. The oportunity is that children aren't adiccted and can have fun with other things. Healthy things like playing football, go swimming, be with their friends... To be social and adventures!
