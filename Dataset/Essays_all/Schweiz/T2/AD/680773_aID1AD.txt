Young children are easily manipulated. If by their peers, their parents or other people or objects they look up to, children's opinions can be changed quickly. Television and specificaly advertisments are especially important in this matter, but is it actually ok for children to be specificaly targeted by advertisment?

One might argue that it should not be allowed, and it would be sensible to do so. Children are very suseptible to subconsious manipulation and have no means of defending themselves from it. They willingly listen and take in consious information along with subconsious stimuli, leading them to unreasonable requests and maybe even changed behaviour.

On the other hand, children's parents have a great amount of control over what their child sees on the television and how it reacts to it, since their opinions and behaviour has been affecting that of their child since shortly after its birth. Furthermore, children are not only influenced by commercials, but by anything they see and like, so banning or monitoring advertisements that target children can be bypassed by pretty much anything that is shown on televison. 

To conclude, my personal opinion of banning advertisements directed towards children is, that a ban would not do much. For one thing, parents are the ultimate filter of what children see and the behaviour they show as a reaction. So if a child makes unreasonable requests, like constantly demanding new toys, parents can work against the advertisment by simply not answering those requests. And, finaly, on the other hand children, even rather young ones, tend to recognise what they want or not without being guided by what they see on television.
