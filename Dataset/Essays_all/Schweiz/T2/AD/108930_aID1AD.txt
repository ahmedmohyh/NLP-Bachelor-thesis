On the one hand, young childrens can easly get influenced by television advertising because in the age of two to five, usually they believe everything they see or hear. So when they see other children playing for example with a new barbie, they want to to the same. Some of them will always tell it to their parents and when they don't get it, they will cry. For their parents, this can be very annoying. 
But on the other hand, television advertising directet toward young children can also be good. Because sooner or later, they will get in touch with television advertisning. It's better when they learn how to deal with that when they are young.
I disagree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. In my opinion, they parents have to pay attention on what their children watch in the television. If they don't want that their kids see the advertisment, they can buy for example a dvd.
