Should television advertising directed toward your children in the age of two to five years be allowed? 
On the one hand the small children should get to know the real world and how it works since the moment they were born. It might be quite a good lesson for young children to consider diffrent options of living. In the young age it's essential to learn many diffrent lessons about life. One of the most important one is to understand, that there are milions of people living in this world and that there always will be different thing, you wanna buy. The lesson, to not always get what you want is quite important and necessary for life. A television advertising toward young childern might be an amazing help for specific lessons in the education. On the other hand television advertising toward children can be followed by extremely deep familyproblems. If children, not having a big amount of money in the family, everyday get to see this advertising with happy children playing funny games, they really get to  belive that other kids might be much happier than them. They get to see how money leads to positiv emotions. The good thing about children is to see how happy they are and how much fun they can have requireing nothing. If childern in their early age get used to see people beeing happy because of investigated money, they will always in life tend to think that richness leads to happiness.  A young kid will never understand that advertising hasn't anything to do with real life.
