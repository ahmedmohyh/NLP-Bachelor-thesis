In general, children aged two to five should not watch to much television. There are psychological experiments which show, that children who watched a lot of television are a view time later not able to do the same things like drawing a person, like other children can with a lot of details. So children did't get enough inputs wehn they watch a lot of television. 
The advertising between a programm in the television are not just watched by adults but also by children. And there are advertisings for adults and also for children. But those for children are most of the time absolutely rubbish and just make children to want this product they advertise for. Actually every advertising has this aim, to make people to want have a product. But I think it is something different when you do it for children, because children do always want to have everything, also in the supermarked. Parents then have to tell their children, that they cannot have everything they want, but the television advertising makes this much more difficult. 
On the other side for many businesses it's something verry important because otherwise they will not earn enough money. 
But my point is clear: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
