Television advertising is just a method of many to get people in the store. I think it should be allowed to make televison advertising directed twoard young children if there are companies which want to spend money for that. There is no reason against it in my opinion because I believe that childrens aged two to five should not be in front of a televison. So no childrens that young would see such comemrcials. I suppose that the impact of those commercials are not huge, because it is not the childrens who decide to buy it or not. Parents should be responsible that their kids cannot get affected by such stupid commercials. Companies should think about what commercial they will do and who gets directed. I would say it is wrong to do televison advertising directed toward young children because the childrens should not be in front of a television or at least not completly alone. Children that age cannot decide from what they get affectet but teir parents can and should avoid stupid things. It is alright if childrens watch a episode from their favourite serie but it is absolutly not okey if childrens watch four houres. In my opinion it is better to do advertising for such young children then do advertising for adults on a channel that is manly watched from childrens.
