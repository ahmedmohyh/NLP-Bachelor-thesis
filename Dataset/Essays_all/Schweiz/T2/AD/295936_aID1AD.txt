Fun, colourful and loud those adjectives especially apply to the advertisement aimed at a young target group, the children. Just like the toys and sweets that are being sold to children the advertisement is just as bright and shiny in order to trigger the young consumers's demand. But is advertisement towars such a young target group fair, should it even be allowed?


Children are not yet able to properly asess the meaning of advertising. They are too young to realize that all the things that are claimed in those spots might not be true since they do not understand economy and therefore neither they understand marketing. Children are very influencable due to their lack of knowlege and are an easy target. By aiming advertisement at a group of two to five year olds the industry is playing an unfair game, by taking advantage of the children so young they are barely able to make up their own mind. 

Since children, especially aged two to five don't have any buying force on their own it's their parents decision whether a purchase is made or not. Advertisement directed at a very young target group therefore does not have an impact on childrens prosperity. They aren't able to amass any debt and therefore the only thing the industry is taking advantage of is the parents soft spot. The children will automatically run up to their parents and beg them to buy the advertised product which only be bad for the parents nerves.

After asessing the pros and cons of the topic advertisement aimed at young children, I have come to the conclusion that advertisement for children might not be a very fair game but I think the children aren't suffering any damage from it since the buying decision does not lie on their side.
