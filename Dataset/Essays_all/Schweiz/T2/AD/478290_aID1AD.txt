Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed? 

Which advantages and disadvantages are included?

First of all, it is true that publicity affects children and adults in order to buy something presented in the ad. People often want this specific object, after they've watched an ad about it. That's like publicity works and that's why it is utilized by many companies to spread their product, even though it can cost a lot. They invest, because it^s very likely to make surplus.
 But, however, the question is, if there should be a barrier in order to ommit commercial influences on children not older than five. If it is important or nonsense is very causing discussions. 
On one hand it's questionable whether those kids really care about ads and their messages/products, even when it's easy to imagine, that they will most likely care, if it's an advertising about toys like playmobil. 
But how is it possible to control and manifest such a prohibition? It seems impossible and at least it would be very hard.
