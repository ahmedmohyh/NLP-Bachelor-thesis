In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons. First of all, children are not a part of the adult community yet and do not earn any money. It is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it. Therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children. 
Secondly, children are easily influenced, which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the children's heads. That fact brings a certain danger, some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way. And it could also be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising.
I also think that children should spend more time in nature playing, making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world. It might be alright to watch television from time to time, but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things, which could kill off children's natural eagerness to live and play.
Having too many things or products also dicreases the children's creativity, since they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore. This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults. They would always have to rely on products to entertain them.
All in all, television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me. It does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product, which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with. It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively. Other points are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a children's natural creativity.
