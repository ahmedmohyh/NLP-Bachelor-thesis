Children in this age do like watching TV. But they don't know if it's good or not. And that depends on the programm they watch. There are huge differences between the series. I wouldn't watch horrorfilms with a five years old child. But I think they can and should watch programms like "Sandmann". Or in the age of five or older they can watch series which teach you something. But that's nothing for a two years old child. The most impotrant decision the parents have to make is the timeperiod in which their children are allowed to watch TV. A young human being shouldn't watch TV for a long time in a row. It's better for them to watch several times a day but always just for an half an hour or less. It also depends on what the children do when they are not watching TV. If they are outside playing it's more normal that they are allowed to watch TV because they did enough sports and they had fresh air. But if they are at home during the hole day to play video games or something like this, then it's not healthy for them. Maybe the parents don't realise it when their child is that young but I would say that it can effect the life of a child. An other problem is that the children can relax while they are watching TV. They didn't do enough sport during the day and that's why they aren't tired at night. So they can not sleep that well and that long. 
My opinion is that children can watch TV. But it has to be a programm for children and it needs to be during a realistic timeperiod. And the most important point for me is that every child needs to go outside to play to have a healthy life. The parents need to have keep the controle over the TV and the programm which their child is watching.
