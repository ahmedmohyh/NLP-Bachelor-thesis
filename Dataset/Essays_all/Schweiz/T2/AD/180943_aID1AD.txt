Television advertising is a quite big part of our daily TV programme. Especially on channels that are meant to be watched by kids, there are countless spots about games, toys and other inventions that kids might like. DO kids already understand what they see in TV and how are they influenced by it?
While watching TV, children may see a new product that they like. They are inspired by it and have new ideas of what they could play or paint. For example They can find another way to use a toy they already have.Such experiences support the development of the child's creativity and provide it with new ideas. 
However, especially young children cant't understand yet how they are influenced by the media. Every product seems to be perfect and a lot of fun on TV but they can't see the marketing stategy and the lies that are hidden. Those children may be disappointed once they recieve their new toy or game.
Furthermore, by showing kids the wide range of toys that exist, parents are pressured to come after every of their child's wishes. In addition, these products often are quite expensive, which enlarges the parents' problem even more. 
To conclude, I would like to mention that television advertising should be limited, especially on childrens' channels because in my opinion it is wrong to use naive children to sell as many products as possible without them noticing how they are influenced.
