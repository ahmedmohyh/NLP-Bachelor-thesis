Nowadays there is a lot of advertisments in the television directed to different kind of groups.
Groups with different interests and characteristics.
Some groups are easilier influenced than others, children for one are rather simple to manipulate.
The product just has to be presented with some flashy colors and they all suddenly need this object.
But is it okay to have all these ads?
Children don't know what they want, they just 'want' what the others have, what is new.
And these adverisments use this fact on purpose, because they know, sooner or later, most children will have been working their parents long enough in order for them to buy it, so that the children are calm again.
On the other hand, if those ads were to be banned all of a sudden, the companies won't sell as much no more.
It would have quite a grave influence on the economy without really helping anyone.
Maybe those ads are manipulating the children, but adults are manipulated as well by ads and media.
Lastly, banning these ads is only milding the symptons, not curing this materialistic disease Europe is suffering from since their free will was stomped by the Americans, the British and the Soviets.
These children, as said, don't know what they want, and the adults seek it alike in these times: it is order, guidance, discipline, a purpose other than existing. So banning these ads will not do much good anyway,
so there's no need to do so.
