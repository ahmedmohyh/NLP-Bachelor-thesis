Everybody who have a televsion knows it how it is when you will watch a serie or a interesting film and every thirty minutes it comes a advertising about three to five miunutes. That can realy goes on your nervs, but it is allowed. Is it also a good idea to screen adversting to young children?
The young children are in this age in the part, where they get away of their parent. They bigin to distance to their parent and are more and more independence. For example they can walk alone, eat alone and speak. This time they want to explore the life and make a lot of new experience. When they watch television they can't unterstand everything but even if they get older they unterstand more and more. So when they see an advertising and it looks pritty they realy want it. So they have desire for the birthday present or for christmas. An other point is that they see new things for spending their time. For example a new game.
On the other side it is no so easy for the parents, beacause when the advertising is very pritty then the children want it and asked everytime their parent to buy it. So it can goes realy on the nerfs. A negative point is that the children don't realy know what it is but it looks nice and on the adverting it looks very funny so they want it. They realy get manipulated, they don't realy follow their own interest. You should also take care if the adversting is for the age of this children or not. Don't forget that some children get bored very fast when they see often advertising an not the serie or what they want to look. So they easy make stupid things

All in all it isn't easy to say if it should be allowed or not. It gives alot negative points but without the advertisig the television would have problem with the finance, because with the advertising they can pay alot of the cost and for the people it is less expensive. I would say it should be a bit less advertising but n
