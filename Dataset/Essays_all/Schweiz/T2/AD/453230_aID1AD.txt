Television is today normal and not think away of. Many children grow up with it. Especialy young kids spend a lot of time in front of the TV. Parents should controll them, so that their kids don't spend to much time at the TV. The Television is a good way to learn the own language and also other foreing languages. Ther are many series for kids which animade them to be active. As long as the children watch series or movies for their age it's okay. When they watch movies for adults, horror or criminal movies, they get bad influence. When the parent watch films which the children should not see, they have to look that the children aren't looking with them. Young children should be allowed to watch TV, but it must be for their age. They should watch teletubies instead of James Bond. I disagree the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. The television gives us many opportunities and for children a good way to learn many things in a fun way. The children have to be controlled by their parents, so that they don't watch things they shouldn't see and that they don't spend to much time in front of the TV.
