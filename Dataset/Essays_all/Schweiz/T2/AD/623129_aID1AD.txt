Advertising directed towards young children:

The pure fact that young children age two to five already watch so much television that we as adultes need to talk about the ban of TV advertising already reflects the huge problems we have in the first world...

However it has to be said that we live in a capital based society which is built on capitalism and the free market. In a free market economy the whole population profits when more products and goods are sold to the pobulation. So we should argue that we should allow adertising for our kids just for the good of our economy.
I must say I disagree strongly. Our country is run by a so called social free market economy, which is a system where the state corrects social differences by reallocation resources from the rich to the poor. All that wants to say that we care about everybody wellbeing in our society. So why should not care about our youngest and already make them and protect them from the influence of advertising.
Since children at the age of two to five are getting to know our world very intensively we should not show them our made up world of advertising, we better show them our real world and by that i dont think about some sort of cool animal documentaries on Dmax. Our kids should figure out for themself what they like or not. We should not be talking about what kind of ads we would like to ban for kids we should be there and support them as our own brothers and sisters. I am very sure then only when we are able to rais our kids in a good way, only then their future gets breither. 

So when we think about banning advertision for your youngest we should actualy be talking about how to raise our kids properly.
