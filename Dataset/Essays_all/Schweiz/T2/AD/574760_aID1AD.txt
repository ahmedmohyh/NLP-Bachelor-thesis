A lot of kids aged two to five like to watch television and do this all day for some hours. For the parents is this also good because the kids have something to do and the parents can work in this time or clean up the house. But ist that a good idea? In television you see not just movies or series you also see a lot of advertising directed toward young children. It shouldn`t be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children. 

An argument who speaks for the thesis is that kids in this age believe everything you say to them. When Kids hear something what people say in the advertising they think that`s true oder when they see something stupid in the advertising they also believe it`s true. Because of this kid are very vulnerable and it could be that they learn something wrong because of this advertising. This could change the life of the kids.

An reason who speaks against this thesis is that advertisings aren`t bad. There aren`t brutal or cruel scenes in it. The scenes which are shown in advertising are happy and full of harmony. A lot advertisings are funny and you have to laugh if you see it. This isn`t bad for this kids and don`t harm them.

Finally I think it shouldn`t be allow to do this. Kids are too vulnerable in this age and television advertising directed toward young children is unessecary.
