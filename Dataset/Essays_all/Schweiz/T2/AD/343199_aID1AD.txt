Should childrens advertismenets be allowed?

Nowadays after every show or almost every fifteen minutes there is an advertising break on television. Most advertisments are directed towards adults or adolescents, however should there be advertisements for young children? 

If there is a commercial on the tv about the latest Princess Doll out on the market and your young daughter sees it, she is most likely to want this doll afterwards. However as a parent, we cannot buy our children everything they desire, so we have to say no. The usual then starts: They start to scream and cry, saying they want the doll. If there would be no advertisments directed towards young children, some of these breakouts could be avoided. 

On the other hand, young children might not even notice the commercial. They look at it but just admire it and wait for their movie, tv show etc. to continue. 
Most sellers have the right to advertise their products on television, then why shouldn't these sellers be allowed not to? They should be allowed to advertise any product, regardless who is watching. 

I think that if an advertisement is going to influence a child it does not depend if it is maid for younger or older audience, it is still going to affect them. So in my opinion there is not going to be a big difference in cancelling the advertisements.
