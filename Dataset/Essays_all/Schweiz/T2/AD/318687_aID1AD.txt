Television advertising is a subject concerning everyones everyday life. Everyone got so used to it, that nobody really thinks anything of it. But how does it affect young children especially when the advertisment adresses them?

It of coures can be a good thing to confront children with that subject from an early age on to teach them to have a reasonable understanding of it. Especially as this is a subject in our everyday life and children are influenced by it. 
From the advertisment makers perspective it can be a good thing to adress children when they are their target group. It can make sense then to prromote a product in a way that it is attractive for children so in this case their target group. 

Television advertising directed towards young children might also have a very negative influence on them where children of a specific looking type are chosen and younger children start compare themselves to them. It might then be more difficult for them to accept their imperfections and impurities later on especially in puperty where boys and girls have a lot of insecruities.
Also again of a ad makers perspective it does not really make sense to make advertisments directed towards young children. Eventhough the product might be for them they are still not their target group. The parents are because they buy the product so the ad must be attractive to them.

All there is left to say is that advertisement towards young children has its pros and cons but I reckon that the negative ones overweigh the positive ones. Advertisement influences children in a way parents don't really think about and which can damage them in a way that they might don't really like for example their appearance anymore later on in their life because they compare themselves to what is shown on TV.
