Young people are in a stadium, where they are growing. All the parts of their body is growing. If the child looks television in his first tree years, that has a negative effect for his growing, his eyes etc. If the child does not look television in his first years, everything is good. There is a reason, why a lot of people aren't agree that children can watch television when they are a baby. 
In the first years, the child should think and imagine in his own why and shouldnt look television. If the child looks television, he does not have to think. Thinking on his own way is a good exercise. If the child looks television he loses important time. In this time, he could play with other babys which is more important than watching television. when i have a baby, my baby isn not allowed to watch television in his first tree years of his life. In this time, he should look on pictures of a book or should play with soft balls or something like that. 

In conclusion i am agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
