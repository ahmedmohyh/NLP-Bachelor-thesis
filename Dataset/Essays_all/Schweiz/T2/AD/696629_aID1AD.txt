Television advertising that is directed toward young children is a manipulative method that brainwashes the children to become consumers as they are growing up. Evident for this would be the high impact advertising is already having on our society today, with consumption in the West already being so high that one earth would not surfice anymore if every individual lived accordingly. Having children grow up accustomed to high consumption of goods is problematic since it would have a massive impact on our environment, which would amplify the issues we are already facing today.
Additionaly this type of advertisment would cause more stain on the parents, since they would be the ones paying for these advertised goods. The standards for parents everywhere would be higher, as the demands of the children will increase with the advertisment. Therefore it will create more pressure for the parents with low financial means, as they attempt to live up to parents that can afford giving their children what they desire.

However what has to be taken into consideration is that adverts are already a crucial part of our life and society. We cannot leave our house without seeing them, sometimes they are even subconciously imbedded in our minds. Even children are affected by adverts meant for adults, even if the target audience is older. Therefore it's questionable if banning age-specific television adverts would make much of a difference.

In conclusion although television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since it puts unnecessary strain on our planet and the parents, it is not the main offender when analyzing the problems we face. To really make a difference it would be necessary to review our general use of advertisment and how we monitor our consumption. However we should not increase the problem by targeting and conditioning children at an early age.
