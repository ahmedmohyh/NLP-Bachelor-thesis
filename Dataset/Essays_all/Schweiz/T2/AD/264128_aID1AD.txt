Nowadays, ads are everywhere. Whether it is on the internet, in television or in real life in form of posters, etc., everyday we are exposed to brands telling us what to do. Although no one forces us to buy anything, there is no way to escape these advertisements and even if we might not notice, they are constantly influencing us. We all are victims of advertisement. However, we still have the ability to stop that up to a certain degree, because (almost) every adult is able to see things critically and have an own opinion. But what about children, that have not yet learned what is right and what wrong? Children tend to believe most things they see or hear. So when they are watching tv, they will probably also believe the advertisements. Especially at the age of two to five, children are influenced by everything surounding them, and it is important that parents think about what environment their children are growing up in. So they should ask themselves whom they want their children to be influenced by. Is it really brands that should teach children what is important in life? Do we want children to learn that kinder bueno bars are the only thing that will make them happy, that they need barbie dolls for complete satisfaction? Do we want them to be opressed by capitalism and fitted into norms, created by a profit orientated, unfair and sick society? No. Hence, we should defenitely prohibit ads for children under the age of (at least!!) five, and much rather teach them real values. Despite, I personally think that children under the age of five shouldn't watch tv at all, as it can cause harm to their brains, stops their creativity and diminishes their ability to have human relationships.
