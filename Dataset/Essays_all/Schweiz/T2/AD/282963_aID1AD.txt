In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed because children are inocent and emotional, they believe, what they are being told and what they see. They take everything literally, so if someone in the televison says for exemple the world is a plain, they are going to believe that because they don't know it better.Even if they do know that the world is actually round they will start to question it because that is just what children do. 

An other reason why i'm against it, is that young children don't even understand what they are being told and that is exactelly the reason why they could understand or interpretaed something wrong that was ment to be something totally else. 
Unfortunately it is likely for a child that it believes what it is being told. Young children can easely be manipulated and producers, politiciens or other people could take advantage of that. They could brain-wash childrens and manipulate them as they please, just to get what they want.

Anyway I think that in general you shouldn't direct something towards little children as I said for the reason that they would take everything serious and would listen to what they are being told

Sorry that you have to read this but I had really no clue and not the slightest idea what advertising means, so I just guessed.
