When I siz in a restaurant I often see little kids with an iPad or iPhone, playing a game or looking a film. The parents sit beside them chatting with friends. I do understand, that it is exhausting to entertain kids the hole time and the parents need a break. But is the iPad or iPhone the best way?

I'm just 18, but I think the parents could do it better. Because there are other possibilities to entertain kids. An easy way to give them something to do is to let them draw. Almost every restaurant has paper and pens. An other possibilities is to bring some books with you to the restaurant. In this ways the kids can entertain themselves.

As many sientists say elektronic object can have bad consequences like cancer. So why should we let our kids use these elektronic stuff. I know kids really like elektronic stuff but parents should definitely avoid the contact between their kids and a television, iPad, iPhone, gameboy and other objects like these.

A two year old isn't interessted in a documentary about bears in Canada or something similar. So they want look kids series like "Cars" or "Lego movies". But with this series they don't get useful informations. Most of these series are foulish.

Kids are so creativ and have a huge fantasy. We should let them use these. When they play gamse on the iPhone their creativity and fantasy get lost.

For me there is no argument to support the use of television or other electronic things for kids of that young age. So I definitely think it should not be allowed to let kids use electronic stuff like television.
