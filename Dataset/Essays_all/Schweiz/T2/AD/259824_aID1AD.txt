In our modern society the media is ganing a lot of attention and power. With it, advertisemtent is also growing and catches our attention through our daily lifes. Conflicting children with advertisement isn't a new idea or strategy, it has made now for decades and still is very effective. Children who see a new toy on television will be given that toy for their next birthday if requested enough. By the high determination of children in their families today make the advertisment directed toward children even more efficent. But this is a controversy. Should parents just buy things that their children like to have or should the parents decide, with their grown up mind, what's good or bad for their own child. 
Many believe that advertisement directed toward children is manupulting and stops the developement of the own identity. I personally think this is not the fault of the advertiser, I believe the fault is on the parents side. Parents should clearly point out to their children that they should be critic about television especially advertisment. By holding a good distance with a critical view, advertisement surely won't stop a personal development of a kid and also let's him keep his personal freedom.
