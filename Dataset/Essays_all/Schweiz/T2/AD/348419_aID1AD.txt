Today, advertising is an importent part of our lives and also for the companies witch bring them out. There have been many studies about how publicity influenc our daily live. In scool we talkt about witch advertising is better and why is she better than others. So there are many different opinions about thsat theme.
If a child is in the age from tow to five, somebody could say that they see the advrtising but they don't pay attention to it, but perhabs it does something with them in the sub-conscience. its the same thing with the grownup persons. so they couldbe influenced from a very young age up. It also plays a rolle wicht kind of publicity is that. If its for a toy they perhabs realiced it and walk afterwards to the parents and ask them if they could buy it.
People also can say that its not good to show children advertising, because they get early in that flow of buying allways anything if they have money. Or, and thats an other argument for contra, even if they don't have enougth money. Its easyer for them to make a lot of problems with money. 
We also could say, that showing pub to them, heps that they could better understand the word of commerce and so they could learn not spending to much moneyone things they don't really need.
So they are many different ideas and meanings, but I think there are more arguments for the negative sight on this problem.Its not necessary to show them advertising because they don't have to be influenced in such a young age. They can not protect themselv from this attacs in the sub-conscience. And that is also my personal opinion.
