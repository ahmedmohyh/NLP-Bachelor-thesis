I do not agree with this statement at all.
Nowadays there are a lot of companies that produce toys for kids. There are also big stores, for example "Toys'r'us", that only sell kids toys. The most common way to advertise such toys and stores is by making adds in a way that kids feel the need to buy that toy. This is the way every advertising works. Not just toy advertising. Also adult specific companies make there advertising in a way that they want to buy there product. The only difference is, that adults can buy there products immediately. On the other hand young children can't buy toys. They have to get the permission of their parents first. 
Moreover the way how our economy works is by advertising. You can not watch TV and expect to not see adds at all. Or you can not read a newspaper without seeing adds. That is just the normal way how TV stations get their money. And through the adds the audience will decide wether to buy this product or not. It doesn't matter if the add is directed to old or young people. If toy companies are not allowed to advertise their products, how are they supposed to make money? So I don't see why advertising directly toward young children should not be allowed.
