I think that it should be allowed because it can't possibly have to many bad consequences. Even if those children are allowed to watch television at that young age, it doesn't imply that they'll be able to buy those things themselves.
 
For me it's more a question of how educated the child is. I personally think that children aged 2 to 5 should not be allowed to watch too much tv but only movies adapted to their age. If they'd still have that healthy childhood that I had, they wouldn't be watching tv anyway so the advertising would have no effect on them.

But now supposed that times have changed and young children are watching tv and therefore are affected by those advertisements, what is the bad thing about it? If they see a toy they like and the parents agree to buy it, everyone is happy. Because given that the parents would buy toys for their children anyway, why not buy them something they actually want. 

Also as a child I remember reading those magazines with all those toys inside them. So even outside the tv children are already exposed to advertisement. And I have to say that I actually enjoyed it when I was little. Although I wanted almost everything that was inside that magazine, my parents obviously couldn't buy me everything so I had to decide on just a few. Looking back I think that I learned two important lesson thanks to that experience: that I couldn't have everything and to enjoy the things that I had. Because were is the fun in being able to buy everything and not even have to work for it? 
To conclude I personally thing that being exposed to advertisement at a young age is not much different than when we are older, it only gives us suggestions what we could buy but in the end we can decide for ourselves.
