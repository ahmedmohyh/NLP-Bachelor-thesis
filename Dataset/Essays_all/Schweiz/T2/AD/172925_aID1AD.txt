Nowadays children are used to electronic items like computers, televisions etc. In this essay I will examine the question if advertisement directed toward young children should be forbitten or not. So I will give some pro and contra arguments.

In television there are a lot of different channels made for children. As in every channel there is a lot of advertising, children also get in contact with advertisement. They usually watch advertisements about toys or computer games and more. One advantage is that they are able to look what new toys exist and so they know what toys they would maybe like to have. 
Furthermore, they learn how tu use the new toy they bought. Because in adverts they often show how other children play with these objects. 
Thirdly, children get new ideas by watching advertisments. They become more creative because they learn what sort of things they can use to play and so they are able to invent something new in the way they use their toys.

On the other hand, the first thing I would like to mention is that children at this early age (two to five) should not watch TV at all. Adverts are showed in TV to make people buy the factory's products. So when children watch that, they already believe the things the adverts are saying. 
Moreover, it could also be disturbing for the parents of the children. The children always ask their parents to buy the new item, which can be exhausting for them because it is also a question of the money the family earns in the salary. 
Lastly, the adverts have a big influence on the children. Because if the children won't get the toy, they may behave badly.

In my opinion we should not let children watch much TV, especially not adverts. I imagine, it must be horrible for the mother that her child keeps asking for a new toy, which may is too expensive for them.
