This essay will be about the topic of advertisments directed towards young children. It is a very controversial topic and there are valid points for and against those commercials.
The biggest problem in my opinion is that very young children can't correctly judge if they need something or not. Because of that they can very easily manipulated. This is a big problem because companies can design certain types of advertisments to specifically target those age groups. At this age they can't already realise what they really need and what they don't. Because of that the children might want something very useless and the parents who want to do their children a favour give in an buy a lot of unnecessary stuff. 
On the other hand people say that it is the parents responsibility to not let their children watch television at such a young age. This is not good for the development of the child anyways. Also it is the parents who might buy those things for their children, not the children themselves. This further says that it is the parent's fault if those commercials work on their children. 
It would also be problematic to prohibit such advertisments. How do you prove that an advertisment is specifically targeting children that are below for example the age of 5? This is very difficult and may lead to big and expensive court cases.
Although I agree with the point that children are easily manipulated and it is not a good thing to exploit that, I don't agree that commercials like this should be prohibited. In my opinion it is the parent's responsibility to protect their own children from such advertisments. Every parent has the possibility of stopping this, either by not letting their child watch television or by not giving in and buying unnecessary stuff.
