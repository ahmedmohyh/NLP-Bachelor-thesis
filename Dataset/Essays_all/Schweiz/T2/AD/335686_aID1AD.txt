In young age people are more likely to believe what is told. So companies can take this advantage to make young children buy their product. Should then advertisment to young children be forbitten? 
The idea of the statement is that, young children should not be influenced by television advertsiment, so they can build their own opinion on certain thoughts. But how should this law work? Television companies do not know how old the consumer is who is watching the advertisment at the moment. And what if the parents of the young child are whatching the marketing trick too? To fullfill this law is impossible because there are to many greyzones.
In my opinion this statement has some good affects as like, the manipulation via television advertisment of young children would not take place. But children are manipulated by their parents anyway. Furthermore could the parents just control this by not letting the children watch television, which is in my opinion thebest way to solve this because children with age from two to five should not be watching television.
Conclusing, I do not agree with this statement because it provocates more problems than solutions. The mentoinned problem is fullyin the hands of the parents because a two year old is not able to say wether he wants to see this advertisment or not.
