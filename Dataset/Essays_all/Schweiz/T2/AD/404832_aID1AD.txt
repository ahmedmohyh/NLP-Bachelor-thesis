First of all, i think that television advertising is like a human right. So why would i diasagree with the statement? 

Some of the children who watsches one of the advertisings and really focus of the main plot of the message surely can remember this one little toy. It`s the very same thing with adults! We only focus on the ads which we like the most. The little boys and girls can learn something from the television, what makes the hole statement even more interesting, because that would be great when they can still remember that one advertising ten years ago! If there are advertising directed toward children, there`d be specialists who created those and that makes it a lot less worse

On the other side, some of the televisions ads can be disturbing and terrible, even the ones for the children. There`s always a risk when i let my child watch one of those advertisings. 
Another point would be that the child got a passion for watsching TV when they start to like advertising. When they grow up and always be in front of their screen, then I`m sure that`s not good for their healths. It would be anyway better when the child is like 90 percent of the time outside and plays with his friends, like we all did. So when I get the chance to put my child in front of A TV or outside, i`ll go with the second. Many people say that the world gets dumber every decade. I associate that with the statement here. Ads in a young age are just bad for the development of our brain.

It`s from child to child different if it learns something or got a bad habit from advertising which are directed toward young children.
