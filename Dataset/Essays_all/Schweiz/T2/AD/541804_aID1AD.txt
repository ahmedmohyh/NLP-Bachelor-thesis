The question, if direct advertising towards young children should be allowed truly is a very controversial question. It shurely is a widely discussed and important topic with good arguments on both sides.
On one hand there is the freedom of market economy, which ensures companies to have certain rights and to advertise for their products as widely as possible. They are dependant on a certain amount of sales and need enough income to continue providing their product and paying their shareholders and employees.
On the other hand children (especially aged two to five) are extremely easily influenced. Do they have to be protected through law or are parents responsible for what their childen watch? Are parents able to always watch over their children when they watch TV? Or should they just let the advertisement get to their childrens brains but try to keep their kids under control on their next shopping trip to "Walmart`s"?
In my opinion we should protect our children from threats like these. Letting big companies screw our helpless childrens minds is cruel and can`t be toleratd any longer. We must rise and take a stand against this worst form of capitalism the world has ever seen. There hasn`t been this amount of psychologic violence since the end of the second world war. A battle is raging around us but we seem not to see it. Or don`t we want to see it? Because we are part of the system...?
