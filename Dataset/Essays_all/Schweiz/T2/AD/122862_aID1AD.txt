The 21 century, a time where technology controlls the world and the people living in it. A time when a five years old girl or boy gets an IPAD as a gift for birthday and children get mobile phones a tthe age of eight. So should we support this developpment and take it even further to even younger children? If not television advertising must be illegal directed to children at the age two to five.

Television advertising should not be allowed to children two to five because they can't decide by themselves what they are watching and by what sources they are influenced. 

In this time where technologies are everywhere and everyone uses them why should it be illegal to advertise it to very young childdren. We should throw away the thought of a childhood when playing outside in the forest or on the street were the things to do during the free-time. Things change people change so the childhood does. Our thinking of a good childhood is the wrong thought. We should accept it and get along with it. That leads to why it should be legal advertising to young children.

Mobile phones and Ipads rule the childhood of the kids. Today it starts at the age of 9 maybe some yearse arlier or later. The question is, do we want to support this developpment and in some years everyone from the age of five has a phone? No,a future like this would be awful. The talking skills decrease and people get even more isolated. 

To conclude, I'm totally against advertising to young children. The developpment of the childhood drom mine to the ones now is bad. Seing all the kids with phone at an age when I didn't even thought of mobile phones is bad and we should do something against it.
