Television advertising directed toward young children - should it be allowed or not?

First of all it is important to seperate the differnt kind of television advertising. Different channels show different types of advertising. Therefore it's in the responsibility of the parents wich channel they let watch theire children. During the day there is less danger for bad or scary television advertising. But in the evening the advertising often change. For example a channel shows a trailer of a scary movie. Advertising like that makes young children full of frigt and fear. And they often get nightmares. 
So like I sad before, the most important point is the kind of channel young children watch. Channels made for yong people, like Disney-Channel, show advertising made for young people! In this case theire is no danger to let young children watch these kind of advertising. 

Because of this my opinion is that television advertising directed toward young people should be allowed if the parents controle the situation. If they don't watch theire children and let them alone with the televisioncontroler it should not be allowed. In real life we can't controle the responsibility of the parents therefore I can only hope that the parents always have an eye on theire kids.
