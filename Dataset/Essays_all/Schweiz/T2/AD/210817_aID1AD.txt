Yes. Advertising towards young people should be forbidden. In this age kids believe everything someone older than them says. They should not be told, that everything that looks good in advertisings is good in real life. Our life is all about consuming. Even the youngest people are drilled to get the best toy. This is ok, when it is something out of a good quality, like Pokemon cards. But if you advertise this 200 gramm plastic thingything and everyone is buying it, you are a serious problem in this society. We can not live towards consumption. This was one argument. The other argument is far more primitive. Nor mother nor father want to have the stress, caused of a little kid wanting really bad this new toy out of the TV-advert. Whoever lets this stress happen to parents on this earth, had eather no siblings, or was rich since his birth. If I will ever have kids, my kids will watch kika, where there is no advertising going on. I don't want to have kids who are always wanting something new. If it is out of good quality, then sure. But these toys will never be advertised in this kind of television. To wrap it up, advertising directed towars young people is not that what I want for our world.
