Our society is full of diffrent form of advertising. Youre eye will always meet an advertisment if you go for a walk in, for example, a city. Advertising has become so important to this world, because of its power. Capitalism does not functionate without any form of advertising. But in what way do advertisments affect on us? And espacially how does advertisment shape our thinking and behaviour in a young age through technology, like televison? this questions will be discussed in the following paragraphes.

Advertisments can be helpful. If your watching TV, and an advertisment is comming up, you can see what products on the market and decide if you need them. There might be a porblem with young children watching those. 
Because of their young age, they aren't mature enough to consider if they really need the product who popps up on the TV. Parents may than be confronted with a lot of wishes from their children.
There is also a risk of creating a fake or unhealthy perception of the world watching TV advertisments in a younf age. Young girls will unconsiously save the images of "beautiful", slim and tall girls in ads. Later in life they have the need to become similar to them. 
Children in young age, it they watch TV ads, will be indirectly confronted with our capitalistic system.  
So new generation will be used to this society structure, so the may not have the need to question the bad in this political system.
In my opinion TV ads should not be allowed to yoz
