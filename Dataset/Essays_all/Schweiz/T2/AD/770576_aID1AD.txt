Nowadays television advertising is very commonly used in order to win new customers. However, less often do we actually take the consequences of this type of advertisement into account. Directing television advertising toward young children may have tremendous effects one a child's life. In this essay I will discuss whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. 

First of all it needs to be taken into consideration that television advertisement may influence children's opinion to a very large extent. This is due to the fact that by directing television advertising toward young children they will not only copy certain attitudes and beliefs, but also lose their ability to evaluate and judge significant values and matters. 

Nevertheless, even though television advertising might too strongly influence young children, numerous advertisements can very often enable young children to think critically. Therefore children might become sophisticated analysts who have to decide which advert they like the most. Such skills are very important for the future in terms of becoming an adult, career decisions etc. 

In conclusion, both aspects appear to be of great importance. However, in my opinion television advertismemt do actually harm children's ability to evaluate and judge. Accordingly, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
