Today you can see a four year old child on the playground with his new IPhone and playing games on it. Also there are lots of children at home in front of the television and not outside anymore. That is our new generation growing up with technology. But is it healthy for a child or should it not be allowed for young children to watch television?

On one hand I understand the issues they have with children who are just watching television or are already having an IPhone with four years, especially beacause they are very young. Young children in this age should play with toys or outside on the playground and should make games with their mothers and not with their phone.

On the other hand they can learn something on television. There are plenty of good series for kids for example Dora who learns the children counting or the coulors. Also it has an social aspects. If the other children are allowed to watch television and your child is not, then your child can be excluted. There are also lots of disney films who are for children and who the parents can watch with them. Furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship. 

In my opinion you should find a balance between it. I played often outside in my childhood especially in summer but I also watched television and learnd something from it. Propably you should not allow it to a two year old child but a five year old can defenetly learn something out of it. It is also important that you care. If you do not care about your child watching television they can be in front of a television for hours. Then of course it is not okay.
In conclusion it is every parents own decision how long and if they even want to allow it their children.¨watching television.
