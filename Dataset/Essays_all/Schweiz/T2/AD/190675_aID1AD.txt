When I was a young little boy, I used to watch television at home. I had my series which I liked and enjoyed watching them. But after an episode there often came a short period of adverts. I hated the adverts because on my television channel they used to be very boring and not entertaining. After some time I realised that a few of them have a persuasive way of interacting to me. What happens when a young child gets into this propaganda?

Firstly, the adverts indeed can be a kind of propaganda. So the problem is now that young children can be convinced pretty easily because their minds are a little bit naive. Nevertheless, the adverts can claim something that is not true or they really could implement some lies. In addition, the children could believe those things and start to desire products which they don't really need or they only know and need now, because the advert told them this. 

Secondly, television advertising is able to change reality in the mind of childrens. They start to believe things that can not be true and never will be true. Moreover, this fake reality is also connected with a specific product which the producer shows to the ones who are watching. For example the thesis of Redbull of giving wings to the one who is drinking their product. 

My third point contains the thought that adverts also can be dangerous for children in a diffrent way. Maybe the kids are forced to see sexuality and the use of drugs. This can have bad consequences for the future or their lifestyle. It's possible that they are even shocked and frightened by the adverts. Maybe they can't handle the advert.

In a summary, I am against the television advertising directed toward young children. The propaganda can contain lies, reality could turn into a fake one and in adverts there can be things, a young child should not see.
