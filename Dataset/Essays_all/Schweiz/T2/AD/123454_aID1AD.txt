In our society technology brings big dvantaged on daily bases, but unfortunately there are also many problems. One of the most discussed one is the influence on our children.
On one hand every television serie has the right of free speach. There are certain themes they cant speak about or show us but thats very rare. But they never would have this kind of stuff in series for young children. ALso its the parents decision to let their kids watch a tv serie or tv in general or not. Its also to cosider that these special series for young kids could help them developing certain skills if the producer direct the series at them, they might be really happy and inspired by the stories and pictures they see.
On the other hand is it possible that our little boys and girls get manipulated by economic interests with comercials and series.
In my opinion its a chance and a risk. But if i would be a father I'd have to take the decision myselve if my children watch a serie or not. And i like to make this decision my selve, because of this there is no need for me to  let this statement be regulated by law.
