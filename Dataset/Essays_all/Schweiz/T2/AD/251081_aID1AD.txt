As a child I used to watch a lot of televison. While watching my favourite series like spongebob or Bob the Builder every 10 minutes there were television advertisings. They were annoying but I still watched all of them. Usually the advertisings were about the newest playmobile or the babrie, which didn't interest me though. Suddenly there was an advertisment about a spongebob figure which can talk. I wanted it. I told my paraents about it but they never bought it...It was frustrating. 
Should television advertising directed young childrean be allowed? 

Well the advertors know that childrean are very influencible. If they just show a simple barbie figure a lot of young girls are going to want it. Or if they produce little cars all the boys are gonna tell their parents to buy it for them. And here we have a critical point. The childrean don't think much about the money which their parents are spending for them. The producers of the advertisments could just crave an amount of money for a simple products which should'nt cost more than 3-5 dollars. 
But advertors and producers need to get their money from somewhere.

I think televison advertising should be allowed because of the fact that others alao need a way to get their money. It's not the job of the advertors and producers to take care of childrean
