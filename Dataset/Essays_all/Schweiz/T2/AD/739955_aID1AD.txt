First of all it is necessary to say that television advertising nowadays is really common in our society. Everybody gets used to it, already in young age. It depends on the personality but I would claim that at least every second household has a TV at home. So children rise with television.
On the other hand you could say that advertising in general isn't really necessecary in TV. It just gets on peoples' nerves because they cannot watch the TV-show or movie that they're watching in one piece. Children also don't like the breaks in their movies and I would say that they're also getting bored when there's lot of advertising.
Another reason to allow advertising is that young children mostly are interestet in things that do not take a long time and that are easy to understand. That's the case in advertising. Often it is also made in a funny way or has music in the background which young children enjoy.
The last argument not to allow advertising for young children is because it sometimes shows a fake or a wrong illustration of the real life. So already in young age, children don't see the life how it really is and get influenced by advertising. There are studies which say that advertising does really influence us and how we see our life becuase it shows a perfect world which isn't the truth.
To summarize, there are positiv and negativ aspects in advertising. Often not just for young children but for people in general. In my opinion advertising should be allowed to young children because in our society we are just used to it and it would be kind of difficult to allow it for children above five and not to allow it for the younger ones.
