In the world we live today advertising has a great impact on us. The industry has realized and has already taken advantage of that. What we like, what we dislike, what we agree and what we disagree with is highly influenced by what we see daily. It can influence our childre even easier. Do we want to let our children grow up 

It is difficult to say if advertising towards children should be banned. But it is true that it has a great influence on them. Imagine a kid seeing an advertising on something offending content. If parents do not intervene it might be likely that unconsciously the child becomes familiar with it.

But is it just to take their right of beeing free of choosing their of choosing what they like and what they dislike? In my opinion their likes and dislikes should be influenced by something else than what they ses on TV. Young children do not need to find the newest trends, fashions etc. Responsible parenting forms their opinion much more than some advertising.

However it is impossible to introduce this idea of banning advertisement. Advertising - mostly unconsceously - occurs in our daily lives. I would like to prevent this from happening. Nevertherless I do not think that television advertising has such an influence on children. As a matter of fact, I do not want that my children spend their childhood on television either. My concern is not the advertising but the TV programs thei watch.
