Nowadays television is an object we see in every house. There are programms for adults, children and even for babys. The television is also an item that is a good use for marketing. There are hardly channels that don't have advertising. Even children can admire the beautiful toys they can buy at the next supermarket. Now does this sort of television advertising for young children be banned? 

On the one hand those advertisings will affect the kids social lives. They can talk about for example the toys they saw on TV with their friends. The fact that kids can have a chat with each other about interests they have in common, will support their social life. This advertising will sort of increase the communication between kids, because they rather talk about toys, than adults do about politics for instance. 

On the other hand this advertisings can have a big inluence on the children. Young kids aged two to five can hardly denie the feeling of wanting something. If they see an attractive toy, they want to have it and they will tell heir parents to buy it. Of course then it's the parents job if they'll buy the toy ore not, but the kids will learn this procedure of seeing a toy on TV and telling their parents to buy it, so they will sort of learn that they can have something just by watching TV and not buy for example accomplishing something.

In my opinon the television advertising for kids should not be allowed, because the industries are taking advantage of the young children by showing of their toys in the most attractive way, so their incoms will increase as high as possible. As I already sad children can't choose between wanting something and acually needing it.
