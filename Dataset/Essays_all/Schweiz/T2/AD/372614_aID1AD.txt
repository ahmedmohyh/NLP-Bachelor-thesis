Television advertising toward young children.

Young children are learning a lot. In early years they basically pick up everything they see and it stays in their memorys. So, is it really a good idea to let children watch advertisements on television?

As told before young children learn very cuickly and especially; when it comes to languages. 
So hearing lot's of speaking would possibly help them with getting more confortable with speaking their language. 

Depending on the education they receive of their parents, children can be tought, that they won't get everything they want from seeing all the advertisements. For example when a child sees lots of advertisements of toys and it want's them all, it is the parents task to not buy them everything. 

Buying the children all the things they see in the advertisement, leads them to be spoiled and you later may recognize that as a bad side of their characters. 

An advertisement, that shows stupid content can also influence children in a bad way. They can't decide yet what is true and what is wrong, so they may believe wrong content, which wont help them when it comes to education.

In my opinion letting children watch advertisements isn't the best thing for them. Watching television in general has to be done in the right measure. If they spend to much time in front of the television they wont learn some really important things, like knowing the nature.
I am lucky that my parents always told me to brush my teeth during the advertisement, shown in the serie i always watched before sleeping.
