Actually, the advertising for products which are concepted for these young children is not for these young children, it's for their parents. The children can't buy the products anyway, because they're too young and don't have any money or anything. So why would someone say that this type of advertising should be banned?
I have two ideas: Either, the children shouldn't see these advertised products, because the parents will get annoyed by them wanting all the new stuff they saw in the television advert, or the children should be raised without having to watch all these dumb adverts because they may influence them in a bad way.
But I think, these two reasons are both bad, because if you are a parent not wanting your children to be influenced by all these adverts, you should just stop them from watching tv advertising, it's very simple. 
There are many strange things being advertised in the televsion nowadays, and it would be unfair if firms who make toys and other stuff for young children would be banned from tv but all these perverted dating sites have no trouble at all. The advertising is for the parents anyways, because the children can't buy anything in the first place, so why ban something that harmless (or if not harmless, that easy to avoid) as advertising for children in a world with so many much more fucked up things? 
I Think, this question is of no importance, seeing so many much more horrible things going on on the planet than advertising for young children...it's like comparing a death of a close friend to a spilled cup of tea.
