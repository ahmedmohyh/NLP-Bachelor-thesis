In todays society mostly every familiy watches regular television. It's not unusual that young children are also there watching. So why shouldn't be these companies be allowed to send advertisment directed directly to these young children.
First I want to say that the parents have to watch their children. This means that they have to figure out if the program and ads are harming their children. If so they must switch the channel or better let those kids play outside. 
But if the parents can't stay with their kids checking what kind of programmms come. Then we should take into account that those small kids can't yet figure out if thos adverts are misleading. So those kids are unprotected strayed to those companies. This means that those companies can influence the evolution of their personality. For sure we don't have to think now about a society like in brave new world but it can be dangerous.
I am a supporter of the free market so i think the best is if we let the companys do whatever they want. Because the custommer in the end can chose if he will buy the product and consume it.
