More and more companies use television advertising to speak directly to their audience: Young children aged two to five. They want to spread their products for childs and influence them. But is this a legit method to sell more product? Should television advertising toward young children not be allowes?
Critics say that there is always a free market, even in advertising. For this reason, companies should also be free to make advertising to young people. Another point is that with ads speaking to the children, they can also learn something about business that really concern them. Otherwise, they just see ads for adults, which they propably don't understand. When watching TV, they get into a world that made from adults for adults, and that may propably influence their innocent childhood negatively.
Supporters of a ban have opposite strong arguments. They say that children in this age are too young to have an own opinion. If they now see an advertising where something is promoted as a incredibly good and cool thing, they automatically want it, even it's nothing they could use or have pleasure on. If children now want such a product, it's hard for parents to deny it. This decreases parent's autority, when there is another force (next to the parents) that tells the children what to do.
In my opinion, this sort of advertising should be prohibited, as it may harm a child's own world which is to protect with all available forces. It is better to speak to parents when there is to sell a product for children, because they have the risk for their children and they are old enough to decide, if they want to buy a product for their sons and daughters or if they better leave it.
