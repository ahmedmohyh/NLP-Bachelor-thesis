Children should not get in touch with televisions too soon. A television is nothing good at all, it is a waste of time. That does not mean, that I do not watch TV in my spare time. But you do not have to start in your early ages, if you do so you will most likely get used to it. But there are a lot of other things you could do in your young ages, which you will not do if your grown up. Parents should help their children to have a happy childhood. That means for example motivate your child to go out and play with friends. I think that this is importent for the development of the personality. A child has a lot of power avaiable, and it should make use of it. If you are sitting in fornt of the television you do not move. This could lead to overweight. As we all know there is a big chance that people with overweight get diabetes. This is very tragic because those people have this illness for the rest of their lifes. In america there are a lot of people diagnosed with diabetes type 1. This type of diabetes you get from eating food with big amounts of sugar and fat in it. If you do have bad eating habbtis and you do not move enough, because you are sitting in front of the TV you will become overweight or you even might get diabetes.
