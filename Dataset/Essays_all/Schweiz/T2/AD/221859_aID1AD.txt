From my point of view thia atatement is absolutly true and I don't see a way where it's not true. I'm positive that EVERY SINGLE ON OF US has seen an advertisement on tv they absolutely loved and we all tried to convince our parents to buy it. 

Let's be honest people, the stuff in advertisment just looks so good, and if your a child you still believe everyone is good and that santa still exists and nobody is ever lying. To be blunt, no 17 boy plays with children toys, they're probably at home playing their video games. But if a young bay sees someone who's older and in theri eyes cooler and they do awesome tricks like jumping over fences and stuff they want to do that to. And every child wants to have the coolest toys and show it to their friends. 

A friendly advice, don't buy toys over the internet, it's almost all the time a fraud and your children will stop playing with it after a week anyways.
