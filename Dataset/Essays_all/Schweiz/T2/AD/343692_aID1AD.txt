Televison advertising influences people who watch televison much. And as we all know kids are even easier to influence because they are young, naiv and can not decide if the commercial they watch is true or not. So out of the perspective of an advertisier televison advertising directed towards young children is very effective, because they can sell more and earn more money. But does not the moral suffer?
Maybe the kids watch a commercial while a film break about an ice cream. They want that ice crem but do not know that it might look different because of photoshop. They tell theire partens to buy it and maybe they even do it because they want theire kids to be happy. Then the children are depressed because the ice cream looks different and maybe does not taste as good as advertised. Or even worse: they watch a commercial like "how to get thiner - just drink these smoothies twice a day", so they learn that they should be thin and drink these drinks. That could have a serious future effect, maybe when they are in theire teens. They think they should lose weight and remember the many commercial they have seen in the age of a toddler. 
In my opinion televison advertising directed toward young cildren should not be allowed because kids are too young to get influences that much in a bad way. But I thinke parents have to educate theire children too. They can tell them that commercials are often lies and that they have to keep attention if they want to buy something.
