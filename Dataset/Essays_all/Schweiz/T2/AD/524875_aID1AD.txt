Advertising on Television directed to young children has become a common thing in todays media. Companies try to sell their products by making children want them so they ask their parents who can't say no. Some people argue that there is a problem when it comes to taking advantage of young children in the world of advertising.

In my opinion this form of advertising is not really a big problem. Parents have to be able to say no and if they can not do this it is not the advertiser's fault. If I was a parent and my child would want me to buy a bad product  I would simply say no even if this might make my child sad or angry. Children usually forget things just as fast as they decide that they need a certain product.

In addition to this the advertising towards little children only makes up a minor part of the world of advertising. People should be more concerned about advertising directed to teenagers. This age group is more vulnerable because they actually have the money to buy the products. So by doing advertisment in this section compnies cause harm to young people's wallets. For example a five year old cant buy itself a nice dress or t-shirt but a fifteen year old is capable of doing so.

So in conclusion I would say that this advertising towards young children is not a big deal because it does not really do harm to the children. It only turns into a problem if parents are not strong enough to say no but you can't blame the companies for trying to take advantage of those parents.
