The discussion is about the american voting system and whether it is reliable or not. The text says that it would be best to implement a computerized voting system. One point he makes in favour of a computerized system is that with the traditional voting system there is a lot of space for errors. Firstly people might vote for the wrong candidate because they do not see very well and might therefore check the wrong name. But even if they chose the right name there is still the possibility, that the official counting the votes makes mistakes. The presentation conters that a computerized system might also bring problems with it regarding the voting, because some people can not handle computer technology or just do not like it, which could lead them to refrain from voting. As to the counting of the votes, the problem there is that even though a computer program does not make mistakes, it may contain some, which could have a fatal outcome. The author of the texts arguments that we already put our trust in computer technology every day, but this technology is used every single day and is always improved, so it is no wonder that it runs smoothly. And lastly if a mistake is made by an official counting votes everything has to be recounted, which is annoying, if however a computer makes a mistake you may not be able to recount anything, seeing as there are no physical voting ballots.
