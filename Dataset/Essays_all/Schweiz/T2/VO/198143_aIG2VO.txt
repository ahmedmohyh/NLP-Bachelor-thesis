In this eassy I've to describe the difference of the points for and against the computerized voting. First I'll tell you something about the handling with computers and the second point will be about the human/computer errors. 

Both are speaking about the computerized voting system in the world(US). The problem, which the presentation claims is, that for young people, who knows how to use a computer it would be more efficient to vote. But for older people, who didn't use the computer in there daily life, it would cause much more errors because they really don't know how the use the trackpad and other things. But the text says that for people with bad eyesight the traditionally way to vote with the huge ballot is much more complicated than to vote on a computer on which it's clear for who you vote because they can easily mark the wrong name. 

Another problem, which is mentioned in the presentation is the problem of the errors in a computer. On the one hand it's true that if a computer make an error, it would remove or change thousands of votes. On the other hand how many times do a computer have made a mistake in the history?
The text assume that if a human make a mistake it isn't a huge problem because it would change only a few votes, which are in this capacity wouldn't change a whole election.

To sum up, you can say with the digitalization it's important to change the sytem on a computer based level because more people today knows how to use a computer than ten years ago and it would be much more efficient and correctly.
