The text and the listening tape cover different oppinions. The text is encouraging to start using the new system based on technology in the entire country rather than going on with the traditional way. It says that humans are a lot more likely to make mistakes than computers, for example whilst counting the ballots or by accidentally voting for the wrong candidate. With our knowledge in technology which we use every day even in delicate situations like banking and which are reliable it should also be possible to vote this way and to avoid such mistakes. 

On the other hand, the listening tape mentions reasons why the traditional way of voting is the better way. Even if it would be easier to vote for people who are used to work with computers, there are many people who don't know how to use them and they might even get scared and stop voting at all. There's also an other argumentation to the point about us using modern technology in our everyday life. While the systems we use a lot get improved constantly so they can match our standards, voting only happens every two years and so there wouldn't be much space to improve the system and to make it reliable so there might even be more errors than by letting humans count the ballots.
