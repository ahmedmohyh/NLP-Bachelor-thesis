Voting is a very important thing. In the presentation it's the question: Do we have to vote in another way that we vote now? Maybe by the computer. Many people use the computer every day, so this is an argument that we better vote with a computer. But what would do people who can't use a computer, maybe the old generation? Our grandparents? What would do the people who have a missing know-how? Computer are made by people, so people can make mistakes in programmizing a computer. The computer is used in different ways, for example in banks or in school. We use it daily. But a voting is once a year. So the traditional voting is better than a voting on the computer, because computers can make errors, like the people who programmize computers.
In the text is is the other way around. Critics say that the voting systems in the United States are inifficient. They would like the traditional systems to be replaced with a computerized voting because this would be more trustworthy. Critics say that voters usually have to find the name of their candidate on a sheet and so they often choose the wrong candidate. So a computerized voting system woult be better and it's easily taken. The vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers. This would be ever better than the voting system today.
I personally like the text more than the presentation. The traditional voting system is fine, but we live in a modern world full of technology. So I think it would be better when we would have a modern system, so we can vote on a computer. This would be better for everyone. The older generation would learn to use a computer and the younger generation can vote easily.
