The lecturor mentions that there may be problems with the national voting system in the United States, however, introducing computers will not necessarily solve these problems. First, not everybody can afford a computer and many people are not used to them. Therefore, they might be afraid to vote with a computerized machine. In the text it is argued that people make mistakes, whereas computers are much more accurate. Nevertheless, machines are programmed by humans and according to the lecturor in banking transactions for example has been a need of improvement since it first was introduced. He is convinced that there will be a lack of trust in the technology since there are not many elections. Another point is that computers would make it impossible to recount, if a mistake happened. The computers would not record the votes but only count them and there would still be an expensive recount to be made.
