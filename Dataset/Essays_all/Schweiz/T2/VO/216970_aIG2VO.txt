While the text above is completely sure about our technology and believes it would be better if everyone has to vote online, said the speaker it wouldn't be like that. Sure it is not a problem for someone who uses the modern technology on a daily base or just reguraly. But imagine our old people, or people who can't afford a computer. Either they can't vote or they are discourraged to vote because they have no idea how to vote anymore. Sure, as the text says, mistakes can happen easily by marking the wrong name or if the officials make an error by counting the votes one by one. But after all, the computer programm is a technolgy made by humans. So it is almost inevitable to avoid mistakes for the first times they count elections, because every computer progmramm has to be developed until it's perfect. And because an election doesn't happen that often people don't really have time to handle msitakes that could be impossible to handle.
