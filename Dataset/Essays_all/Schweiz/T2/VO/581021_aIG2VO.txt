The question that's asked in both the txtand the speach is, if current voting systems should be replaced by more efficient computerized methods. To answer that question it is neccessary to make sure if those computerized systems really are superior than the traditional method. One of the strongest argument might be, that computes shall not make any mistakes in opposition to humans. But on the other hand these machines are obviously programmed by humans, so they could have mistakes in ther programming which would have much heavier effects on the result of the vote than singele counting mistakes made by a human beeing. 
A further argument for the automatised system is, that it is easier to handle and for that people make less mistakes using the modern technology. But we also needto see, that this argument always comes from poeple who know to handle a computer and it does not integrate older people who do not have experiance in using computers, so it might be possible that those persons even make more mistakes with the computer than with the traditional voting system. For conclusion it is important to test such a system intensivley to make sure that there are no errors in the programm and people have to get fammiliar with the new methodes. Before that has not happened these systems do not need to be more efficient than counting votes by hand.
