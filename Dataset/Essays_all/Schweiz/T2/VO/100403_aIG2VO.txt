People say the voting system in the United States is not good enoughh and has to be replaced however some people think we should just leacve it as it is. In the listening it was said that if we used computers to register votes it would be a lot harder for poor people and people that don't use computers in their everyday life. They are afraid of the technology and because they don't know how to use the computers they can easily give a wrong vote. This is the complete opposite of what was said in the text because they said that the traditional voting with the ballot made ltos of mistakes. There are to many names and they are so small it is easy to mark the wrong name especially for old people. Voting with a computer would be easier because you can vote with one touch and it is possible to make the names bigger and more readible for old people.
In the presentation it was also said that the computerized systems also made errors because they are programmed by people so the human error is also in the programms and if the programms made errors they would be much worse than when someone miscounted one vote. Also it is easy to recount a vote after a mistake for a human but it would be impossible with a computer. On the otherhand the text said that humans make a lot of errors and these can be cut down if we used computer programms because they don't miscount votes. Also it is done very quickly and automatically.
Finally during the presentaion it was said that computerized programs used for banks and other transactions are used on a daily basis and they had to be adjusted a lot in the beginning due to many errors. However voting systems will not  be used often so it is clear that they will still have a lot of mistakes. The text said the opposite because a computerized voting system would be easy and we use these systems all the time and they contain private information like our bank account numbers and so on.
