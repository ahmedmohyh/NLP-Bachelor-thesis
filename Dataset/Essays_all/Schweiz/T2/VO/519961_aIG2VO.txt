In the essay that I listend to before states, that digital voting would not only have the same problems than voting by marking a name on sheets full of names, but also could turn people of entirely from voting if they aren't familiar with computers. They would make mistakes and vote for the wrong person but if the digital voting seems to be too difficult  for them, they won't even try to vote. The text states that digital voting would make voting much more easy because the people with poor eyesight could let the names be magnified to better see them. This would in theory decrease the amount of misvotes.
The second point made in the essay is that computers are a manmade structure and therefor contain human errors as well and they would have a much bigger impact on the result than a few miscounted ballots when the counting of the votes is done by hand. The text says the opposite, that computers could count much more efficient than humans. If humans miscount, an expensive and lenghtfy recount has to be done.
The last point made in the essay is that voting in America only happens once or twice in a year. Would it be neccesary to develop a safe digital voting system for this few times. Because of the possible human errors in the system, thousands of votes could be left out of the counting or could even be removed entirely from the record. The text states that we trust complicated computer programs to transmit highly sensitive information or to do perfectly accurate banking transactions.
