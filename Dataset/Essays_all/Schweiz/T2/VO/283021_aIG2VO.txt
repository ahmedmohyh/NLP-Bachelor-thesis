First of all, the lecturer agreed with the text in the point that traditional voting systems don't always work out satisfyingly. But while the text states that computerized voting machines would make the whole voting process easier than with the ballot, the lecturer argues that people who don't own a computer or who are just not used to using them would be happy with a computerized voting system. A lot of people could be discouraged out of their fear of technology.
The text also points out the human error of miscounting of the votes: "Officials have to deal with thousands of ballots, it is almost unevitable that they will make mistakes." It says that a recount would be long and expensive. In the lecturer's opinion, it is also possible that human error occurs in computer programs and they would cause a lot more damage. If something went wrong, a recount wouldn't be possible at all, according to her.
And closing with the last statement, the lecturer agrees that governments and individuals trust other computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as the communication of highly sensitive information but emphasizes on the fact that these systems are used daily and have been improved multiple times before and while using them, while the voting technologies would only come into action every two years in the USA. Therefore a lot more time would be needed to improve them than for the other daily-used systems.
