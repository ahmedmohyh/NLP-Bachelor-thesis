In the lecture the speaking person is more on the contra side for the change of the voting system. One of the point the speaker especially pointed out, was that computer can also make mistakes which can be even worse then the errors made by counting every single vote. Another mahjor problem is that the programmes for the electronic counting system is also programmed by humans and if an error accures in the human made configuration, the consequences will be even more influenceable and will lead to misscounting as well as the traditional voting. In addition to that is it not even possible to make a recount with the computerized voting. Another factor which difference them and what the speaking person is mentoning, is that not everyone is used to work with new technologies. Indeed most people are acttually used to work with newer technologies, but on the other hand there are also people who can not even afford a computer which causes even more mistakes made by the voters. At the end the speaker mentions a last point in which they are different from eachother, which is that the computerized system is not used as often as they say it is in the text. Elections are only every four years, so there is no time to get used to the system.
