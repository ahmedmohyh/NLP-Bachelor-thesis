We heard an auio file and read a text about the votingsystem of the US. Now the question is, what are the differences and what are the arguments they used. 
Those two sources are both talking about about voting, the counting of votes and especially the mistakes which cn be made. The main these of the text is, that voting by hand or on the paper is not that good because humans make a lot of mistakes. Maybe they mark the worng person or the votes are counted wrong and they add, that the votingsystem in the US is iefficient. On the other hand, the audio says, that voting by computer is not better because computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. Maybe thousands of votes will be miscounted because of the computer or too many people vote at the same time so the technic crashs. They added that not everyone has the mony to buy a computer and not ehery human can deal with it. Maybe it works good at bank systems but there they are used to it and it has been tested for quite a long time.  

To summarise the arguments you can say the difference of those two sources are,that the text is writing about the disadvantage of the old voting system of the US and the audio source is talking about the disatventage of voting on the comuter. This leads to the thing which is the same. Both are talking about disadvenateg of voting systems.
