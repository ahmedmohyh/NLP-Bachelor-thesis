Elections are a very important part of policy. So everyone want's them to work the best and easiest way possible. There are different possibilities of electing as voting on paper or voting online. But in which one should we trust? 
Humans can commit faults, that's true. But computers, which are programmed by humans, can do faults to if you don't program them correctly. The woman arguing towards voting on paper thinks, that it's a lot less grave if someone counts one vote wrong. A fault in a program can be so much worse and there are more votes affected than just one. It's easy to use computers for banking, but e-banking is much more improved because it's used every day. Elections happen every two years and so there's no guaranty that everything actually works out the way we want it to. Also, not everyone knows how to use a computer, some aren't even able to afford one while almost everyone is able to write and read. The text says it's hard for people with poor eyesight to read all the names correctly. But to be honest, they're also capable to read the newspaper, why shouldn't they be able to take their time reading all those names, maby with glasses or sth.? 
To avoid very grave counting faults it's easier to trust human skills and let them count the votes. One or two wrong votes don't affect a candidature, while computer systems can be hacked or delete all votes completely by accident. But as time passes, we will all have to learn to work with computers more often and they will get improved and be a even bigger part of our lives, so let's see what the future elections look like!
