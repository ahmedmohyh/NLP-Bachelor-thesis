In the lecutre they said that humans can miscount the ballots but these mistacks are overviewable and you can recount it because you have the papers. Also they say that computer programs are programmed by humans so it's possible that they have an error. If there are errors in these programm then they would have an even bigger effect on the result and there aren't any recounts possible because you don't have a paper record of it. It sais that computerized voting is good for people who are used to computers but there are people who don't know how to use a computer and people not having one. In the text they just say that the computerized voting machines are an easy-to-use touch-screen technology and it's better for people with poor eyesight than they old system so they don't accidently mark the wrong name. In the lecture they have the argument that computer programs need to be improved often and need to be tested over a long period of time so they're hardly sufficant you can see that in the baking transaactions because these programs exist know for a long time but untile they we're as good as they're know it took a long time. The argument against that in the texis in that we already trust other complex computer technology every day and it's fine.
