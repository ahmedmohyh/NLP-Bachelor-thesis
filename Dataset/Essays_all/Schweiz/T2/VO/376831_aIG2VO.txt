The woman, who spoke in the presentation mentioned, that some older people are not used to use computers. So they could be disturbed and confused by a new technological voting system, they could easely touch the wrong name on the screen. The text resists this statement and says itself, that the names of the candidates are often very small written, if they are printed on a sheet of paper, but on the screen you would just need to touch the candidates name, which is written quite bigger. The text also stated, that humans make mistakes by counting the votes on the papers, while the computer seems to work pefect. But the woman in the presentation resisted and said herself, that a votingprogram for computers is developped by humans and if they make a programming mistake it doesn`t affect just one vote, but all votes, which is far more grave than counting it out by hands.
