Both the text and the lecture compared the traditional voting system with the computerized one. Whereas in the text pointed out, that the traditional way of counting votes has some inconveniences, in the lecture the computerized way was critized. 
The text says, that with the traditional way to vote humans with bad eyesight or in general pick the wrong candidate as they wanted, but in the computerized way this can not happend because they just need to tap on the name of their prefered candidate. Computerized voting machines make hardly any mistakes, whereas it is in the nature of a human to make mistakes. People are counting the votes and this has led to inaccurancy which would not happen with a computerized voting machine. 
However, in the lecture it says, that errors made by computers result in a huge mess wich can not be fixed easily. A recount is impossible. Computer programmes are made by humans so why can not the programmers have made mistakes? Not all people are used to technology and a big number of people have fear of technology nowadays so the chance, that people vote less their wrong candidates is not diminuing it could even get bigger.
