The text and the listening were about computerized voting. Critics say that it should have a changement in voting. They want to vote through a computer. They say that this might be better, because so there would be less wrong votes. There are a lot of people with poor eyesight that can easily mark the wrong name of a candidate, because the space between the names is not that big. By voting through a computer, they can just touch the name on a touch-screen. 
The others say, that this might not be fair for everyone. There are a lot of people that are used to computers, but also many that do not use them at all. These people might be in trouble. So there could be the chance that they may also give a wrong vote because they do not understand what they should do.

Another argument of the critics was, that while counting the ballots, there might be some mistakes in counting, and that they then have to recount all the ballots one by one. A computer would remove the possibility of human error, because the counting is done very quickly and by the computer itself. The others say, that we must not forget, that computers are made by humans and that there might also be mistakes. If the computer crashes down, you do not have anything left, with a ballot you would have the ballot left.
