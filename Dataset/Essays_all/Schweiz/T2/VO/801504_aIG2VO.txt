Voting with the computer has some fundamental problems. For example it is only useful for people who are used to it. Many other people are too old or have not enough money.As a consequence they not couraged to go voting. In the text they say that many mistakes are made by old people because they can not see the names and the system with the computer is easy to understand, so everybody will be capable to vote. Like humans, computers can also make mistakes. But the conseqences are much worse, if the mistakes are made by a computer. But compared to the text, people make mistakes during voting and counting where mistakes are inevitable. On the other hand there are no records of the votes made by the computer. Also important is the fact, that voting is done very rarely not like banking with the computer, where there have been done a lot of improvements. On the opposite the text says without giving it a try, we will not trust those technologies.
