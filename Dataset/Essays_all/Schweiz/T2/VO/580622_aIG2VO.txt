Committing mistakes on counting ballots is normal. Every human makes mistakes, but why should we trust because of that the technology? The technology is programmed of humans, and if they will do mistakes while programming them, 100000 of votes could be misscounted. A fact is that the computer reduce te probability of misscounting votes.So the result will be more exact.It's also difficult for the persons using this computers that have never used one because they don't have enough money to buy one, aren't used to it or just have fear of technology. In the new voting system it will be self explainig how to vote, because you just have to toch a screen and that will make it more easier to find the name of the chosen candidate.So it will be much easier for the persons who have a poor eyesight. The technological system of the bancs are just so developed because they are used every day, but the voting machine will be use once or twice a year, so the efficience will be bad.
