Some people want to vote in the future with the computer since the traditional voting system is inefficient when a closley contested election occurs. It is discussed whether a computer is trustworthier than a human being when it comes counting to the election papers. Humans make mistakes and so do computer, because they were initially created by men. If an error in programm occurs the mistake would be a lot worse and thousends of votings would be lost. For the traditinal counting, the human can recount again. Another point of the subject is that many people have bad eyesight and would vote by mistake. A touch-screen computer is suggested where the civilian can click on the candidate's name. Who says it would be easy for people who are not used to technology to vote? The situation would probably remain the same, only that the group of people having trouble switched. We use technology on a daily basis for calculating money and communicating, what shows us how much humans trust computers. Since we use it so often they became more flawless. The voting-system would not be used as that often and therefore we should not trust the new system so easily.
