Although traditional voting systems are far from perfect it is absolutely not sure that comouterized voting systems really would do a better job. It is said that especially people with poor eyesight often mark the wrong name on the ballot. But because most of these people mostly belong to older generations it is likely that they would make even more mistakes with computerized voting machines because many of them aren`t used to computers or it could even fully prevent them from voting beyause they are afraid of technology. Also, human errors can not only happen with traditional vote-counting, because after all computers are also programmed by humans and a small mistake in the computerized system could probably much more serious, than in traditional voting systems because it could lead to a much bigger number of results being falsified and there would be no physical source of the original votes available. And finally, a computerized voting system must be tested often and revised and this wouldn`t be really possible because votings are too rare.
