Whether the traditional or a new voting system in the United States of America is better and leads to less mistakes is hard to say. The current traditionl voting system is pretty ineffiicient and leads to inaccurate countig of votes while the computerized voting system removes the possibility of human errors. But critics say that there is still a huge amount of people who are not used to the modern computerized system because they don`t use them on a regular base, can`t effort a computer or another technical advise or even just fear the new technology. On the other hand there is always a big risk that people accidently vote for the wrong person because they mark the wrong name caused by their poor eyesight. The traditional voting system relys on people who count the votes by hand and as we all know there is a big number of long and expensive recounts which had been necessary because of a detected error. While the computerized system removes the possibility of those human errors. Some might say that computer programms need to be improved several times before we can rely on them and there is also a possibility that these programms might be inefficent because they are also programmed by humans who can make mistakes while creating such a computer preogramm. After all it will probably still take some time until there are trustworthy computerized voting systems and until people get used to all the technology. But before that happens we need to improve our current voting system as good as we can.
