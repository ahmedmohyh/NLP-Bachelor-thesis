The first point the woman is making states, that computerized voting may seem easy for many, but that is by far not the case for everybody. What about the people who can't afford a computer or don't use it on a regular basis. They could easyily cast a vote wrong, so what the woman is saying directly opposes the text which talks about no casting mistakes occurring with a computer vote. Following to that she makes an even bigger statement arguing that behind every computer programm is a human to, so that doesn't exclude humans errors. While humans may count a ballot or two wrong mistakes made by the computer can be far worse, not counting thousands of votes for example. Responding to the argument made in the text, that we trust computer programms in highly sensitive informations such as in banking transactions, she argues that these programms made a lot of mistakes in the beginning but now after a long time they  work. Having in mind that there is only a voting on a national basis every other 2 years and it would be a new program having to work perfectly fine on its first occurrance mistakes by the computer programm would be dreadful and very likely to happen.
