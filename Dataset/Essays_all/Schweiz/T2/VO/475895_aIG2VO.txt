Which voting system is the better one? Should we use computers or should we stick with the traditional system. 
Each system has adventages and disadventages. 
First of all we can say that we are now in a century in which technology is very important. We use computers daily and in every situation. So why do not we use it for the voting system too? With a computer many human mistakes could be removed. Another point is that this system would be easier for many people because the technology and the use are very easy. A system like this could count the votes much faster then the human. 
But there is an other side too. There are many people who can not use a computer or are not able to afford one. They are afraid of technology and computers. It would be very hard for them to use a computer for voting. We also have to mention that an error in a computer system would have a bigger effect then a human mistake in counting. A recount would be impossible in such a voting system. This is a really big problem and perhaps the reason why we have not used computers until now.
