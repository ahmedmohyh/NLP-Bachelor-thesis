Still there are many people country-wide who have no knowledge about compouters. They have no clue how to handle the computer system, respectively what they have to do. How should they be able to vote accurately? As people might today have problems to mark the right candidate, people might have problems using the computer correctly.
However, those small human errors make up a few votes allover the country. Of course ther are other human errors, for example in counting the votes. But also a computers make errors, errors that can be far more drastic than the ones humans make. And, computers are programmed by error making humans. This could lead to far more serious problems then we nowadays. A computer could change, lose, or count incorrectly thousands and thousands of votes. 
However, still if an error is detected, a recount is impossible as votes have to be deleted for due to anonymitiy. Isn't an expensive recount still better than no recount?
Of course is our life today heavily based on computer-based systems we rely on. But we have to remeber that we use those systems daily, more or less error free. Remember how long after the introduction of new systems errors are still occuring, sometimes errors with drastic affects for mankind.¨
In the USA votes are collected only once per two years nationalwide, not every day. So, how should errors be detected or corrected?
Should we really replace a traditional system by a system we can't fully trust?
