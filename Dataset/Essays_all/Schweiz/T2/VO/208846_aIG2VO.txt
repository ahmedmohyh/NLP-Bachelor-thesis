While the text promotes computerized voting, the lecture does not support the idea of voting becoming computerized. The text argues that people with poor eyesight can sometimes not see which candidate they are voting for and might make a mistake. The lecture on the other hand argues that people who are not used to computers could not even use the voting machines if it was computerized or make mistakes by doing so. 
The text makes a point by arguing that there are tons of electronical systems Americans trust every day and ask why some people refuse to implement yet another electorical sysmem into their life. In the opinion that is shown in the text, human errors in counting the ballots could be evaded. The lecture shows a different point of view. Human errors could be fatal when programming an electronical voting system and recounts would not be possible.
