Critcics say that the current voting system in the US is to inefficient and lead to inaccuracte counting of the votes. In the current voting system the votes need to be counted up by humans  one by one. This often leads to mistake because making errors is in the human nature. Also it is a long process and not efficient. 

The solution would be a modern, technologic voting system with computers. People also trust in computerprogramms in the deals of money and banks. Why not when voting? The Voters would need to cast their vote on a computer screen. The votes would be counted up fast and without mistakes. As long as there is no mistake in the programm wich is the firt critic of the woman's presentation. 

Because the programm is also made by a humans there could be a mistake in the programm wich would be a much worde deal because you wouldnt be able to d a recount. it could also be discouraging for people of old age or computer unexperienced people. It could even lead to people not voting at all because of fear. When comparing the voting system to a bank system the woman said that the banking system was is used daily. For years it has been improved upon because in the beginning there were also mistakes. Becasue voting is only once every two years in the US, there isn't room for mistaked or time to be improved upon.
