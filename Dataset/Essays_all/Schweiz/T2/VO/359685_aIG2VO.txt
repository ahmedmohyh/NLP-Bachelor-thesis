The voting systems are currently doubted a lot, since Donald Trump has won the US presidential vote in 2016. This article however isn't about representatives making the vote unfair, but takes the ballot system and its fairness into consideration. The Article mentiones that there are a lot of errors made by humas, while filling out or counting the ballots. Thus they proposed an online voting system, where everyon can give their votes by solely klicking at the name of teir favorised candidate. Especially people with poor eyesight would profit from that system because they could magnify the names of the candidates and read them thoroughly. The real question should be thouhg, wether the internet is trustwothy enough. The lecture on the other hand presume that mistakes made by computerprogramms will be a lot worse, than those made by humans. They try to show this by claming that ballot-counters only miss a few votes, while a wrongly written computerprogramm would create totally wrong results. They add that a recount would not be possible, because there would be no way to see the real results, if the computer made a mistake. In the end the lecturer predicted, that it would take a great amount of time to develop a safe enough onlinesystem that would work. She thinks that it will take at least as much time to make this voting possible as it took develop flawless e-banking. The future of voting systems is open but in my opinion we should try to take voting into the age of communication technology.
