The text is describing more faults about the voting system of today. It's a traditional and old system, where votes are counted by humans one by one so there can be some faults at counting them. To that there are some people who vote accidentaly for the wrong person so there are faults too. The text is showing a new idea of a voting system, which could be more efficient because everything is happenning on computers. Other People in the text are saying that a new technologie of voting would be too complicated for some people but on the other hand people nowadays are using and trusting computers and other technologic things more than ever.
In the Audio a woman is talking about the disadvantages of a new voting system and that it is better to have our traditional voting system. She said that some people can't affort a new computer or that some people never worked with computers so they'll get confused by voting on computers. To that computers itself are programmed by humans, so if someone who programmed a computer made a fault there will be a bigger error than in the old voting system. Today a fault would be that someone has counted a vote twice or has forgotten a vote, but a computer with an error would forget thousands of votes or count them twice or more.
