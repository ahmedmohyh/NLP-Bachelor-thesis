The voting in the US is done by hands. Every person in America fills out a sheet of paper with their personal vote on it. The new voting system would bedone by computer. The problem with the computers is, that even they are used every day, they don't exist for a long time. It's still an expensiv gatchet so not everyone has one or knows how to use one. Because of that those people would struggle with the voting. Another point is, that a computer programm is made by man and man can make mistakes. So if there would be an error in the voting system all the votes would get lost. Also it's hard to improve something, that is only used once a year. 

The old voting is also made by man. So an human error is possible too. If someone makes a mistake in counting the votes they have to recount all of them. The difference just is, that in the old voting system the votes can't get lost in compare to the new one.
