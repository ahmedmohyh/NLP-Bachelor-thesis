The voting system causes a lot of discussions. 
Especially, when it's about, if they should stop to count the votes by human and let it do the computer. ¨

Some people say, that the computer would have a lot of benefits.
Sometimes people make mitstakes because they have a poor eyesight, and so they sometimes mark a wrong name. In the computer-system, which is build with an easy-to-use-touchscreen technology, this would not happen.
Something what would also not happen, would be the human errors by counting the votes. The computers in contrast would remove the possibility of human error, and it would be a lot quicker.

But is that really true?
Would the computer be a better solution? 
There are some athor voices, which are convinced, that the answer on this question is "NO".
Yes a computer may seem easy to handle with. But what is with the people, who are not used to an computer? What is with the people, who don't have a computer and can't afford it?
And is it really true, that a computer doesn't make any mistake. Because when you say human make mistakes, then it could be that in the computer, which is produced by humans, is a mistake as well. And in this part a mistake in the programm, would have a bigger consquence, than when an official would count one wrong name.
