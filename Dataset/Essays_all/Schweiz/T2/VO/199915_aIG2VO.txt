Seconed, are we realy sure computers don't make any mistakes? They are programmed by humans and with the argument from before, people make mistakes. Fore sure also bankes and other important institutes use computers, but that will not say the system for voting won't have any mistake. At the beginning of using, also financial systems had mistakes. But because we use them so regularly, programmers had many time to impruve it. But because we vote only twice a year, we won't finde problems so fast, so there can be many mistakes and we don't even recognise.
