In the paragraph the traditional voting is critisized for it's inaccuracy due to accidentally voting for the wrong person. In the lecture the woman was clearly neglecting this thought because in her opinion there are many people who can't afford computers, aren't therefore used to computers and also have a fear of technology. This will result in a high tendency for errors with computerized voting systems. 
In the above text the critisism is directed towards people counting the votes, which can clearly lead to errors because we only are human beings. This will then also increasingly lead to implementing recounts. It is argued that with computers, such errors are neglected. The woman in the lecture has an opposite view and argues that computers are programed by human beings wich therefore also leads to errors in computers. But not only one or two mistakes, if a computerized system has an error it can lead to thousands of miscounted votes. In that situation, a computer recaount is impossible. In the text another argument for a technological voting system is the governments and individuals use complex technology every day, not to mention the accuracy banking transactions, why shouldn't a new voting system be given a try. The woman argues that these daily used systems have been improved from years to years and are used and improved every day. The voting system is only used every four years, so many different problems can occur.
