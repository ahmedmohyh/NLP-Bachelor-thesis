The previosu speech was mainly about the disadvantages of a computer voting system. The speaker started with the argument that a counting system with computers would have no benefits for anybody.
She said that it is true, that the system would be easier in use for people, who are experienced with computers. However the problem here are the people, who have no idea how to use computers. They will elect the wrong candidate, because they are iritated by the design of the election and the way they have to elect.
Another argument of her was, that computer are not fautless, because in the end they, and their programms are made by humains and if these informaticians made an error, which they will do by their nature, this would produce heavier problems as if a single humain miscounted the votes.
As a last argument she brought in, that these conputer votings system are too less frequently used, so people do not improve these programms as often as the programms, which are daily used in banks, schools, and everywhere else.

The speech has a lot do with the text above, because it is the complete opposite of it. While the text shows the benefits of a computer voting system and tries to make us in favour of it, the speech critisies the computer voting system and shows us the disadvantages of it.
