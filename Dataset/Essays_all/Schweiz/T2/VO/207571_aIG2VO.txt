There are people who aren't happy with the current voting system and who would like to improof it by using computers. But there are also counter arguments that show how computers arent the right solution.
First, the ones who have the opinion that computers should be used say that especially people with poor eyesight have problems with the ballots. They can't see it properly and therefore they are likely to vote for the wrong person. So computers would be alot easier. The problem with this argument is that there are people who don't own a computer (e.g. because they can't afford it) and aren't used to one. These people could too vote for the wrong person, because they don't understand the system, or be just discouraged and don't vote at all.
When humans count the votes there can easily be errors. But the same goes for computers, because these systems are also programmed by humans. Those errors could be much worse, because a recounting would be impossible. Humans maybe would make one or two mistakes, but with a programmed computer system there would be thousands of errors.
To just believe in technology would be a big mistake because, unlike banking transaction systems that are used daily, votings are less often and the system isn't approoved and adapted every other day.
