Are computers more efficient for voting? 

We have written a text and have heard a different text. Both are speaking about the vote in the USA. But they are in different opinions. 
In the text, we get that the computerized voting would be more easily, because otherwise it is really easy to make mistakes while voting or while counting the votes. A computerised vote would be helpful for the voters. 
In the opposite, the audio thinks that a vote with computers won't be as good as the traditional one. Human make mistakes and computers are made from human, so computers make some as well. And they are telling, that an error of a computer will have a bigger influence to the vote. With a computer it is really easily that everything will be deleted. 

So these two texts speak against each other. The text doesn't say anything about a technical mistake, and is in the opintion that computers are a lot better than humans. On the other hand the audio tells a computer with huge problems.
