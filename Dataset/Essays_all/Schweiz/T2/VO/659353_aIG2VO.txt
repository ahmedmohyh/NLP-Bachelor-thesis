In both, the text and the audio, they talk about that there can occure misscounts of the votes in traditionnal counting.

But in the audio they don't say that in traditionnal voting poeple accidently vote for the wrong person. They say that the traditionnal voting is less complicated specially for those who aren't used to technology and computers.
They say that the technology isn't ''easy-to-use'' for older people as they say in the text.

The audio says that votes-counting computer programms are also programmed by people and so they can also make mistakes. The mistakes a computer can make are bigger because the error is perhaps of a thousand voters and not just of a view.

They also mention that the new computer-based technologies like banking systems weren't trusted since their beginnings. The society  at the beginning had fear of the technology and had to get used to it and develope confidence for them. What is more is that this systems didn't work adecuately since the beginning and had to get improved.

In the audio they also say that it can't be taken for granted that the people can afford such devices because they cost a lot.
