In the text, it is written that critisans of the traditional system think that that counting votes by humans lead to errors. In the presentation, it is said that if humans would make errors in counting votes, they also would make errors in making the computer programm for the computer voting. If they made a mistake in traditionals voting, there would miss a few votes. But if a computer programm would have a mistake in the system, there would be a lot of mistakes and its difficult to find and recount this votes becouse they aren't physical. 

In the text it's written that for people with poor eyesights it would be easyer to vote if they would have a comupter, so they would make less mistakes. But in the speak it is sayd that there would be a lot of people who have troubles with a computer. They dont be used to this voting system and there would be much more errors by doing false cricks on the computer than making wrong marks on a sheet. 

It's also said that this traditional system isn't used so much and that people have ameliorate it since there were the first votes. So there would not be much errors.
