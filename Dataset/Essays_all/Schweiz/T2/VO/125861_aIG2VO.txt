The lecture was about two different voting systems. It was said that computerized voting does not have to be better than the traditional voting system. People who cannot afford a computer or are not used to it will have huge problems voting for their candidates. The text disagrees in that point. Computers are thought not to make mistakes like humans do it when they count the votes. Whereas, the lecture said that an error in computerized voting systems which are programmed by human beings is much more serious than  in the traditional system of voting. In the text it is written that men are using complex computer technology for banking transactions and cmmunication containig very important information, so computer can also be used instead of ballots. However, in the lecture it was said that such kind of computer programms are used daily and have to be improved over a long period of time. Traditional voting systems ought not to be a substitution for voting on computer, so the lecture said.
