Firsty, many people are afriad of using the computer due to not being used to it. So it does not make the voting esier for them. Even though computer programs can be much more accurate than the traditional voting system it does not mean that such a program is without errors. For example, if the program is not ordinarry developped it could be a major problem, but if people who count the votes make a mistake it is only a minor problem. 
Finally there are people saying that it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology. But the election is  once a year so there is no need to be afraid of that. If people trust other tecnology like banking transactions they should give the new voting system a go.
