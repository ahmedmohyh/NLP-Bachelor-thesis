This essay deals with some arguments from the critics against the traditional voting system in the USA. In the audio they talk about counting votes on computers, so that means the people need to vote by computer. The problem is that older people and people with little computer knowledge maybe aren't able to handle a computer correctly. This may lead to wrong results. But the fact is, that computers are constructed by humans and humans make errors. But if a person counts the voters by hand, she could make some small mistakes but they often would'nt be that important. In contrast to a mistake made by computers, this doesn't have strong consequenses because an error done by computers can't be controlled and the results could be terribly wrong. In the text ahead it seems as the critics want the voting system to change to computer voting but the speaker from the audio doesn't seem to be content with that opportunity. One other problem about the electronic voting is that with only one touch you have given your vote for a perhaps unwanted candidat.
