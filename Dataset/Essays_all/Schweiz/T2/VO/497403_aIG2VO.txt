They talk aabout voting systems. The little text say that tradiotional voting is not good, because it has that much names on the election sheet that they first have to search and mark, but there is only a small place that people could vote accidently a wrong canditate. And that when they count up the words that a human error could make a long and expensive recount and that it normally takes much time to count. In contrast, when the system is computerized that the human error is removed and the counting is automatically. That means also faster. But the record says that when people normally don't use a computer it's harder for them and it also can be that they accidently vote the wrong person. Another argument was that human error is not really removed because they are human who programm the system, so error is also possible in a computerized election and it's a bigger problem, when the voting has to be recounted, because only the computer has the voting so it can't be recounted. And we can't say that also bank and etc. are computerized. We can't compare it with these things because this system are needed nearly everyday, so they update it very often and perfectionize, but elections are only one or two times in a year so it's still a new system which can make mistakes.
