The election system that's currently used in the US isn't working out so good, because there are still to many big mistakes in the Computer system that haven't been fixed yet. You can't compare it with a computerized banking system, because they have been used daily and heavily and a computerized election system is only used once in two years in the US so there are still many problems that have to be solved and this is going to take years. An other bad thing is that people who aren't used to a computer will have difficultes to handle it at the election day. There is one last aspect you have to think about, computerized systems have been made by human beings and humans do make a lot of mistakes so the system have nearly as many mistakes, than a swiss cheese has holes.
