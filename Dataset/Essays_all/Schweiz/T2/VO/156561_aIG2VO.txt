Summary Voting 

In the text that I have read it is disussed if the traditional voting system of the United Staates should not be replaced by an new computerized one. The extract that I have heard points out, why the americans should keep their old system. In this essay I will compare these two source of informations.

The mainpoint of the text is that the traditional voting system is to time-expensive and errors are far easly to make as humans count the votes. The article remarkes too that people with bad eyesight can hardly not find their candidate on the enourmus ballot, because the names are written to small. 
All this disadvenatges of the traditional voting system have been proofed by the audioextract. But the speaker of the extract also remarkes that it is not been said that the computerized system is better- The mistakes which are made by humans in the counting could now be made in the software creating and this sort of mistakes would be even more doubtful. It is said too that the voters who are not aware to comupters could find it too diffrent with a modern voting system so they stop voting.
