In COmparison to the text teh audio was firmly against comuterized voting. 

The first argument in the audio which should proof that computerized voting will not help the voters to vote was that only people which are used to computers can really vote with them. But not everyone knows how to do it and so they can be to afraid of making a mistake so the will not vote. And for sure not everyone has a computer. 
On the other hand the paper writes that many people accidently vote for the wrong candidates because the small mark they need to do nedt to the name on the ballot is easly to small for people with poor eyesight. 

Another argument was that computers are programmed by humans so there can be errors in the programming itself. This can be a major problem because for sure the officials which count up the votes one by one makes mistakes but it is significantly more dificult to find errors in the system of a computer than recount the votes. 

Both the text as the audio agree that we trust computers a lot. Be it for communications or in the bankig transactions. But there again explains the audio that we can only trust this functions because they were perfectionized during their daily use and a voting which occurse only every two years nationaly does not have the time for being unperfect.
