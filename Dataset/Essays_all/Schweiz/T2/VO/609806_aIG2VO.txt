Today every election has to be made by the hand. After the voting of papers, every vote has to count and this takes much time, and if you than make a mistake, you have to recount al of the votes again. Probably there is a solution for this problems. In the future it could be, that votes are electric and can be made on the computer. But there arent't just good things with this modern technology, there are also many problems. 

First some good points. The programs are very fast and precis in counting the votes. Also is the voting easier for people, who don't see so good. They often make the vrong cross by the wrong person, because they don't see it.

But there are also bad sides of this new technology. For example if people doesn't use a computer very often, they can have some problems to do this votes. Everybody has the right to vote and so it isn't correct, that you can't vote because you don't understand the computer.
Another issue that the votes with the computer brings with, is the programm. The program is made by humans. But humens arent't machines and so they can do mistakes. If the program has an error, a lot of votes could be wrong or not correct. Then you have a big problem, because the votes are all online and so you haven't any votes anymore on a paper or something. 
Maybe a good solution would be, that you can make the votes in both ways.
