In the presentation, the women talked about the voting system and his problems. Some people say the votin system in the moment is inefficient and they want to vote per computer. Here are the arguments from the women against that computerized voting.

The main problem of computerized voting she talked about, is that not everyone can work with computers, the older people can not work with the technology, like the younger generations. So that voting system is not for everyone.
She also asked us, if the computer makes it better, because every one makes mistakes an the computer is made by us. That means that it can give errors with the computer programm. If that happens, all the votings are lost and that would be dramatic.
And her last argument was, that the voting is only once every two year, so it is not so dramatic that the United States needs another voting system an there are not much mistakes who happens, so she is against the new voting system with computers.

The women is abolutely against the computerized voting, it is to early, because not everyone has the techoogy at home. An there are encore to much errors in the computer programm. It needs time to change out the old voting system.
