Is voting whith the computer or traditionel better?

Whene somebody isn't used to computers or can't effort them they get into trouble when they have to vote with a computer the women in the listening said for example so the person vote for everybody because they don't know how to contoll a computer. The expose said that whene they vote with a voting sheet they often vote for the wrong candidate, so there are also mistakes so in that point they aren't agree with each other.

Often peaple say that humans make mistaks that's true but the computers are from humans. So whene a computer has an error everything is lost and the resultats can't count again. But whene the votes are with a voting sheet you can count again to prove the resultats. But the in the text it is written that it is very heavily to count the votes and there are many mistakes and with a computer it is possible to remove the humans error.

In the end you don't can trust the computer programme because only once in two years there are votes so the programme can't get testes whene you are counting the votes with the computer you can't be sure that the system works. But the expose writer thinks you have to give computerized voting a thought because you also trust other computer things.
