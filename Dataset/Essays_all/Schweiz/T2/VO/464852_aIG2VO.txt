In the listening the woman said, that a computer is only easy to handle for people who are used to it. There are also a lot of people who live in the United States and don't have a computer and so they also don't have knowledge about them. But in the writing they say, that a computer is really easy to use and also that the chance to vote for someone wrong isn't that big.
Another topic was that while counting  the votes like they now do, a lot of mistakes can happen and that a computer could count the votes quickly and without any mistakes. But for that the woman said something really important in the listening. She meantioned that a computer programm is also made by human and that an error in the computer could miscount thousands of votes. Also if the votes are need to count one more time if there are suspections about sabotage, it isn't possible to recount the votes on a computer. In the text they talk of all the advantages of a computer and the presentation was about all the disadvantages. In the presentation she also said, that a computer in the beginning wasn't that trustworthy as it is now but it's sure that they need to make it more secure so that maybe one day people can vote on a computer.
