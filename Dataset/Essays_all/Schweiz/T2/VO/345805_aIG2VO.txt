In the presentation a woman argues against computer counting of elections. A cruical point of computer counted election resuts is that they are not reliable as elections don't take place very frequently which causes an impossibility of major improvements in the system itself. This is contradictive to the statement in the given text that we rely on daily used computer technology.
Possible mistakes by computers may have a immensely high impact on the results and can miss thousands of votes. Human counting on the other hand can only cause minor miscountments which can barely decide an elections results. The core issue about a computer voting reform is that people who are not used to working with a computer or cannot afford one might make mistakes by voting or would not vote at all in the worst case.

Concluding can be stated that the text is arguing for and the auditive presentation against a new votes counting system based on computer technology instead of human counting.
