Essay about Voting

The topic in the short text and also in the audio file is voting. They talk about the currtent voting System in the United States of America. The system nowadays is based on a traditional way of voting or with other words: a very personal way of voting. In both sources they say that the system now has a few critical points. For example can the people who count the votes make mistakes. But also both of the sources doubt, that a computer voting system would be better. Then also there can be made a lot of mistakes. For example if the computer does not work properly once the error would be much bigger. Many votes can get lost. It would also be very difficult to vote on a digital way for people who are not used to it. They would have many problems with this system and could finally give up voting. So finally the conclusion is, that it is too risky to implement complicated voting technologiy nation wide. An other reason for that is, that people do not fully trust in modern technology. Especially not, when their future depends of it.
