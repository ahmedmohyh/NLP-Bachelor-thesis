While it is true that some people with poor eyesight can easily make mistakes with voting, we also have to think about something else that is a thing within the elderly and the poor. Some of them might have never touched a computer, from not being able to afford one to fear of technology in the end it doesn't matter that much. Because of this, these people might make mistakes with voting on computerized systems. 
One much more bigger concern though, is that the programms designed to vote on a computer, are still made by humans. This means that if there is a mistake in the programm, there will not only be one wrong vote, if someone counts wrong, but up to thousands. And the worst thing about this is that ,if it is close in an election, you can't even do a proper recount, because there is no physical evidence of the votes.
Finally it is true that we use computers everyday. But that is exactly the point, which we can not be sure about with computerized systems designed for voting. We don't vote everyday, but only every two years. With this there comes a lack of trust, because the system isn't being tested everyday.
