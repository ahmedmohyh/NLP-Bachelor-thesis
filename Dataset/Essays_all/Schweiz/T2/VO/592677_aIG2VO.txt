The voting system in the United States is a very contorversial topic. An option would be to use computerized voting, but critics do not trust computers to do a better job than humans when it comes to constructing fair conditions for voting.

Critics of this suggestion say that computerized voting might be easy for the people who are used to computers, but there are many people who could have trouble voting and vote for another person unintentionally, because they are not accustomed to the technology. These people would include older peopple and citizens who cannot afford computers. Advocats argue, that an inaccuracy in voting occures more often when using the traditional ballots, as people have to find the right name and it is easy to set the mark beside the wrong one, especially for people with bad eyesight. On a copmuter the text could be zoomed in on.

While advocats of computerized voting believe that a computer would count the votes more reliably, critcs say that computers are programmed by humans, which still makes human error possible. If there would be an error of counting on the computer, the number of wrong counts would be much more vast. Eventhough recounts are expensive, as the advocates point out, they are at least possible. With computerized voting, this would not be an option.

Although there are may online services that we use today, like online banking and communication, crtiics of computerized voting say that these services are used on a daily basis and that they could develop and improve by fixing errors that acuured. Voting is only done twice a year in the United States, so this service would take years to work properly. On the other hand, advocates argue that every individual and even the governemnt trusts computer services with all kinds of information and this wormks well, so it should not be different when it comes to voting.
