The presentation has got the opinion, that computerized voting woulnd't be any better than paper based voting. For people who are used to computers it seems much easier, but there are also people who can't afford a computer or aren't working with one - and for those it would be much more complicated. They could vote for the wrong person or - even worse - be discouraged to even vote.
Furthermore, there are human errors in traditional voting such as miscounting. But in computerized voting, humans would also be involved to programm. And the errors made there are far more serious. While in traditional voting only a few ballots would be wrong, in the computerized voting thousends of votes would be false. The recount would be impossible, because the files would be deleted by the computers immediately. The votes would be permanently removed.
Last but not least, of course complex computer technology is working perfectly - it is used on a daily base and was improved for years. It wasn't as reliabe as today in the begining. But the voting programm would not be used as often as for example a banking programm. So it would take much more time to remove the errors.
