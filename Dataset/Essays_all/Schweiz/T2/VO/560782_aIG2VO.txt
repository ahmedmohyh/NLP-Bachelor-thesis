The speaker doubts that digital voting improves the accuracy of political elections and votes whereas the text advocates computerized votings.

Whereas the text says that people can easily make mistakes on ballots the speaker reminds us that many people are not used to using computers. Therefore people are even more likely to make mistakes at a computer system or even won't vote because they are afraid of new technology.

The text states that human error is likely to occur at counting votes by hand. But the speaker is doubtful about whether there are not any mistakes in a computer program since it is programmed by humans. The consequences of a computerized error would be even more tremendous because not only a few ballots would be counted incorrectly but probably thousands of votes. Furthermore such a mistake could hardly be proven since there is no physical evidence as in the traditional voting system.

The text says that one should not fear the properness of computerized systems because we can see perfectly running systems in banks for example everyday. The speaker is of the opinion that this is due to several years of constant improvements after mistakes that have occured. In the case of political elections these experiences cannot be made because there are rarely votes and a mistake would be very crucial.
