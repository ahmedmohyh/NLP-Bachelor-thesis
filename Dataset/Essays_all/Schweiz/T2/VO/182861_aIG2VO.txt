The lecture was critical about the idea of modernizing the voting system. The argument that it is less probable to cast a wrong vote is not true because it only counts for people who are used to technology and computers. For unexperienced folks it would be quite easy to tap on the wrong name on a touch-screen. Furthermore, such people would come up with the idea to gather and help eachother casting their vote what could lead to foreign influence. Unexpirienced people consize mostly of old people and as we know the amount of old people in our society is increasing by quite a fast rate.

The woman speaking admits that humans indeed make mistakes but so do computers as they are programmed by humans. Even more we should consider the difference of mistake that could be done. Humans could count wrongly or make a wrong tick which would lead to an indiscrepancy of some few votes. But if the computer programme is written completely wrong every single cast could be false. On top, humans are able to recount votes if an error is suspected, computerse aren't.

Also another strong argument of the text fails according to the lecture. Namely, it is not possible to compare a technoligical system used in bancs for transactions with a technoligcal system used for voting. She agrees that banking systems are trustworthy and reliable but that this has come only with development. At first also those systems failed and had to be improved. This was possible because transactions are done in millions every single day. Boting is to rare that a development and improvement could take place because the system would be tested only every second year nationallyö.
