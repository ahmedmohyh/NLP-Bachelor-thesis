Is computerized voting really better than current voting systems?
This is a question which is highly dissgusted latly. Some say that a new method of voting has to come because the old system leads to inaccurate results. Firstly because everyone who votes has to find the name of the canditate they prefer on a large sheet of paper and if they have poor eyesight, it is possible that they mark the wrong name. Furthermore the votes are couted by hand. So people have to go through evre ballot one by one and with this method it is highly likely that mistakes are made. 
On the other hand, if the voting will be computerized there are other disatvantages. One of them is that many people are not used to use computers daily, so the are not able to understand the sytem as quickly as others. This will lead also to wrong votes. 
Perhaps the votes won't be counted by hand anymore but that doesn't mean there will be no mistakes. The computersystem is programmed by humans too, so it is possible that the system misscounts may votes not just one or two like it is the problem with the current method. 
Overall a change must be made but before this can happen, we have to develop a bigger confidence in using such an advanced technology for elections or other important thins in society.
