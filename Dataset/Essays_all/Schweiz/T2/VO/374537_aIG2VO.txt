Traditional Voting vs. Computerized Voting

Critics think that the current voting system in the United States isn't efficient. It's much easier to make a mistake at counting tousands of ballots by hand. And if the error is detected, a recount would cost a lot of money and time. They're sure that cumputerized votings would have better improvement. People could easily touch the name of the candidate instead of marking a small mark next the the name. Eyesight would be a problem anymore. 
On the other hand, peopole doubt the computerized voting. Not everyone can afford a computer or use one. For the ones that don't know how to use, it wouldn't be easier. They could still vote for the wrong person. The worst case would be, that they wouldn't even go voting because they're afraid of the technology or they would tell other people to vote for them for the same candidate like they do so they wouldn't have to go by themselves. So the results would be right. And not to forget: computers are programmed by humans. One mistake in the programm could lead to millions of wrong votings and a recount wouldn't be possible without people voting again. 
The traditional voting has been a system for years and has been improved. AS they vote just all two years in the United States and only just about two times, the old system is still good enough.
