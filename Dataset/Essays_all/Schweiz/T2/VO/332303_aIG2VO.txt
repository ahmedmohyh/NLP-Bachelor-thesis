In the listening it is told, that the computerized versions for elections are probably good for people with sightproblems, but also have many other issues. It is usual that many old persons also vote for presidental elections and so on, and this is why many of these seniors will be confused or perhaps also scared when they want to vote and make stupid mistakes. The woman in the listening also says that if the worst case scenario happens, there could be thousands of votes who weren`t countable for the elections. And one last problem is also that such computerized versions are used daily in the bankings and so on and are always tested again and again. For election there would be a use only once in a month.¨

In the conclusion, it is said that the new versions for elections are better than the traditional way, beacause people with weak sightness aren`t able to mark the right ballot. A computer, with a touchscreen, such as a tablet, would perhabs help them, because they can zoom in to the namefields and read evrthing carefully.
