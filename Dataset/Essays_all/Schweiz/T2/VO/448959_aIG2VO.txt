In the text it is said that the current voting systems are inefficient and that the votes are often inaccurately counted. It is stated that the cause of this miscounting is that people sometimes accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because they can not see by which name they are making a tick to vote. It is claimed that with touch-screen technologies and computers this problem could be avoided. However, in the lecture it was said that computerized voting technologies can't be fully trusted. The lecturer claimed that there are people who might not be able to afford a computer or simply might not be used to work with it, which can also lead to problems. These people could be discouraged by the fear of technology and as a result not vote at all. 

Another cause that is named as a source for inaccuracy in current voting systems of the United States is that the officials who must count the votes are very likely to make errors, as they have to count each vote one by one. The writer of the text states, that with a computerized voting technology this problem could be eliminated. The lecturer disagrees. It was claimed that the counting programmes on the computers are programmed by humans, who might have made a mistake while programming. This could also lead to errors and to thousands of votes being miscounted or even lost. Additionally, because there is no physical evidence of the vote, it would be very difficult, if not impossible to recount the votes. On the contrary, in the text it is said that with the help of computers the recount would be quick and automatic.
