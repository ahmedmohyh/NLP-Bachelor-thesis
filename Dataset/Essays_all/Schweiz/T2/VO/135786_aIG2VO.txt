The text and also the audio where discussing if the traditional voting or the current voting is better.
In the text is said, that with traditional voting it happens quiet easy that someone votes for the wrong candidate because there are so many names written pretty small and someone with poor eyesight can easily tick the wrong name. The woman in the audio critizized on the current voting that it may be easier for those who are used to computers. But those who haven't got the money for a computer or are just too old can easily vote for the wrong person just because they don't understand the technology.
The second problem according to the text is that officials must count thousands of ballots and that it's almost inevitable that they'll make mistakes. In the audio was this problem contered with the arguement that if the computer has an error it's not about a few wrong votings, it's about thousands of votings which would be wrong. And those computers are also prepared by humans. So how should anyone trust that they don't make any mistakes?
The final arguement is that technology is used worldwide from the government and individuals for other important things, as the communication of highly sensitive informations and banking transactions. The woman from the audio agreed but also said that those things are used daily and needed time to improve alot. Votings aren't done daily. They're being done once every two years, so she questions how those votings should develop and how should they improve.
