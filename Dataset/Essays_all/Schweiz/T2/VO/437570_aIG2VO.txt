The presentator in the audio presentation had many arguments against having computers as a voting system. The text on the other hand, argumented against the current voting system and how computers would do a better job at counting the votes.

The presenter thought that the computers as a new voting system wouldn't be reliable. The history of computers has been developed since many years but national voting in the United States is only every two years. That way, if a problem occurs, they'd only notice it every two years. Maybe if there was some kind of error in the voting too, they'd have to recount the votes. If a computer counted the votes, you can't really recount them. But with acutal votes on actual paper you can, in fact, recount them. An arguement of the text is, that when we count the votes with  people, they'd probably have some failures in there because they have to focus on so many ballots. Therefore they think that computers as a new voting system would be a perfect replacement since there can't be a possibility of human error. But what they don't consider is, is that computers get programmed through people. And if the program has some mistakes in there, many votes could easily be counted accidentaly to another person or even be forgotten.
