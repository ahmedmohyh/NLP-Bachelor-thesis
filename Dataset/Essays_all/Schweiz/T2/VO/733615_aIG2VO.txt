The lecture opposes the text regarding its position concerning the efficiency of traditional voting. The text claims that easy-to-use touch-screen technology would improve the accuracy of the voting system. But according to the lecture, computers would also cause major trouble with voters that can't afford computers or simply do not use them. A computerized voting system would therefore discourage people from voting. 
The text continues to suggest computerized counting systems would remove the possibility of human error. The lecture, on the other hand, implies that computers would not reduce counting mistakes. Wrongly programmed systems might miscount in the range of thousands of votes. Additionally, recounts would not always be possible preventing a correction of the counting. 
Finally, the text says that banking and communication systems already utilise complex computer technology and that there is therefore no reason to doubt complicated voting technology. The lecture counters this by explaining that those banking and communication systems are in daily usage and are therefore improved steadily. This would not apply to voting technology which is only used a few times a year. This makes it not sufficient enough for the actual usage.
