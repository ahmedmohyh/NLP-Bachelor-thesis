Many people say that the vitung system in the usa is inefficient and inaccurate. A miscount can be very damaging in a close contested election.
But theres also a inaccuracy problem in the traditional way of voting. Many people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate.The reason for that is simple; People have to find their candinate they want to vote for in a large sheet of paper containing may names. People wih bad eyes can easly make a mistake when they mark for their favorite candidate.
In contrary the high-tech voting machine has a easy-to-use-screen technology. The voter has just to touch the name of the candidate they want to vote for.
Another big problem is the way of counting the votes. On the traditional way people have to count every single vote. On the other side the computerized voting machine counts all votes by it self in seconds.
I think we should all give it a try. We can see the computer is helping us most of the time today for example the technology on banking transactions which is very accurate. Nowdays we should trust the technology more and bring the computerized voting machine in.
