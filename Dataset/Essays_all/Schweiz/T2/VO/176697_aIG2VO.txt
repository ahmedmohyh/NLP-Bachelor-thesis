Technology or the old traditional voting system? If we are voting and all these ballot should be count by a person there could happen a lot of faults. But what about the older persons, who do not have any contact with technology? 

First of all, the older persons have to change a lot of there habits. Now they can't work with that, so how should they vote. They have to learn to be in contact with technology. And just for voting every second year. Is it worth it? Isn't there the chance, that the old people won't change there habits just to vote. Maybe there gone less people how votes.

Secondly the programm, who counts the ballot is installed by a human being. So there could also be some faults. The problem is, that human think, that the technology of today is perfect and there aren't any faults. 

Although we are now in a time, where the technology is very strong. We have to change us. The world have to be with the technology. Time flys over. So the idea, that the voting system is at our laptop isn't bad. But there have to be some workshops for the persons, who don't have any contat to technology. They have to get some suport. 

At the listening, the woman was against the technology and the text is for the technology. But both shows some arguments for and against it.
