Voting is one of the few things, which is relevant for all people of a society. We elect and diselect our leader figures. Those people will be responsible for our presence, future and looking on an Orwellian state even for our past. Certain people suggest that voting should be computerized in the future, while others prefer the traditional voting system.

Many people accidentaly vote for a person which they did not intend to. Reasons for that can be visional problems or inaccurate marks. Those kind of mistakes can`t happen in a computer-based election. Furthermore a computer counting system doesn`t loose concentration, while a human being naturally looses concentration after a certain time span and that of course also causes mistakes.

But also computerized elections aren`t secure of human errors. All those programms have been created by human, and who sais that they didn`t make mistakes. A mistake in a programm would even cause much bigger problems than a man misscountuing one percent of his ballots. Also, elections must be accessible to everybody and still, a big share of the population doesn`t have access to computers

Summarized it must be acknoledged that computers could help us with certain problems w ehave with our traditional voting system but a computerized vote would also create new problems.
