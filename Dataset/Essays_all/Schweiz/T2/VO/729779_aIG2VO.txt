Some people think that the traditional voting system is better than the modern work with computers and some think the opposit. 
In the reading part it got mentioned that counting by hands is very inefficient because it takes a lot of time and there are only humans who do this and humans make mistakes because they are unperfect. So they think it would be better if computer are used for voting and counting the votes: It's faster and doesn't make any counting problems.

The listening part thinks the opposit. They mentioned that every technical thing is programmed by humans. So there can be mistakes too. But if, there are way bigger and harder consequences because a whole bunch of voting could be just removed and lost forever. Plus votings are something special, it isn't every year and so it's worth to make it by ourself. 
Another argument they said is that there is a problem for people who aren't used to technic or who can't afford a PC. But everyone should have the right of being able to vote.

That accidentially vote for a wrong person is an argument for both sides. On the one hand they say that mistakes are made by chosing on the paper and on the other hand the others think that the touch screen is worse.
