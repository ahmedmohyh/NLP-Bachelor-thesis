As the text proposes the digital voting system as a solution to human errors, the lecture opposes with different reasons. 
First of all, computers and other electronics are not used by every one as heavily as often thought. Some people cannot afford a computer or simply do not have the skill to use one. Furthermore, some people might even be scared away by a digital voting system because they do not know what is really going on. 
Another reason aagainst this digitalisation is, even though humans make mistakes while counting votes a computer program can also contain errors because it is made by a human being. If a person makes a mistake while counting out votes some of the votes could be lost, but if a computer has an error in it's program thousands of votes may get lost. With the traditional system at least a physical recount is possible.
As a counter argument for the trust we put in computers in everyday life, the lecturer says that those systems are heavily used every single day, while there's only a vote all two years. Errors can only efficiently be detected within a often used system. Online banking and other digital services were also likely to have errors in the beginning but developed over time. With voting there is no room for errors, so the system can never really develope and get better.
