The Text takes about the voting system and makes comparison between traditional and computerized voting. 
The current voting system is questioned because of it's inefficienty. There are several problems that can falsify a politcal vote. The major problem is, that in traditional voting, many people vote for the wrong candidate. The main rison for that, is that especially the elderly people have difficulty to find the right name on the list. Another problem is, that it takes a lot of time and money to recount all the votes, and it is impossible, that they will not make any mistakes. 

That is way, critics would like to replace the old voting system with a computerized voting system. The main argument that speaks for the new technology is, that it is much more efficient. But this solution also has its flaws. Technology e might work perfctily for people who are used of using it daily. But there are enough people who fear technology and that would have an negativ impact on the vote. Because these national votes are just few times a year, people can not develop a confident relationship with the technology. Another big problem that this new technologie might bring, ist that these systems are programmed by humans. An error in the program system would have a big negativ impact on the hole vote. 

To both voting systems, there are positiv and negativ aspects, but it is an option that the government has to consider.
