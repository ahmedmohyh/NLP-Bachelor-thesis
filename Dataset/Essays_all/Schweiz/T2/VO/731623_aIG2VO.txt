Critics say that the voting systems in the United States are inefficient. They would like the traditional systems to be replaced with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems. But is it really more trustworthy? At first, yes we can trust, because computers are daily used and they are improved for a long time and they are really faster. On the other side the computerized systems are only better for people, who knows computers and uses their. What should the other people do, especially the older ones? People, who don't know, how handling a computer? How can they vote? An other argument is when a human make a mistake by countig the votes, then it is one mistake, but a computer could have an error and or loose thousands of votes in one mistake. So it would be too risky.
