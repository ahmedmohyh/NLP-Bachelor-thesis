These two statements are definitely from a different point of view. While the text clearly supports an electronical voting system, the presentation doesn't. The narrator makes a big critic about the computer system and doesn't want it to become the new standart. For him it is obvious that the humans can make mistakes but these programms which are also written by humans also can include mistakes. But these mistakes would have a way bigger influence on the result and a recount also wouldn't be possible anymore as it would be with the actual system. He also points out that not everybody is able to use a computer. Perhaps ther are people who don't have one or who are just not able to use it. The writer of the text in fact has another opinion. For him it's clear that way more people could be reached and less failures of the system would be produced if we all were able to use an electronical voting system. And his last argument about the similar systems we already use today, also got destroyed by the narrator of the presentation. In his opinion these systems got better and better over the years and had a time to become perfect because they are used daily while the voting system just would be used once in a few years and already then it would be really important that already by then it would work perfectly.
