In the text cricics say that the traditional voting system is unreliable and old-fashioned. People accidently vote for the wrong canditate on the voting sheet. Due to the votes counted by people, they may make mistakes. An improvement would be an easy-to-use-touch-screen and using computerized systems for counting votes, just like for banking transactions or communication.
In the listening example doubts were mentioned that computers will efficiently improve the voting system. They say that for people who use computers daily it will not be a problem, but people who are not used to computers, or who do not like to work with computers, it will be a great change or even a reason not to vote. Another point is, that computerized systems are still man-made and because humans are imperfect, there might be a mistake in the system and this would have a bigger impact on the whole votings than, if only a few people tick the wrong name on a sheet of paper. This mistake would cause votes to be wrong or even to be lost. For sure are banking transactions and communication with computer systems very reliable nowadays, but at the very beginning also these were not flawless and had to be improved and changed. It can not be compared to voting because banking transactions are used on a daily basis, but you only get to vote every second year.
