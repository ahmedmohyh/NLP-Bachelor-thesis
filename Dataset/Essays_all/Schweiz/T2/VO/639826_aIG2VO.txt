The woman said that's it's doubtful that computerized voting machines make the voting any better. For people who can't afford a computer, this voting system could cause trouble. Secondly, the people who aren't aware of modern technologies could easily mark the wrong name. The text claims, that this danger is way bigger with traditional voting because people with poor eyesight don't find the correct name on the large sheet fo paper. 
Moreover the woman argues that it isn't prooved that computer do a better job, because human errors could show in the programm and this would have more consequences. Thousand votes could being miscounted. The text claims that computer are way more trustworthy that humans. 
The statement in the text that even the government trusts for instance computerized banking transactions every day should not count in the view of the woman I've heard. The reason she gives is that banking transactions are used every day and had to be improved while voting systems aren't used that often and it would be horrible if the election would't work normally.
