The text and the lecturer talked about the possibility that the voting system will become digitally. That means, the votings will be computerized.

The text contains the pro-arguments, the interview i heard talked mainly about the negative side of this changement. Well one argument in the text says, that the traditional voting can lead to a lot of mistakes, as it is normally counted by humans. On the other side, as the lecturerer said, are computers programmed by humans, so they can easily make the same errors. It could even be that the programm would make much bigger mistake, than a human. He could even delete the informations about the voting by mistake.
The text also argumented, that some people can have a problem understanding the traditional voting system. There are also people with poor eyesight, which can't read the small letters on the sheet. But computrs could be make that easier with their possibility of magnifying the letters. But The lecturer has an argument against that. She said that not all people are accostumed to use the computer, so they could be afraid or even discouraged to vote for something. 
The text also talks about the government, who as an example already uses computer for even bigger things. But the lecturer tried to explain that those programms are used daily, so they are improving faster than a programme, that will only be used two times a year.
