The woman states in her presentation, that computerized voting may seem good on paper, however there are many issues with it, which she proceeded to elaborate on.

Computerized voting is not the way to replace traditional voting, as many, especially older people, aren't used to using new technological devices. However there is a greater issue, this being the fact, that not everyone is capable of affording a computer, which leads to less votes in general and robbing the people of their opportunity to vote. 
Making mistakes of accidentally choosing the wrong name may still occur even on computers. Some people might even be scared of using this new way of voting, which also leads to less votes coming in, which might swing the votee in a different way.
Furthermore she states that computers are programmed by humans, and the fact that humans make mistakes from time to time, could lead to a malfunctioning program in the counting of the votes. Having a defective program in such an important event could lead to major voting errors, like counting for another candidate or not counting the votes at all. In traditional voting, this problem would be solved in a quite time consuming manner, this however is a better solution than not having parts of the vote counted at all.

With each technological advancement in the past, mistakes and problems occured with it, which were later on fixed. However this would not be the case in the voting period, as there is not enough time to work on fixes in the programm to get everything working perfectly in such a short amount of time. As the votes only occur about once per two years, the programm can never be perfected as there is not enough use of it outside of the votes to detect mistakes with it.
