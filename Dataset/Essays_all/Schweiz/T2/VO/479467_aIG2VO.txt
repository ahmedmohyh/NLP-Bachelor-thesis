The critic states that computerized voting systems will not be better than traditional voting systems as there are many people who are not used to using a computer. First of all, people who cannot afford one or do not use it daily. These people will probably stop voting at all due to their fright of technology. Secondly, these technological programs are developed by humans and it is very likely that mistakes and problems occure. So a change to a computerized voting system will not remove the possibility of human error which occures in the traditional system, e. g. miscounting or marking the wrong name on the ballot. More important, errors in the programs are far more serious than the treaditional errors mentioned above as the concern hundredthousands of votes. For instance, many votes might be miscounted or removed by a mistaken program. Thirdly, if a mistakes occures in the computerized counting of votes, no recounting is possible, which is not the case in the traditional system. Last but not least, such complicated programs have to be improved steadily to get rid of possible mistakes and insecurities. Like it was the case when the first banking systems came up. This have been imptoved over a long period of time and can be used perfectly and daily today. However, voting in the U.S. only takes place once every two years nationwide and twice a year locally. So there is very little possibility to develop the necessary confidence in the new computerized system.
So all in all, the lecturer does not agree with the text above in many ways as he disaproves a new computerized voting system strongly.
