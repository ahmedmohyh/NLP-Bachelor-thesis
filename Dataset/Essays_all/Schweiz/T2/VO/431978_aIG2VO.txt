In the written text it is said that computers are more reliable than human. It would be easier to vote with the computer because it would make it less likely for people to accidently vote for the wrong candidate. The listening said that this fact isn't true because people who aren't experienced in the use of computers are in disadvantage when  the PC becomes the only possibility to vote. The don't know how this technology works and because of that they probably don't vote at all.
In the written text it is also said that computers are less likely to make mistake. For example when the votes have to be counted. Because there are thousands of different voting sheets and it's normal for a human to make mistakes. On the other hand the listening said that the computer programms are programmed by human beings and they could also include mistakes. A mistake in a programm which is used for the voting process would have an tremendous effect on the election. The listening states that there normally isn't a physical copy of the votes. So the election would have to be retaken. The programm would have to be reprogrammed. And the candidates would have to lance a new campaign. All in all it would be a total disaster.
