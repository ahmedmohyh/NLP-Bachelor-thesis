Both texts discuss the issue of the safety regarding the voting system in the United States and wheter it should be replaced by a computervoting system. The women from the preaentation represents the oposite side from the writer of the text. She claims that a computerized voting system doesn't assure us any more safety than the current voting systems, since no one can ever be a 100 percent sure about the reliablitiy of these computers. She says that it took our society a while to trust the computerized bank systems and that it took a lot of improving to ensure the safety there if it even is safe. Therefore she admitts that people may be making mistakes counting these votes but also adjust that those mistakes also could be made by any computer and in that case the error would be more serious. A point where the text disagrees, claiming that the computerized voting system is absolutely trustworthy.The text also claims that voting with the computers will reduce error made because of poor eyesight or because of the imense number of names on these sheets of paper.  
Another negative point with using the computersystem is that it could leave some people out of the voting at all. People who can't afford to have a computer or people who aren't used to the usage of computers. The women says that this could incourage people to vote at all, since they don't know how to handle the technologie. It pushes them toward an technological world where they must be able to afford a computer if they want to be part of the democratic system. 
She also arguments that votes are very rarley. In a year it takes place maximum twice per state and that it in tha case it's worth the effort of people counting the votes.
