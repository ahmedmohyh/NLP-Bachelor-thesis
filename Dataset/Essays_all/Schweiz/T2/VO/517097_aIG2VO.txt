The presentation is saying, that computers are not a good alternative for voting because some people are not used to even work with computers and may not even be able to afford one. The text however says that when using a computer, people that have problems could adjust the screen so they can read and understand everything. 
The presentation also says that when using a computer, the amount of errors could be far worse, since it is programmed by humans and the computer then does the same mistake over and over again, if such an error is detected, it is impossible to recount because there is no physical evidence that could be recounted. The text on the other hand says, that human error would not be possible anymore. 
In the presentation it is said, while we trust computers  for other things like online banking, they can not be regarded as reliable since a vote doesn't take place on a daily basis. In the text, the amount of time we use it is not a argument, but it says that when we trust it with so many other important things, we can also trust it as a voting system.
