In the lecture the woman is not convinced of the idea of the computerized voting system. She agrees that computers are a good idea for people that are used to the use of computers but she says that they are not for people that aren't used to computers or can't afford them. She says that there could be a risk of people stopping to vote because they are disencouraged by their fear of technology. 
She also argues that computers are produced by humans and therefore the possibility of human error technically isn't removed. This disagrees with what they write in the text as well. 
Another point she discusses is the severity of computer errors if they would happen. She agrees that the people who count the votes make mistakes but those mistakes are only a few votes compared to what could happen if one of the computer programs would fail. She argues that thousands of votes could get lost and that a recount could be impossible.
Last but not least she talks about the risks of trusting computers. Since computers are constantly being improved and voting only takes place every 2 years she says that computers aren't trustworthy enough to be used as a new voting system.
To summarize all that the woman that gave the lecture disagrees with most of the points in the text and is against the idea of introducing a new computerized voting system for the United Stares.
