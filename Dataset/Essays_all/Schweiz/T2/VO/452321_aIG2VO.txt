The lector told that there are some problems in the current situation. But is a computer-related voting system better? The lector has the opinion that it seems easier for people which use the computer every day but not for people which don't do this like for example the elderlys. It is true that humans make mistakes when they are counting the votes but the programms of the computers were also written by humans, so when a computer makes a fault it is worse than a single human failure in the traditional voting system. Another problem is that there are not any physical records when using a computer-related voting system. But why we use the computer with for example money transications? There it is also a big problem when a computer would make a fault. But the difference is that we use those systems every day and there were also big problems at the beginning. But in the USA there is only an election each two years.

In the text it is mentioned that the current vote system is inaccurate and there are many miscounts. It is also difficult to find the names of the candidates on the sheet and this would be easier on a touchscreen. Today it takes a very long time to count the votes because the officals have to count each vote seperatly. With the computer you would know the result of the election immidialtly because the computer is able to calculate the result.
