The text is about the voting system in the USA. Since tecnology is one of humanity most influcial discoverys it is replacing a lot of things humans used to to on their own. Some years ago, the selection of a new president was all done by humans. Counting all the selection choices. But since techinque has become a standard, it has taken over this job. These days the selection is done tecnoligal by computer. This way the mistake of misscount ung by humans can be avoided. But just because humans don't do it anymore, doesn't mean that there will be no chance of something going wrong. Afterall it's technology. Something humans invented and in the end not flueless. There is a chance of an error and an error on the program is much worse than humans disability of correct counting. Further not everyone is used to techique. Finally humans don't invest much in developing the selectional-system because it's not used this much.
