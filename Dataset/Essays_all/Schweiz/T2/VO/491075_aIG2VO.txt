The first argument in the lecture was that computers don't necessairily have to be better than handwritten votes. For people used to computers, this might be the case, but for someone who has never used a computer before, this  might be discouraging or they could accidentally click on the wrong candidate. This is the opposite of what the text suggests, where they say it's easier to get it wrong on the ballot than on a computer. 

Another critisism of the computerized voting system is that we can never be sure if it will actually be better. Even though humans make errors when counting votes, computers were designed by humans and they can just as easily make errors, but those errors can be far worse. It could for example not count votes at all for a certain candidate, which would have tremendous consequences. The text suggests, that computers have an automatisized counting systen and won't get votes wrong, while humans counting have a greater possibility for counting errors.

It also points out that while the possibility of a fatal mistake might be in that technology, we trust computer systems everyday with banking and communication. The problem with this comparison, according to the lecture, is tha they have been improved over and over, as they are used so frequently. They weren't perfect in the first place and contained many errors, though they improved over time. With a computerized voting system, there would be many errors in the beginning, and because those systems would only get used maybe twice a year, would take a long time an too much effort, which makes them inefficient.
