First of all, you can"t compare the use of computers in banking transactions and other daily used systems with a voting done by the computers help. There are many people who are not well informed with these electric machines. Also, the systems who are being used in a bank are used daily and by people who really understand the whole system.

Secondly, a problem with the new system is that if there"s a mistake or a problem, it automatically gets a big problem. With the old voting system, a person who forgets to count one or two votes is a small problem. The effect on the result at the end of the voting is close to zero. With the new system, the whole voting could be wrong and the result at the end could not be the result most of the people would have wanted.

Last but not least do many, especially old people, not really know how this computerized system works. Even if it does look very easy for us, old people who are not used to these kind of machines have bigger problems to vote for the one they want to with the new system than they would have with the old well known paper system.
