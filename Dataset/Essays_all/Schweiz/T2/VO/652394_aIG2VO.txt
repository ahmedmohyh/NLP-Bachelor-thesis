One of the main reasons why people don't trust the newer voting system is because of theyr fear of techonology. In the text they mention that they want to improve the current voting system of de US because they think it's inaccurate. They think that you'll easily vote for the wrong pearson because some people can't see that well or are unable to properly mark theyr candidate. Others criticise the newer system because they think that especially older people, who're not used to computers or don't use them on theyr daily basis, can't manage the newer system. They also mentioned that every american household has a computer, which could cause major difficulties voting.
