The first argument of the lecture why voting should not be done over computers is, that people who are not used to handling a newer technology, such as elderly people or people who can not afford this kind of luxury, will have trouble with the new voting computers. This can lead to those people voting the wrong candidates, or, even worse, being discouraged to vote alltogether. The text is claiming that far more people would accidentally vote for the wrong candidates with the traditional system because the ballot contains too many names, creating the risk of accidentally crossing the wrong name. The voting machines would remove this problem, by offering an easy-to-use touch screen technology that even elders and unexperienced voters will be able to use.

On the the texts argument that the traditional voting system was heavy in faults because of the manual counting of the votes, the lecture replies with a question: Will computers really do better? 
The lecturer is claiming that in the end, the counting programme will be manmade, which means there is a chance of errors. According to the lecture, these errors would end up being far worse than the miscounts of the traditional vote, because a bug in the programme would have nationwide consequences. A recount would be impossible, because there would be no note of all the votes.

Even though the text says that computers used in everyday life are perfectly accurate, the lecturer replies by saying that even these computers have been doing faults in the beginning of their usage, but constant fixing of the named have lead to an improvement. This system of improvement of technology would not be possible in the voting system because in the USA, votings and elections are only held every two years. This frequency tends to be not enough to learn about the bugs in the programme, fixing them and seeing if everything is working alright next time.
