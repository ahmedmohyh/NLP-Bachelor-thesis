The presenting woman views computerized voting very critically. Whereas the text states that voting errors caused by poor eyesight would decline, she thinks that this won't happen at all. She also thinks that if you let people only vote on computers, many, especially old people would be discouraged from voting, be it because they do not own a computer themselves or because they are even scared of them. Same as the author of the text, she thinks that the current voting system has its flaws, but different as the author, who would like to introduce computerized voting to correct those flaws, she thinks that this introduction will very likely only create more problems. She mentions that the computerized voting would, contrary to the author's opinion, not be safe from human error, because it would have to be programmed by humans after all.
