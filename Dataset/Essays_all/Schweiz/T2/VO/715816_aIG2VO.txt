voting systems - lecture vs. text

The woman who held the lecture pointed out, that computerized voting can be way more difficult for some people than we think. For example, some people can't even afford a computer or are not very experienced in using modern technology. Those people could experience many difficulties in case of a computerized voting taking place and they could even be discouraged and therefore not vote at all. The text on the other hand suggests, that computer programmes are easier to use for people with poor eyesight.

The lecturer also mentioned, that computers can make mistakes too, since they are programmed by humans. And if these programmes were to make a mistake or fail completely, a recount would be nearly impossible, since some votes may be lost or falsely preserved and there is absolutely no physical vote to get back to. The text only talks about the mistakes that humans can make and the impact they have, which is that a major recount is necessary. But the text does not see, that computers could make mistakes too and it says that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.

Finally, the text says, that governments and individuals also trust other complex computer programmes every day, like banking transaction programmes. To this, the woman who held the lecture said, that of course there are computerized programmes that are being used and trusted everyday, but these programmes were not flawless when they first launched and they needed improvement from time to time, until they could work as good as they do now. Voting programmes however, would not get the chance to be improved that often, since they are only used twice a year in every state and every two years nationally.
