Technology makes our life easier in every part of our everyday life.

An advantage is that it is better to read on the computer than on a sheat of paper. But not everybody has got a computer so not all the people are familiar with it. There are people who have a fear of technology or can not afford a computer. If you are not used to it, there is also a chance that you vote wrong.

Also there are people who make this programmes so there can be human errors, so it is not proved that physically voting is more inaccurate like it says in the text.
With the traditional voting system it is possible to recount the votes but with the computers not. Another point is that the traditional voting has been improved over the years.

In my opinion voting with computers can be easier but it is not easier for all the people. Because there are many people who are not used to computers. In both voting systems there can be errors because both are made by humans.
