The arguments from the audio presentation were that people who aren't used to computers or can't afford one will have trouble with the electric voting system. On top of that is that errors in computer programms can affect the result far more than an human error. There we have the first indifference between the presentation and the text. In the text it was mentioned that human errors often happen with the actual voting system. A coomputer voting systemwon't make any errory counting out all the votes. The presentation says instead of this that it could make a mistake and the mistake will be heavier than a human mistake.
