If a technological voting system in the U.S would be more efficient than the manual one we currently know, is debatable. 

Computers seem to be the most perfect thing on our earth. They can calculate pretty much everything and even help everyobdy in their daily lives because without computers we couldn't live. The computers don't often make mistakes, due to that reason they are also used for very important things such as banking and in hospitals. Our live would not function without them. In the U.S, votings are counted manually by persons. They have to check thousands of balllts during an election, whereas they may easily miss out on some ballots or simply miscount them. Computers could do this better than humans. Wrong, because all humans make mistakes, that's just human. And if people say computers are way more secure than people's power, this is wrong. Computers were programmed by humans, and who assures us that they did not maked mistakes whilst programming? Computers used in the banking region were at first very inefficient as well. They made tons of mistakes and were not exactly flawless and had to be improved over time. 
Banking-Computers are used day for day and are kept running. On the other hand voting-computers will only be used once every two years nationwide, which would surely affect some programms. For younger people the new easy-touch-computer system would be great to use and they would easily understand it. For older people which don't often use computers this may cause even more wrong-voting and the whole voting process will take muc longer and will be fairly exhausting.
