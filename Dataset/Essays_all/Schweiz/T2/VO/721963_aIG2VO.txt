We have heard, that the computerised voting system is not as good as we thought. It has many problems as well. For example it is only easy to use for people who are used to computers and technology for all the others it could be very difficult and they could make even more mistakes than they would make in the traditional voting system. The written article said that more people could accidentally vote for the wrong candidate but this happens as well in the computerised voting system by people who are not used to computer technology. For example they would click on the wrong candidate because they do not know how they have to click. Or they do not vote because of their fears of technology. 
We are not sure if the computer would do a better job. Every human makes mistakes and the computer programmes are written by humans. This would show us that as well this programmes could have some errors and if this is the case it has a much bigger impact than the little errors of counting votes has. And if someone wants to recount the votes to prove them it is not possible with the computerised voting system. If we would make it traditionally we could recount the votes as many time as we think it is important.
And because this system is not very often used (only once a year) we do not have the proof if they work properly. All the other complex computer technologies people rely on are used every day and if they have an error after a few weeks we know the problem and could solve it. This is not the case in the computerised voting system becaus we do not use this as often as the technology of the banking transaction or the technology of the communication of highly sensitive information. The article we heard takes in count that we only use this technology once a year and if there is an error it would be to late. So this is the argument against the conclusion of the written article.
