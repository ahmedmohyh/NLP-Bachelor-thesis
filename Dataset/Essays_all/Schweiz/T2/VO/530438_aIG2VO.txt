There are multiple points that speak for the computer driven voting system. First of all, the counting. Counting as we know it today is done by humans. And humans make a lot of errors after repeating the same process over and over again. The second point would be the speed. When you vote on a computer, then the votes would be counted instantly and we wouldn't have to wait ages until all of the votes are counted. Also the system would be much easier to use. People could'nt missvote on accident so easily and also the time you have to wait during the voting process, wouldn't take so long.

On the other hand there is some form of risk. There could be a computer error, which then could lead to misscounts or even a loss in all records. Also there may be a vulnreability in the system which could lead to potential attacks on the system, resulting in a unreliable vote.
