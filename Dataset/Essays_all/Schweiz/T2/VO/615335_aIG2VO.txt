Critics say that the old US voting system is inefficient and causes many mistakes. Because nowadays, to vote you get a piece of paper with many names and people with a poor eyesight could easily mark the wong name - critics say that a computerized touch-screen system would solve that problem. The thing is just what about elders or other people who don't use computers often? They could have a lot of problems with this new system.
The other thing critics say, is that humans tend to make mistakes while counting thousands of voting sheets and if there was a mistake you'd have an enourmous stress recounting them. Computers, they say, wouldn't do any of these mistakes, because for example online banking also works perfectly. But what they seem to forget is, that computer programms are programmed and installed by humans and if they would accidently "install" a mistake on the program then it would probably count thousands of votes wrong not just a few, like it can happen to a human counting the votes by hand and voting systems would also not be used everyday like f.ex. online banking and could not be improved so fast - online bankiing wasn't flawless in the beginning too. The second thing is even if they'd realize after an election for example that there was a mistake there'd be no physical votes on papers which you could recount.
