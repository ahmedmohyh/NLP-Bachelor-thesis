While the text shows only negative aspects about the traditional voting system and consequently reinforces the voting through technology such as a computers, the presentation of the woman is not quite sure about the positive impact of a change to voting with a computer.

First of all, the text critices the traditional voting because of voters who can easely vote for the wrong person due to a poor eyesight.In addition, counters will probably not count right as there are so many ballots.
On the other side, the lady says that human error can not only occur in traditional voting but also in voting with electronic devices as computers are made by people too. While human errors in traditional counting will not have a big impact on the total counts, an error in the computer program certainly does: thousands of votes could be changed or permanently removed of the record and as there is no physical count, noone would even notice!
Furthermore, the text talks about the fact that it is easier and faster to vote by computer whereas the woman is not persuaded by this thought. First of all people do have a lack of trust in electronic devices, because everyone once had a problem respectively had trouble with an error of a program. In addition, generations nowadays lived throughout the different stages of improvement of such kind of technology and consequently knows the daily flaws of this system. At last, not all people do use computers on a daily basis such as seniors or people who can not afford a computer. This can cause fear of using it for voting and in the worst case leads those to no vote at all.

The text and the lady are definitely not agreeing in which is the better choice of voting. Traditional and computer voting do have their negative and positive points to prove but both are not perfect.
