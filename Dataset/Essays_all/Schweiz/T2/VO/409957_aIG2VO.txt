The presentation says that computerised voting is easy for people who know how to use computers and people who can afford computers. There are people out there who don't own any computers or don't even know how to use them if they don't use them for there regular bases therefore the fear of technology is a big topic that stands against the computerised voting. 
Furthermore the presentation talks about the argument of the human mistake which the text brings up on top. Computers won't do a better job than humans. The human error can already happen by making the computer because the human is the one inventing and creating the computer. If the computer does a mistake it's even worse. 
Therefore the human mistake excuse of the text is not a trustworthy argument. 
Finally they talk about how people by filling out the voting sheets miss a few ballots which is a problem that could be solved by the computerised voting but if a computer makes a mistake 1000 of votes could be miscounted and it would be impossible to recount all of the votes. The presentation in addition says that the computer did not work at the first use and also computers used daily don't work flawlessly therefore they say that the computerised voting should not be trusted and should not be developed.
