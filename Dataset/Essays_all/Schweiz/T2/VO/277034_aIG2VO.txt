In this essay I will show you the differencens between two extracts. 
The voting system is always and everywhere a subject. In this text the exemple will be the United States.

In every election and contest it is difficult to make the whole without a mistake. Nowadays -after the text- some peole say, that the voting system in the United States is inefficient and often leas to the inaccurate counting of votes. Here are many mistakes that can happen. One exemple is, that the people, especially older humans, sometimes vote for the wrong candidate, owing to the small names on the paper, on wich they have to fill out their voting. Or they just read the wrong names. An other problem is the heavily on people, those who has to count the votes. They have to deal with thousands of ballots. That is too much and often error happen. 

The solution would be the computerized voting. In the listening it said, that there could also be problems, because of the people, wich don't use a computer at all or can't afford it. But on the other side the whole voting-scene would not need so much time like now and it does not make so much mistakes like a human. Yes, also comuters can make error, but we have to trust them. They are daily and heavily used. Moreover, a mistake by computer voting only happens once every two years.

Finally, the differences between the two extract are not that much. The often say the same in an other way. They both take about the same things. The text more talk about the error of the people and that the computerize voting would be better. The listening talk more about the error wich also a computer can make. But we have to trust them and there are more advantages by a computerize voting system.
