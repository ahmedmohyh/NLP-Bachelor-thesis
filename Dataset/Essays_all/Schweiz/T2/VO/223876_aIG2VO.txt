Although it may be an issue that people sometimes set their cross at a wrong place when voting, a computerized voting system would not necessarily wipe out this problem. There is a great amount of elderly citizens voting who are not used to computers or technology. They could be discouraged to vote at all or make even more voting mistakes when clicking on a narrow space on a screen. Furthermore, there are people who can not afford a computer.
In addition, critics are against counting all the votes by humans by hand, as humans make mistakes when operating with such big numbers. They believe that this problem could be solved by using technology for counting, which the computerized voting system is able to provide. The opposition discredits this proposal with the thought that humans are the ones building computers as well, so how can we be sure that there will not be an error in the computers? And if there were, it would be a far larger disaster that a few votes being miscounted by hand, since the computers could not recount. One sytem error could delete thousands of votes.
