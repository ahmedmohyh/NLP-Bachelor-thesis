Vote

Computers woud make voting much more easy, but only for the counters. For the voters it doesnt't chanche to a bether side. For people who don't use the computer every day it is much more enoying and discosting. They don't know how to use it and they don't trust the technology. Some people say that the traditional voting sustem where humens count the votes has a lot mistakes and whit computers that woudnt happen enymore. But some say that also computers are mad by humens and they coud make mistakes like we coud. They also could breake down that woud be terrible becaus all the votes woud get lost. 
In the text they talk about that the voters don't realy know who they want to vote and because the vote papers are manipulated, like one name is realy big and the others are missing or very smal, they vote for that one they think look the best. Thats mostly the big one. So the vote get rong but you can't chanche it anymore.
