This article said that the voting system of today in the USA is inefficient and can have miscountings, because the counting of votes is done by humans, so they can do faillers. The tratitional voting system is also problematic because people can't find their candidate on the ballot and many make a small mark next to the wrong name. That's the case of people with poor eyesight. The solution is the technology system where you can vote with your computer. The counting of votes wouldn't be a problem anymore.
On the other hand not everyone can use a coputer and there are a lot of people who have trobles and that lead through a false voting. By the way computer programs are made from humans and humans make mistakes, so the programs have also mistakes and do miscountings or removes. The technological system can be manipulated much easily than the traditional system. It's correct that technological systems are used in banking and communication, but it's a daily use and it improved during this years. The votings are not so often used so it may be that the technological systems aren't that efficient.
