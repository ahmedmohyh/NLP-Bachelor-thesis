The first point that is mentioned by the teacher ist that computerized voting will only be helpful for people are used to computers. The ones that are too old to understand this relatively new technology and the ones that do not use comuters on a regular basis will be left behind and will easily stop voting because of their fear of technology. And this will be far more people than the ones that voted for the wrong candidate by accident.

Another argument that is mentioned is that computers are programmed by humans and that if a systemerror is occuring this will have a far more enormous impact on the voting than if someone makes a mistake when counting the votes. Because if a programm has an error it will be on every computer and not only by a few poeples that count wrong or vote for the wrong candidate.

The last contradiction she presents is that all the programms that are used in for example online banking were improved many times until they became what they are now. The problem is that voting in most states happens very rarely and so errors will not be found as fast as they are in programms that are used every day. So actually the computerized system is more inefficient as the traditional voting because it woud be a long way until they reach a standard that is satisfying.
