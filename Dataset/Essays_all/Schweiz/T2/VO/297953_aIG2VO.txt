This presentation countered many points in the text above. The text contains many arguments for a transition to computerized voting systems, to avoid human errors. The presentation counters the idea of trusting computers more than humans, by explaining that computers are programmed by humans. This means that human errors cannot be avoided either way. Also, an error in a computer program would have a far greater impact than one human error. During the presentation it is said that: "the worst a human can do is miss a few ballots," whereas a computer error would make a recount impossible. 
While it is true that people with poor eyesight have a risk of choosing the wrong candidate (as mentioned in the text), the presentation argues that not everyone knows how to use computers. What about people who can't afford them, or never use them? People may end up losing their motivation to even vote, or it may lead to mistakes, especially if people aren't used to using computers in their daily life. 
The text also implicates that people should not be saying it's too risky to trust computers, because they trust them every day with banking transactions and communication. This argement is countered during the presentation, by explaining that banking and communication systems were not perfect when they were introduced. They took many years of usage and improvement to get to the reliability they are at today. Voting only occurs every 2 years nationally, which is not enough time to be improved and perfected. Therefore, computerized voting systems are not to be trusted the same way banking and communication systems are trusted. 
Generally, the presentation says that computers should not be trusted more than humans, as errors can occur no matter what.
