The main difference between the lecture and the text is that the text is for computerized voting and the lecturer is against. They both have different arguments:

In the text it is made very clear that the old voting system is not practical at all. The votes are cast on a long list of people and mistakes are easily made by both the voters and the ones to count the votes. The long paper lists are confusing and people with poor eyesight are very prone to voting for the wrong candidate. Further is the counting of votes a big problem. With the hand-counted votes errors are inevitable and are going to occur always. With a new electronical system, the touch screen would allow the voters to even zoom in in order to place the correct vote. As opposed to that, the lecturer stated that the errors that derive from the counting of votes may be much more devastating on the computer, since it may miscount or even delete notonly a few missed ballots but potentially thousands of votes. The computer system would also make a recount impossible. It was further said, that people who are not used to working with computers might make mistakes easier than with the paper system or even be discouraged to vote at all. The current voting system is quite easy to understand and execute, and it is clearly more old-people-friendly. The text brings up the argument that other complex electronical systems such as bank accounts are used without giving it a second thought. The lecturer in contrast states that we use the banking system every day and hence have lots of experience and we had time for improvements. With a new voting system, which would only be used twice a year, improving would take much more time, and even moreso with such a sensitive topic.
