The traditional voting system is inefficient. Many problems happen because of humans. The voters can easily mark the wrong name and the people who count the votes can easiliy make some mistakes. The alternative voting system would be the computerized voting. The woman in the presentation we have heard before is talking very critical about this new system. People who can't afford to use a computer habe disadvantages. On the opposite the text tells us that it's an advantage for all those people with poor eyesight. 
Secondly the woman talks about the errors caused by humans. If somebody made a mistake in the programme there is a bigger effect to it, as example there could be thousands of votes miscounted. On the other hand the text tells us that there are now many mistakes happening with the traditional voting system. But surely the effect of those might be smaller.
Another point of view that was mentionned during the presentation was that it might be difficult to improve the system because they use it just once or twice a year. A computer programme that is used daily can be improved in a much easier way.
