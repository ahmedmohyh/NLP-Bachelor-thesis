To begin with they told in the lecture that computerized election could probably be easier for people used to computers, but people without any experience on computers will have struggles, not last because they have too much respect from digital systems. 
It's also said that human counting can last in mistakes, but since the programs on computers are also made by men there could be mistakes in these, too. And a mistake in a program can result into a loss of thousands of votes or even for a complete destruction of the election. There wouldn't be any possibility for recounting the votes since there isn't any material. 
An election doesn't happen often in England, so there won't be any great testing time like for communication systems. And Gathering trust will also be a problem because of the rarity of the votings.

In the first place, they say that one could make a wrong vote because he isn't experienced with computers, but in the text it's said that the voting machines had an easy-to-use touch-screen technology and that people just have to touch the name of their candidate, so it shouldn't be a problem. 
Recounting the votes because of mistakes is expensive and they usually don't do it, even if they have the votes on sheets.
Another argument of the text was that people are using other sensitive technologies everyday, too. So they should be able to trust a digitalized voting system, too. It was only about trust, not about the testing periods.
