"Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes"
This point it quite right. The US is such a big country that technology could help to improve the system and make it better. Here in Switzerland the system works because our county is smaller and better organised. We can send out ballot with the mail and don't have to worry to go to a poll. In the states it's impossible to vote by sending your ballot with the mail, even if it would be so much easier. 
On the otherhand do I see the point of not using computers for voting. It's risky if the system gets hacked. All the votes could get changed and no one would notice because there is no evidence that the results could be wrong. #f**kthesystem It's not easy to find a good way for voting in such a big country. The thoughts are so controvers that there will never be a candidate who is liked by all the people. I don't like that Trump got elected and I think the States did a huge mistake by electing him. 
We should all be happy and give eachother a HOOOOYYYYYAAAAAA. #langlebederkommunismus
I like to go voting here in Switzerland. We have the paper ballots and it makes me feel really important when I bring it to the mail box or to the pollif I forget to  bring it earlier. 
When I was in the states I did go woting with my mom and it's weird because you have to go into a gym. There were many booths, so that no one could see your opinion. It's a strange feeling tht people in the US are so snsecure with showing or saying their opinion. I like Switzerland because of that. We are free to say our opinions out loud and don't get busted fur that. #heilewelt
