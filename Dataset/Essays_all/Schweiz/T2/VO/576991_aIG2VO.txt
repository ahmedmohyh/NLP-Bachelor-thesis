The subject of the lecture is the voting system in america. It says that a new system like a computerized system is not very effective beacause of a few points. One is that with a computer system for elections, everybody needs a computer and not everyone can afford it. Second many people do not use a computer regulary and so mistakes are most likely to happen. Third also many elderly have fear of technology and are maybe not going to vote anymore with a new system. It says that by human counting mistakes are going to happen but with computer also beacause it is developped by human beings. Another point is, that elections are approximetaly every two years and so a new system can not be used and developped every day.
In contrast is the text abouth this voting system. It says that by human counting the quote of mistakes is very large and has a big influence when it comes to a close election between two parties. The critics say that many people vote for the wrong person especially if they can't see very well and mark by the wrong name.
As a conclusion they want to introduce a new computerized system with no human errors and a quickly new method to ease the life of many people. The people against a new system say that is to risky to implement a complicated voting technology and it can't be trust these programms. 
But we use computers every day in our life and trust them for much bigger things than just elections and it works and is constantly developped by humans to improve the accuracy, for example if we think about bannking transactions and the communication of sensitive information.
