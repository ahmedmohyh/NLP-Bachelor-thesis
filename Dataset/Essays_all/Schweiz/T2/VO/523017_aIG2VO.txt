That they are doing mistakes is absolutely normal - mistakes are everywhere where human beings are. A majority of the population is not happy about this mistakes which are made by humans. As a result they would rather do the couting by computers. But isn't it strange that most of the people trust computers which are developed and progressed by humans more than humans? The pro arguments for an electronic election are based on the short timeperiode and the minimal quote of possibile mistakes.

All this operators which have to be paid during hours only for the election only have to work on time - so the Usa should be able to efford them.
To sum up old traditional voting system take way more time. Time is money and money is e
