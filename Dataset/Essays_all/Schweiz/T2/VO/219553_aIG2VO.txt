The text is about computerizig Americas votingsystem. It says that a lot of people vote for the wrong candidate because of the complicated voting ballots, especially people with poor eyesight. On a large sheet of paper containing many names it' very possible to vote for the wrong person.With computerized voting a person can only click under the name candidate which can also be magnified for people with a who have trouble seeing sharply. Another inaccuracy in the traditional voting system is that it relys on heavily on people counting the ballots. With the possibility of human error it's very risky to keep the old voting system going, especially since we use computers every day for banking transactions an the communication of highly sensitive inforation.
In the lecture, the person says that it doesn't make sense to change the voting system because it's also humans who programm computers so the human error is just as likely in the computers. Yet the only thing that officials can do wrong is misscount a few ballots. If a computer makes a mistake it could erase or miscalculate thousands of votes. Also, people who can not afford computers or don't use them on a every day basis may be discoured from voting bcause of the new systems. On the argument of trusting computers to do bank transactios and communicate sensisitive information, that's because those computers were perfected over years of experience and are used a every day. Yet the computerized oting system can^t afford to be perfected over a period of time, it has to be accurate at the first eleccion.
