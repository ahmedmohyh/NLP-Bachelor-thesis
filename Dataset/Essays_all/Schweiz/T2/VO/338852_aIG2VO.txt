The text is about to exchange the voting system in america by hand into a computerized voting system. Some people think it's a good idea because people often make mistakes when they vote by hand. People accidentely vote for the wrong cadidate what isn't good at all. When we would replace the voting system by hand by a computerrized voting system this problem isn't as big. The problem with a computer voting system is that that some people don't understand or even can afford a computer and for these people it wouldn't be possible to vote. If the system has a problem or is hacked thousands of votings could be wrong what would be a disaster. The advantage of a computer system would be that you don't have to count all the votings one by one. But at the same time it is a disadvantage because people would lose their job. With computers there would be a lot less mistakes but the question is if it's possible for everyone to vote with a computer system. Is it even worth changing a hole system if the votings only happen once or twice a year?

The difference between the lecture and the text is that the lecture says it would have to many mistakes ba computer and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to vote with it and the old voting system is inefficient.
