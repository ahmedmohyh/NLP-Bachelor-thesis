The problem with computers nowadys is that not everybody has one. Many peolpe can^t afford having one or they just don`t want a computer. Thats the next problem: many mostly elderly people don`t know how to use a computer so they are excluded for the voting. And wo can`t let this happen. All those problems are easy solved with the exiting votig system: everyone can afford a pen to make his cross on the voting sheetand everyone understands how they work. Sure are there some people with bad eyesight. But if they can`t read on paper they sure can`t on computer. 
Another important advantage of the paper are the possible failures of a computer program. There it`s possibe that thousands and thousands of votes are being deleted by accident. Or otherwise if the computer misscounts the votes. This is especially dangerous at votes with a narrow difference in pro and contra votes. 
Critics of the present voting system say that with computers votes get much faster and easier to count. This can be true, no doubt but the question wether we need this speed or not is quite important. In the US we vote one time every two years and regionally one up to two times a year. So the question is do we really need to spend money time and research for something that we need once or twice every year and for something we still have a quite good working solution for.
