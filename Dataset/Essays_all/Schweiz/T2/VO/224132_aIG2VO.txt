The topic is about voting systems. In both, text and audio, there are arguments for and against voting systems which should be available on computer.

The text says that computerized voting is more reliable while the audio says the opposite which is that the traditional voting system is more reliable.

The argument against computerized voting systems are that people who don't use electronic gadgets everyday or in general not mutch are negative affected because they could easily vote wrong or don't vote at all. An argument against it is that for example old people don't see well and they could easily make also a wrong vote in the traditional voting system by marking a wrong name 
Also a problem they see in computerized voting is that even though computers don't make mistakes human do. And that's a problem because humans programm this computerized voting machines and if a person makes a mistake in this case it would be a much bigger mistake than the tratidional voring mistake because you couldn't recount it for example. While the people who like the traditional voting system say that it is hard to count the votes and that it is inefficient.
The next argument was that such programms need to be improved to be reliable and even though technology helps us in the daily life it still could fail and another negative argument is that the improvement of computerized voting systems would take long because we don't vote everyday, we vote maybe all two years. An argument against this is that we still should give it a thought.
