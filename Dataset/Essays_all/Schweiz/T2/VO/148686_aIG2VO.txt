After listening to the presentation about the topic "voting", we can sum up the main arguments.
In the text the author mentioned that the counthy of votes is very inaccurate and that miscounts can happen easily. So the voters can accidentally vote for the wrong candidate and there is a neccesairiy to replace the traditional voting systems with more efficient computerized voting.
In the presentation we heard a contradictory: The computerized voting is easy for people who are used to computers and work with computers and other electronic devices all day.
