Using computers may be easy for the voting but not everyone is used to computers. What if someone has never had a computer and doesn't know how to use it?

The traditional way can't be substituted with the technological system, because technology has to be improved over many years. The voting is only twice a year and so i'ts too hard to develope confidence. Both systems rely on people. Computer programs for the voting are also made by people. Even records can be removed if  the computerizing system isn't programmed properly.
