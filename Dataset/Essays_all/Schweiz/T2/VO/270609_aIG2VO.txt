USA has a inefficient voting system, which seems to be acceptet from both (presentation and text). In the text they come up with a computerized voting system. Now is the disscusion does a computerized voting system work better? The opinons are diffrent. In text is the argument people who cannot see clearly could make their marks at the wrong name  so machines with the touch-scree technology would work better. Is it really easier if some people never used a device witch this technology or what if people never uses any computer ar cell phone. 
"computerized systems remove the possibilty of human error" is to find in the text, while the presentation mention that computer are made from humens and all the programms are made from humans. Can humens get rid of human error by programming? It is also mention that electronical voting systems have a lot of issues and the most of them in the beginning. An other argument for computerized voting is that the banking transactions as well get used and people trust them completly, but people used to do banking stuff more often than voting. By the way is the banking system older and there were to solve a lot of problem, what is said in the presentation.
