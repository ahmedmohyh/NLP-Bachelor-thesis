First, the lecture mentions that traditional voting has some problems. Even though this part is said in both, the  audio and the text, the rest of the arguments are really diffrent. The woman speaking in the audio claims that it is  doubtful that computers would really do a better job. They say that people who are not used to working with computers or who just cannot afford one would have some problems with a computerized voting system. That stays in contrast to the text where it says that for example people with bad eyesight could have benefits from voting over a computer system. 
Another argument in the audio that is diffrent from the text is the problem with the inaccurate counting of votes. While the text is telling us that computers would do a much better job than the humans, the audio explains that computers can make mistakes too since they are programmed by humans. These mistakes would often be much more serious because it isn't about some missed votes forgotten to count from humans, but much more a huge mistake in the software that leads much bigger miscounts of votes. And according to the audio the mistake in a computer program is much harder to find.
