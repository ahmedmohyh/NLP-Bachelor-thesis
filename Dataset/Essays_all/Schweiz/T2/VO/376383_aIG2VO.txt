Worldwide there are always problems concerning voting and election. In this text part it is claimed that our voting systems, as we have them now are inefficient. As people have to count the votes there's often an inaccuracy concerning the result. Computerized voting systems are said to be far more efficient and a thousand times better. It is also said that it may be too risky to implement voting technology nationwide. What is to add, people with bad eyesight may have problems with the 'traditional' voting. The names are written down in such small letters, that it is impossible for older people or the ones having problems with their eyes to recognize the right name and to make a cross beside this name. It can easily happen that they cross the false name which they didn't intend to cross. Also an important point that leads to inaccuracy. The text part is clearly into computerizing voting as you can see.

In the listening part the situation is looked at a little different. Computerized voting is not easy for people who cannot afford a computer or people having no idea how the new technology nowadays works, for instance the older generation. So people having no clue about computers will have a serious problem. Also we cannot be sure that computers will avoid making mistakes, maybe they will make even more mistakes as humans, as they are programmed by us. A severe problem could also be that computers cannot recount. It has also to be said that voting takes place only every 2 years, this is too rare to make such a big deal out of it and to program computer programs for voting, it's just unnecessary. As is evident the listening part is clearly against computerized voting.

All in all the opinions of the two different parts are completely different and in my opinion I would totally agree woth the listening part. It's just a too big deal to computerize voting as not everyone has a computer or understands how it works.
