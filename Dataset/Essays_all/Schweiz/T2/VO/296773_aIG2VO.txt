The first argument is that people who aren't working everyday with computers, people who don't or even can't use computers have a problem because they can't get along with it. All the old people couldn't vote. And what is with the people who are enemies of technic things they also wouldn't vote. But the text says that it would be easier because you don't have this long ballots. The second argument is that the voting machines,the computers, have to be programmed by humans. And humans make errors, we know that, it's the truth.Of this aspect the text wasn't aware. The finally it's the human again who makes the machine.But to programm such a machine isn't as boring as counting millions of votes. The third problem is that if there were an errror all votes would be lost. You can't just recount them like you can with the traditional voting system. The last argument is that they only vote every two years nationally and maximum two times a year for local things. It would such an big effort that it wouldn't really make sense to programm such an voting system.
