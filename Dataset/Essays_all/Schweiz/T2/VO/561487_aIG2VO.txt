The lecture critisises the text's proposal of replacing the traditional voting system with ballots by a computerized voting system with touch-screen technology. The text proposes to switch to a computerized system to prevent the voting mistakes people make because of their bad eyesight. A computerised system with touch-screen and the possibility to zoom in the candidate's name would make voting easier for everybody according to the text. The lecture however states that a computerised system won't make voting easier for everyone because some people are not familiar with handling a computer. For those people a computerised voting would even be a discouragment for voting at all. The text also states that voting errors occur while counting the ballots by hand and that there is a lot of human error involved. But the lecture opposes this argument stating that a computerised vote counting was also once programmed by humans and therefore doens't eradicates the possibility of human error in counting the votes. The lecture even suggests that a human error in programming a computerised voting system would lead to much more drastic consequences as vast numbers of votes would be affected by the error. In addition there would not be the possibility of recounting the votes if an error occured because there is no physical prove in order to do that. 
The lecture also raises the point that a technology always needs to improve over years like the electronic banking program had to be imporved over years and that voting doesn't take place enough times a year to improve the technology.The text instead suggests that if the technology works for risky banking transactions it will also work for voting.
