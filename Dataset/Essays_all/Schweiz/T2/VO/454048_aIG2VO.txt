Most people are used to computers, but not everybody. It wouldn't be fair if those people who haven't have any knowledge about computers would have to use them for voting and if you can't afford a computer, how would you vote then? The opposite side says, that people with poor eyesight would profit alot, because they could zoom in and would see much clearer for whom they vote for. The critics of the computerized voting system also say that human errors in the voting programm would be much worse then the error that are made by counting ballots by hand. An technical error would cause much more damage, than a few ballots which were miscounted. And if you have no prof of an error you don't have any physical effidence of the results. Critics also say that computerized banking transactions are used day-by-day and they are save because they are corrected when they make mistakes and the mistakes they make are known. An computerized voting programm is only used all two years, how are we supposed to test them and know what errors they may make, and if we don't know the errors how are we supposed to correct them.
