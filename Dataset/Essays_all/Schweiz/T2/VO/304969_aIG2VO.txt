First of all, the woman said that the traditional voting system has some problems because sometimes the huames which have to count the votes make some mistakes and have to  recount the ballot. But it is more easy to recount it by human than with the computer than if a computer makes a mistake you can not recount the votes. In the text is written that we use the computer also for banking transactions. So we don't have to be afraid od the new technology But the woman explained that we needed a long time to imrove the banking system and it is not that easy to make a voting system which is secure. Nevertheless a computer based voting system has some advantages and disadvantages. For people with eye problems it is more easy to vote at the computer but the women explained also that there are for example people without a coputer or people which do not know how to use a computer so they can not vote.
