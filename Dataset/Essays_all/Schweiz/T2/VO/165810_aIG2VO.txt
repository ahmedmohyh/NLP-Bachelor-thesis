The woman is talking about the problems that may occure if they would introduce a computerized voting system nationwide. The first thing she is mentioning is that not every person is used to computers or might not even have a own computer. For these people there is no security that an online voting system is easier to avoid picking the wrong name by mistake. Also there could be kind of groupe votings because people are scared of the technology so if they vote together they feel safer. But this might lead to people voting for another person because all the other do. Another point is that in the text above it is written about the human error being a problem. But the woman mentions that the program would be made by humans to so there could easily be a problem in the program itself that would be way worse because thousands of votes could be wrong or even benot counted at all while with humans counting the number of false counted votes is lower. Also it would take a while until there is a functioning vote system. Computers, when they were invented, were stupid in comparison to the ones we have today. The same thing would also be true for a program. It would have be improved and improved. But voting just happens nationwide once every two years. So how long would it take until we have a really good system?

In conclusion the main point is that with a computerized system we can't say that there are less errors made. Programs are made by humans so it is worse if there is a mistake in the program than when a few votes are counted wrong.
