In the text it is said that it would be better if the traditional voting would be replaced with computer voting. The presentation only gives arguments against the computer voting system.
The first argument of the presentation is that not every person is used to computers. Many people, especially older and poor people, don't have a computer, they would be abandoned of the election. The text sais that especially for older people the computer voting would be better because they wouldn't do mistakes in voting for the person they want. In the traditional voting, the sheets of paper on wich the names of candidats are written are large and the letters are small. It can easily happen that people choose the wrong name.
The text tells us that computer voting is more trustworthy than the traditional voting in terms of counting the votes. Human beings easily can make mistakes in counting. If someone thinks that there was a mistake in counting, the whole process must be done again. It is a very time consuming process to count and recount the votes. With the computer system it would be much more quicker, easier and mistakes in counting would not exist. The person in the presentation has a different opinion. She sais that computers can make mistakes because the programms are developped by humans. If there is a mistake it would have a bigger impact rather than some miscounted votes in the traditional voting.
The last point in wich the presentation an the text have a different point of view is the savety of the computer voting. The text sais that we can trust the computer system in terms of hacking and things like that because it does work with bankig transactions as well. The presentation offers the argument against this that the elections are not that often as the banking transactions. The people who are developping the programm don't have the chance to improve as quickly as it was done in banking transactions.
