The women critises computerized voting. She says that the problems of voting with computers are bigger than the traditional voting. First of all there are many people who don't have a computer. They aren't used to working with computers. The text says that a computer voting system is easy to understand because you just have to touch the name of the candidate you wanna vote for. 
An other problem is a possible mistake of the computer programm. If the computer programm got a problem this problem will influence many votes. The mistake of the people who are countning the votes are rare. The text thinks there are much more mistakes by counting by hand. There is also a long and expensive recount possible if there are any uneven votes. The women thinks this is an advantage because there 's a physical evidence if uneven votes are spotted. 
The las problem the women mentioned is the experience of voting by computer. Because there's only a voting every two years it's hard to deteced the mistakes and problems of computerized voting.
