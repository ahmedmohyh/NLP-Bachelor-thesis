One opinion is that the selecting system is very old and they freshed it up with new technologies like computerizvoting systems. The result is faster published and you don't have to count all the votes by hand. The people just have to touch the screen for voting for someone. On the other hand it is also comlicated for older people or people who don't into technicsystems. They could vote the wrong person or something like that. You would have to explain the new system for all this people and it would during a long time. Also the result could be wrong if the Computer has an error. Thousends of votes can get lost and no one knows witch one's their are. Officials also can make some mistakes but they dont lost the votes they often just forget to count one of them. And every human can make a cross on a ballot without an explaining how to do it. It is true that the voting systems used in the United States are old but it could be better than a new technologies who could lost thousends of votes. I think every State can vote how they want. They just have to make a good result that is whright.
