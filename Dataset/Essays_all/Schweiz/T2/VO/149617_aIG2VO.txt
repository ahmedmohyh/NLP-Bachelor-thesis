The argumentation of the essay has the main point that computers can make errors too and some people wouldn't be able to use the system properly. Especially older people often don't know how to use a computer. This could result in them not voting or voting for the wrong candidate. Also computer programms are written by humans so there is no proof that they will work like they should. The text tells us that the voting system is too old and there are many faults because humans are counting the votes. The speaker in the essay refuses to share this opinion and tells that computers will make more faults and that the recounting wouldn't be possible if the computer makes a mistake. Also the text says that other even more complex computer technology like online banking also works so an electronic voting system will work too. The essay tells about this topic that it would have to develop first and that national votes are only every two years, what means that it makes no sense to develop an electronic voting system.
