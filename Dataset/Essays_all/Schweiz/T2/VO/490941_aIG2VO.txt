The lecture was about the problems of computerized voting systems. The Woman was completely against computerized voting systems because of many reasons. She said that computerized voting is only useful to people who are used to working with computers. People who aren't used to computers might not even go voting because they are afraid of modern technology. Some of them might even vote for the wrong person because they are nervous, but the same thing can happen with traditional voting. Traditional voting isn't perfect either because people with bad eyesight might vote for the wrong person accidentally. The next big problem is the counting of votes. With traditional voting, the people who have to count the votes are certain to make some mistakes here and there, while computers can be programmed to count votes without a single error. The lecturer sais that computers are programmed by humans and therefor even computers can make errors. I think this statment is completely stupid because modern programmers have a lot of experience and the'll test their code before using it in a real scenario.
