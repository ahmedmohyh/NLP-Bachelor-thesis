voting systems

There are two types to count the votes of the people. One possibility is to count the votes by one to one by human beings. The other way is to use computers with programms which are able to count the votes. The traditional voting system is inefficient and inaccurate. People with poor eyesight are  handicaped and they can easily mark the wrong name. It is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes by this amount of votes. The recount after a detected error is expensive and long to to take place.  The voting system of the new genretations will be done on computers. There will be an easy-to-use touch-screen where the voters can mark the name of a certain candidate. The morden voting system has also lacks. There are a lot of people who do not trust in technology and who are not using computers on an daily basis. These people fear the technology. Computer prgramms are made by human beings, so it is inevitable that there can be also miscounts. The problems are, that the miscounts can be removed by the record and that the recount is impossible beacuse of the lacks on the programm.
