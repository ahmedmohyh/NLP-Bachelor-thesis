Critics say that current voting systems are inefficient but are we sure that computerized voting is better than the old stystem? Many of the mistakes in traditional voting are that many people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because of the large sheet of paper and the small mark next to the name. The other thing is that the people count the votes wrong. But are the computerized new systems better? One of the problems are that many people can't afford a computer or many of them can't handle it for exemple the old ones. The trouble is real but the technique are always getting better and we have to go with the time because it is much easier too count the votes without making mistakes. But the other thing is that computer can have errors and the votes also can be miscounted or even be removed is this good? No, many people say it is too risky even it is easier for the voters to vote somebody because they only have to use the touch screen and touch the name. Many people don't want to use the new system because it is expensive for those who can't afford these technological advises. They are afraid of the new and want to stay with the old system because they don't trust the computerized voting, they have more trust in the people who count it by themselves.
