The text states that the traditional voting system in the U.S. is inefficient and inaccurate and therefore should be replaced by a new system; voting on computerised machines. By introducing this new system many dangerous miscounts can be avoided, because human error can be excluded. The computer can make it easier to vote for people with bad eyesight, since they can now zoom in on the names of the candidates.
The lecture, on the other hand, states that the introduction of computerised voting machines creates more problems than it solves. Many people don't have the know-how of how to use a computer or can`t afford such a machine. This may lead to people making more mistakes whilst voting, because they are not familiar with the new system. Furthermore the lecture states that the computers are programmed by humans and that a programming error caused by a human can have worse consequences than a miscount by a huma after the vote. On an additional note during the lecture it is mentioned that a recount is impossible when the voting has been conducted by computers. However, the text states that the new system would make the whole voting process quicker and more accurate. The lecture is more critical towards the new system and says that the voting only takes place every two years and it probably is not yet as good as it can be. it is noz part
