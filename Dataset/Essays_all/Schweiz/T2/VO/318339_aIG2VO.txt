The traditional voting can produce some problems because humans make mistakes, but the problems would be even bigger if there was a computerized voting. 
One point is that people who can not afford a computer or are not used to them will have problems with the computerized voting system, they could get discouraged and embarassed by the technology and maybe would not even vote. The critics say that there are problems with voting the wrong candidate because of poor eyesight but this would be a problem on computers too.
Another point is that humans programme the computers and as we read humans make mistakes. So what if there is a big computer error while voting? The errors can forget to count thousands of votes, a human only a few even if there are inefficient and inaccurate counting of votes with computers there would be more. The thing about the computerized sytseme is that if there is a problem with it there is no way to recount the votes so they are lost. In the traditional voting a long and expensive recount is possible.
The last point is that every systeme had to be improved even our online banking and other stuff that we use daily. They are used often and could be improved daily but the voting systeme would only be used every two years so it has not gone through the process of improving it and will not go through it.
