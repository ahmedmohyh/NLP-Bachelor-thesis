The lector has the following three arguments about computerized voting:

Firstly, not everybody has access to a computer or enough knowledge to use one properly. Reasons for that can be the lack of money or simply the age of the voter. 
Secondly the lector critices the security of the programm. She doens't doubt that humans make mistakes while counting the votes but says that the programm of the voting system gets written by humans as well. And while a mistake made while counting only concerns a few votes, an error in the programm could lead to thousands of mistakes. Moreover, it is possible to recount the votes in the current voting system. With an error in a computer system this possibility gets lost. 
At last she talks about the developpment of the computer programm. Here she mentions that every programm needs a few "run-throughs" until it is perfectly safe. But since we talk about elections that take place every other year she says we cannot allow us to have a programm that is not perfectly safe from the beginning on.

To summarize, the lector is definitely against a computerized voting system. By that, she has the opposit opinion than the writer of the text. The writer says that the government and individuals trust in complex comuter technology every day and does not see a danger in a computerized voting. He even sees a big chance in it because after his opinion, a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong person because of bad eyesight or small texts. And while the lector critizes the safety of computerized voting, the writer only mentions the miscounts made by humans in the traditional voting system.
