The computerized voting system is not much better than the traditional system. People who are not used to handle computers may not vote anymore because they have like a fear of the new technolgy. If people do not vote because of this reason it does not matter if a voter needs only to touch the candidate's name on the screen or not.

Computers also can count false. Becausse humans make errors, it could happen that there is an error in the programm that counts the votes which can affect that thousands of votes are wrong. This is much more problematic than if some officials count some votes wrong.

Computer technology is used every day for example in banking transactions. But the banking system had to be imprvove many times and is used very often. The election occurs only once in 2 yearas so it is not necessary to change the system.
