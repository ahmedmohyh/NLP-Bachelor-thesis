There are two different groups with different meanings about the voting systems in the United States. The first group says, that the old voting system is not efficient. They think, that people can easily write accidentally the wrong candidate on the sheet, or even mark easily the wrong name, when they have poor eyesight. For these people, it is clear: computers would do a better job. 
But is that the truth? Critics say that working with a machine is not better than the vote counting by hand. It is more complicated and the worst thing a human can do wrong by counting votes by hand, is that he misses some, or reads them wrong. But what happens, if a computer has en Error? This would be a huge problem. There would be a throusand of misscounts or all votes could be completely removed. Computers are made by human, and human can do mistakes, even, or especially, when they do a program for a computer.
