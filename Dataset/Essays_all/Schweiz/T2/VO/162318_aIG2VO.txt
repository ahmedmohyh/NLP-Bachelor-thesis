The voting systema in the United Staates are very old. Many people are not happy with the system of counting every single vote by Officials. In theire opinions the voting people can make way to easy mistakes and also the counting by the Officials is to complicated. The criticers want to vote with electronic. They think, that the new system will stop miscounts. Also the people who vote, will make less mistakes because they can only click on the candidate the want to vote for. The Criticer think, that the change is no problem, because the people also deal every day with computer technology, which is very accurate. 

But there are also many people woh don't want to have electronic voting systems. The belive, that computers also can make huge faults. If they make some misstakes they can not just count the votes again they may lose all votes and every single person have to vote again. That would cost a lot of money and the voters maybe dont belive in this system. But the moste importent point is the fact, that they have to test the programs and the problem is, that there are only every two years some votings. So the test would go much to long.
