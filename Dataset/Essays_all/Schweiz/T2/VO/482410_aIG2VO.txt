In the text they write in a critic way about the current voting systems in the USA. They are inefficient and inaccurate. there are often used traditional systems in votings and they should be replaced with computerized voting systems who are far more efficent and trustworthy. One reason due to this critic attitude is, that there were made some wrong votings in the past, because the voters have to find the name of their favourite candidate on a large list. Another reason is, that there are many votes and somebody has to count them. Obviously it's possible that thoese people make errors.

In the listening they had a more negative opinion on the coputerized voting systems. It's difficult to use them for  people who don't use them on a regular basis for example in their job. They say that a human error in a computer system could cause a bigger damage than an error caused by counting. 
another argument, is that the banking computer systems are improved over years and that it isn't possible to do it in the same way with the voting computer systems.
