The subject of the passage and the listening part is the voting system of the United States. 

In the listening part the speaker was sure that computerized voting systems aren't better than the old way of voting by marking a name on the list of all candidates. The woman said that this new system is easy for regular computer users but not for those people who don't work a lot with this kind of electronic item. Computers are a human invention and humans do a lot of natural mistakes. But these errors can cause that the computer is programmed wrong and does the same mistakes, too.

In the given passage it is written that computers are more efficient and thrustworth. The reason for this is that a computer is a robot and doesn't any mistakes. Well, in this point the speaker of the listening part doesn't has the same feeling. Another positive argument for computerized voting systems of the passage is that the counting is much more easy for a robot than for humans. It is quickly and there are a lot less errors.
