In the lisstening part they named a fiew points they don`t match with the points in the written text.
In the lisstening part they said, that computer doesn`t solves the problem. What, if a person had never used a computer before? This is a big problem or if a person can`t afford a computer. It`s a risky as doing the voting traditionally.
Another point is, that the computersystem is also programmed by a human and so they also can include errors. The problem is, that if the error is in the system, the consequences are bigger than if the error hppens by counting the votes. This error would be also much more expensive.
The last thing is, that bank systems are used daily and so they are tested verry well. A vtoting programm is somthing that is used all two years. And because of that it`s not as important that it`s safe than if it`s a bank system programm.
In the written part tey say, that the human counting errors are more bad. So they want to use computers to vote. So they think it`s easyer to match the right name because it`s not as small as it`s on the paper list.
And with the bank system thing they see the oter side. They think, it would be a good idea because also banks use them and so they have to be safe.

To sumarise. They think everything different. In the spoken text they dont want the computers because they think that also they can hafe errors because of being programmed by humens. The others think it the other way round. They see the help of the computer as a advantage because it shouldn`t make mistakes like Humans do by counting the votes trattraditionally. And also the safety is an important aspect. The spoken thext says that is`t not as safe do it tracounting aand This is the main differences between the two statements.
