In the speech the speaker emphasized that computer voting systems are easy to use for users that are used to this kind of technology wherease old people will have difficulties with the correct use of it by for example casting the wrong vote. The text points out the same problem, although regarding the traditinal voting system. Therefore, in both voting systems there could be casted the wrong vote by accident. 
Moreover, human error has been a subject in the speech. The speaker explains that human error can of course be present in the traditinal voting system but she points out that since computers are programmed by humans, the computer voting system is also affected by human error. The author of the text seems to have forgotten about that crucial fact. 
Furthermore, the speaker points out that defects in a computer voting system are way more serious than in the traditinal voting system. While in the traditinal system only a few mistakes could happen, a defect in the computer voting system can lead to millions of discounted votes. The text does not take account of that. In the text computers seem to be mistakeless.
Lastly, according to the speaker it is difficult to develop confindence in a computer voting system, because it will be used rarely. In the United States there is a voting once every two years whereas the computerized banking system is used every day. The text points out that we trust the banking computer system as well so why not trust the computer banking system? The opinions are therefore different.
