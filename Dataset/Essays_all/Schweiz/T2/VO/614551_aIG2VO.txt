Is it easyer or better to vote with the traditional voting system or with omputers?
 
The traditional voting has some problems. For example for persons who can't see that much it is really difficult to find the the right candidate on the namelist. Easily they can mark the wrong candidate. Secondly to count the votes is takes a long time and easyly the counting persons can count wrong. And if an error is found they have to recount the votes and it takes longer time. 

Because of this arguments from the criticants they are trying to find a better system for example the computervoting.

With computers the counting is much easyer, but critics say that the computer can also make errors if the persons who installed the computerprogramm made some errors. So we aren't shure that the computers make the same job. Another point is also, that for persons who use computers often or daily it is much easier to vote, but people who don't use computers usually they can have trubbles and struggle with the new voting system. 

Both of the to systems have positive and negative aspects. But it is important that we are thinking about a better way to vote.
