According to the presentation computerized voting can be difficult to people who aren't confident with these new technologies. They have fear to the new technologies and they could even give a wrong vote because they don't know how to use these touchscreens.
Humans can make errors too but they can't be as crucial as the errors from a computer. An official could hardly miscount a few ballots or let them even out, but a computer can make errors too, since they're programmed by humans these errors can cause that thousands of votes can be erased or miscounted. The errors of a computer can cause more problems than a humans error. The people are called to revote again, maybe the winner of the last vote couldn't be the new winner. An error form an official can't cause so much the most convenient thing is that the votes should be recounted.
Due to the computerized systems the government could lose the voters confidence and all the trust of the american voting system would be gone.
