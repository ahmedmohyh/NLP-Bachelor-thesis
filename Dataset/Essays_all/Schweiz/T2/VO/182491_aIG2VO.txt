In the presentation it is mentioned that computers are in many ways not really better than humans because they are prorammed. Other than in the text the lecturer said, that computer votings maybe seem easy but what about people that are not used to computers on a daily basis? Others maybe can not even afford a computer so they would be not satisfied about the votes on a computer like it has been said in the text. They would be really afraid to go and give their vote. So they fear the technology and would better give their vote like now on a paper.
Because eventhough mistakes can happen if humans count the votes, these mistakes would not be as serious as if a computer made some. Because they are programmed by humans, errors would be far more serious. So it is not like in the text where they said, that it is a problem that we have to rely on humans that are counting thousands of ballots. The problem here is that a mistake on a false programmed computer could make thousands of errors and not a few like it happens when people are counting the votes. So eventhough we use modern technology every day and it has been improved we have to be aware what the risks are. Because serious errors can not be made in the United States where there are votes barely all two years with millions of people who are voting. 
So we have to ask ourselves which system the safer is - The traditional voting or the advanced computer voting?
