I'm going to write about the pro's and con's of two different voting systems. The first one are the ones which are used in most of the countries, the ones which are counted by humans. The other one, are the electonic votings on computers.
The first point of the presentation was, the using of computers. For people which are used to computers and can handle them, it's quite easy to do votings on this electronic device. But when it comes to people which can't efford a computer, there will be a lot of trouble. And in the worst case, the may not even vote, because they can't work with a computer. The next point is related to the counting of the elections. So while people can make a few errors in counting, computers are instruced by humans and can be easely manipulated. When somebody recognizes an error in the counting, it's easy to recount it. But the votes on the computer can't be proofed. In the text, there are listed a few other points. They see the problems in the one's who vote. It's said that a few people aren't able to mark the person they originally wanted to vote. They either can't read the names because of their eyes or they accidently choose somebody else. They also say, that recounts are very long and expensive, while computer do everything quickly and automatically.
