Nowadays they use computer voting systems in the USA. But critics want to have back the old system. They argue with statements like, human are doing this programmes and if they do an human mistakes during programming the systems, it will be a bigger disaster than on the traditional way. On the other hand they have to think about if there's a technical problem, than a recount is impossible. If you did it on the old way, you've got still the possibility to do a recount. Especially if there's a close contest. Here we shouldn't forget that a recount is very expensive. And it would be a big afford to do a recount in the USA. Another big lack of the traditional version is, that people, which have got problems with their eyes, run into a risk, that they mark the wrong candidate. Here the profounder of the computer system mention that on the new programm you can just point on the name of your favourite candidate, and you voted.
