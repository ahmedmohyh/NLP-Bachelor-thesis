In the presentation the speaker clearly showed some doubts about computerized voting. In summary there were three main points made. Firt off, people who are used to using a computer will for sure not have any problems, but for people who don't use or can't afford them it's going to be a more challening task. People who don't know how to use them correctly could easily make a wrong vote or could be turned off voting in the future.Amajor problem in the text seems to be the task of counting, because of the human errors tat could happen, but the same possibility is mentioned in the presentation. Since,there could be errors made by the computers based on a defective programm, which could lead to thousands of wrong votes and in such a case a recount would be absolutely imossible, since there are no physical votes. Another point is that the mentioned computerized systems for banking are under heavy, daily usage beacause of which they were constantly improved. This compares to the argument of the text where it is argued that we use computerized technoloy daily even for highly sensitive topics.  Elections only happen every four years, or two times a year, with not as many oppurtunities to see flaws in the system you can't really improve them either.
