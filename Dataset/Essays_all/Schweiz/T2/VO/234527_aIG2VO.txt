In the text it says, that the voiting system in the USA is inefficient and too old. It causes too much errores who can be sloved if computer would over take the work for the people who are counting the ballot. Futher more many people can not see or find the name of theri candidat and mark the fals name. So they are saying let's give technology the power of the voting system in the USA. But the other side clearly says that computer won't make it any better. There are many people who don't use the computer very often or never. They have fear of technology and then they could not vote. Also it says, that computer are programmed by humans so the argument that people are counting fals doesn't count beacuse they would be much more faults if a computer programm is fals programmed caused by a human. Also many programms need time to improove and the votings nationwide only happen all 2 years so the programm could not improve and would cause many errores.
