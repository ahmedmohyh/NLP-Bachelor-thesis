Many people in the United States are convinces that the current voting system is extremely inefficient and faulty. Because of the small written pages it easily happens that you vote for the wrong candidate. The traditional way includes an awfully huge amount of work. Next to the work it's very possible to miscount the ballots. The counters are human beings and they might easily make one or two faults in their job. Those are the reasons why many people are intrested in a new and modern way of voting. They adore the technology and they'd rather vote on the comuptuer. This solution might also be extremely doughtful. Computers are expensive and modern. Many old people are not used to computers and will never get along with them. They will not even get the chance to vote and to share their opinion. Another problem is the money. In the United States every single person must have the chance to vote and say what they want. If the voting happens through computers, many families won't be able to afford them and will neither be able to vote. If the United States loose the votes of poor human beings having problems with the political system, the situation will never get better for them and they'll never end up being happy with the state they're living in.
