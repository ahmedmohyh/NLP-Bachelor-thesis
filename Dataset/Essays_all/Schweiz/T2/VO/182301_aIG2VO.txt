In the presentation the woman mentioned that people doubted an improvement through computers used in the counting of ballots. She said that it might be easier for those who use computer daily but not for those who either don't use computers at all or who just can't affort one. In the text it is said that the computers will have an easy-to-use touch screen technology, which is a point against that argument.

She admitted that people make mistakes during the counting of the ballots but she also pointed out that the computers and the programs are made by human, so if an error is implied in a computer which is used in the counting of the ballots, that error might affect the whole elections by miscounting in the number of thousands. In the text there is not an argument against that statement, more a conviction that the computers will erase the possibility of human error.

She also said that all the other computerized systems, such as banking systems are used daily and therefore were constantly upgraded and improved. The election only happens once in a four years time period so they will be errors at the beginning just as it was with the computerized banking systems at the beginning and it is not worth the costs and effort to improve those computers for the election since it only happens once in four years. At the same time, the text mentions the mistrust people have on computers but seem to forget that humanity already relies on computers in any sort of daily life. But still no argument against the statement from the audio, since she talked about those systems and did not deny their existence but she argumented that those systems are constantly upgraded because of daily use.
