The person in the hearing part said, that computerized voting wouldn't make voting any better. Some people don't have the money to buy a computer or some are just to old for the voting system. She also mentioned, that computers also can make mistakes, because computers are programmed by humans. So that means it could be possible, that it would have mistake. In other words it would be a Human error. Some people don't really understand the technics from a computer so it could be possible, that they would click the wrong button. Also hacking could be a problem espacially for the votings. The systems are used daily, but votings are only used one time (or maybe twice) in a year, so that would also be a problem for the system.

Some of these argumments are really good. Espacially the hacking problem with the system. It could also manipulate many of these political votes and change our lifes. If there is really an ,,easy-to-use touch-screen'', would it be still for many person with a poor eyesight a problem, because they wouldn't still see the names of the candidats. Many of these people would accedentially press the wrong button and as a result the wrong person for example would be chosen.

So all in all we don't have to technolize our voting systems, because the system is already a big problem for human species.
