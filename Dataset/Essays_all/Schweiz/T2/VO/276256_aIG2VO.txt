There are many talks about the current voting system used in the United States. Also the last election of the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, made much critizism on the voting system of the United states. In the following, I will show you different arguements.
Firstly the positive side of the election system of the United States of America. When people have to choose a candidate on a paper, they can be really accurate and can vote for one of a large number of names. 
But there are not only postive arguements, there is also a negative side. The most important point is the reality, that older people can have for example poor eyesights or other yllnisses which can influence the election. Another important arguement to mention is how expensive the traditional votings are. There are millions of dollars need for such a voting. And if there is a decision for making a re-voting in cause of any mistakes, there are again millions of dollars taken. Besides thast, it is extremely heavy to find a better way for a voting system, because for example a computer based voting could end bad if the program is not created well or if there are hackers.
At the end, America should keep the traditional voting system, because the other ways of voting are currently not well.
