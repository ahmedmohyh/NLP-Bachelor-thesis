In this short essay I want to thalk that voting is one of the important thing of the world and that it is not safe sometimes.

The people could vote with the computer and this is a advantage, because it is easely to vote. Maybe there are more people who want to vote, because it is faster for the electer. 
It is a fact that sometimes people do a misstake at the computer, because they vote for the wrong candidate and this is a problem, because the election is wrong. ¨
This problem is so little that the state wants to bring this technology and that the state wants to finish with the old system.
I think that an other problem is that the older generation do not vote with the new system, because they mean it would not be safe and I would be sabotage. 

For my conclusion is important that the voting is correct and fair. the state have to look at the election and have to be fair for all electer's.
