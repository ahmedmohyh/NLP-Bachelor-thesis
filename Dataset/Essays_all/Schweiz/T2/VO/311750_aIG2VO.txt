The presentation talking about the implemetation of computers in the US voting system had several points arguing that computers should not replace the traditional voting system. One of the concerns the presentator had, was that many people can't afford, or decided not to use a computer. These persons are not familiar with the way you operate new devices and therefore could vote for the wrong person, or decide not to vote bacause they fear the new tecnology. It is not metioned in the text that some people are unable to use a computer but it mentiones, that the computer helps the voters to view the canidates name with a magnifying option and can therefore prevent inaccuracies caused by the many names on the voting sheet. Another concern of the presentator is that when copmuters make mistakes it is much graver, than when people make mistakes, a computer caused mistake could lead to the loss of the votes,because it is programmed by humans, but a human mistake leads to a recount of the votes. The text says that an error caused by a computer is highly improbable and can be resolved quickly.
