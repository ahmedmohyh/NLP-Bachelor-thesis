Nowadays, voting is a big deal. In the times of Mr. Trump voting has become a lot more important than ever. But traditional voting systems have their problems. They can easily lead to a innaccurate counting of votes. Another problem is that these traditional voting have to be counted by humans and humans often do errors. The question is now, what would be a better solution for a typical voting than the normal ballot type? In the text above, the only relevant solution are the computers. In the text it is mentioned that computers can help to reduce errors, like counting wrong or ticking the wrong name on a list. On the other hand, it was mentioned in the presentation before, that also computers can make errors, for example, when they have been programmed wrong.Computers can also be terrifying for people, who don't work all day with these machines and are scared to use them. If this people don't go voting because of their fear of computers, that would be a bad thing.The point, that governments and other instituions are using computer programms every day, is also in the text above. But this don't have to be argument for computer based voting, according to the presentation. There it was said, that these gouvernments use this programms every day or far more. Computer voting programms on the other hand would be only used all two years or far less, so they can't be used properly. There has to be another solution, than computer - based - voting!
