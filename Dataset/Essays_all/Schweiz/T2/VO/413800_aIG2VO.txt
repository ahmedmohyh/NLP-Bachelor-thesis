The presentation said that computerized voting isn't the best solution to vote in the USA. It brings a lot of problems with it. For example, the poorer americans doesn't have computers so they can't vote or if there is an error in the voting programm all the 1000 of votes get lost. It is also hard to develop the voting programm because there are only all two years elections and that is to rarley to develop the programm as good as it should be.

In contrast the text said that the traditional voting brings to much trouble with it. People accidentally vote for the wrong candidate and it would be much easier if they could vote with a voting programm. Officials must often count up the votes one by one. If this would overtake a computer and remove by this the possibility of human error. The other side, the presentation, said it would bring more problems with it than it would remove. The programm is made by humans hand so there are faults in it for sure and it is more worse to control the system than to count the votes in the ballots by hand.
