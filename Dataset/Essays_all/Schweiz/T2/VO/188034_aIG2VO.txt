Technological advance in political elections

Rumours about human errors are widely spread in america, talking about voting. In history there have been so many heated debates about how accurate this voting system is. Think about Al' Gore and Bush. We make technological advances in every industry, so why not in voting, wich is a topic which affects all humans on earth.
With computerized voting, the costs of an election could be decreased so much. And the participation of younger adults would be much higher, because voting would be so easy via computer. It could also reduce the possibility of human error.
But on the negative side, a computer is just as intelligent as his developer and every thing that is digital toaday, can and will be hacked, especially if it's somthing that important as elections of the next president of the free world, as the americans like to say. If this case occures, then there would be no physical evidence, just maybe some digital footprints of the hacker.
There are also just a few people who would understand the algorhytm behind the digital voting system, which is also a risk of manipulation.
And even though younger adults get motivated to vote, the elderly people would be discouraged, because they're not used to computers or even don't have one.
