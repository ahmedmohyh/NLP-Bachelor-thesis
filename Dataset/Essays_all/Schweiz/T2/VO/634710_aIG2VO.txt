The writing sais that the computer voting is more easy too vote for the candidate because in the traditional voting you hardly can't find the name of the candidate on your sheet. But in the speech the person said that it's also a problem to vote with computer voting because there are still many people that aren't used to cope with computers. They said if the votings are count one by one by people there are easily done mistakes and computer wouldn't do this. But in the speech they said if a computer counted the votings wrong and this is possible to happen it would have been a major problem and very hard to start again counting the votes because of the technical systems.
Critic people about the traditional voting want to replace them with computer votings but there are also risks with computer voting and probably the people that aren't used to computers will stopp voting becuase they don't know how it works. In computer voting systems its easier to find the name because you could just use the touchscreen.
