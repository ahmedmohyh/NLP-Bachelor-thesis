The voting systems in the United States has been critisised a lot latley. Because the voting system at the moment is not really efficient and the couting of the votes isn't either and also the voters are making a lot of faults while voting. Now, a new computerized voting system is going to help, but is it clear, that this voting system will be more efficient?

As already said there are some problems with the current voting system. The first one is, that voters accidently vote for the wrong person because they can't read the name on the sheets. So without knowing they make a mark next to a "wrong" candidate and there is already a mistake in the voting. Furthermore, while counting the votes happen a lot oh miscountings to. Sometimes even 10000 of votes won't get counted just because someone forgot them.

On he other hand, you can't be sure that a computerized voting system will make all this problems go away. It's clear that persons who are known to computers will be happy if a new system will come, but for examle an old person will be scared to use a computer where he doesn't understand anything a all. Also, why should a person trust a computer? A computer can make as many faults as a person and is also installated from a person. So there are some spectical aspects too. Well, here you could say, that people know shouldn't make such a big deal out of it, because all our financial stuff is also handled by computer programms. But actually, these programms had to be perfectioned, because in the beginning these programms had a lot of faults in it. And in a voting systhem wou can't provoce such faults. 

So we can see, that there are goods and bads about both ways of voting. Mabey the people wait mabey two or three years till the programm is perfect and the people are less sceptical to replace the old system with the new one.
