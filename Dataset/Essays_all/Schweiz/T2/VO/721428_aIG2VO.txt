Critics say, that traditional voting systems are inefficient and inaccurate and that they should be replaced by a computerized voting system. The record tells us about the problems with such a new system and opposes the arguments of those critics.

Computerized voting might be more easy for those, who are used to computers. But what is with the ones, who don't belong to the "digital generation", or those, who can't afford a computer? For them them the new voting system might be too complicated, and they will make mistakes or even won't vote anymore - which is far not the aim of changing the voting system.

Critics see a problem with people counting up the ballots one by one. Maybe they are right and the people who count make a few mistakes, but it won't really matter if there is one vote more or less. A far bigger damage would occur, if the computer system which counts the notes has an error. We should not forget, that this program would also be men-programmed. Until a damage in the counting program would be detected, there would be thousands of votes which were miscounted. 

Of course we use complex computer technology every day. But this are systems which have were developped over years, and at the beginning they didn't function as good as today. People learned to trust these systems, because they are often used and they now, that there are nearly no mistakes. If the computerized voting system would be introduced, how could people trust it, if they don't have any reference to the past? There aren't enough elections to establish a trustworthiness and to ameliorate the system so that everyone can see the progress.
