The text obiously is in favour of computer voting and the lecture is against it. 
The text states the human error and inaccuarcy as the main argument in favour of the computer voting system. It is said that especially when there is a close contest mistkes can easely happen. When soemthing like that happens an expensive recount has to take place. Also an argument for the computer system is concernig people with poor eyesight. For them it sometimes is not easy to marke the right name on the voting ballot and the mark the wrong name by accident. It also says that the human uses computerized systems everyday in many ways for example their finances and noone says anything against that.

In the lecture you can hear that the lucturer is against the computerized voting system. Especially for people that can not afford to buy a computer or are not used to use one ora any other kind of newer technology it can be very problematic or even a discouragement for voting. Also a very important point is that obviously errors while counting can happen but what happens when there is an error in the system? That would be bad enough but afterwards it would be impossible to recount the election. Another argument stated in opposition to the text ist that computerized sytsems such as the financial system had there errors and mistakes in the beinning as well and were improved by using them over and over again. People use this system every day but the voting only takes place onces in every two years. 

To sum it all up as it can be seen it is a very controversial subject but very important as the USA is split about it. People want to hold onto the traditional way others want to finally give new technology a try. It will probably get very interesting in the next fews years and maybe there is a vote about that as well.
