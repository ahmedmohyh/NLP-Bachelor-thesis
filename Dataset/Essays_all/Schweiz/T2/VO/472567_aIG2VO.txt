The presentation says that that computer voting isn't better than hand voting. People who are aware of computers softwares can vote easily online but peolpe who are not so good in the use of computers or generally technic can't vote good on computers. One argumetn for this is that the wrong vote could be chosen very easy. The text says that it's easier to vote on computer for all the people.

In the presentation it's also mentioned that computer voting could make even more mistakes than hand counting of the votes. But in the text it says that computer counting of the votes makes less mistakes and is more trustworthy. By hand you miss only some votes and the votes can be counted once again by an other person and this three times. A arecounting by computer is very complicated and difficult to start because of the data. This isn't mentioned in the text like that. The text says computers make less mistakes than humans. But a computer programm for counting votes is also created by humans so it can bring even more faults with it than the counting by hand. 

In the text it's mentioned that governments and individuals trust other technologys every day. For example in online banking or shopping,... Also in the presentation this argument is mentioned like this. 

The text says that in traditional voting it's easy to make a wrong vote but the presentation says that it's much easier to vote wrong by computer. On computer you can click one time and you can't correct but on a paper you can correct your tick or whatever.
