The woman argues about the usefullnes of a voting system with computers. In contrast to the text, which says that the digital voting system is easy to use, she thinks, that voting with computers is too hard for people, who can't access a computer regularily. This is going to scare or even discourage thesepeople off voting. An other point of her is the relaiability of these computer programs. They have to be programmed by humans, who can make mistakes and if there is a mistake, it's irreversible. A mistake in the program has way more influence than an error in counting, as the text says. This program needs testing to erase mistakes, which is impossible with its use only once a year.
