In the text they say that the traditional system is inaccurate and lot of mistakes can happen. But in the presentation they have the argument that if humans make mistakes they will pass it on to the programms they make so the computerized system will also have it's errors and than it can be even more inaccurate. Also in the text they talk about how hard the old system can be for people whith poor eyesight but it's not easier for them with the computer and also not everyone can afford a computer so they can't vote. Another fact is that not everyone uses it often enough and they don't really know how to use a computer and it's programms, so it's still hard for people to vote. Maybe there won't be that many mistakes anymore but less people voting. 
Finally the text says that the new sytsem is more trustworthy. But can we trust the computers? Because all banking programms had their errors aswell and they had to be redone and renewed alot of times before they became trustworthy as they are today.
