Is a traditional voting system or a computerized voting system better? This is the mmain question regarding the article and the presentation.

On the one hand, voting on computers would be more easy and fewver mistakes on accidental making a mark next to the wrong candidate would happen. On the other hand, people who aren't used with computers can't handle them which includes especially older people. 

Humans make mistakes by counting the ballots, it is nearly impossible not to make any. Moreover, recounts are quite expensive. But computers are programmed by humans. So if there's an error in the computer programme it is much worse. Because then, a recount is impossible.

However, our daily life is based on computers; we trust them with our banking and many other things. But these commupter programmes exist for quite long and they had to be improved because they weren't perfect. On contrary, voting happens only once a year, so the mistakes would be more heavy.
