In the presentation they talked about voting and counting the votes with the computer. 
Obviously they had no clue what they were talking about. They pretty much said it makes more sense to let a human count the votes instead of a computer. I mean I know, americans can be retarded. 
But like in 99.9% of the cases a computer does a better job at counting things than a human could ever do. Or can you multiply 12414124141 x 12657567573? no. 
They've said a computer was also build by humans and that it took alot of time to get them were they are today.
Yes. But as they said themselves, computers are super-high developed nowadays. How can u possibly say something like, it makes less errors than a human.
