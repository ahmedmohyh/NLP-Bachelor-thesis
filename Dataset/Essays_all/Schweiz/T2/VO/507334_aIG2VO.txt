while some people say that the old voting system is inefficient others say that a new computer managed system would be unreliable and maybe even more inefficient.
one argument against the old system is that people with poor eyesight could be ticking the wrong name.
supporters of the old system say that these problems could happen just as easily with computers, especially when it comes to people who aren`t familiar with them. Those people might even be interely discouraged in voting.
An other problem with the traditional way of counting votes is that it`s done by people who have to go through thousands of ballots and record them. Its almost inevitable that mistakes will happen. In this case we`re talking about maybe 3 votes in a thousand that are false, where as mistakes made by computers are a lot heavier. If all the votes are made online it will be impossible to make a physical recount if a mistake is suspected.
It`s true that we rely on computers everyday with important stuff but it`s also true that all of these systems had initial problems. So is it save to trust computers made by humans without ever really testing it on a thing that is so important?
