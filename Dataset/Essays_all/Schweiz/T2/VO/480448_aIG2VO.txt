Computerized voting systems also have some negativ aspects especially for older people who did not grow up with computers. It is possible that this persons would be confused by the computer program and stop voting at all. An other important aspect are the possible errors caused by a fault in the script of the program. Of course human sometimes do some mistakes but this are just a few misscounted votes and you are able to recount them but if there is an error in the script thousends of votes could be misscounted or even worse deleted. Critics often say that we also use computer programs for important things like ebanking or to save personal data but this programs are used every day and were updated many times before working fluently. Comparised to that national votes take place just every second year.

As you see there are like in every discussion pros and cons. All in all you can say that there are to many risks in chanching the voting system and that our actuell voting system works pretty good.
