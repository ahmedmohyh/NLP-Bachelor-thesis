Whilst the text is positively opinionated to the idea of using computers for voting in the USA, the lecture is pretty much fully against using computers in voting.

One of the first points made by the lecturer is that it is doubtfull that computers will do a better job than humans. The text points out that humans are bound to make flaws when they have to count out every single ballot by hand, leading to inaccuracies. The lecturer brings up the point that the programs that would be used for voting all are made by humans, meaning that they themselves could have flaws in them, which could have a greater impact on the voting. Where a human counter would count one or two ballots wrong, the program could wrongly count, or even delete thousands of votes.

The text also goes to say that computers would beeasier to use for people with bad sight and for older people, as they could magnify the text onscreen, allowing them to better see what they are clicking on. "But what about the people that have no experience with computers? They'll mistrust them or maybe even fear to use them", the lecturer would counter-argue.

Finally, the text states that people trust technology each day, so why shouldn't we use them in voting too? The lecture also has an answer to this. Everyday programs and computers have been tested and used for many years, always being improved upon. We can't do that with voting programs, as people only vote once to twice a year,which means it would take decades to improve voting programs, contrary to everyday programs that could be improved massively in a fortnight.
