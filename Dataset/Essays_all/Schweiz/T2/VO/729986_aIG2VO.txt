Electronical voting technology will not necessarily make the current voting system better for everyone. It will be easier for people who are experienced with computers, but people that don't use them often (maybe because they can't even efort them) or are even afraid of mordern technology will have trouble.
Of course, humans make mistakes when they are counting the votes, but computers are also programmed by humans. So they could also do an error and these might be much worse, because humans are maybe missing a few votes, but in computers a lot of data, for exemple from a whole region, could be lost. Also, the error probably wa't be detected
The argument that computers are regulary used in bancing transanctions and the communication of highly sensitive information isn't so good, because there they are used daily. In the beginning, this technology wasn't very good, but it has developped to the point where it is now. For voting systems, the whole process have to be done again.

So it is clear that computers are not the perfect solution, and there are arguments that for and against them. Maybe we should vote about this topic and hope that the system will be good enough to represent the opinion of the people.
