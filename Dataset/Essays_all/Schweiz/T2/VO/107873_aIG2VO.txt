Elections are and will be very important for the whole nation so it is important to find a way that the voting procedure is as accurate and efficent as possible.

There was mentioned that it could be a problem that some could chose the wrong vote because of a bad eyesight is solved by using a computer system where you just need to touch the candiate you want but if you aren't familiar with computers or can not afford one you aren't able to vote.
In the traditional way there are few mistakes the officials make while counting the votes there is no doubt because they need to count vote by vote and if there is made a mistake a expensive recount has to take place but important to say is that a recount is possible while a recount in a damaged computer system isn't possible. 
Computers are also made by humans and because of that there is still a possibility that they aren't perfect and have their bugs and if there is a bug it will effect the voting stronger than the few mistakes made by officers who count the votes. That a computer technology of a bank works flawless isn't just luck there was a lot of improvement needed and there where bugs so the fear that in the rearly used computer technology for voting there would be a higher risk of computer bugs.
