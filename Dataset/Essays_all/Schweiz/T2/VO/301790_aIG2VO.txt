The woman in the audio finds it doubtful that computerized voting is better then the traditional voting systeme, because not everybody can afford to have an computer and most people couldn't even handle the new technology
There is the argument that if a computer programm has minor tecnical problem so the voting could be severely inaccurate, because when a human makes a fault in counting the votes, it would be by far less dramatic then when the computer makes a systematic fault, which influences the whole voting.  Also problematic is the lack of these computerprogramms of recounting the votes, this makes a fair votation impossible. The arguments between the twopaties are like black and white. The text is clearly pro computer and the audio is against it in any point.
