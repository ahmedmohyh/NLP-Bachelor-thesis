The texts suggests that a computerized voting system would be a better alternative to thetraditional system. 
It says, that many people mark the wrong canditate on their ballot, because they have poor eyesight and can't read the names properly. The text suggests that these mistakes would be diminished on a computer because one can magnify the names. This would result in less mistakes when voting.
However the listening sequence said that a problem would be that people who aren't used to using computers or who can't afford one wouldn't be able to vote anymore. 
The text also says that there is a high risk of human error in the traditional voting system which can lead to expensive recounts. With computers human error would be removed. 
But the listening sequence made a point, that computers are programmed by humans, so there's still a risk of human error in the program. Such a programmed mistake would have a much more significant impact on the votes than officials miscounting. It could lead to thousands of votes being mscounted or even lost. Also, with the computerized system, recounts would not be possible.
The last pro argument the text mentions for the computerized system that people already trust computer systems in so many other fields like banking transactions. If one can trust computers with transactions, one can also trust them with voting, the text says. 
The listening sequence opposes that again by saying that we make transactions on everyday basis an that the systems weren't perfect from the beginning but that one noticed mistakes through the users. This noticing of errors once the system is being used does ot work in the case of a voting system because it is only used every other year, so there would be no process of detecting mistakes within the process.
