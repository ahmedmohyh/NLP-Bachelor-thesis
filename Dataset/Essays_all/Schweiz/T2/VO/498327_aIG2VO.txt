Traditional votings have their problems. But are the computerized votings better than the traditionals? It's easier to vote with an tablat, that's true, but there are many people in the world who don't have a computer or money to buy one. People say that the humans make lots of mistakes by counting the ballots. But does the computer make a better job? These computers were also made by humans. If the computers make mistakes while counting the votes there is no possibility to recaunt the votes. 
But in the text bellow we can read about the problems with the traditional voting system. People have to find the name of their favourite candidat on a large list of name, that is called a ballot. But people which have probnlems with their eyes can easily mark the wrong name on the list. If those people use the computerized voting they can magnify the names on the tablet fo easier viewing. There is an other major problem mentioned. The people have to count the ballots one by one. So it's easy to make mistakes. The computer would count he votes quicklier and automatically. So the human mistakes could be removed by the computerized voting system.
To summe up, the computerized voting system has many advantages. But we don't know if thei don't make errors becaues the were also made of humains.
