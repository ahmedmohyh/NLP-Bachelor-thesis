I've heard and read many a good point both for and against a computerized voting system. While the text, for example, said that a computerized voting system can eliminate the possibility of human error while counting votes, the presentation of the topic said that human error isn't eliminated by computer programms, as they are written by humans and could have bugs in them that make a lot of votes miscounted or dissapear. in such a case, votes on paper can simply be recounted, while the ones made by computer can not. Another argument that was brought up was that computers are generally easier to use, as with a click on a name you can hand in your vote and the text is even able to get bigger if you have bad eyes or problems reading. while this is certainly true, the counter argument was about people who don't use computers a lot, either because they don't need or want them or because the modern technology scares people away from voting all-together. The last point made was about trusting technology. The text used bank systems that are managed by computers and people who trust them without a second thought. As a counter argument the presentation used the fact that these systems are used a lot more than the voting systems, with the latter only being used a few times a year locally and only once every two years on a nation wide level, and needed a lot of time to improve and work without problems.
