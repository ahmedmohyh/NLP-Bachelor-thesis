Many people mistrust computersysems because they dont have experience with them. But thats wrong. Our world is technicalising and progressing more and more into a digital world. Thats why all people have to learn how to work with computers.

Now some people also want to make votings digital because the counting is much quicker and less faults happen with counting by computers. They see it as a big problem that the votes are counted by humans. Others say that you can eliminate human error by letting the computer do all the work because even computers are programmed by humans. To add to this, one fault in a computerwritten votecountingprogramm could have fatal results and a fault by a human counting the votes changes only one ballot. 
Furthermore, some people critizise that the old voting system is hard to use and inaccurate because a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. The ballot has an immense number of names on it and they are mostly written very small which leads to many people with poor eyesight voting for the wrong candidate. Where at the omputer you can just click on the name and you have already casted your vote and you can even magnify the ballot to see it better. Followers of the old system think that a digital system is hard to use for people who dont know how computers work which can also lead to accidentally casting a vote for the wrong person. To say more, some people don't even possess a computer. How should they vote then?
There are also voices that say the new system isn't trustworthy. Others think it is because we also do our bank interactions digitaly.
