it's not easy to change from th e traditionally votin system to a new, computer based, systeme. many people can't use a computer or th ecan't afford one. the programm must be written by humains, but if the make mistakes by the traditionally countigs, why should the not do any mistakes by writing the programm? a voting programm is not the same as a bank or a email programm. it has to work y the first time and there is no room to correct mistakes. 
by the traditionally system is it possible, that some votes get wrongly counted but it's on both siedes, so in the end it don't matter.  but in a computer programm is it possible that thousends of votes get counted wrongly. 

the text isn't at the same meaning as the audio. the say it's much faster to count votes with computer. and also is the fail chance much smaller than the humanity is knows enought about computer programms to write a save one for counting votes. also could they save money because if a counting mistake happend, there also millions of dollers to invest to correct the mistakes.
