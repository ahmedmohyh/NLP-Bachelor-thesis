The presentation and the lecture is about the voting system in the United States. I am going to summarise both of them, the summary and the lecture.
It saies in the lecture, that the traditional voting system is inefficient and leads to an inaccurate counting of votes. There are many names on a voting sheets and if a person can not seperate two names it is possible, that he is voting for the wrong person. The traditional voting system is even bad for those who cannot see that far because they could easily mark the wrong name. The critics think that it would be easier with trustworthy computerized voting systems. It is natural that humans are making mistakes and you cannot allow mistakes at a votingday.
At the presentation she saied that there are people who cannot afford a computer or people who does not even know how to use one of them. So if the voting system would be computerized those few people could vote the wrong person or not even be able to vote anybody. And what if a computer makes a mistake? If a person makes a mistake you have to yount ever vote again but with the computer many votes could disappear. 
Personally I think that we should change the voting system. We do not live in the past. Nearly every person knows how to use a computer and if there would be some computers at the voting day for everybody it would not be a problem. We need to go a step forward and not looking back, that is how human are able to succeed.
