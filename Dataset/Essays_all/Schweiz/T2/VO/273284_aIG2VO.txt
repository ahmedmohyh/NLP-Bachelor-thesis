First of all what is mentioned in the text is how damaging inaccuracy can be for an election but the lecture was mentioning the fact, that if a computerized voting fails, there is no way to recount the votes. Whereas, when people who count make a mistake, it is possible to recount the votes.

Now the question occurs what is worse, if you lose a couple votes through human mistake, because not every ballot was counted correctly or to loose thousands of votes because a computer system faild, created by humans.
Considering, that people usually have to vote once every two years, is there really a computer programm developed and tested enough to use?

Another downside to the computerized voting system is, that people who hardly ever use computers, would face a lot of difficulties in filling out the forms. For some it could also be very discouranging, because they are afraid to vote on a computer or afraid to make mistakes. These possible problems are not even mentioned in the text.
