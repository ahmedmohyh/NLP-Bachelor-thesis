While we read arguments for a replacement of the voting system of the US in the text, the listening part is a critic of this idea. 

The writer says that the current voting system of the US was inefficient and inacurrent in the counting of the votes. For example, old people would have problems to find the people they want to choose on the large piece of paper. If we have so much trust in the technic, like for banking transactions or the communication of highly sensitive information, why shouldn't we trust in a simple counting program? 

On the other hand, the speaker is against replacing the counting system. He has two reasons for that. The first one is, that there are people that aren't used to work with computers. The dangers out of this are, that they don't vote anymore or that they vote for the wrong person. The second reason is, that he/she is fearing errors in programmes. At the moment the mistakes can't change much. But if there was a error in the program, this could manipulate thousands of votes. Also it would took long to trust the new system, because nationally votes are just every second year.
