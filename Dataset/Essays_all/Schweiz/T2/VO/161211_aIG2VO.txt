Technologie. It is the maine Aspect which describes our present. Technologie is very young in the worlds evolution and it is created by humans. Nowadays we do almost everything with technologie help. In fact also the voting system turns into technical system. People who were grown up with technologie have less problem than people who have to learn all that stuff after they have grwon up. Perhaps the old People nowadays. They have no idea what to do with a computer and how to use it. Why should they know it? They have not learn it at all in their lives. So the Problems in the voting system starts. People with no idea of computers are not able to vote or to vote for the right person, although it says that it is an easy-to-use-touchscreen technologie. When preople have not learn something everything seems difficult except technologie. Technologie is really difficult.
it is a traditional Problem which is present. In fact computers are made by human beeings and if an error comes out, it is because a human has creat it.
