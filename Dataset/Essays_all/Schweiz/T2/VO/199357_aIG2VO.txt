One arguement for the implementation of technology is that people with bad eyesight or another type of disability can accidently vote for another candidate they didn't want to vote for. With a computerized voting system people will be able to touch the name of the candidate they want to elect and if they suffer, for example from an eye disease, they can enlargen the screen. Also with manual counting of ballots it is obvious that there will be errors in the counting of the votes. Thus there will be an inaccurate outcome and the counters are forced to do it again; a costly thing. Not to forget is that with a higly contested election few votes can decide much. But on the other hand the digitalisation of voting causes new problems. Many people don't use computers on a daily basis therefore they are far more prone to make mistakes than with traditional voting. Furthermore they can even feel discouraged to vote since they aren't willing to try out the new system. Another point is that since the voting system was programmed by humans there's the risk that there will be mistakes in the programming. In the worst case the votes can be lost. Since elections in the US are not exactly common one won't use this technology that often, so erros can't be found on a regular basis. All in all the listening is against modern voting and the text is for it.
