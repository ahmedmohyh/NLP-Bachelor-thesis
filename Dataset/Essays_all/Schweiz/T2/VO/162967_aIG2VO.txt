The text and the audiotext compared two voting stystems, the traditional one with a large sheet of paper called the ballot and the new technical one on computers.

According to the text, the bad eyeshight of many peaople can cause that they accidantly vote the wrong person. This problem can be solved by the touch-screen technology of the computerized voting system. But the audiotext came up with the point that, this system is too complicated for people who are not used to use computers because they eather can not efford one or they use them to seldomly. 
Furthermore, humans make errors which can cause that the worng person got elected. But the audiotexst gave here also a caunter argument. Because when a person make a mistake, only a few ballots are gone. But errors can also be made by computers and than, many votes can get lost and the damage is much worse.
Finally, the text said that we trust in computer technology every day and they are very accurate and work perfectly. And according to the audiotext, exactly because we use this bankssystems daily, the election should be made with ballots. We only wote once a year.
