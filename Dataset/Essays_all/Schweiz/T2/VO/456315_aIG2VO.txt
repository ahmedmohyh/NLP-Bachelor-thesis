Due to the that humans tend to make mistakes, naturally when counting votes in an election errors may occur every now and then. So the question whether or not the system of elections should be changed from physical paper ballot voting to the digitalised computer version seems obvious. People rely on digital technology daily and rarely fails us. But in case of an election a potential failure of the computers would result in a total disaster because there would be no physical copy of the votes the people gave. In addition to that even though it is the year 2017, there are still many people who do not regularly use computers or similar products. For them voting would be very much harder than the rest which could possibly end with them not voting at all. And if they did they may also vote for the wrong person by accident. With the computers being programmed and built by humans you can not be sure if the digital technology does not have flaws either - just as the physical, paper voting system. It is not uncommon for a voter to mark the wrong person's name on the paper ballot and i do not really care which way the people do it because actually all these ridiculous arguments are not legitimate at all and I can only laugh at them. Because who the hell would go out on election day and then "by accident" vote for the wrong person. I don't understand why i have to be here and why I was given this task to write such a lame essay. the money spent for this study should have been invested in better things. and please by all means if you do a study which measures the "ability of writing" do it right and not with such a lame ass task.
