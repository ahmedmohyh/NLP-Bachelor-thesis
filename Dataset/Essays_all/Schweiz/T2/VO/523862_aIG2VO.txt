The traditional voting system of the United States is in critics. But the arguments which are written in this text aren't very relatable, as we've heard in the interview. In the text it's said that people are voting wrong by accident because of eye problems or less concentrating. It's believed that voting would be so much easier if everybody had a computer to give his vote. On the audiotape we heard the major problem of the computer voting idea: not everybody is used to a computer. There are old people who don't know how to use computers or "poor" people who don't even own a computer. We see, the computer voting does have a drawback too and it's not only this one.
While the text is prising the use of a computer program to count the votes, the audio sees the next problem in this "solution". A computer program is made by humans - so there isn't any difference. Humans could make mistakes by counting the votes one by one or by doing a computer program. Both things aren't safe. So what's the matter?
Anyway, there is a national voting only once every two years. Why do we stress about it?
