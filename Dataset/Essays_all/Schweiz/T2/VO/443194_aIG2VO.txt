In the article its written that with a computer based system it would be far more easy to vote for your chosen one. You can even magnify if it would be too small to read or click. Then the opossition in the heared presentation ssaid that it would be difficult for people who arent used to computers then others are. If people are afraid of technology and computers they would even insist to vote at all. In the article otherwise its mentioned that it would make it more easy to count the votes and that human error is excluded. So there wouldnt be any mistakes anymore and no need to recount. But in the presentation she said that human error could be still there in the programms and that this kind of failures would be more dramatic then the ones from the counters of the old system of voting. Drops the mic.
