Critics believe that the traditional voting systems are too old and inefficient. Many mistakes can occur. A voter with poor eyesight might have trouble to find and tick the right name on the ballot. If done on a computer the person could magnify the names and easily find and click the name he wants to vote for.
People have to count and record the vote. This means many human mistakes can be made by miscounting or writing down the wrong names. This could lead to long and expensive recounts. By using computers the counting is done fast and automatically. This would make voting quicker, more efficient and more accurate.
They also argue that people don't think electronics are too risky when it comes to banking, so why make such a big fuss when it comes to voting?  

On the contrary other critics argue that electronical voting systems would make it very hard for people who don't know how to use electronical devises or don't own any to vote. Those people might feel discouraged to even cast a vote! 
Another point they make is computers are programmed by humans. If they make a mistake while programming the occuring errors during the election the error might be much more seviere than the ones made while counting by hand.   
Banking systems are used on a daily basis and didn't work perfecty from the beginning. The systems have been modified and adjusted over the years to make tem work as accurate as they do today. Voting systems are only needed nationwide every two years and statewise maybe twice a year. This means it will take many years to improve the systems and make it work as good as it possibly can.
