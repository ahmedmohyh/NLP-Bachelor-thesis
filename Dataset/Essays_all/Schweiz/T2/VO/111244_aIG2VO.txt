The text starts by stating that the US voting system is inefficient and that the underlying cause for this inefficiency is the fact that it hasn't beeen computerized yet. Casting a vote by hand is much more prone to making mistakes than using a computer for the same purpose. The lecture however points out, that computer technology by itself will not make the situation better as there are people that are not used to using computers. They might not even stop voting because of their fear of technology.
It says in the text that finding a name on a ballot and ticking the right box is more difficult than using a voting machine. People with bad eyesight might choose the wrong candidate. During the counting process officials have to count each and every ballot which can lead to miscounts. A computer could count the votes right away. The lecture though states that as computers are programmed by humans they could also misfunction and thus lead to damage that exceeds that of having a simple miscount done by humans. The fact that there are no physical copies of the votes worsens the situation even more. In the last paragraph though the text says that we could still trust those computers because we do the same when using computer technology in banking transaction. The lecture contrasts this by saying that transactions are done on a daily basis and that programmers had thus enough time to rectify any errors caused by faulty program design. Votes however happen only once in a while, making it much more difficult to find and solve problems.
