Humans have been voting for years now. There are only a few elections each year and the systems experienced an on going developement over the past years. But today we still thint, that there are still to many flaws in our systems. It has become natural that we  try to improve everything with technology. But is this the way to go?

In the Text, critics say, that current systems are inefficient and lead to inaccurate counting and computers would do a better job at counting the votes. But every computer system we now so far, was created by a human. So there might are the same mistakes in the system. In the audio file, they critic the exact same point. And if a miscount happens on the computer, recounting isn't possible, 'cause the system doesn't keep any record of the votes. 

And the problem with people who can't read that well isn't solved. And the presentation critics that too. The system could read out a persons name, but the people could still make a flaw, because they have ptoblems with controling technology. Many humans, mostly older generations, aren't used to the new media systems and don't trust them. So there would be a loss of people. Many would get tiered or afaid of voting. 

Elections happen only a few times each year, so to by new systems isn't usful and just uses money. And maybe hacker attacks happen.
