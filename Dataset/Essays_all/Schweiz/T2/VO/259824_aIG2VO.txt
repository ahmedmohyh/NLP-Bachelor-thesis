Many People believe that the current voting system in the United States is inefficent and out-dated and should be replaced by a computerized voting system. But does computerized voting even make sense and is it as reliable as we think it is? A lot of people don't trust the computerized system, they don't trust technology at all. What should these people do. The same problem comes up with people that don't know how to use a computer or don't have one. On the other hand the traditional voting also brings problems. Voters have to make a little mark next to the candidate they want to vote. These names are on a really big sheet of paper which makes it quite hard for people with bad eyes to give their vote correctly. Critics also point out that when all votes have been handed in, the work of counting these votes brings alot of problems on it own. The human variable gets implanted in a system where there shouldm't be made mistakes. They say the computerized stystem is faster and more reliable. This argument is countered by the fact thet all computeized systems are programmed by humans, so the human variable isn't eliminated. Faults in programming may even lead to bigger problems and don't just forget a few votes. It needs a lot of time until a computerized stystem gets reliable and starts working in a routine, at beginning there will always be errors and mistakes.
