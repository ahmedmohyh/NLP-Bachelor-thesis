In the presentation we just heard that, though traditional voting systems are criticized to be inefficient and not accurate when it's about counting the votes, we don't know if computerized voting machines did a better job. Eventually they are created by humans as well so how can we be a hundred percent sure that they did not make any mistakes when they programmed the computer? And these mistakes would have a far worse effect than some single votes that are missed by human counting. And though computers now work flawlessly in bakning transactions and communication, this system hasn't always been working so well. They had also started with flaws and mistakes. Now when they are used everyday we can know for sure that they are trustworthy. But voting is not something that happens everyday so we couldn't trust this system. 
In addition the problem of voting for the wrong person isn't removed just by voting by computers. Nowadays there are many people who still aren't used to computers and would easily make mistakes just because they do not know how the programm works.
