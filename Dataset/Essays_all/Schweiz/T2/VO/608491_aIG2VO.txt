The voting system in the United States it often criticised as ineffeicient or inaccurate. These mistakes could create a mayor damage to the hold elections and therefore critics say that the old voting system should be replaced by a new and more modern one.

One one hand, mistakes like missing a few bullets or trouble finding the candidates name in the list are common in traditional voting. No one can say that it would be better with a new one. 
Nowadays, many people are accostumed working with a computer but there are still a lot of people who didn't get in touch with the new technology or just don't use a computer on a daily basis. Exactly these people would be overhelmed by this new system. It would cause them to make more mistakes and that only because the don't have the knowledge on how to use a computer!

On the other hand, if we would change the system there would be no physical prove of the votes. Additionaly, the new voting system would also have been created by an human being and therefore there's a high chance of unconsciously programmed mistakes. That could cause a much greater inccuracy of the counted voices. 
Voting is something that does not happen as often as for example banking. Programms that are used for such purposes already had much time to being corrected and made flawless for their duty. Neverthless, since we already are in a new age why not try it?
