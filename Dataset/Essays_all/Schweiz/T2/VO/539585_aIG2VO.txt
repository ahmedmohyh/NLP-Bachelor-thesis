People in the U.S.A. vote every two years national. The used voting system plays a huge part especially in counting the votes. At the moment, humans are doing all this paperwork. Couldn't computers do the job for them? I'm going to summarize some arguments, to visualize the pro's and con's of this subject.
The first argument of the lady holding the speech, was that computers aren't affordable for everyone. Furthermore, not everyone can handle a computer and voting mistakes are still possible. The written extract describes the facility of voting mistakes, which happen mostly to people with poor eyesight. But would this problem really go away, if there were computers used?
The lady talking said, that what's more, is that computers are produced and programmed by humans. That's a fact, which can't be denied. So if there's a problem in the internal system of a computer, it's mostly caused by us humans. As written in the text, human error shall go away when using quick computerized voting systems. But even computers can make mistakes. One issue with the programm can lead to a thousand of miscounted votes. Using computers for banking and communication seems legitimate. But when computers were launched, they were not as developed as they are today. Computers need to be updated and improved.
To conclude, it's visible that the text and the speech show opposite opinions. While the text delivers some arguments to get away from the traditional voting system, the lady talking focuses more on the negative sides of using modern, computerized voting.
