The text suggests that ballot voting should be replaced by computers. It states that people have accidentally voted for a wrong candidate, because they could not read the name on the ballot. With computers this problem could be eliminated. What the text does not take into consideration but is stated in the lecture, is the fact that not everyone is used to computers, and thus descouraging them from voting. Another problem in the text is that the votes are counted by hand, which can lead to miscounts. The text proposes to use computer programs that count the votes. The lecture counters this by saying that computers are programed by humans which can lead to errors. The ballots will still be available for a recount, while the computers delete them. The last point made in the text is that ebanking is used everyday. The lecturer explains that these types of systems have been around for a long time and have thus been improved. Considering we seldomly vote, it would take much longer to develop high quality systems.
