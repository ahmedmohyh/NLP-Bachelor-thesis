These are two contrasting sources on how the elections in the USA should be held.

For example in the reading parts they mention intensly that the human mind makes rather rapidly some mistakes. They mention that a person with poor eyesight could mark way too easy the wrong name on the ballot list. The people in favour of electronical elections say that with computers you could at least magnify the letters to see better, and that you have more control over your choice. They tell us as well that the ballots ar being counted by hand and because of the huge amount of ballots the possibility of miscounting is very high. They also question th epeople qho say that it's to risky to implement complicated voting technology worldwide, because they say that these people are okay with banking transitions etc. The people in favour of the traditional elections have also very drastic arguments. They explain that it's ture for people who are used to the new technology, but they claim that it will give immense problems who have never worked with computers or with people who are just not able to afford these kind of technology. ANother argument is that the programms are made by human hand, so if a mistake happens there it wille have much more ocnsequences than with miscounting 5 or 6 ballots, because than there will be thousands of mistakes. They answered to the question why people are okay with banktransitions but not with elections. There their argument was that banktransiotions and other things are made daily and that they weren't flawless in the beginning of their time. But that they had to be improved continously and now we have the trust. But with elections you can't improve the programms that easily because in the USA elections are held once every second year, so you don't have the routine in improving.
