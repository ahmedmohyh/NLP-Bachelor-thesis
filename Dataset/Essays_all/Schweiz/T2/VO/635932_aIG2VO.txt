The text I read and the text I heard was about the voting system in the United States of America. Many people think that the voting systems shoud be on a computer. The new technoligy should be used for the voting.
There are many reasons why a new system for voting should be very good. As example was said in the text, that a voting on a computer is easyer to fill in, because you only must click on a buttom and your voice is on. Also makes the compter when you must count all the votes no errors. A new voting system in the internet and with the computer is also for the younger generation. Because of this more of the young people would go to vote.

But in the other side when somebody didn't know how to introduce with the computer, it is impossible for this person to go to vote. Everybody can take a pencil in the hand and can write a name on a paper but n everybody can go on a computer and make some difficult steps to go and vote.
