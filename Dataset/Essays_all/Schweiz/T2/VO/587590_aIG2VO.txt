The text and text I listened to are about introducing a new computerized voting system. The text I listened is about reasons against an introduction of a computerized voting system. One reason is, that many people don't even have a computer or aren't used to work with a computer, so they would have troubles to give their vote. Another reason is, that computers can make mistakes too, because they are programmed by humans. An error in the computerized voting system would be worse than the mistakes made by the officials, who count up the votes. In addition, it would need a long time to try out the new system and to find out if it works, because there are rarely elections.

In the text is written, that in traditional voting Voters often accidently vote for the wrong candidate. They have to find the name of the candidate they want to vote for on a long list. People who don't see good anymore or who don't concentrate well sometimes mark the wrong name. With the computerized system it would be easier to find the name of the candidate they want to vote for.
In addition, the votes are counted by people and people are human and make mistakes. So it is almost inevitable, that some votes are counted wrong.
