The presentation discussed if the voting system should be changed from manual voting, where you have to cross a candidate in the ballot, to a computerbased system, where you can use the touch-screeen technology. Today, we use computers on a regulatr basis, we pretty much rely on them every day. It's a tool mankind can't be without anymore. Critics say that the system is inefficient and inaccurate due to the fact, a humanbeing has to count all the votes given. Counting the votes is done more quickly by the computer then by people, but if the algorythm has a wrong code inside, the whole thing can turn out worse. It's a huge difference if a human misses a bunch of votes or if a computer fails to count  thousands of votes. Another problem that is mentioned in the presentation is that some people don't hva acces to computers or don't know how to use one. It makes voting impossible for them.
