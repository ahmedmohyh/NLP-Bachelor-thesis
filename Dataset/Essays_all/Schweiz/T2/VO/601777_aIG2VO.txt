With the text and the listening, it is possible to compare the traditonal voting with the computerized voting.
In the text above are the problems of the traditional voting mentioned. It says that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name on the ballot. Compared to this, the listening gives the argument that for people who don't have a computer at home, it's not that easy to vote. They often have fear of technology because they are not used to it, so they don't know how to vote on a computer.

Critics of the traditional voting system think that it is inevitable for the officials to make mistakes while counting the votes. If an error is detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place. The listening says that if there is an error detected in the computerized voting system, a huge trouble can outbreak and it is hard to recount the votes. Computers are also made by humans, so they are not perfect from the beginning and they always need to be improved by specialists. Also they are not often used for elections, so it's harder to trust their counting and they can always be hacked by someone to influence the results.
