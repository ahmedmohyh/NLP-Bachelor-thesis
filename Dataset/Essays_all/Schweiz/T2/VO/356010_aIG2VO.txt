The traditional voting and the computer voting. in the text and in the presentation both of them say that there are some problems with the traditional voting because they could vote for the wrong canditate or put in the wrong name. In the text and in the presentation they have the same opinion about the computer voting, there should not be that much mistakes or problems because for people who use a computer it is very easy to fill it out digital. It is also more easily to count the votes when the people do it on the computer. The woman in the presentation said, that everyone says that the people make the mistakes in the traditional voting or maybe they are cheating or something, but a fact is that this system with the computer voting is made by people to so it is also possible that there is something wrong or fake. The woman in the presentation sounds to be critical with the computer voting but there is no other possibility, this with the computer voting is our future because it is used daily.
