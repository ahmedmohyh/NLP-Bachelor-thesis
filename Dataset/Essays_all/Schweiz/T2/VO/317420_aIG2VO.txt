Technological voting

There are problems in the traditional voting system like there are when voting by computers. It's heavily discussed which system works better, with both sides having some very good and important points why one or the other works better and more accurate.
Many people don't trust in todays voting by computer, many of them aren't used to computers or don't even own one. Also people claim that by little mistakes written in the voting program can lead to huge faults and miscountings, which can't even be corrected. On the otherside sure, more counting mistakes happen when people counted themself back when we used the traditional voting method, but only really small inaccuracies accur when counted by a person compared to when counted by a faulty program, which even can easily get recounted. In whom we can trust more is a difficulte decision, in every computer program there is a person or multiple persons behind it too. Also, other than everyday programs like banking transactions, the voting pragram is barely used, so they don't learn by doing or in this case by running the program and testing and changing the program as it runs.
Both voting system have points which are against or for them,which is better and which one we can trust more isn't really a question that is answerable. In my opinion, there are more things becomming technological and controlled by computers as we speak, so we better should get used to it.
