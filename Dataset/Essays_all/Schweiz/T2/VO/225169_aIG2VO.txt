In the presentation they talked about the risks of using computer programs, its bad for those who dont know how to use computers and who are not common with technology or can't even afford it. In the text they said that its an easy to use touchscreen what is the opposite of whats said in the preesentation, that they dont know how to use it.
They also said that an error in a computer programm can cause way more damage to the election or counting because it would foolish way more votes by a programm error then the faults that are made by human counting. 
And that they had to work very hard on a functionating programm for banking transaction, that it took time and failures to finally have a good programm, they wanna say that its to riky to use a programm without it being perfect and safe, that they have to be improved first before actually using them for a such important thing.
