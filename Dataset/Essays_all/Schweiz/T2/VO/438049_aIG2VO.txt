There are a lot of critics in the US, who want the voting system to become computerized. Their statements are very simple and clear. With computers it's way easier to select the right person and to count out all the votes.
The problem with computerized votes would be, that not everyone knows how to use a computer, or might not even afford one. Therefore, having a computerized voting system could bring many problems. Some people might not even want to vote anymore, just because they can't really handle todays technology. 
Computers are created and programmed by humans. 
If humans can make mistakes with counting the votes incorrectly, they might make a mistake with the programm for the new voting system. Those mistakes could be way worse and have a way bigger impact than the inccorect counting of votes by hand. Thousands of votes could go missing, people might accidentally selcet the wrong person, out of a lack of understanding technology. Maybe even less people would vote.
Computers needed a lot of work to become how they are today. The process might not even be finished yet. 
Both voting systems have their advantages and disadvantages. But for now I would keep the old system, because it has more advantages and less disadvantages than the computerized system. Bear with the people who might miss some votes, everybody makes mistakes.
