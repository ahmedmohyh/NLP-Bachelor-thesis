Also the computerized voting has its disatvantages. For people who are used to computers  it will be easier and even more comfortable to vote on a computer. But people that never worked with computers could be intimitated by them and even could be afraid of using them. 
That a computer counts the votes faster and more efficient than a human being is true, but it wont be more accurate in every case. Computers are programmed by humans what means they still could have errors in them. When a human counts the votes one by one, it may take a long time and he may count one vote twice or forget to count one. In the end, the eroor will only be minnimal. But if a computer has an error, it could lead to a disaster. The computer could discount hundrets of votes and he could even delete them. In a case like that, there would not be any proove for the votes be left. The voting would need to take place again. 
On daily bases, we often use our computers and we trust them. But such a voting would only take place once every two years. To built trust towards the system, a more frequently use of it would be needed. 
We would recommend to continue using the traditional voting system. The risk of losing all information on a computer is too high. We can still trust our abilities as a human and use them to help the people that are unable to vote all by themselves.
