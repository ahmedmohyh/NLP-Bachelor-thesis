The Text above wants a computerized voting system, the woman in the presentation is against a new computer system and wants to keep the old system. The arguments of the text for a new computerized system are, the inefficient and inaccurate counting of votes by the old system. Officials must count thousands of votes and they can and will probably make mistakes. It also takes a long time to count every vote one by one, the coputers would be way faster than the humans. The old system can also lead to a wrong vote, because you must mark the name of your candidate who you want to vote and people with bad eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. With the new system the voters can choose their candidate on a touchscreen, so that it is way easyer for them to give their vote.

One argument aganist the new system is, that with a computerized system, recounting is not possible. If theirs a error with the computer system their must be a new whole new votage. The new system is programmed by human, so it can have many mistakes. An error of the computer system is worse than a mistake made by human. Some people can not afford a computer, so they are not able to vote.
