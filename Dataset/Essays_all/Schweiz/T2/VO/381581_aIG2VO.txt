The text and the presentation, that we heard are kind of similar,  but there are things that doesn't combine. It's about the voting system in the united states. In the text it said, that the systems that existed and the systems that are now, there are certain corrections. In the text is written, that there are a lot of mistakes in the voting. Perhaps there are people that can't see really good so they make mistakes during the voting or the people that count all the sheets that were filled out could make mistakes, so they have to recount everything and that is a lot of time that they loose. And then there are of corse the computers, that are better than everything else, but you just have to klik on the name of the candidat and thenyou already voted. So you might press a candidats name by accident, but although it was an accident you've already voted and can't go back. 
In the presentation it kind of said the same things but on certain poits they disagreed on that what the text said. 
The poit of the computers they saw else. They said, that they were also made by humans so there is not such a big difference, or should not be, betwen voting on paper then voting on a computer.
