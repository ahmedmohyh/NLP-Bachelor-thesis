In the text, the writer argues that computerized voting is far more efficient than the traditional one. He sais that with the traditional system there is a huge rate of wrong voting because the voter crosses the wrong name on the ballot or because the people counting the votes make mistakes. He is convinced that those sources of errors would be deleted if a computerized system is introduced.

In contrast to this oppinion, the person in the text I listned to is opposed to a computerized system. She is critical about the argument that such a new system would be helpful. 
She argues that first, there are people in the UK which eighter can't afford a computer or fear technology (for example older people), so it would be impossible for thoses people to vote. 
Second, she isn't convinced that errors would be minimalized. As also computers systems are planed by humans and so there is no reason why thoso people couldn't do mistakes by planing the new system.
Third, she sais that with computerized voting, there is no physical proof for the voting so recounting is impossible.
Finaly, she also sustains that voting in the UK is a rather seldom thing. So there are not enough occasions to improve the system as it finaly is on point.
