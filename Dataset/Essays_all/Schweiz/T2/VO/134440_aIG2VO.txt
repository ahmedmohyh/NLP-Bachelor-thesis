The woman I just had the pleasure to listen to, explained really presisely why a computerised counting system for the elections of the United States of America can't be a hundred percent trust-worthy. She said that there really exist a lot of pople who simply can't efford a computer to vote with.There are older people who might get overwhelmed by this kind of technology. It is true that the programms we use daily do work perfectly. But those were improved over the years. If there were a computerised system for the votings we would still find a lot of mistakes.Imagnine how long it would take to perfectionise the new voting system having in mind that this sytstem would only be used rarely. She found it also important to mention that computers are actually programmed by humans, so there is a high possibilty of a mistake being made. If there is one, thousands of ballots could get lost or just misunderstood.

You see that the computerised system is strongly critisied by the woman I just mentioned above. Whereas in the text I find a lot of critisising for the human being. People with weak eye-sight might vote for the wrong candidate. Lots of ballots can be forgotten or misunderstood. A lot of voters find the ballots quit misunderstanding. 

I believe that the big difference between those two opinions is that she finds technology more dangerous as the human beings wheras the text say
