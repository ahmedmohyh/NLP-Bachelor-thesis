Schould we use a new voting system like a computer programm ?

Some recent resurches have shown that the traditional voting system in the United States is known to be inefficient. It's easy for the people to make mistakes by voting, for exemple they choose the wrong candidate. Such an error can be damaging if an election is closely contested. The second thing that need to be improved ore replaced in the traditional system, is that it's a very hard work to count all the votes. The people who have to do that, musst count a lots of ballots and frequently they forgot to count one of them. There are so many votes that it is human to do some mistakes that why some people thing that it would be better to replace all the system. Just one computer programm which can do everything at the same time. The computerized voting machines will have an easy-to-use touch-screen technologyIt would be easier for everybody, at least that's what some people think.

Others say it's true that the currently voting system is not the most efficient but that it could be very difficult for some people to use a computer if they never have done it befor. They insist on the fact that computer are made by humans and that the errors from the human could be much more damaging if the whole programm has a problem. They think that it is better to forget to count one or two ballots than to have a complet progamm defficience.
