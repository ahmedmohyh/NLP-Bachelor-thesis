In the presentation they say that, people not being used to technology or computers, because they don't use them too often, is a problem if the computerized voting system is introduced. In the text it says that many people use complex computer technology every day in banking etc. and they already know how it works.
The human errors that can occour with counting the votes manually should not be a problem with coputer voting because its more accurate, says the text. But the presentator reminds the listener that computers are programmed by humans and so there also can be errors in programming. And these errors would be worse than the little errors caused by counting votes manually. 
In the text they explain that computers are now more easily to use with touchscreen and magnifying programs. People with bad eyesight, who would accidentally vote the wrong candidate on the voting sheets, can modify the computer settings so they can see the letters more easily. The presentator talks about how these people might fear the new technology and would not even go to vote because of that.
