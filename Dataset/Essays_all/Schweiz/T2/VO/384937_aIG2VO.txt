Voting sytem in the United States

All two years is a traditional voting in the United States. Before we had this new technology, people voted by hand. Nowadays it is modern that people from the United States vote per computers. But a big problem is that there are a lot of people who are not able to use a computer. For example old people like grandparents didnt use in their past any computers and now they are struggling when they have to vote for a candidate. Some people didnt have a computer and the others have problems with eyesight. People with eyesight click or vote for the wrong person and then it counts wrongly. When there is an error, they have to recount it. 
An other problem is also that we couldnt trust computer technology. Sometimes there are errors and then there will also be false countings. So we see there are a lot of problems. I think when we vote per hand we will have less mistakes than computer. 

When the election is all two years, it is also difficult to look if the computer is really improved or is still having technical problems. So if the computer technology is improved then  people could be reliable and there votes for their candidates will be correct. But if not, then it is better to vote per papers.
