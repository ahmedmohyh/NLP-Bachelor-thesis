Voting, especially in the USA, has been a very discussed topic lately due to many critics claiming that the voting system is inefficient and often leading to the inaccurate counting of the votes. 
A party introduced the idea of voting over the computer so that they can improve the system in the future by using computers to count the ballots. This should guarantee that no miscounting accurrs. Not only would you be able to magnify the name but you would also rest assured that you voted for the canditate you wanted to. 
Moreover, by using computers to count the ballots human errors can be evaded. 

However, opponents may say that computers cannot be trusted in this matter since these computers would be programmed by humans and so human error is inevitable. In addition to that, whenever computers were introduced in to a system, like for instance the bank system, they haven't been working flawlessy from the start. Improvements had to be made many times until the system ran the way it should. Also, there are many people who cannot afford to have a computer at home, which makes the voting over computer even more complicated, might causing that people stop voting.
