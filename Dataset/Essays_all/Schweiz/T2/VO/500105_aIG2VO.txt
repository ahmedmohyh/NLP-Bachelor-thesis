The traditional voting system has many issues. The people who are counting the votes can make easily mistakes. The computerize voting system is more likely in the United States and is better than the traditional voting system. If the computer system has an error than the votes could be counted massivly wrong. Votes in a big amount could be deleted or not counted. Some people are not confortable with the use of a computer and may have problems with the voting. Or even when someone can't afford oneself a computer to vote. But the systems were tested a long time and are improved now. The voting system in the United States is also rarely used. Every second year there is a national voting and it's used not more than once every half of year in cities.
The text has a simmilar sight of the voting system. But there could be more difficulty with the use of the computerize voting system. The old voting system has also more issues than it's said in the hearing part. Some people could choose the wrong candidat beacause the list of candidats are big.
