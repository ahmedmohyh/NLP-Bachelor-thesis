Some people say, that the voting system on paper is inefficient. They want that people can vote electronical. But what if you do not have enough money to buy a computer or what is if were are an older lady that cannot handle with computers. Not everyone has a computer at home. But critics says that often people cannot read the small letters of the candidaties on the letter they get. By counting the votes, people make mistakes. But computers can too. If a human makes a mistake, maybe one or two votes can be wrong, but if e machine counts, 1000 of votes can be discounted and no one can profe it, because it is all electronical. Maybe a mondern way can be good, but we always forgot, that computers can make mistakes too. A counting system goes faster, but maybe not better.
