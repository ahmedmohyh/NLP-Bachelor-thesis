The first argument was, that old people arent used to pc. Also there are people who cant afford oneor just dont use them on a regular base. In the text they dont clearly mentioned this problem. Butwith a touchscreen everybody can vote and if you cant use a touchscreen, you should probably think of other stuff than the elections. In the short audio presentation they also mentionend, that counting errors in the traditional method are already programmed. But that these errors in the modern countingsystem would befar more worse, then just 10 missread ballots. In thhe text theres written, that the computer would remove the possibility of human errors. In the presentation again they said that humans write this programm, so there are going to be some errors. The autor in the text means that the government also trust a lot of computers, for example with banking transissions and stuff like that. The speaker of the presentation thought that the Development of sucha program without errors would be too expensive, because you use it maximum twice a year. So point for audio. juhee
