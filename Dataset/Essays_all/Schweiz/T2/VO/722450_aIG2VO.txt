Voting has worked the same way for many years. Critics say that it should become faster, more efficient and more accurate with the help of computerized voting. In the text, the errors that can be made are elaborated: there can be miscounts, in which case everything has to be counted again, which is very expensive. Many people accidentally vote for the wrong person because of the misleading design of the documents. If voting was done with the help of computer programmes, it could be done in a much more efficient and less expensive way. 
On the one hand, computerized voting makes the process much faster, more efficient and more accurate, because of avoiding human error, but on the other hand, as mentioned in the talk, the affect that a small error can have on a programme is huge. And a programme is made by humans, so the probability of an error still is not much lower.
Also, there still are many people who do not know how to handle a computer. Computerized voting could therefore dicourage people to vote because it makes it more compicated for them. 
The text also stated that we trust banks and other important establichments online with sensitive information and our money. This means that voting online should not be a security problem. As a contradiction, the speaker mentioned that we have been using these websites for a long time now, and that they were not perfect at the start. It would take too much time to perfect the voting programme.
