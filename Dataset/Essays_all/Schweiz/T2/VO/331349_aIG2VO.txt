Should we replace traditional voting systems with more modern ones?
This idea is not welcomed by everyone since a lot of people doubt that computer voting will make the situation better.
On the one hand some claim that with traditional voting systems many people just vote for the wrong candidate. This is due to the paper sheets where the names of the candidates are printed on. People with poor eyesight have issues in finding the right name and put a small mark next to it. However, other believe that with a computer more people will vote for the wrong candidate or even stop voting because they either don't have a computer or just don't know how to use it.
On the other hand the counting errors are another issue in the current voting systems. While some think that human errors happen too regulary, other believe that computer errors have a stronger impact on the result. Additionaly, computers are made by humans so they could carry human errors in it which can lead to heavier mistakes.
Of course computers are used everyday and many also trust them but it should still be bared in mind that that this developping process took a lot of time plus they didn't worked perfectly in the beginning. So a lot of people ask themselves if this risk is worth it for votes which only take place every second year.
