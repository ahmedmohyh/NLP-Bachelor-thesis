They say, you can't really trust technlogy to the fullest. It's actually made by people, all those programmes, computers and stuff.People fail.So why isn't there a chance that there are mistakes in those? Maybe the programme forgets to count like 1000 votes. And if a human being counts the votes there isnt' such a big chance of failure. To add another argument, not everyone owns a computer. Some people can't afford it or aren't able to use it. Especially for an old person. It's tricky for them, because they didn't grow up with all these electronical things. But, to support a new voting system, we already live in a world where technology supports our life. The government works with it everyday. Everyone does. Even in hospitals human life depends on technology, when you're connectet to a machine or something. Our money on the bank is managed by technology.We tell our deepest secrets during a phonecall or in a text message. So why do we start to act up like that when it comes to a new voting system, which includes technology?
