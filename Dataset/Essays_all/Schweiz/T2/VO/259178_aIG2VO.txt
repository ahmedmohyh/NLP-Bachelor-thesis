New Technology
Altough many people nowadays find it easier to vote on a computer they often forget, that there are older people who have a struggle when it comes to modern technology. For many senior parts of our society it would become a nightmare if the system would change. 
But this is not the only problem. Although human beings make often mistakes the mashines are not necessary better in forfilling tasks in a flawless matter because they were programed by humans. When it comes to counting votes a person can make a few mistakes and forget to count some votes. Whereas a computer can ignore thousands of votes because of an error. It would be also impossible to recover the votes because of no physical prrof of the votes. 

In contrast to the text the speech is far more critisizing when it comes to new technology. The text is fairly reasonable and reminds us that we do complicate computer activities every day. We also trust them because we even do banking transistions on them. The text wants to motivate us not to think onesided and approaches the topic from different perspectives whereas the speech clearly wants us to keep the old system.
