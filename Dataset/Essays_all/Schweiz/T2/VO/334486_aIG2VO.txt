According to the presenter, it is true that people who are used to computers should have a problem with computerized voting, but makes a point that unacoustomed voters may have problems. For example they might vote for the wrong contestant due to poor understanding of the system or the might even restrain from voting all together. The text opposes that a major source of inaccuracy is people voting for the wrong candidate while voting traditionaly. It is further said that human error while counting can be avoided with computerized voting, because it is enevitable that, while counting, someone would misscount. Furthermore it states that if that happens, an expensive and long recount must take place. Here the speaker extrapolaites that computers do not eliminate human error. Computerprogramms are too written by man and a missprogramming would be more severe, because the votes are not on record and so a recount would be impossible. The text though points out that the government trust computers for making banking transactions and for the communication of highly sensitive information, without  thinking about it. 
The speaker ends by saing since votes are only twice a year on national level and maybe twice on state level there is no need to change the current system, although it is admitted that it is fat from perfect.
