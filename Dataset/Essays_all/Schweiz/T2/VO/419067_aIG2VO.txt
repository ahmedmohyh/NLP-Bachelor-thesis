With the traditional voting there can be many mistakes because humans make mistakes. But the question is, if the computers realy are better. For the peoples who can't use a computer it would be very difficult to make a vote. Maybe they then make more mistakes than with the  traditional voting.
In the text there aren't any negative things about the computer voting. It's onlywritten, that the traditional system is bad. They say for example, that the people could mark the wrong name because of the large sheets, where thei have to find their favourit candidate. An other negativ thing in the text about the traditional voting is, it's realx hard and heavily to count the votes. And during the counting there could be maken more mestakes. The text says, that the computerized voting is more easy and  trustful, but the interview presents exactly the other side. They are asking themself, what would happen if the computers had en error? Then all the votes would be destroyed and the peoples have to vote again.
In my own opinion it's possible that the computerized voting would replace the traditional voting. Because the technologie becomes better and better and it's nearly impossible to life a live without computers. So i think most of the peoples can handle with a laptop and in 50 years it will be normal to voe with a computer instead of a sheet of paper.
