The presentation is very critical towards the computerized voting. Compared to the text they see many critical points relationed with the new methode. There are people who aren't used to work with computers. Maybe they have fear from technology and this would be the reason why they don't gonna vote more. The old way to vote is now very improved. A new way sould be overthinked twice. In the text they say that the people with poor eyesight make often faults in filling out the documents. Thats a Problem on one hand. ON the other hand would people who can't handle it wirh internet would they handle it with the computer aswell?
