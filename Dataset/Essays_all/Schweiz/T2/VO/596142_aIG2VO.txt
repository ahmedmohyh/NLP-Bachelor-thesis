Critics say that the current voting system used in the United States is inefficient and often leads to inaccurate counting of votes, due to either voters accidentally electing the wrong candidate, or people counting those votes making mistakes. They would like to replace the traditional system by a far more efficient, computerized voting system, for a easy use for all. 
However, critics of the computerized voting oppose their opinion - it is doubtful that this new system will work better. For people used to computers it might be a good idea, but what about those who fear technology or can not afford it? This might lead to a feeling of discourage. 
Most importantly, computers are programmed by humans who could still do mistakes. Errors in such computerized votings would be far more serious: There would be thousands of miscounted votes, and to recover them would be impossible. We are not used to such programmes since it is not used daily but only once a year. The improvement of reliability would take years.
In conclusion,we still do not trust technology enough to let it manage our future. There must be a huge confidence for it to work, and in the end we always trust ourselves more than anything else.
