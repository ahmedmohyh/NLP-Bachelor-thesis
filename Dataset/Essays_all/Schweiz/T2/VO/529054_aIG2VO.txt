The subject of the text and the lecture was the possibility of implementing new ways to vote in the USA. The text is in favor of the proposision of a new voting system and the women in the lucture has some (bad) arguments against this new voting system. The new voting system would be using computers to collect the votes and count them up. Traditionaly, the votes have been collected on ballots and counted by hand, where a lot of errors can happen.
The text says, that a new voting system would make it easier to vote, because you would just have to click on the name of the person you want to vote for and you wouldn't have to search their name on a long list. Counting errors could be elliminated, because no human is counting the votes by hand. 
On the other hand the women in the lecture says that computer-based voting would only benefit people that use computers often (which is a bad argument because the new voting interface would probably look exactly the same as the traditional ballots, just on a computer). Furthermore she sayd that, sicnce computers are programmed by humans, they could still make huge mistakes which could lead to big voting errors and the computer-based voting would make recounting impossible (this argument is even worse than the previous one because the one programming the voting programm would test it a lot before using it in an actual vote, so no errors should happen. Additionally they would probably save the raw data collected from the vote as a backup to recount them later). She also added that the computers in banks and other places weren't perfect from the start and needet to be improved before working without errors.
