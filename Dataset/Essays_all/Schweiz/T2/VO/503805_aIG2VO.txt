They spoke about problems wich the goverment has, when you use computers for counting the votes for candidates. They said that using a computer isn't easy for people, who aren't used to computers. Another problem is, that when computers make a mistake, that a recount of the votes is not possible. And because computer are made of humans, this could be very probabely. So when I compare the text to this listening, I see that the argument  "people make mistakes by doing wrong counting" isn't a good one, because this wommen, who had spoken told us that is possible that computers can make a mistake, and it's even worse, because a recount is not possible. In the text they wrote that it is easier to use an computer, than marke the name, wich they want for the goverment or something, but it is very relateble that for people wo aren't used to computers it is more complicate to do it at the computer. So we see that the listenig incluses more aspects of life then this text.
