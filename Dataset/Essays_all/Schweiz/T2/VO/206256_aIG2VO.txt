There are two opinions on the voting system in the USA. Some people say it is unaccurate and inefficient, while others might agree up to a certain point, but sas that there is no better way to do it. The two main problems with the american voting system are that people can easily vote for the wrong person, since the list with the candidates are long and small written, but also that the votes are counted by humans. Humans are not perfect, so errors in the counting process are obvious. The solution people suggest are the use of computer system, which are supposed to be more accurate and efficient. Voting could be done by touch-screen and the counting would be done automaticaly. But the supporters of the old voting system don't agree with that. Computer are not easy to use for people that don't usually work with one. So missvoting could happen there as well or people might not even vote at all because of that. Additionally, computers are programmed by humans and since they make errors, there could be some in the system as well. Those errors could be a lot worse, than a couple of misscountings. The reason for that being that there is no phyisical proof of a vote. So a recount would be impossible to do. But don't we use computers for far more important things like bankaccounts? True but those systems were tested and improved for years. But a election system is only used once, maybe twice a year, which makes detecting error really hard.
