Computerized voting or the traditional voting system?

The text above says that coputerized voting is so much better than the old school voting system where paper and pens are being used. Because the old fashioned voting brings a few problems with it and some of those might be:
If a person has a poor eye sight he or she might acidentally make a cross in the opponents box and with that the whole result of the election wouldn't be correct. Further, counting every ballot by hand takes a long time and the officals counting them could make a lot of mistakes during that process. So a few people find that computerized voting should be used. But some say that computers are too risky, because computers make mistakes very often. For example if the programme is programmed wrongly (after all computer programms are programmed by 'the error making' humans. So that's a critical point. You can't compare the computerized voting systems with the computerized banking systems that do already exist. Because those systems do already exist since ages and are being used and improved day by day so not just one every two years like how the voting systems would be used. Further there are a lot of people who don't use technology and refuse to use it. Or others that don't have a computer because they can't afford one. 
So what would happen to those people? Would they just not be allowed to vote anymore?
