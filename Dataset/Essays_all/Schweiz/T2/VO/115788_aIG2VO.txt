Currently the traditional voting system is used in the United States of America. Nowadays we have another option for a voting system, which seems to be more efficent. For sure the computerized voting system would be easier to count. People, who are used to computers would not have problems with this technological system. But there are also people, who do not often use computers. Another problem is, that not every American citizen can afford a computer so they would not be able to vote. The computerized voting system is not totally safe as well. The programms are made by humans, what means that errors are problably not even avoided. It is possible that the system goes wild and thousands of votes get lost. With this system you can not reproduce the votes.
The current voting system seems to be inefficent and difficult to use. All candidates are on a piece of paper, so it is  extremly complicated to find your prefered candidat. A revoutilinary voting system using touch-screen technology would be easier. The counting of the voting sheets is not the safest method. It is just human that we make mistakes which are leading to misscounted votes.
