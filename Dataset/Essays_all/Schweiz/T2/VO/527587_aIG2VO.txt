Would it be better to use computers to count for the votings or do we still let it to the humains?

Firstable they talk about that the people who lived without computers or don't use them very often will have problems to use them. And if they get help from other people the election could be manipulated by the somebody. The text says that humains makes mistakes and the pc don't. But in fact humains made the computer and it needed to work over and over and over to be reliable. So if the people makes a mistake at crafting the pc, the mistake will bi far worse than just a counting mistake in the elections. And is it so effetcive to use computers for votings. A country has its votings once in two years and in a city a maximmum of two every year, so why using a system that can cause a bigger mistake than a counting mistake by humain error.

Finally it would be better to make it by the humains because its more efficient and cheaper!
