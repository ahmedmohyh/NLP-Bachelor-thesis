In the lecture you could hear how a computer can lead to bigger human errors than humans counting the votes. This is explained with the fact that when a human doesn't count a vote, it's not going to be a mistake of thousands of votes but when a computer does the counting it could lead to a misleading number of wrong votes. So in the lecture they are focused on the human errors but in the text we read they also are talking about the human errors. It says that the system is very inefficient an inaccurate. To solve those problems they think the best solution is to computerize the voting system. It says that often the voters have bad eyesight and they don't see the names so well on the voting papers so they want to have a touchscreen where you can easily choose your candidate. 
In the lecture they also said as an argument that people always improve the computer system with the experience but they do not vote a lot. Every second year one time so there should not be a possibility to make those mistakes because of the few chances of the votings. 
In the text they say as an argument that we and also the governments trust computers for so many other things just like banking transactions and for those things the computer is "perfectly" fine. 
In the lecture there is also said that the voting system with a computer can't be afford by everyone. So that there are a lot of poor people or even people who does not want a computer and they will not be able to vote for the next voting. And the old people who don't know how to use a computer the rigth way so this will lead to trouble. 
The voting will be also more expensive than the other before. 
In the text they have the argument that the mistakes, the human errors will be less often than it was with the humans counting the votes, so it will be more efficient.
