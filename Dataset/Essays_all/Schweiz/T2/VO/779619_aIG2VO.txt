The topic is about old voting systems, that they should be replaced by new computerized voting systems. The question is, if these computersystems are better than those traditional votings. The report thinks, that this is doubtful. First of all it becomes a problem with all the people who can't afford computers or can't easily use them. So those people either learn how to use a computer or they are discouraged to vote. 
An other aspect is that humans could make easily mistakes by counting up the votes and there is too much time the people put time in it. With a computer, who could quickly count all this ballots, there wouldn't be mistakes, but computers are also made by humans. So are they really better? For instance, in the traditional way, people miss a few ballots, but if a computer shuts down, thousands of votes would be removed by the record. And the voting has to start all over again. 
The last aspect is , if computers are trustworthy. The technology has everywhere influenced, for expample in banking transactions or in the communications of highly sensitive information. Here peaople are used to work with computers, because they use them daily and heavily. It took some time that the computers were getting improved and finally get reliable, but in votings, which aren't often to use a computer, it is hard for people to develop trust  and completely rely on those computers.
