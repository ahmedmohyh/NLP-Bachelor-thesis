The first problem critcs have is the inefficiency of the voting system they use now in the United States of America. The system often leads to inaccurate counting of votes. It is difficult for humans to count thousands of ballots without making mistakes, and once a mistake is made and seen, they have to count all ballots again to make sure there are not more mistakes. Having a programmed system for computers would solve that problem. 
On the other hand the people against a change argue that those computer systems are made by human hands, so a little mistake in the system can damage thousands of votes, while a human counting them makes less damage. 

The second argument made by the critics is that the possibility of placing the wrong vote is also an issue. The lists of candidates are always really long so mistakes when voting can happen easily. People with eyesight problems for example could zoom in to the screen on the computer and make sure they voted the right person. Furthermore people should not be afraid of using the program since they use computers everyday for important things such as banking transactions or private communication.
People against the change see a problem with actually having a computer. Computers are expensive and some do not have he possiility of using one. Others do not have the ability to use one because they never needed it. So people could be discouraged to vote because they are affraid of making mistakes or affraid of the technology as a whole.

Last but not least they do not vote that often so a special programmed computer system would not be needed.
