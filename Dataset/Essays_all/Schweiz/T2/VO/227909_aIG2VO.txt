In the text is written that voting on the computer would lead to a flawless result. The author of the text does not mind that old people may are not able to serve a computer correctly. A error in the voting-software would cause a more dramatic inaccurate result than a official who does not count correctly. Online-voting is for voters which live in a other country already allowed. This fact shows us that it is working. A combination of these two voting methods would guarantee that people without computer knowledge can vote under trustworthy circumstances. In addition, the younger people, especially the digital natives, would rather vote because it is more easy for them to vote online. The mixture does it.
