In the last few yers, the voting system was often seen as a problem. And there are a lot of people who want to improve the situation.

On the one hand the voting sheets are often complicated and people often pick the wrong name. On the computers people could magnifie the voting sheet so it would be easier for them to pick the right name. On the other hand there are a lot of voters who do not use computers on a daily basis. These people could have a lot of problems using an electronical votin system. 
The human error is also often discussed in case of miscounting the votes. There are surley some human made mistakes but if a computer is bad programmed the whole election must be retaken. The consequences would be really big and the governement would lose a lot of time and money. 
People claim that we should give the electronical voting system a chance because we trust the eletronical devices on a daily basis. But there are other people who think that we can only trust the computers if we use them every day. They think that computers are improved daily and so they can gain our trust. But an electronical voting system would only be used every second qear so it is hard to develop confidence towards the computers.
