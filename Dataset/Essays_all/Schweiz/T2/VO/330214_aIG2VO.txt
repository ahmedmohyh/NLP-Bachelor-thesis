In the lecture there is said that voting by computer can not be fully trusted and if there is an error in the computer programm it could lead to thousand of votes discounted but in the text there is written that computerized voting is trustworthy, this is quite a contradiction. Well in the text there is said that there are often miscounts if people are going to count but if the computer counts it will not make an error but in the lecture it is said that computers are still programmed by humans and if they have an error it will be major. And comparing banking systems with voting systems it is that baking systems had improved a lot over the years which both sources agree on.  Because they were used a lot, but on the other hand voting systems are just used every two years. Exactly this is different, voting systems are used rarely comparing it to banking systems. Also in the text it is said that to cast a vote the only need to touch the candidate's name on the screen, but if the people do not use computer?
