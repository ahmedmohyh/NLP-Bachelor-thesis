The lady in the oral presentation took rather the side against the new technological voting system. She said that a new voting system with the usage of computer instead of the traditional way on paper would only serve the young or in general the people that are used to new technological devices. So she especially refers to the more traditional people and old people, in general people who aren't used to computer and technology. Because of that she mentiones the problems which such people would face with a new technological voting system. This sector of people wouldn't be able to cope with it. She also said that maybe there are some mistakes made during the evalutaion process but these are minor compared to a problem in the computer system that would result in a huge amount of mitakes in the evaluation of the votes. She also says that even if we trust the technological devices in our daily life in the banking system and in communication, we shouldn't trust the computer systems that help with the evaluation of the votes. Because the banking transactions take place daily and also communication, so there's already a lot of experience behind these software systems. But the voting just takes place every fourth year and because of that the daily practice wouldn't exist and faults occur easily as that was the case in the technology in banking and communication in the beginning too.
