We heard in the presentation, that computer aren't really better then normal voting letters. For sure, for a lot of people it's much easier to vote with the computer. But for those who aren't comfortable with the Computer could also do a mistake while they're voting. So they may vote for the wrong person or for everyone, because they don't know how it works. The text says that the voitng system for the computer would be easier for everyone.
Another argument in the presentation why coumputers aren't better is that computer could also do some mistakes,  for example when the programm isn't working flawless. So then the programm would count the votings wrong and there would be a huge problem with the voting results. For sure normal people can also do mistakes while counting the voting letters. But they would never be as worse as the mistakes from the Programme. The text says that there would be no mistakes by the computer and all the mistakes would be made by the people.
Last but not least there are also several banking programms or other programms who help us a lot in our daily life, but they all got once introduced and they all had their problems at the beginning. So there would surely be any problems at the beginning and those mistakes aren't affordable for such a voting.
