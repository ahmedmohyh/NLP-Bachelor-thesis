At the very beginning of the record, there was said, that voting is a traditional problem. According to the text, there could be a lot of mistakes, made by humans. If someone can't see really good, it is possible, that he votes not for his favorite candidat. In the text, they suppose to use computers, which are easy to handle instead. But as they told in the recording, the other case is also likely. If the people have to use computers to vote, they may can't afford them. There still exist some humans, who aren't able to use a computer, so for them the election would become impossible. 
For the next different point we first take a look at the text. There is written down, that the humans do a lot of errors, with counting the votes. There some mistakes can easily accure. If they would use computer technology to count the massive amount of votes, there would be no mistakes anymore. Humans are getting tired after a while, wo if they have to count so many votes, they sure make an error. On the other hand, computer programmes are written by humans. In the recording, they talk about what will happen, if an unexpected error would accure. Also computers can do something wrong, and it would be a lot more tragicly, as if just some votes aren't counted.
It is also a question of security. How save are computerprogrammes? In the text they are in the opinion, that computerprogrammes were used all day, for example in banks. The critics don't really believe them, because according to them it isn't the same thing. The election don't happen frequently, just once or twice a year. The computerprogrammes of banks are used every day, so they can detect the errors and correct them. At a voting caunter, there could be a big problem, which the humans don't realize, because they don't use the structures every single day.
