It is true that the traditional voting system in the US has caused some problems. However to replace the humans by computers does not have to be the right joice. Even if the computerized voting system seems to be easy for people who know how to work with a computer, it can be very troubling for those who do not know how to handle a computer. These people could vote for the wrong person by accident or not vote at all. Of course it would be easier, as said in the text, for the generation that has grown up with the new technology, but for some of the older generations computers can still be a challenge.
It is true that humans make mistakes, but because computers are programmed by humans, they are able to make mistakes as well. These mistakes could be far more damaging than the couple of ballots which a human could mark wrong. 
Furthermore a computer programm needs to be improved over years, but with an election only twice a year the programm is not able to have enough work experience in order to improve.
