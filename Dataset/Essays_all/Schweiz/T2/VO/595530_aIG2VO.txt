In this essay I'm going to write something about the voting systems. There are pros and cons about the old system and about the new technological one. 

First I'm going the explain the view of the old system. It's a bit inefficient and it lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. There are many people who aren't very safe in using technology. They will have problems with a computer voting. Anohter thing is that people don't trust computers. That's why it would be better if they use the old system. In the other hand, in the old system there were human error because it heavy to count the votes and it's easy to make a counting mistake. That's like human beings are. 

Second I'm going to talk about the new computer system. First of all, it removes the human error, but computer are invented and programmed by human being also they could make errors, too. It's worse if a computer is wrong programmed than a human being has misscounted. The result of a computer error is like 1000 error because there are many other computer which are programmed like the wrong one. Like I said, the technology could be a problem for some people. In the other hand, a computer is better for the ones who have an eyes problem. It's much easier to read on computers and it's rarer to missvote. That's why computers are better.
