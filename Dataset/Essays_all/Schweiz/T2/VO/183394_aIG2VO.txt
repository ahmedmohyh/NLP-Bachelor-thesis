I've just heard a presentation about the voting with computers, which I want to summarize now. In this text is said, that it is a good thing for people who are used to computers, but it is not that good for those who are not used to the new technology. Those people would have a lot of trouble and make mistakes. So the election won't have the right result, because the vote the false person. Furthermore there is the question about the counting. Can we trust the computer systems more than the human beings? Well it is clear, that humans would make mistakes while counting, but the computer system is also done by a human being and so it is also possible that there are some faults containd. And if there is a fault, that would have a big impact on more than thousand votes. So can we trust the computer election? 

Now I want to compare this text with the text I have read. The written text is more for the new voting system. It says that the traditional voting is inefficient and contains more faults. On one hand this faults are caused by the counting mistakes, like it was also said in the spoken text. On the other hand they are caused by old people who can't see that well anymore. This eyesight disability causes that the vote the false person, because they can not even read the names or chose the correct box to tick. Moreover the written text says, that it is easier to vote by computer. The results are gotten quickly and automatic and also the voting is easier. One click and it is done.
