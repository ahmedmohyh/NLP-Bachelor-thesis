The discussion of in the text and the lecture differ from each other quite a bit. In the lecture it was mentioned that, although the traditional voting system might have some problems the computerized method will not make it better. In the lecture it is said that computerized voting may be easier for people who are used to working with computers. However, many people are not familiar with the use of computers or simply cannot afford one. In the text it is said that computerized voting would be far more efficient and accurate, the text also mentions the human error that occurs when counting all the votes and how expensive and time consuming a recount would be. However, in the lecture we hear that even though there may be some human errors in counting the problems that might occur when voting with computers would be far more serious, partly becauese there would not be a physical form of the votes. What's more, during the lecture it is mentioned that bakning transaction are used daily and improved with time and that is the reason why they can be trusted but votings are not that often, therefore it would not be sufficient.
