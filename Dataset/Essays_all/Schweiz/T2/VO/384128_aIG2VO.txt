The woman speaks about to electronizing the election and to vote. She think its a bad thing.  For people that are used to the computer it's good, but what with the ones who is poor or don't know anything about the technology. They want to vote electronicly because they will reduse the hand counted mistakes. But what if the porgramms, that are wrotet by humans would have some mistakes? That would be horrible. That one mistake would be effetcting 1000 of votes and nobody would noticed it. If they are only saved on the computers it would be impossible to recount them.  But there are some good point too. You don't have to search the names ond the big paper. It would be more visible. For people with a poor eyesight it would be so much better. They  wouldn't give the vote to the wrong person. The other point is that somputer are way more precize than human in counting the votes.
