The traditional votingis is inefficient and often leads to mistakess. Because they have to count every ballot and when they  miss one leads this to incorrect results. It is also a problem, that they have to count every ballot by them selves. Because they have to make a tick next to the name on the ballon people with poor eyesight make a tick  next to the wrong name. This leads to wrong votes for the wrong candidates. 
Because of this problems,they want to replace this strategie with comuterizing. But this leads to other problems. Many people can't handle this system, because they can't deal with the technology.
Some people say it is to risky to use complicated voting technology nationwide. But the goverment and the people trust other the computer technology every day in important things like banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensetive informations.
