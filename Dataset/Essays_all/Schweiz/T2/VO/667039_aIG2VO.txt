Some people say that the current voting system is too likely to make some human mistakes. Humans counting the votes one by one are not efficient enough as they might accidantelly count them wrongly. An other error that accures some times is that the voters get confused by the long list of names that they have to choose from and vote for the wrong candidate. A computerized voting system, with an easy to use touch-screen, would be for the most of us, much easier to use. Furthermore, a compuretized system would be more reliable to make no mistakes. The problem here is, that computer programs are done by humans. That means that if the programers make an error while producing a computer program to vote, it would have a major negative impact on the counting of votes. People who aren't familiar with computers or can't efford one would be discouraged to vote. People nowadays are more aliek to use very complex computer technology every day to deal with banking transactions and the communication of highly sensitive infomation. The problem is that we don't vote enough to develop a fully trustfull program and that might mean a lot of mistakes until we voted enough times to find the perfect computerized voting system.
