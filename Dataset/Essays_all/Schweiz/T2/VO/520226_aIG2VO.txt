In the modern age of technology, things like computerized voting systems are often mentioned by critics of the traditional voting system. Those critis claim that online voting would be more accutate and safe than the one we have now. People wouldn't accidentally vote for the wrong canditate because of their poor eyesight. Safty would be insured because it would not be humans, who are flawed and can easily make mistakes, that count the votes but reliant computers. 
But even critics can be critizised. There are a handful of arguments that show the flaws that a computerized voting system would have. Elderly or poor people would have disadvantages in such a system because they are not used to computers. These people would easiy make mistakes or would not be able to give their vote at all. Another argument against such a system is that, yes, humans make mistakes but are computers really to be trusted compleatly? The aswer is no, even the seemingly perfect computers make mistakes. And those made by computers would be far more serious ones that those made by humans. Tousands of votes could be lost by just a little flaw in the system. 
So can we really trust a computerized voting system? I think the future will tell us sooner or later.
