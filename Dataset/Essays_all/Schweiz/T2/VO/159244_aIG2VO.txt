The problem is that todays voting sistem is not as efficient as it is wished to be. It could either be human error or the fault of technology failing which causes all these inacurracies.

The reason for all these wrong votes could be, for example, that the people voting mark the wrong candidate on the voting sheet. Also, it could happen that those who are responsible for counting the votes make errors.
However, if we think that we can use machines to replace officials and voting sheets to avoid miscounts, we might be wrong. People who are not used to using technology could make even more mistakes or they do not vote at all because they do not understand it. Another wrong claim is that computers are flawless.
Actually, they are also created by humans hence why they could also be faulty and create even far more serious mistakes than humans could ever manage to do.
