The right way to vote

Voting happens in the United States every 2 years, thus it is important for the people to know how to vote properly. What is more imporant is the way they can vote and counting mistakes that may happen. In this essay I'd like to emphasize the points critics say about computerized voting and about the traditional way of voting. 

In the traditional way of voting, it is common that there you will be given a sheet where you have to choose from a large list, the name of the person you want to vote for. Thus there can happen many mistakes, as for example people with poor eyesight could mark the wrong person which can rapidly lead to mistakes. Altough everyone could use this voting system, there are still other problems that may occur. Another reason against traditional voting is the way the votes are being counted. There are people who need to count them one by one and humans make mistake, so this can also lead to counting mistakes.

There are also some arguments agains computerized voting. To begin with, even though some people think computers are easy to use this does not count for everyone. Computers only work for people who are really used to them, so this method can not be used by everyone. It is also said that computers are progrmammed by humans and since humans can make mistakes, who says that they did not during programming the computers? 


In my opinion the traditional way of voting is the most useful one. During computerized voting there may not just happen mistakes because of the programming, it could also be that the voting system gets hacked or that computers may shut down during voting. In the traditional way of voting there do not happen such big mistakes. What may happen are small mistakes in which just two to five votes get miscounted.
