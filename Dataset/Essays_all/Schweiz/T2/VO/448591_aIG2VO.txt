It seems like there is a probLEm with de voting system in the United States. Some people do not like the system of voting on a sheet of paper because there are so many names on each ballot and they are written so smal, that someone with bad eyesight accidentaly vote for the wrong person.
On the other hand some people wouldn't like a computerized voting system. A programm designed by humans has mistakes in it. Because every human does mistakes. So if people would vote via computer, some votes would go lost if there is a problem with the PC or the programm. But if voting on the computer was possible, it would be much easyer for older people, incase they know how to use this technology. The Computer can show up the names much better. With a bigger writing it is easier to read the names correctly and vote for the right person.

In the end, computer technology should be used in the voting system. We trust other computers and maschines on a day to day basis and no one cares there. So why shouldn't we trust computers in this particular case?
