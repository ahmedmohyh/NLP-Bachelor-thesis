So in the text they say that people trust the complex computer technology because of them being perfectly accurate. For example in banking transactions and also in communication, people trust the computers blindly.
But in the listening from before they are saying that computers can't be trusted a 100% because their software is based on human programming skills which can cause errors. This is the point where the two sources/ perspectives do not see eye to eye, because the text is saying that a computer based vote will remove the possibility of human errors and the listening says exactly the opposite.

They are also talking about the problems that the two options of voting bring. The written text says that the computer based vote shows fewer risks than the traditional way of voting and the listening says that the two options bring the same amount of risks. They argument is even more against the computer based option because an error without a backup will cause total loss of the given votes and will make it impossible to make a recount.
The witten text on the otherside says that a recount for the traditional voting would cost too many resources as time, money and manpower. So the written source relies on the perfection of the computer.

Which beside is also my point of view. I think and I know that machines do not make any mistakes, only the program can have a bad coding but this shouldn't happen if there are just a few good and professional programmers who create this easy software together. 
I know from experience that this isn't a that complex of a software and mistakes can be avoided by checking the code a few times.
