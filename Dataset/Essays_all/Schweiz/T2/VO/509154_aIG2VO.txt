The woman in the presentation were against the computerized voting because there are a lot of people who do not work with a computer at work or at home so they have no idea how it works and so they will do mistakes. In the text it says that it would be easier because you don't have to search the name on a full sheet of paper. 
The woman also said that computer are programed by humans so there also can be mistakes and that the mistakes will be more dramatic than counting by humans. The text do not mention who programed the computers. 
If a computer were not programed the right way and make a mistake the result will be more dramatic because more votes are going to be lost or wrong. The writer of the text thinks that counting by computer is more effectiv and there will be less problems than counting by hand. 
And its absolutly stupid to say people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name on the paper. If they don't see very good what on the paper stands they also don't see what is standing on the computer and the will also mark the wrong person. So I don't understand why this stands in the text.
