The arguments of the oppostions can be summerized into three distinctive points. 

The first point is that people who are not used to using computers or do not own a computer either cannot be a part of the vote because they do not know how to vote on a computer or that they are afraid of using the computer and so a fair amount of voters could be lost. 

The second point is that computers are being programed by a human being. This could mean that the computer programes have faults and errors and could then lead to a corrupted election because either some votes would not be counted or the program has a major flaw which could then delete all the votes and thus no back-up of the given votes could be saved and would disappear into the nothingness. 

The final point of the opposition is that bank actions and voting cannot be compared because programs which are used by the bank are used every day whereas a program for elections would only be used all two years and so the program would not be updated on a daily basis and many bugs could be found in the system. 

All these arguments form the opposition contradict the other group.
