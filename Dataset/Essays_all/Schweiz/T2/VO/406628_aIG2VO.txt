In the audio there was mentionned that the old voting system is better than the online-voting. But in the text is written, that the old voting system is insufficent and that the current voting systems are better.
It was also said that the people who aren't used to the computers and who can't get along with the technology, have problems with the votes and tend to vote together or not at all just because they don't know how to do it on their own. 
The argument in the text about the human error is critisised in the audio. In their opinion also computers are programmed from humans and they could also be wrong and could have got errors. If the result of a computer is wrong there would be a lot more consequences than a human counted result.
Another point that they mentionned is that the old voting system has been prepared any times and a lot of mistakes and insufficent points were made better. So they say that the old system was better than the voting at the computer because also the online voting system should be prepared and corrected until it is really secure.
They also highlighted the importance of a correct vote result. The voting is only every 2 years and have a big infuence on the citicens.
