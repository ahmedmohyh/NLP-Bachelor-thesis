The fallowing text and the presentation show opinions wich are the same but also some wich are different. Both are saying that the actual system of voting for candidates is unsure in some ways, like accidentially voting for the wrong candidate or that it is a terrible and inefficient way to count all the votings without a computer.
The difference is, that the article says it should be made with a new technology, that peolpe can vote online and that this would be a great thing in innovation. It really shows the opinion, that we should give it a try and there is only a verly little part of seeing a bad thing in it. 
In case, the presentation is completely differetn. It shows the other opinion of the new technology. They say that voting with computers would be more inefficient and there wil happen more accidents, because there a re many people witch can't read the little letters very good and would voting for the wrong candidate, more then they already do now. Also they say, that an onlne voting would be difficult, because it's only made for people wich are used to computers and work with it every say. People who unerstand the world of technology, but it would be a good solution for the big part of humans. 
It is also daid, that a mistake in a computer programm would be much more terrible for the whole voting than some counting minstakes by the people. An Error in a coumputer programm would mean that the whole voting has to be done again, beauce everyhting would be a fail if this happens. 
Some points wich are said in the presenation, are written in the article too, but the presentation shows that their thoughts are more true than the ones with are written in the text, or they just had the better arguments to catch me on their side.
