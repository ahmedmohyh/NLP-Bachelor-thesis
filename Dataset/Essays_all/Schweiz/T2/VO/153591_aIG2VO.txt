Computer technologies are made to make the world more confident for humans. In the past every inhabitnat of a country had to give his choice on paper by a national election. And every single choice had to be count by a human as well. Critics say that these humans can influence a result of an important election and they anounce that an election could be taken more easily while using computers instead of paper. The ones who believe in the old system say that especially old people are not able to handle a computer in a proper way. And they attach that a computer is as well designed by an computer specialist who is a human as well and who could also influece an important voting.
Critics respond that we let our computers do even more important or more critical stuff and that a voting which is taken by computers could be handled in the same way. And the voting could be taken even faster because it will not take hours to count all the ballots.
