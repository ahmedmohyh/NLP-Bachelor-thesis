Critics of the current U.S. voting system want to replace the traditional system by a computerized one. They say the current system with the ballot and votes being counted by people would be inefficient and inaccurate. In addition, a computerized voting system would be easier for the people. But it must be considered that not all people in the U.S. are used to computers or are able to afford one. Therefore, fear of technology might lead to fewer people voting. Human errors made during vote counts are inevitable. A computer won't make those mistakes, yet a defective program might lead to a great miscount of thousands of votes, a computer recount might be impossible. Computer technology is being used every day and works perfectly most of the time, but it can not be fully trusted and is therefore not yet used for the voting systems in the United States.
