It was pointed in the text that a computer-based voting system would be easy for all users. Nobody would have a problem and due to that it would be more efficient and accurate. But in the audio they talked about all the people that are not familiar with this technology. Those could have a problem and then accidently choose the wrong person or don't vote at all. 

There was also a part which was about the errors. The traditional voting system brings human errors due to accidently choosing the wrong person or by miscounting the votes and as the text says, would those be eliminated with the change to a coumputer-based voting system. But aren't computers and its systems programmed by humans? The audio file makes the statement that with a new computer-based system there is also the possibility of human errors. But here it would have an ever bigger impact on the whole voting. What would happen if one voting possibility (a candidate) is linked wrong in the system? We'd might have a wrong president.

Another argument that this text gives is that they don't see a problem by implementing such a system. They also mention that we trust those complex computer technology in our everyday life and that we because of that should also implement this new system. But if we listen to the audio file, we'd change our opinion in a minute. All those systems had to start small and had a lot of errors. A new implemented system would have that too. And because a  vote only takes place a few times in a decade it doesn't make sense to implement it.
