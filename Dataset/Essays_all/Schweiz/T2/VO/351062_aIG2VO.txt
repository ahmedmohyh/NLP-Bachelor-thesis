In the written text it is said that the people who are counting the votes may make some mistakes that will influence the whole election. Whereas in the lecture it was said that people of course make counting mistakes but they are definitely not as considerable as when humans make mistakes. Computer programmes are made by humans so they are bound to have mistakes in them as well. Furthermore if the programme contains a mistake there's thousands of votes that are counted wrong. Compared to the few mistakes the people counting the votes make, it is far better to keep up the old system.
In the written text it is mentioned though that there won't be any mistakes and recounts won't be necessary, therefore it is no problem if there's no possibility to recount the votes.
In the presentation it is stated that computer programmes aren't reliable, this is a point where the author of the text doesn't agree once more with the presentation. He said that the computer system would be far more reliable, as we can see in the online banking systems which seem to work more or less flawless.
