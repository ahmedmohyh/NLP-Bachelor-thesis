The arguments in the text are the same as the ones the lady said but just twisted. In the text there's the argument that humans are mistakeful and at the presentation the argument that humans made the computers and so the computers can be even more mistakeful is mentioned. It's like a tipical debate. Endless and needless. At least the point that the computer could miss a few thousnand votes and a human just a few is a truly good point. I think we should combine the good side of every system. Or even let the people decide wich one they want to use. Because the argument that elderly people have problems with never technology is a present problem. after all voting is way to complicated. I was in the united states for a few weeks as the voting took part in nearly every disscusion. But not the question Hillary or Trump was the main subject. It was that the people were afraid of the election day and that they won't know how to hanlde the difficult voting sheets. After all we also heard from Snowden that the NSA is everywere. They're probably reading this right now. So a good old sheet of paper is easyer, safer to handle and way cheaper than to build a new program with new problems and new coasts for the taxpayers.
