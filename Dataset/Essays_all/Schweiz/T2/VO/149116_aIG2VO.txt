The text I just read and the presentation I heard were about traditional and modern voting.
Other than the text, the presentation was pointing out the disadvantages of the modern way, with a computerized system, to vote. The woman said that it would not be any better espeacally for the people who are not used to computers or can't afford one. The text though said that the new system would be easy-to-use. They also disagree at the point of making errors. The presentator thinks that computers also make faults, they aren't flawless because they are programmed by humans and these errors would be much more serious than the ones which are made at a traditional voting. Thousands of votes could be miscount or worse, they could get lost. Also it's said that it isn't save because often the votings are just all two years or less but in other parts like banking transactions it is used everyday and it got improved ofer the past couple of years, so it can't be compared.
