The lecture states that even with introducing computers to count the votes at elections there might still be the same amount of errors than with humans counting the votes or even more. They state that one big problem would be that many people aren't used to use a computer on a daily basis or aren't even able to afford one at all. These people would simply be cut from voting. Also we cant be sure that computer programs make no mistakes at all. There is a huge possiblity that a computer system has a bug in it and might delete or misscount hundreds if not thousands of votes. We have to see that they are programmed by humans so they are likely to have mistake in them because as we all know humans do make mistakes. Even banking programs didnt work perfectly at first but had to be improved many times. This would probably not work for voting systems since votes only take place ever two or more years.
 
The text on the other hand believes that a computerized voting system is essentiel to have a trustworthy and efficient voting system. They state that especially for people with bad eyesight it would be a lot easier to vote on the computer than on a voting paper with very small writings. They are also sure that computer programs would make less mistakes than humans while counting the votes. Moreover they believe that if humans can trust technology on a day to day basis in bank transaction as well as in  communication they can't be bad or wrong to use as voting system aswell.
