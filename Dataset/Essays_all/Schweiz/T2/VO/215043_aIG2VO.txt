There came the idea to vote on comuputes, to prevent people from making mistakes. It happens often that some older people or some who have sight problems make the wrong name on the ballot. On the computer you could magnify the names and then you would just have to touch the one you want to vote for him. Much easier! 
But it isn't easier for everyone, just for those who know how to use computers. Voters who don't know much about technology or computers, will have problems as well. 
And computers aren't just robots without mistakes. Human beings create the computers and its programs. So what if the man/woman who created the program did a mistake? Even if it's just a small mistake, the consequences would be immense for the votes or election. You couldn't use these vottes. 
So the question is, if the risk for mistakes is higher by using computers or by letting everyone vote themselves.
But we also have to consider that governments and individuals trust other complex computer technology every day. Nowadays we make our banking transaction and communicate highly sensitive information on computers and even phones.
