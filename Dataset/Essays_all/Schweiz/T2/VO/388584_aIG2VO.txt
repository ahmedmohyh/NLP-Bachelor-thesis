In the text we get explained the inefficienty and inaccuratcy of counting votes in the United States. There are many flaws to the system. One of them being, that many vote by mistake for the wrong canditiate, because some can not see the names on the sheet very well. Another problem would be, that the votes are counted by hand and for that reason it is very likely for mistakes to happen. They suggest computerized voting systems. It would be more efficient and less prone for human error. Computer technology used for banking transactions would also show how good and user friendly this system is. 
The presentation though looks at the topic from another perspective. They believe that computerized voting systems, would just complicate the whole process. Many people who can not affored a computer or just do not use one in their day to day basis, could have difficulties or worse, be discuraged from voting at all. Many believe that computers are prone to human mistakes, but many forget that computers were programmed by humans. So if their was a problem with counting the votes or just in general with the system, it would be far greater than the mistake a human would make. Also banking transactions which are used daily with computerized programms, get improved very often because of its freakvent use. Computerizing the voting system would be highly inefficient, because we vote very selden.
