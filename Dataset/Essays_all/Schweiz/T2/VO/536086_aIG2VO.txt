The text says that we have to change the traditional voting system to a computerized one. The speaker has the opposite opinion.

So in the text it says that it gives a lot of human errors while the voting and that with the new system they can be elimanted. For example people with problems with their eyes will see it better on the computer and so they can also vote for that person they really want to. They also have not to search the name of the person they like on a huge sheet of paper. In the audiocast the speaker said that it won't give human errors in a direct way but the machines will be programmed by humans so it also gives human errors. The most important problem for her is that human errors like counting wrong or mark the wrong name are small errors and causes not very big problems but when the computer system has a problem that amounds a much bigger problem and we can't controll the voices afertwards because they are all in the system and when that is wrong everything is wrong. Also it is just easier for people who know computers and that are used to. Edlerly people maybe are afraid of the computers and won't vote at all o they can't use it in the right way.

A argument for the change out of the text is that we use also in other situiatons computers like in banking transactions or something like that. But the speaker says that we use this other systems all day and very hardly so they are highly developped not like the voting system because they vote just once in two years nationally and just a few times locally so the chance that something will go wrong is much higher than in systems that we use every day.This because it is very ahrd to improve the voting systems in fact it won't be used that much.
