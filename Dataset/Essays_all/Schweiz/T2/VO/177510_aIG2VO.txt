While the text is rather positivly about voting with computers, the presentation is clearly against it and sees too many problems and disadvantages in it. Both think that the traditional way to vote contains several problems but the woman in the presentation doubts that a system with computers would be better. She says that it would probably only be easier for people who are used to computers but those who aren't or who can't afford one have a huge problem to vote. And moreover when a computer system has a problem it will affect the result of a vote much more then the mistakes which the people who count the votes make. And if there is a problem no recount will be possible. A system has to be improved by using it many times so you can see where the problems are but because one won't use the system that often it isn't really possible to improve it the way it should. In the text they write more about the problems that are in the traditional way of voting. They write that there is a chance that people vote for the wrong canditate because they mark the wrong name on this large sheet of paper containing many names. The use of computers would simplify that because one can also zoom in. Its also written that the counting would be much easier. About the problems mentionned in the presentation they write nothing. They don't see the point why they shoudn't trust those systems while governments also thrust other complex computer technology.
