The problems of human mistakes are mentioned in both statements, but on one side they mentioned that people make voting mistakes if they can't see the paper well enough. On the other side is a computer for some people really hard to handle so they aren't able to use it without help. The speaker told the audience that computer systems form the banks didn't work correct from the beginning and they are used every day many times. In compare to that there isn't any spaces for startermistakes if there is an presidential election or something similar. These voting machines would be used maybe once a year maybe even less so there could be a problem whenever they are needed. The human mistakes which are ment could have even worse consequences if there is a programming mistake at the computer software. A man or a woman can maybe put a votingpaper on the wrong side or didnt count two or three of them accidentely but a computer would do the same mistake over and over again. So if there is a problem with the software the consequences would be even worse than some human mistakes in electioncounting. If there is a way to prohibit counting mistakes it must be somewhere in between this two possibillities, because both of them have some weak points and may be a reason for more or less hard following mistakes.
