In the presentation it is said that a computerized system might not be a better option for the voting system because other problems appear. People who are used to computers may have it easy, but a lot of people are not used to computers at all, because they have bad eyesight or can not afford one. As the computer programs on which the computerized voting system would run on will be written by humans, human error will not be completely vanished like the text predicts. In fact, an error at such a computer program might be more fatal than just some uncounted votes. Perhaps, the whole system could collapse and a recount would not be possible as everything happened totally virtually and electronically. Banking systems are stable because they are used daily and developped after a long time of use. But a voting system is just used in a two or one years time  period and that would be too rare to properly develop such a system.

The presentation showes contrasts to the written part. It gives reasons about why a computerized and modernized voting system might not be such a good idea as it first seems.
