Some people say, that the voting system in the USA is flawed, because of worng votes and human errors and think, that a computerized system as the useit in online banking, would be much better, but is that really true? 
Voting can be difficult especially if you have poor eyesight, since the the names on the ballots are very small and voting for the wrong person isn't that uncommon. Some people say, that a computerized touchscreen system would be way better, since you could theoreticly zoom in, to see the names better. But other people claim, that if there was a computerized system in use, many people, that don't use a PC at home would have a problem with that, since they're not used to it. Maybe, they would even stop going to vote. 
Another big question is, if PC's are really better than humans, since humans can make faults, but if a computer makes a fault, the effects would be much worse, since a human can get somme ballots worng, but a computer could screw up thousands of votes. 
Last but not leat, there's the argument, that banking systems work perfectly too, but critics claim, that those systems, used on a daily basis, had much more time to be perfected than a voting system that is used about twice a year.
