For the woman that did the lecture, computerized voting doesn't have to be any better than the current way of voting. It would be easier for people that often use computers or know how to deal with them, people that never or harsly ever use computers, would have problems voting online and some could even be afraid of voting on a computer.
The people counting the votes may miss some bullots or write down the wrong vote, but computerprograms are written by humans and they have the errors within them, which were put in there. An error in computerized voting could be by far more dangerous than a misscount done by people counting the votes.
She also mentionned, that programs we use everyday had problems too, but these problems were fixed by people using the program on a daily basis and finding all the bugs and errors. The voting system would only be used once every two years and would take years to find all the problems in it.
