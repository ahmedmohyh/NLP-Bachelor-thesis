In the presentation the woman supported with four main arguments her statement that the traditional voting system is better than the computerized voting system. 
She said that for people who are used to computers computerized voting is easy but for people who fear tecnology the computerized voting system could be a problem because they are so scared that they don't vote at all. In the text it said that the current voting system of the US is the major source of inaccurancy  They have the opposite opinion. The argument in the text is that a lot of people vote by accident wrong espacially old people with poor eyesight. The woman said that a computer also can make a mistake and if a computer has a mistake or the programm it's much worse than wrong counting because the mistake is in the system. When you count wrong you can just count again. Her opponent says that the computerized system is more perfect than a humanbeing and that there will be less mistakes and it also would be more easy to count the votes.
To the argument of the woman that it won't be save enought he says that we use it already eyeryday for bank transitions and other dayli process so why sould voting not become also one of them.
