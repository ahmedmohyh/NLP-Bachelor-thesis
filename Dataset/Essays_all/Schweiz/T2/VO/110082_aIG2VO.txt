There are a lot of people that don't have a computer or don't know how they really work, like elderly people. For them it's easy to choose the wrong candidate. The computers could even discourage the potential voters to vote at all allthough the text says, that the digital system would make it easier for everyone.
It was also mentioned that the programms were programmed by humans, so the risk of humor error isn't eliminated, as said in the text but rather hidden even deeper in the voting process. And a mistake in the programm is actually way worse than a mistake with counting the votes, because with the faulty programm, all the votes made with that machine, perhaps thousands, are faulty where as a little mistske while counting manually affects only a few votes. And would there be an error detected the manual votes could easily be counted again, but the digital votes would be lost forever.
Furthermore it was said that the computer technologies that we use every day like banking transactions had a lot of oppurtunities to get improved because they are used every day. When they got first releaased they were faulty but the had time to be improved. The voting machines are only used every second year, so there is almost no other occasion where an error could be detected and improved.
