The problem that is mentioned in the text passage and the presentation is that todays voting is inefficient. The text says that computerized voting should replace the traditional voting which is done by humans counting the ballots. It's said that the sheets contain too many names and consequently its difficult, especially for people with poor eye sight, to mark the right name. in contrast the presentator says that not all people are used to computers and that it's difficult for them to cope with the new technologies. It's said that people have fear of it or can't afford a computer. A second point that the text passage mentions in favour of computerized systems is that it would remove human errors since they have to deal with thousands of ballots. But in the presentation it's said that if the computer programm is defect it would be a enormous disaster, as the ballots would not be able to be recounted. Since this is also mentioned in the text passage, the writer claims to give the nationwide voting technology at least a thought. The author thinks that banking transactions are as well done by computers every day but the difference is that voting in the USA is done only every second year so this system is not that improved.
