The traditional voting system is by now the best option humans had. Now we have the possibility to use technology. With computerized voting we have a new improvement during the votes. 
But there are some critical points that have to be considered. Some people are't familiar with computers and it can cause fear and insecurity. Another point is that not everybody has a computer and hasn't the chance to vote. These arguments can lead to less motivation in voting.

Computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. The probability of a mistake in the program is big. In this case the officials, who count the votes one by one, would maybe miss one ballot. But an error in the program would led to probably 1000 votes that are miscounted. Another problem is that the traditional system is about physical data, in a program's case not. Therefore there couldn't be the chance of recount the votes.

The idea of computerized votes have to be improved. It is a very important and complicated subject. We shouldn't be scared of this chance, the future is now.
