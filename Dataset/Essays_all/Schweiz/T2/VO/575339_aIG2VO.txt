The lecture aknowledges the problems that come with traditional voting systems, namely that human error in counting can cause some votes to falsely or not at all counted but it emphasizes that this only concernes some votes, while computerized systems can also contain human error due to the systems being developped by humans. The lecturer explains that errors in the computerized system can have a much larger impact and influence or falsen thousands of votes opposed to only some. Further, votes in computerized systems are often not archived and thus, if an error was detected, recount would be impossible. She also highlights the issue of people not having the money to afford or people not being used to computers. Those people might have problems in voting with a computerized system or might even not vote at all because of their fear of technology. Concerning the trust that the text argues we do have in computerized systems when it comes to banking tansactions or communication of highly sensitive information, the lecture claims that this trust builds on the fact that these systems are used heavily and on a daily bases. It portrays how these systems weren't flawless in the beginning neither and how they had to be improved and worked on in order to gain the trust they today received. Countrary to that, votings aren't held as often as once in two years nationally and some few times a year within a state, which leads the lecturer to ask the question of how the necessary trust could be developped in computerized voting systems, based on these circumstances.
