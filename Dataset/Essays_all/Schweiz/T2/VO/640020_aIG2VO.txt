The question is "do we need computer for the elections to do leas misstake by the voting".
It sad that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. With computers you can do your text so big how do you want and you can read it easily. 
An other argument is officials must often count up the votes one bye one. With the computer this go very quickliy. And people normaly made more mistakes then a computer. But if a computer have a error all the votes can be count wrong.
The people have fear that the computer make mistakes but everyday we work with computers and we trust others complex technology for example banking transactions.
