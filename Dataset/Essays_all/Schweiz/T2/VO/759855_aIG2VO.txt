In the audio file it is said that computerized votings are not trusted by everyone. People who are not used to computers, people who can not afford a computer and people who do not use them then have a disadvantage. They can vote easily wrong. There are also a lot of people who do not trust in technology. And who says that computers are better than humans. It is true that humans make faults but are computer really better? They are built by humans so why should they be perfect. If a computer systems has an error and it miscounts there is no way to get the right votings back. And the confidence of people in the technology of the banks and other individuals had to be developped. This could only happen because they are used every single day. Other than the computer systems for the votings.
The argument in the text was that a lot of people easily vote for the wrong candidate because of the long list. But the audio file comes with nearly the same argument. It is difficult for people who are not used to computers to vote for the right person. Also both say there could be miscountings. On the one side you have to trust to the counting people or on the other side you have to be confident that the computer systems won't make an error. The argument of the text that the daily used complex computer technology in banking transactions work perfectly and accuratley becomes worse when you hear the argument of the audio file. It is true that the daily used technology in our normal life had to be proven before everyone trusted them. But in the votings they can not make mistakes, there would be big problems.
