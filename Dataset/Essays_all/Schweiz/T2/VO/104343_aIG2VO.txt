Yeah well I didn't really understand something about this weird topic and I'm to lazy to reread the whole text again. In the moment I would rather reread Harry Potter or maybe The Game  of Thrones. During the listening I draw a cow of my piece of paper, so I didn't really listen to the listening, maybe I'm a little imbercile. I can maybe talk a bit from my life to bring the time over. I really enjoy dancing. when I dance I just feel free, but I don'tdance anything, I dance rock'n'roll and disco fox. Both are dances who only can danced by a couple. Myabe I'm a aslo a daydreamer. When I'm older and want to get married I want to marry in a yellow dress like Bell from "The Beauty and the Beast". Yeah I'm special I'm special I'm special. It's absolutely boring because we can't sit next to our best friend, I miss J., she's in the other edge of the classroom. Now I'm on that point of the test where I have seven minutes left and don't understand why we have so  much time. I have written more than enough words and can't skip the exercise.
