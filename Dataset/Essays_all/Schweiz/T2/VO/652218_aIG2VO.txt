Reasons pro the traditional voting: If we have to vote by computer it might be impossible for some people to vote at all because they mightn't have a computer or don't have the skills to use one. Another reason is that as mentioned in the text humans make mistakes and because humans would of course create the programm it'd most definitely have mistakes too and they's be even more concerning than some uncounted ballots. Sure computer programms for for example banking transactions are flawless now but they in the beginning they weren't. And because of the frequency of voting, the programm wouldn't be used much and therefore people wouldn't realise very fast that there is a mistake.

Reasons against traditional voting: Computers are more efficient and trustworthy. Also the quote of human mistakes is pretty high because they have to stay focused for such a long time.

I'd prefer the modern voting too, it's less complicated and needs less effort. Sure some people might not be able to use a computer but that generation is going to die soon anyway. For me it's barely imaginable to think that there would be mistakes in the programm because there will be a lot of people working on it and correcting mistakes of others. And they are experts. People that count the ballots might also get paid for writing down the wrong result.
