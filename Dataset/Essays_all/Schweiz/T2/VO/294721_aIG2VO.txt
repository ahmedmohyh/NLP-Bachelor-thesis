As in a today's world technology becomes more and more important and people believe that the traditional voting system in the United states should be transformed into a technological vote. 
In the presentation they are against the technological vote as not all people are used to computers, especially older people. Whereas it is said in the text that for the older people it should become easier, because they can not see that well and they can zoom the text on the screen, but on a paper it is more difficult to figure out the names of the candidates, because they can not see the names properly.
So at the moment some might vote by accident the wrong candidate, but as heard in the presentation, with the technological vote, some are not even able to vote, because they are either not used to a computer or they can not even afford a computer, so the people might get under pressure when they want to vote.
Furthermore, computer systems are made by humans and can be missused in a way that some votes could be removed and the voting system would fail at all or, according to the presentation, the system is by accident installed in a wrong way so the vote might not even take place.
In addition, in the text it is said that the people use e-banking nearly every day and also communication has improved through technology, but as the presenting person said banking transactions are made every day, but voting is not an everyday thing it usually about four times a year!
