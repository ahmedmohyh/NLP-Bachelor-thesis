The big difference between the text and the presentation is, that the text points out the difficulties of traditional voting and the presentation points out the difficulties of computerized voting.

In the text, it is said, that computerized voting is far more efficient and trustworthy than traditional voting. In the presentation, they pointed out some problems of computerized voting. One of their strongest argument was, that the computer system which allows people to vote is made by humans, and humans make faults. Every system gets improved after every use, but since the elections are biannual, it will take a really long time to improve the system. An other really strong argument was, that not everyone is used to computers. Especially old people don't know how to use a computer, so they can easily press a wrong button and vote for a candidate they don't want to vote for. Maybe they don't vote at all, because they don't know how. All people who can't afford a computer or who don't want to buy one have problems to vote too, because they have to find someone who likes to share his/her computer with them.

These two voices showed us the difficulties of voting in the US. Maybe both of them, traditional and computerized voting, should be allowed, so that every voter can chose the system he/she wants.
