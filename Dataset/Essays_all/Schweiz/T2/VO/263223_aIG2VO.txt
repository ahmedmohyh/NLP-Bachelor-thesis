People have to give more and more trust into computer systeme and sometimes use computer systemes without thinking about it. But why shouldn't be the traditional voting systeme be replaced by suck a systeme?

Opponents have a big mistrust towards the computer systeme. As they are made by humans,it's easily to program a mistake, which can lead to thousands of miscountings and high costs. On the other hand the propponents argue that governments and individuals trust other complex computer systemes by using vending machines, e-banking and other banking transactions. And of course such a systeme is only introduced after going through many tests and several re-programmations.

The propponents mention a second source of inaccurancny in the counting of votings accurs by reading through the long lists of candidates. People with poor eyesight have a big disadventage, as the names are close together and the mark for the chosen name can be easily made by the wrong name. The Proponents are still against the computer systeme, as some people are not used to computers and this would make the whole situation even worse.
