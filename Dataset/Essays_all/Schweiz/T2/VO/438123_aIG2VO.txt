The main message in the written text says, that computers are much better than humans. There will be rather less errors, when computer programmes are used. It also says, that human errors arent possible. 

While in the text the computer programmes are the best solutions, the audio file which was played has a very critical meaning against these computer programmes. There are also human errors possible in the programme, which has a much more negative effect on the election, than a human error does. 

There are both good arguments, which are against or for the computer solution. The audio file also critizises, that some people can`t afford computers or that some have a fear of technology. However, it is much less possible, that a fatal error of the computer programme happens, than there are many human errors of the counters.
