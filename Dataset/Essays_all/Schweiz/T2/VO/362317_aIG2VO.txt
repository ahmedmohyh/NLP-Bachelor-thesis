The computerized system of voting is much more easliy for people who are used to computers than the old voting system. But people who never work with computers could have many problems to vote for what they want. The new systems are likely to accuse a wrong voting because of errors in the computers. It isn't possible to recount the votings and many votings go lost. In this article, computerized systems of voting seem much better than the old voting systems. For example is poor eyesight a problem in the old voting system, but they forgot that there also exist people who aren't used to computers, so they could vote much easier the wrong thing than people with poor eyesight. It is true that it could cause some mistakes in the result if people have to count the votings by themselfes, but for the new system, people are reponsible for the results as well just because computers are made by people. There is a high difference between using computerized technology daily and using it only two times per year. If this system is used several times, it's not a big problem if it doesn't work one time, but if you use it not oftens, you have to count on it.
