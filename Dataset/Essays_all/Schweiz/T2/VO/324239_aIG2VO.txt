The woman of the lecuture critised the computerized voting system which was presented in the in the text. She said that for people who are used to computers it's not a bad idea to introduce a computerized voting system in the US. But for people who are not used to comuters it's more difficult then the old system, because they can easily make mistakes if they've never used a computer. She explained that there are many people who don't even have a computer,  because it's too expensive. On the other hand the text showed, how much people nowadays trust computer technology and that a computerized voting system would have a lot of benefits.   
Another argument of the woman was that comuter systems can also have errors, especially because they are made by human-beings and human-beings are not perfect and they also make mistakes. Which means that computers can have mistakes too. The text confronted this system by showing that already now, government and individuals trust other complex computer technology every day and it works.
The last argument of the woman was that elections are just every second year in the US. Why should you change as much if it works and if it's not a daily problem.
