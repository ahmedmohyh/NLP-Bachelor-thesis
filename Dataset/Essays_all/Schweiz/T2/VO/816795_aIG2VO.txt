The article as well as the lecture we (I) just heard talked about the voting system in America, and the pros and cons of the traditional method as well as the pros and cons of having a computerized system.
While the article focuses more on the cons of having the traditional system, the lecture expresses concerns about having or better said possible problems which may arise when introducing a technical voting system.

Though both (the professor and the article writer) mention that the traditional system has flaws, namely that because humans count the votes there are mistakes being made. Which we can understand since there are enormous numbers of ballots which have to be counted, and as time passes people tend to be less focused, so are more likely to make mistakes. 
But as for the professor, she goes on that since normal people are going to create the programs there is going to be the same amount of mistakes made.
And she goes on expressing her concerns that these mistakes probably are going to be even worse since first of all it would be a program for the whole Nation and secondary there are no physical copies of the votes/ballets. Also she thinks that the problem with this system would be that not everyone has an acess to a computer and not everyone knows how to use a computer.
On the contrary the article writer doesn't seem to see the problem with a standarized progeam for the whole nation since he's just seeing the benefit of it. 
He states that the problem with the traditional voting system is that people with poor eye sight for example can really easily mistake one candidate for another.
