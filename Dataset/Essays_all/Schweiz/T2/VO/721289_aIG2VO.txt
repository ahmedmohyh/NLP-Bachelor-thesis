In the hearing part the lady explained the consequennces and the risks that come with a computerized voting system, while the text above is pleading for a new, computerized voting system

The main argument why a computerized voting based on technology is doubtful is that even if our modern lives depend heavily on technology, not everyone is familiar with it . In the text it sais that people with poor eyesight are especially endangered to tick the wrong candidate. But the risk is just as high when you have to cast a vote on a computer. For people that are not used to these technical devices it would be quite hard to vote like this.

Humans make mistakes and mistakes cost money and they cost time. Traditional votings rely on people counting the votes correctly; there are thousands of ballots to be counted and it is only human to make a mistake. But what if there is a problem in the computer system and the results are wrong in the end? What if the originally right results aren't there anymore and the whole votin process has to start again?
It would cause even higher consequences as in time and especially in money.
No computer system works perfectly in the beginning but with time it is improved so it workds without mistakes and we can depend on them. The problem with a computerized counting system is that it is only used once or twice a year so there aren't many chances to improve this system when it is used.
