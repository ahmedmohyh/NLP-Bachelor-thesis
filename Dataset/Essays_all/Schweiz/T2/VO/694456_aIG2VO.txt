Both, text and lecture focus on the question whether or whether not, a new computer based voting system should be introduced in America. The text argues that the old fashion way of  voting has many possible ways to lead to faulty results. For example could people accidentally tick the wrong name on the list (because the list is so long and the boxes so small) or that the ones who have to count the votes make mistakes. Even though the person who holds the lecture can relate to those arguments, he/she thinks that a new, computer based system could have much more of a negative impact on the results. While a person who counts may miss a few votes, an error in a counting program could lead to major difference of thousands of votes. He/She also mentions that people who can not effort a computer or the ones that just simlpy do not know how to use them, will not vote or could vote accidentally for the wrong candidat. And for those who argue with the statement that the government and the people trust other complex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate, the lecturer highlights the "every day". Those programs were not perfect from the beginning, but rather were improved by every day usage. A voting program would just be used once every four years. One single mistake could have an impact on the whole world for the upcoming four years.
