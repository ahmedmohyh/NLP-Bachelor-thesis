The traditional voting system of the United States with ballots is often criticized. But is it really a better idea to let computers do all the work? 
Since computers are only programs made by mankind, they shouldn't be trusted too much. Computers have made errors in the past and you can never be a 100% sure that it won't happen again. Mistakes can happen to a computer program as well and they can't be discovered until the results are recounted. 
But there are as well voices that claim that computerized voting could improve the voting system. On a list with hundreds of politicians it certainly happens very fast that someone puts his mark at the wrong place or that people counting votes don't pay attention and count the wrong politician. For these risks it would be so much easier to just let people push a simple button and then let the computer do all the work. Moreover, in that way you wouldn't have to let anyone do the hard work of counting votes for a whole day.
Another argument against the computer voting is that many people, most of all elder, are  not at all used to computers. For them, computer voting is far more complicated and they might get discouraged to vote at all.
