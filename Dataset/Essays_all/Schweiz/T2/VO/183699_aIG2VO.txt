Basically, there is one side which is for the new computer based voting system and an other side which are against the using of computers for voting. In the text I just heard, they say that there are actually some problems with the traditional voting system. Nevertheless, it will get better with a computer voting system. As an example, there are many people who do not have enough money to buy a computer, thus they can not vote. Furthermore, many, especially people of the older generation, do not know how to handle a technical device such as a computer and they won't be able to vote properly. And computers can make faults too. They are programmed by humans and voting programs won't be used that often like for example programs which are working on a daily basis (for example banking programs). As a result there could be thousands of miscounts and a recount would almost be impossible.
In the text above there are much more things which would be better with computer based voting systems. With computers it is just easier to vote correctly and faster. People with poor eysesight for example won't mark the wrong name anymore if there are many candidates to vote for. Another big problem is that the officials must often count up the votes one by one which needs much effort and alot of time. Thus, it is almost inevitable that they will make some mistakes. Computersized systems, on the other hand side, will remove the possibility of human failure and the whole process will move on much faster. Although it could be really risky to implement compolicated voting technology nationwide.
In conclusion, there will be almost as much dangers while using computerized voting systems as there are while using the traditional voting system. Computers are just faster and more accurate than humans but if they fail they can not help themseleves.
