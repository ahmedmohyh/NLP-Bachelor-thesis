The text supportet the change from the current voting system where the votes are counted by humans to a voting system based on computers. They say that that computers don't make faults like humans and wont need a constly recout if a fault is detected. On the O otherside the presentation said that computers can have bugsand these can produce even more significant faults, they also think that because these programs are made by humas there are a lot of bug in it and because you just have elections nearly all two years it is not possible to find these bugs befor you start the voting. In the text they think that the computers will help people who can't see that well anymore because it is based on a easy-to-use touch-screen technology. The presentation is on the ontherhand afraid that people who don't have a computer do not unserstand how to click on a glasspanel to select their candidate.
