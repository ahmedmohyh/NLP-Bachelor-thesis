The first argument of the proposers for a computerized voting system is that it is not uncommon that voters "accidentally" vote for a wrong candidate in the traditional voting, especially those who are maybe a little bit older and have bad eyes cannot really see where they put their cross. But the opposers see a different problem when it comes to the population: Some people just cannot afford a computer or something like that and are not used to this technology, so they will have far more problems with computerized voting systems as with little letters.
To continue, the proposers say that the people who count the votes are likely to make mistakes, but the opposers state that the technology is made by humans as well which will lead to far bigger man made problems than the few votes who have not been counted correctly. 
As a third argument, the proposers mention that many modern systems are based on technology, and that no one would worry about that so we should just use technology for votings as well, but the opposers doubt that this is a valid comparison: They say that those technologies are used on a daily basis while voting systems are used a few times a year of not even less so problems which could appear cannot be solved because the technology cannot get improved.
