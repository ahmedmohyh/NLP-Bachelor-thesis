The audio speaker doubt that computerized voting machings are more efficient than the current voting systems in the United States.
In the text it is written that a computerized machine would be better than the current voting system, for example because there would be less mistakes. It seems that sometimes people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because they have poor eyesight and can't read exactly the different names of the candidates. In contradition the audio speaker bring the opposite argument, that lot of people aren't used to computers or can't afford a computer. These people will have troubles to vote, maybe they won't vote anymore. Computerized votes machines may leads to less votes.
In addition the text concern a major problem with the old voting systems. It is a heavy and big work for the people who have to count the votes. Just one mistake, and they have to recount all of the votes.
The audio speaker told us a further argument. Computer programs are made by humans and humans make errors. If there is a mistake in a voting program thousands votes were miscounted or even removed.
Also, we should remember that computerized machines are daily used in bankings for example. There it works. But elections or votings are more seldom, and people aren't used to work with it proper.
Therefore, there are good pro arguments, but also good contra arguments.
