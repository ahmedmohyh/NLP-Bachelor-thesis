The presentation is about errors in the voting systems of the United States.
Many people say that human make mistakes, when they count the votings and that computer programms doesn't make such counting mistakes. But there are people who don't like to work with computers or who don't know how it works. These people could accidentally vote for the wrong person without recognising it. The programms are made by humans, who can make mistakes and those mistakes are more significant then some counting mistakes, because the programm would repeat the mistake several times. One other reason for the error potential is that the voting programms aren't used as often as programms of a Bank are.
In the text is said that a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, because there are many names on the same page, so that people with poor eyesight can't see, which name they have chosen. With a easy-to-use-touch-screen technology would it be much easyer more efficient. It also says that human errors would be removed with a computerized voting systems.
Those two sources say more or less the opposit of each other. The presentation doesn't like the computerized system and the text is very positive towards it. But both are saying that the voting system of the United States doesn't really work good enough.
