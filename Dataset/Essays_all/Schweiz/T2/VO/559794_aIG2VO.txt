The presentation was about the idea to change the current voting system which is used in the United States with a new voting system which use computers. The new voting system maybe is easy for people who often use a computer but there are people who don't know how to use a computer or they don't have one because their to poor to buy one or don't need one. 
In the essay it is written that the current voting system is inefficient and that it should be replaced by a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system. Because the current system use a large sheet with many names and so errors happen fast. But it is told in the presentation that this new system is a programm made by humans and there also could be errors. And if there are errors with this system this were a serious problem. Then with the current system there maybe only a few errors made by peolpe with poor eyesight becaus they can easily mark the wrong name. But if there's a system error in the computerprogramm there are maybe hundrets of errors or maybe votings get lost. So that the voting is influenced by this.
