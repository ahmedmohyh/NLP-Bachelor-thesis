In the presentation the ladie highlits that computerized voting is not very good. There are three major problems. One problem is the fact, that people who are not having computerskills will have big porblems with computerized voting and perhaps they are going to vote for the wrong candidate. An other problem are the errors which are possibly in the software of the computerprogram which counts the votes. This software is produced by humans and it will always have an low percentage to have an error. And the third problem is relied to the second. It says, when a software contains an error will not be recognized fast because it is only used once in a year. 
But against the presentation the text says that the traditional voting is not as good as thought because it is easily to make the cross next to the fals candidate. And the votes are counted by other people which encreases the chance of an error once more. But to vote on the computer programm is much more easy because you only have to touch the candidates name to vote for it an it causes less errors. 
So the text says computerized voting is much reliable versus the poresentations which says that computerized voting easily causes errors which means it is not very reliable.
