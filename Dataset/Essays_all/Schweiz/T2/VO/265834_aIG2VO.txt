Traditional voting might be easier for the majority of voters, because computerized systems can only be used by people who know how to use them. The presentation said that not all people are used to use computers and there are some people who don't even use a computer nor the ability to afford buying one. The fear of technology shouldn't be ignored by the creation of such a system. The text tells us how human errors occur while counting the votes. Computers would prevent these mistakes. But computer programs are created by humans so it's still possible that a program might have some errors in it. If so, that could lead to far bigger mistakes and problems because a programming mistake would affect thousands of votes at once. The use of banking transactions as well as the communication of highly sensitive information happens on a daily basis. The programs used for these sensitive things weren't reliable from the first day on. They had to be developped and improved over and over again. That's why we're now able to use them daily. Nation wide votings only happen once every two years. The huge work that one would have to put into these computer programs just isn't worth the effort and money considering the mentioned risks.
