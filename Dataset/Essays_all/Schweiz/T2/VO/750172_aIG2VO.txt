The text says that a new voting system in form of a high-technical one would bring many advantages. In a first step, it states that voting with computers would become much easier, because the problem that people cross the wrong candidate on the very large sheet of paper would be solved. The lecturer disagrees and says voting would become more complicated and many people would be discouraged of voting. The reason behind this would be that many people are not used to computers and are scared of technology, so they would barely use the new voting system. Furthermore, many can not afford a computer, so they would not be able to vote at all.

The next argument the text comes up with is the one about errors: Computer systems are less likely to make mistakes than humans, because humans count everything by hand which is not very exact. The lecturer opposes that argument by questioning if computers really count better. It was said that errors done by computers are far more serious than those done by humans, because computers may miscount thousands of votes, as humans may just forget one vote. In addition, a recount with computers is impossible. An argument stated by the text concerning this problem is that recounting by humans would take an extreme amount of time and money. 

In addition, the text says that technology is used every day in very important processes, so it would also work for the voting system. The lecturer means that it takes a very long time get a system to a level on which it is reliable and usable. So, the computer system would contain many faults in the beginning, and only after a long time, it would be ready to be used for such an important process as the voting, and all that effort would not be necessary says the lecturer, because voting takes only place twice a year.
