People say, that the current voting system used in the United States is extremely inefficient and often lead to inaccurate results. Some  believe, the whole system could be made more accurate, if it was replaced by a computer basedvoting system.
Sometimes, people often vote for the wrong candidate, because they have poor eyesight and so can't find their favourite candidate. With a computer based voting system, voters could enlarge the names on the ballot to help them find their candidate. The problem is, that there aremany people who aren't really used to computers. There are may reasons for it. Maybe they are too poor, to buy themselve a computer, or they don't work with them every day. So the risks are, that exact those persons will have problems by voting on a computer, because they just aren't used to those machines. The computer based voting system works only for generations, which grew up with computers and are used to work with them.
Computers could also remove the risk of miscounting the votes, which is a current problem of human error in the current system. Here we have to say, that computer systems are alsoonly programmed by humans. So human errors could hide inside the program and the effect could be fatal. Votes could be completely removed and lost or miscounted. Here we have the problem, that unlike in the current voting system, we would have no physical prove of those failures.
Furthermore, there are people saying, that we already use computers in our governmental systems like banking transactions and communication of highly sensitive information and they work too. But those are systems which are used in our daily life. The voting system is only used once or twice a year. So we would have almost no chance in improving the system like we could do it with systems, which we use every day, because they aren't used that much.
