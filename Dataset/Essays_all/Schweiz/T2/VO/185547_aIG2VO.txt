The voting system of the US in the controversial opposition. A lot of protests this year  have shown the belief of inaccuracy of the voting system rises. People are constantly begging for a recount. But is there a way to improve the efficienty and accuracy of the critisized voting system? The traditional voting requires the voters to make a small mark next to the name on the large sheet of paper containting all candidates. Oftentimes people with poor eyecondition mark the wrong name. A possible improvement to this problem is the introduction of a computerized voting machines where a zoom in is possible and a missvote impossible. The voting technology would reduce the misscount of the officials that have to ho thorugh every ballot and record the vote. The technology brings other major concerns to the voting system. As is requires digital devices like a computer is has reduced the amount of people to vote as not all people are able to afford a computer or other that are not used to using a computer and are therefore scared. Furthermore it's important to declare that the intention of the computers is to reduce failure, which is not always the case when you think that computers are the construct of the human. So if there is a programmed mistage is causes far more damages where thousant of votes are misscounted and impossible to recount.
