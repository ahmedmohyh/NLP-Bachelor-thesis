Computer Voting 
To vote at the computer is not only much faster furthermore it means also less work. Nobody has to count the votes by themself. So it's very simple; the computer will just count all votes and at the end you have a solution,in this case a winner. But we have to have in our mind, that not everyone uses a computer. There are also much people who maybe doesn't understand the computer, especially older people who aren't used to use the computer or internet.For us as a student or for also for most of the workers it's very easy to use a computer We learn this in school or from our parents. But our grandparents never had do work with a computer like we have is today. So for them this is a maybe a real struggle to use a computer.
Another problem may be, that the computer won't work. So what would we do when the computer just would go off or if the webside wouldn't load because there are so many person who are on this side at the same moment?
