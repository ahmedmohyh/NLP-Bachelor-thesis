There are arguments for persons who tempt to the use of computerized systems and others who are sure the traditional voting systems are better. Both sides have arguments that are talking about the errors of the opposite system.
For instance a vote against the traditional system would be that people accidentally vote for wrong persons. Wether that exists because of the messy format of ballots or because of poor eyesight, peoples giving this argument think that with electric and computorized voting systems these problems could be solved by a touch screen which could be easily modified. On the other handside we have the people beeing pro traditional systems, that say that there could exist the same problem (voting for the wrong persons) even with a computorized system. They are pointing on persons who don't use computers an all these devices in daily life. These people could also easily make mistakes when using computrized voting plattforms and websites.
The other important argument against the tarditional voting system is the fact that people count the votes. Errors and false counts are likely to happen and often don't get found by the officials. An computorized system could remove these human errors. Against that argument and for the traditional systems stands the fact that even computers are only a product of humans and because of that could have an error in themselfs. Such errors could not just affect some votes but thousands of votes made by people.
To which side we tempt, these systems need to be improved.
