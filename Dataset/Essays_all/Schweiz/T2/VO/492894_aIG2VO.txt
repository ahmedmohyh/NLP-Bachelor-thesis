They talked manly about the mistakes humans make and when the programm had a mistake the hole vote was for nothing. They don't look at the fact that it is hard to read out the right namse a the ballot and that it is alot of work to go throught this ballots. I just wonder why no one talks about the fact that everything on the computer can be hacked, so everything is more dangerous and the vote can get an different result, so it also would be easier to be a dictator or bring new laws up knowbody wants. Of course you can do this also different ways, if just count false or to other mistakes, but when it is on the computer everyone can hack it in there(of course when they have the ability to do it), thats means every country could deside how the result is, if it is count by paper just the people in the counrty can bring up a false result. So if other people have the interesset what the result is, they can fake it. Of course it's hard to get in there, but nothing is inpossible to be hacked, you also could hack you in, that you can read trump's mails.
