The question is wether its better (lol) to use an electronic or a physical voting system. While in murica they use a prehistoric physica l voting system we in urOp use a faaaar more complex and highly developed voting system called the legend ary BRIEFWAHL. Yes the BRIEFWAHL is absolutely the most innovative and extraterrestral v    oting system e       ven the spaghettimonsters use it to choose wether they want carbonara or tuna sauce today. In order to vote fo      r your favourite type of spaghetti or initiative you may pick up the magical voting card with as      much honor a         s ur fatty ass can bring upon its disgusting borders, write yes or no, sign the shit aaand you put it with y        our voting card into the fucking awsome supermagical envelope. Once closed with the blood of seven virgins,                 a little man -he insist on being called ueli blocher- takes that envelope and brings it to helvet        ia herself where she chooses if it would become you better to being manufactured into rösti or if yo          u're drown in melted cheese. - Absolutely Pathetic! But now to the topic, there are few positiv arguments          for the prehistoric voting system that is used. You may read them on the upper part of the page or you li             sten to the fucking stupid muricané woman that should shoot herself after talking such a load of bu             llshit.
