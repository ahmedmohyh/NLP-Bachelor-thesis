Are current voting systems in the United States inefficent? 
Critics think that computerized voting is the solution to accidental wrong voting cause by poor eyesight and the miscount of votes by Officials. They are sure, that using computers leads to easier viewing of the canditates names and also removes the possibility of human errors in counting votes. However not everyone agrees to this. The opponents of computerized voting are convinced, that not being used to computers or not being able to afford them can lead to less voting. In addition, they say, that human errors can also lead to a malfuncional computer programm, which would cause not one but thousands of votes to be miscounted. In that case a recount is not possible. Although critics of the current system seem to be sure, that the computer can be trusted in votings as much as in banking, the opponents are certain that due to voting not taking place often, the computer programm would not be effective at first and would have to be renewed until it works without any mistakes.
