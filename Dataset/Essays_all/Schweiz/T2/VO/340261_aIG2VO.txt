The woman started her presentation mentioning that, although computers may be more efficient for votings, they would still not fix the problem completely as computers are expensive,and not everyone has the funds to afford them. In addition, people who are not used to using computers may find it difficult to operate such a device and probably would prefer a physical votig system.

Contrary to the written part, off which we can easily assume that computers would perform better during vote countings, the woman in the presentation doubts that computers would fare any better, as computers are produced by humans and thus any mistake in the computer's code could result in thousands of false countings. 

Additionally,computers would not store the data, which means that a recount would not be possible,which, according to the woman in the presentation, is another disadvantage. She also added that the only reason why computers work so well at daily-life tasks is that they are used regularly, whereas votings would not occur as regularly, maybe once or twice per year, which would make computers prone to facing errors.
