The argument of the presentation "Computers can make mistakes because they are programmed by humans and can produce far more damage than the mistakes of humans" disagrees with the point of the text in which computers remove the possibility of human error. 

Furthermore, in the presentation it is mentioned that people who are not used to computers can easily be confused by it, but the text says that computers work with an easy-to-use touch-screen technology.

In the presentation, it is talked about the high security of bank transactions as well as communication with the help of computer programs. They are used daily in opposition to the insecure and rarely used voting technology. In the text it is mentioned, that if people think that voting via computer could be risky, they should first think about the risk of bank transitions and the communication of highly sensitive information.
