Nowadays, there is a big discussion if we should introduce computerized voting systems.
The biggest argument which speaks for the new system, is that humans make many mistakes when they are counting the ballots. But computer systems are also developed by human beings, so they probably make mistakes in programming. So, you can't be sure that computers work more exactly than humans.
An other argument against computerized voting systems is, that not everybody is used to work with computers. Some citizans might even not have a computer at home! However, you can get used to everything, also to computerized voting systems. If you have to vote two times a year, you are ready to trust in this systems.
The author of the text is clearly in favour of the new systems. He says that many people trust in computers, because they do banking transitions and so, they deal often with sensitive information at computers.
He underlines also the point, that the voting ballots are really difficult to vote right and count them, because they're small written.
