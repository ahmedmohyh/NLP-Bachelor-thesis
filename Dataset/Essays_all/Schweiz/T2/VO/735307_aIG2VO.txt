They say that not everyone is accustomed to computers, so computerised voting is not a good solution for those people. Even if that were not the case errors in comuter programs may have much more devastating effects than errors made bay humans. That is not completely true: Even if an error causes some data to be lost, the vote can be repeated. It is also unlikely that an error in the program is not corrected as soon as it is found and that the program is not checked and and tested mutiple times befor it is used for the first time or when errors accure. It is also much easier to repeat a vote with computers than by hand. As to the point that not everyone an afford a computer: There are many simple ways of getting acces to a computer: ask your neighbour or a relative if you can use theirs. Not beingused to computers is also no excuse: There is allways someone who is willing to explain how tings work, no matter what it is
