The lecturer does not agree with the author of the text. She thinks that the voting would not be better, safer and more flaweless, when voting computerbased. 
She mentiones that one has to think about people that do not have the money to buy a computer or cannot handle one. So the voting participation would decrease. While the author of the text thinks that with e-voting it would be possible to avoid human failures such as counting mistakes or ticking the wrong candidate because of a poor eyesight, the lecturer sees a danger in trusting computers too much. 
This is based on her thought about people programming the voting-software and doing mistakes during this process. The text shows us, that we trust computers while using e-banking and suggests to trust them too while using an e-voting software. The lecturer has a good point there: 
It is normal to use e-banking and as we started to work with it, it was not flawless. But by using e-banking every day, the programmers were able to fix the problems and so nowadays it works safe. The problem with e-voting is, that we only use it every second year and so we cannot find mistakes that fast and easy. Followed by that, this software cannot be as safe as e-banking is. 
In addition there is no physical record of the vote and so no mistake can be proved.
