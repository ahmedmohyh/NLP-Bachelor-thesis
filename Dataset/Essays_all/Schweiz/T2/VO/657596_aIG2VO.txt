The listening explains how the traditional voting system may be better than the computerized system suggested by the text. 
One of the problems is, that with a computerized system you must also assume that everyone (including people from all ages and from every social class) knows how to handle a computer. People who are poor and can't afford a computer are not accustomed to technology as well as someone who can afford one and uses one every day. These people may be thrown off by technology and may not want to vote at all due to their inexperience with technology. The text implies that everyone knows how to handle technology, but that isn't the case.
It is important to note, when talking about human error, that computers are also made by humans. Humans made these programms, so human error is possible in any technology. Even though with the traditional system there is the chance of an error in the vote counting, this can't entail more than a few wrong votes, which in the big scheme doesn't do much. If there is an error in a computer the damage is far more devastating. If the whole voting process is computerized and there is a failure in the system, than all of the votes could be lost or wrong, making it impossible to recount succesfully. 
Even though it is true that we use technology every day in processes such as banking transactions, but it is important to note, that these systems are used every day and have improved through the years. With voting there is the problem, that it is only done every two years and in some regions maybe twice a year, making it more difficult to improve the system in a short time.
