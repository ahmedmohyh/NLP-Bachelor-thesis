In the United States there's a traditional voting system where people have to count every single vote. Critics say that a computerized system would be so much better. The main topic in the text is that people when they vote or count the votes can make faults. So critics say that they need computerized voting machines. 
But there aren't only problems with the traditional voting system. Today there are a lot of people which know how to use computers but there are also some people which don't know how to work with them. Because of that it's easily possible that this people make some mistakes because they don't know what to do. Of couse when there's a long list and you have to cross the right person some persons can't find the right name they want to vote for. This problem could happen with the using of computers. 
Another topic is that humans have to count all the votes by themselves. Isn't it difficult  for them to catch all the correct votes? With this system one fault can happen so fast and easily. The person in the listening said that also computer can make mistakes. For example when a computer have a virus or an error it's so hard to find the problem or to fix it quickly. According to that 1000 votes or more can be away beacause of this error. When a person makes one mistake its just about one vote and not about 1000 or more. 
A computer isn't perfect like a person. Now it's the question whether we can trust this technical things completely to use it for a voting system or if we should stay with the traditional voting system.
