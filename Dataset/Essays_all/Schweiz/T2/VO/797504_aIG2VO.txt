In the lecture we heard, that human error can't be removed by using a computerized voting system, becaus this system is also a human invention. For example the computer systeme could fail and lose all the material. This would be miserable because most of the votings aren't secired by audio systems. An other point was, that people with poor eyesight are maybe know possible to vote without accedentially faults, but know there is a knew group of people being unable to vote. Those who are afraid or incapable of using a computer will not vote anymore because of their fear of making mistakes or not being able to use a computer. 
But never the less, a computerized system wouldn't be that bad. Expensive and long recounts would not happen anymore and we all know, that knowadays computersystems are highly evaluated and secure. We use them in our daily live, without the fear of mistakes. Our modern society is based on technique and we already trust them, for example our e-banking systems.
