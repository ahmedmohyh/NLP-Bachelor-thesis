To summerize the informations I've just heard in the essay, I would say that the person speaking is completely against the modern voting systems, whereas in the text it is the complete opposite.

The writer only says bad things about the traditional voting systems because of two major reasons: For many people with bad eyesight it is hard to find their candidate on the big sheet and therefore there often are wrong votings, because they didn't see it well. The second reason is that in the traditional voting system the relyance on humans is too big. He even calls this system as inefficient. These negative arguments are actually used as positive arguments in the essay.

The speaker critizises that the computer voting is only good for people who are used to using computers and not for those who don't even own a computer themselves. It was also said that there is a bigger chance of big amouts of miscounted votes because of errors. The computers are programmed by humans and they often, without them knowing, build in errors. The consequences of an error in the modern system, where there would be thousands of miscounted votes, are way bigger than the ones in the traditional system, where there would only be a few miscounted votes.

In conclusion I would say that the writer and the speaker have two truely opposite opinions according the voting system back then and nowadays. The Writer is against the tradional voting system, whereas the speaker is against the modern voting system.
