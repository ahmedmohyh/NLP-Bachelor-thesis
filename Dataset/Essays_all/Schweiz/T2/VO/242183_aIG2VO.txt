This essay is about the voting system and the advanteges of computerised voting. 
The errors in the process of voting happen normally when people count. So would be technology more reliable at counting. The voting systems in the USA are apparently ineffecient and have a lot of miscounts. The mistakes happen most of the time while someone writes the wrong candidate on their sheet. So these errors will continue to happen even with computerised voting, because many people do not know how to use a computer correctly especially old people. The text say's the recounting by humans is long and expensive, on the other side if computers had to recount it would be a lot easier. But are the programms of the computers trustworthy, beacause they are programmed by humans as well. If the mistake is in the programm it is even worse than just a miscount by hand. The computerised voting isn't worth it because it only takes place once or twice a year and to develop a programm only to vote would be a huge amount of money and work. The text in contrast thinks that the computers can be trusted because in our daily life we accomplish even more complicated work on these devices.
