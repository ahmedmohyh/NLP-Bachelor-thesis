The Advantage against the old

In the presentation the women said that computerized voting is not that reliable as many people think. Old people or especially the ones who can't cope with computers or people who can't afford them have a big disadvantage, she said. Additionally she spoke about human or computer caused failures. It's true, nobody's perfect, everybody makes mistakes, an so do people who vote or are counting the votes. She considered that computers are made from humans as well and this means, that they could have hidden errors too. 

It is true, there's no "perfect" system. But the possibility that there are so called "fatal errors" is very low. And the same for people who can't afford a computer or can't cope with them. The amount of this people is very low. Today, neraly everybody has a smart phone or a mobile device. It's logical, that at a certain point of time, the system needs to get adapted to the 21th century.
