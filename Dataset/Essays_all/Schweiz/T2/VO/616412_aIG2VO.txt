The new way of voting is surely a good idea, but only for the people who are used to the new technology. Old people who somethimes neither have a computer in their home don't understand what to do or they have fear of the technology. For these people it's very diffucult to vote. The old system with paper is a better way for them. It's clear that computers have a bigger write and people with poor eyesight can't mark the wrong name but for old people it is a big challange. 
The fact, that computers better count the votes isn't that good. It's clear that the computers are made by people. So if they made an error during the installation of the voting system the whole election will be wrong. Also isn't the system so safe, because the votes may can be removed or misscounted. And if they are deleted on the system they can't come back again. 
And an election isn't a daily thing. It is once in two years. The computer system has to improve from the last election to the other. Computers improved a lot over the last years, but they aren't perfect and so they have to be improved everytime.
