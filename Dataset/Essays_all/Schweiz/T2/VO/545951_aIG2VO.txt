The women who was trying to show us her side of the discussion clearly considered the points given in the text. At the begining she admits that the traditional voting system has its flaws an that errors might or rather will occur. But she also tells us that computers might not be better. It might be easier to use for people who are experienced with computers but not for people who dont use computers on a daily basis. Some might be to poor to buy themselves a computer. They could be "frightened" or a bit scared to vote since they dont have experience with computers. She tells us that these people maybe even dont vote at all because they'er insecure. This may be the case for older people. Another important point that she makes is that computers are programmed by humans and that humans make mistakes, so if someone misses one count in the traditional voting system it isn't that effectful like if someone makes a programming mistake and you lose thousands of votes. In the text they say that people trust other complex computer technology like banking transactions as well as "communication of highly sensitive information". She replies to this with a rather unimpressed statement. She says that things such as banking transactions weren't perfect in the begining either but that they are used on a daily basis.  They are heavily used and improved from day to day. Votings on the other hand are held once every two years or twice every two years, it depends on the area. The women clearly is against computerized voting and tries to show us that the arguments made in the text aren't true or only partly correct.
