The text mentions that manual voting is inaccurate, because the votes are counted by humans. However, in the presentation it is mentioned that one official might make a few errors, but if a programmer makes an error, this might easily miscount by thousands or more. This is also compounded by the missing backups, so an error in the machine might make many votes just disappear without a trace.
The second point made in the text is that voters, especially ones with bad eyesight, can easily mark the wrong name.  The presentation commented on this as well, saying that computerized voting systems will only shift this problem to people not familiar with computers, maybe ones that cannot afford one or have a fear of technology. These people might either vote for the wrong person or even not vote at all due to the aforementioned fear of technology.
Finally, the text mentions that we also trust computers with banking and other sensitive information. However, the presenter refutes this by saying that we use banking services daily and heavily, so the initially flawed systems have had time to be improved upon, while voting happens only a few times a year, and therefore it will take a long time until it is as reliable as current banking systems.
