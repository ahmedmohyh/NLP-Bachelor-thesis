The computerized voting seems easy,like in the text is mentioned it's automatically and quickly, but like the man in the presentation said people who don't use the computer every day can't afford and will have trouble with the election. They will mark the wrong name and vote for the wrong person. And if there is an error with the computer like a miscount or a remove, a recount is impossible. 
In the text is said, that if there is an error a long recount has to take place, but you see the difference, in the traditional voting system it's possible to do a recount but if the computer lost the information it's done.

You have to think, every human make mistakes and the people design the computer program, so the computer program will also have tis mistakes. You have to invest time, design the system to do a really good system.

In the text is mentioned that we trust banking transactions and communication of highly sensitive information everyday, so why shouldn't we trust the computerized voting system? The critics from the presentation is that when you first invent a programm you have to improve on, improve on until you have a good system. You need to get confidence from the people to use it. And here's the difference,we use the banking transaction and things everyday while we just vote like all 2 years. So it's difficult to get confidence from the voters.
