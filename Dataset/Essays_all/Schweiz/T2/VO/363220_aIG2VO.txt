In the text it is  given, that coputerized voting helps people with eye problems. But there are much more people, how can not work with a computer or an Ipad. So they make a lot of mistakes with computerized voting. They fear technology and and are not using to it.
A second point is, that there is a big effort to count all the votes and people make mistakes  while counting them. But computerized voting is based on programms and scripts. If they have an error, thousands of people are betrayed and you can not just recount the votes, because they are in the programm. A paper vote can be recountet. Not just one time, you can recount them how long as you want. 
And other ponit is, that these voting programms have to be tested and improved. But this needs a lot of time and creates a giant effort. And another difficult is, that you do not elect or vote every day. We do not have the experencies and also the possibilities to build up such a system. Our banking system works today, but it was a long way up. In the past there were a lot of errors, atacks and downs in the banking system. If we want also a accurate voting programm, we need also this time to develop the system. But we do not have this time, because a vote have to be clear. We do not have the option to wait the next ten years, just for developping a perfect programm.
