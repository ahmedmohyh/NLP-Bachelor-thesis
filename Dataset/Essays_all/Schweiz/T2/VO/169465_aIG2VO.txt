Many people are discussing about the idea of making the elections and votings of the United States by computer. They use the argument, that they are inefficient. They criticise the possibility, that people with bad eyes could vote for the wrong person because there is such a long list with names. The opportunity side says, that there could be the same error by the computers. If person who are not used to use computers should vote by computer they would fail. As they do not understand how to use them and be unsure how to vote. So many people do not vote or even vote wrong because of their fear of technologie. The other side now arguments, that there are to many errors by the election, made by the people who count. They have the opinion, that people make mistakes by counting and the computers would do better. The other side use the same argument. Computers or programs are made by humans so there rare probably made mistakes as well. And the computerptograms for the voting system of the United States are not used very often as a contrast to our banking or message programs, which are used daily.
