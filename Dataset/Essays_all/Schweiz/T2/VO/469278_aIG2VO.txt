In the textpassage it was introduced that critics of the old traditional voting system would like to replace it with a new computerized voting system. They think the old voting system is not to be trusted because errors can accure easily, for example someone could accidentily vote for the wrong person. An other worry of them is the way the votes are counted, they need to be counted by humans and there it can happen that votes will be misscounted.They are conviced a new system would be more efficient and also more trustworthy. They argue that we already use computerized systems like this one in our everydaylife like in banking transactions and we trust them with barely and doubt. 
The opposting position to this newly introduced sytem claims that an computerized voting system might seeme easy to citizens already used to dealing with computers but it will be a pain in the back for those who are not. They will have trouble understanding the process of voting and might do it the wrong way. They are maybe even that afraid of voting that they will collectivly vote and this way not really care anymore. Also some people can not afford a computer which makes them unacessable to voting. An other argument would be that computerprograms are made by humans where we have a chance of having human mistakes too. These mistakes in because they are on the computer would be extremly fatale and much worse than some forgotten votes. There could be thousands of votes being lost and there would not even be any phisical record left behinde. Concerning the systems we use today they argue that those systems had been improved over years and can be tested and made better everyday. Voting only happens all two years nationally and also not so often localy which gives us very few posibilities to test the system and improve them.
