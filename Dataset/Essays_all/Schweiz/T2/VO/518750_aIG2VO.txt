Every four years, the election of a new president takes place in the United States. As many people live in the United States, there is a need for the election to be as simple, as fast and as secure as possible. Nowadays, so called ballots - sheets with a list of the people who could be voted for - are used. People have to mark the person they want to vote for with a little cross beside the name. For people with poor eyesight something quite difficult. Critics also say that the evaluation of the ballots is problematic, because it is done by humans. With the current system, critics say, there are to many possibilities to make mistakes.
But suggestion of a new system, where computers are used to count and evaluate the votes, is also controversial. Some of the advantages might be that computers are incredible quick and easy, but there are some negative arguments too. First, not everybody is used to a computer or even has one at home. Here could, as with the ballots, happen faults easily. Another argument against a new voting system would be, that if there was an error in this system, it would be way more complicated to solve the problem. Also, a computer programme is evolved by humans, and its most likely to have a fault in it.
That we use computer in our everyday life does not count for those who are against a new system. They argument, that, as we have seen in banking, the system had to be developed over and over again. Another important argument: we use banking in our everyday life, but presidential elections in the United States only take place once every four years.
