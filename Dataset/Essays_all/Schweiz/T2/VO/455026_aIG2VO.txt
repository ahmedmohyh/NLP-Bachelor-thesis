In this text we speak about the voting system in the United States. In the Text on the top there are many critics about the traditional voting mentioned. At the moment you have to find your candidate on a large sheet of paper and make a small mark next to his name. Here is already the first problem about the system. People with poor eyesight make mistakes and mark the wrong candidate. Another point is that so many people vote and you have to count all papers with the names and the ballot around it so it is sure that you are going to count wrong. So they say that it would be better if they change the traditional system to a computurized voting system. 
But there are other difficults about that which are mentoned in the presentation. It would be really difficult for people to use the computer system if they never use a computer and do not know how to handle it. It also is not sure if the computer really counts better. It is a tricky system and we are not going to use it very often only ever two years so maybe there are mistakes with it we cant find out . It also has to be sayed that its made of human.When human make mistakes in counting so it is pretty sure they do it also in making computer systems.
