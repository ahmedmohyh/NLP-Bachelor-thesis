Voting system the USA

The people against the computer based voting have the fear that people who are not familiar with technology will not like the change. Maybe the will not be able to use computers or older people will have no idea how it works. They may be discoured to vote even. But the people for computer based voting say, that older people or people with bad eye sight can not read the small writing on the ballot sheets and may mark the wrong name because there are so many, with computers it will be easy and there will be a zoom function. 
A other argument against it is that humans may make a couple of counting mistakes, but computers could delete thousands of votes or have wrong counting results and computers are programmed by humans as well. But one must know that a recount is very expensive and takes it's time and it's up to individual people, that carry the fault.
The last problem the traditional loving voters had is that banking transactions and highly sensitive communication that happen over computers, happen daily and are used heavily. Voting would only be used twice a year or once every two years. But the time between votings can be used to make the computer based voting better. 
The traditional ballot voters are scared that a lot could go wrong and people would be rather to change the results, but in the end nothing is ever save and one should take the risk, because a lot of computer based things work very good already.
