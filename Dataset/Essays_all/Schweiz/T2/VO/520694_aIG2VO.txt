In the text is written that human errors could be damaging specialy by close elections. Computer are quick and don't make mistakes. And there is also written that human with a poor eyesight easily could mark the wrong name by the traditional elections. So a lot of peope think that elections with computers would be better than the traditional way of voting. 

People with a poor eyesight could make the cross at the false place but people who don't use the computer often will have problems with an election on the coputer (for example old people). An other problem is that a voting systhem first have to be programmed. People make mistakes thats normal. But if they make a mistake in the programm of the computer for the election it will be fatal and more damagin than a human error by counting votingletters. And a other point is that there are not a lot of elections in the United States. So there are not many chances to educate a good voting systhem and learn from faults from the past.
