So people can just choose their favorites and it is done. The inconvenient in the traditional system is that people may mark the wrong name, beacuse of potential sight problems.

So that is why the traditional system is the far safer one. But the mistakes in the computer can be corrected easily, while the ones in the traditional systems.
