the problem that was discussed, is about the voting system in america. it`s inefficient and is often incorrect.
because people are counting the votes, it`s likely to happen that somebody makes a mistake. it`s especially not too good, if an election is closely contested.
also something that weirdly happens often, is people being stupid and voting for the wrong candidate. like, how the hell can that happen? like the people with poor eyesight marking the wrong candidate should go see an eye doctor and get some glasses. like how blind are you to not see a name on a paper right in front of you?
the other argument of mistakes happening because of the people counting is the same. like get some people who can count.
