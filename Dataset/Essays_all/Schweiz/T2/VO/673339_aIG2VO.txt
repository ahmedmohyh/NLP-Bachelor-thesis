The text and the presentation represent opposite opinions. It is a fact that people with bad eyesight could miss their favorite Candidate on the ballot, if they could vote electronically they could use an easy-to-use touch-screen technology to cast their vote. They just have to touch the name of the candidate to cast their vote. In the presentation the woman tells about people who don't use a computer on a daily basis or even are feared of technology. So if all teh voting systems would be changed from traditional ones to electronical ones it could happen taht these people will stop voting. 

A very important thing is the possibility of an official making a fault when counting the ballots. In the text it is told that these called human errors would be extinguished if the voting systems would change. But it is not that easily as mentioned in the presentation it could have mistakes in the programm to count the votes. This would cause to miscounting thousands of votes. Sure if an official makes a fault, a few ballots aren't right, but its much less then these proframming fualts could cause. 

Some people say it is too risky to implement complicated technology nationwide. But they use banking system, wich are pretty similar, every day to transfer their money. They trust them to be perfectly accurate. The opposition tells us that banking systems weren't reliable and accurate from the start. They were used every day and were improved until they reach the level on wich they are now. Nationwide votes are held every two years and state wides not more than twice a year, so how are they tested? It will also take a long time for them to be accurate and reliable.
