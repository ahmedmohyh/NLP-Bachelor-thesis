The Problems of the computerized voting are the following.
At the moment on this earth it has a lot of people especially old people that don't know how to use a computer. It's much easier for them to take a pen and mark the name they want. And if they have problems reading the names they simply have to buy glases or somethig like that to see better. For this people the risk of marking the wrong name is higher with the computer.
The people who supports thecomputerzied voting thinks, that humans makes more mistakes than computers. But the problem is, they forgot that the humans are the ones how programms the computers. So when a somebody makes a mistake programming a computer there will be a much more serious problem then the rare mistakes that makes humans counting the ballots. The programms could manipulate a whole election.
An other Problem is, that there only every two years votings and it would cost a lot of time to improve the computerized votings. It's not the same as banking transaction which are made every single day a lot of times.
