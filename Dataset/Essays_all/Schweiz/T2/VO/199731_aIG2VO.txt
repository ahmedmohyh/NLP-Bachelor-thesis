The text contains the opinion that a replacement of people who count the votes by a machine doing the same would be a great success due to the "human errors". These are the errors a person makes counting those vote one by one for a long time.
Another thing that according to the text is bad about the contemporary voting system is that the names on the voting ballots are written quite small and are hard to read for people with a bad eyesight. Because of this other errors can occur.
In gegeral the text says that the counting by humans is highly inefficient due to the inaccuracy of human counting.
In the audio the oppisite message was said: Humans should stay the ones who count the ballots.
This opinion is justified by claiming that many people are not used to computers, this can be because of the lack of money to buy one or even just the "fear of technology".
Another reason for this opinion was that a computer can - due to being programmed by humans - be wrong too, and those mistakes weigh even more than the ones a person makes.
The last thing that was said concerning this topic was that technology that has to do something with voting has not had enough time to develope itself to the fullest, so it is obvious that this system would screw things up.
