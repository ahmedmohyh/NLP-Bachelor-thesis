The article says that it would be more efficient to replace the traditional voting system with computerized voting because it is thought to be more trustworthy. Their main-argument is that in traditional voting the list is confusing because of the high number of names on it and the little shift might lead to let people with poor eyesight vote for the wrong candidate. The text says that there are errors generated by counting the votes and that with computer technology to count the votes would be easier, faster and trustworthier. 
The "speakers's" opinion stays in contrast to the article. She preferes the traditional voting system because it works the way it is, to change this system to a technology based voting would probably lead to troulbes. There are many people who aren't used to work with computers or can't afford one. She agrees with the article in the point that there are human errors while counting the votes but she thinks that they are not significant and that an error in a - also human made - computer programme would be much worse. A recount would be impossible.
