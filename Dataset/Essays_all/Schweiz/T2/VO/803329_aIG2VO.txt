In the recording, the lady presenting her arguments is taking a traditional standpoint on voting technology. She clearly is against the implementation of computerized voting systems, and tells the audience why that is. According to her, computers are to be considered risky when it comes to vote count accuracy, because they use algorithms programmed by humans. If those algorithms show errors, it may have fatal effects on the result, miscounting a big number of ballots. Here the written article points out that on the other side, if programmed correctly, the amount of miscounts in an voting algorithm would be equal to zero, since unlike a human being a computer is not able to miss ballots in their count.

In addition, the lady states that computerized voting may impose problems for people who don't use computers daily or are simply not able to afford one. For them it may be too difficult to vote on a screen. The text highlights this debate from a different angle, laying focus on the fact that computers improve the readability of the ballot forms for the voters, thus minimizing the chance of someone accidentally voting for the wrong candidate.

Lastly the argument of security guarantee comes up. While the text is defending computer security for voting programmes, because the economy is already using such systems for online banking, the lady in the recording shows herself more doubtful. She emphasizes that those systems had to go through multiple overhauls and improvements before they were considered well-established and secure.
