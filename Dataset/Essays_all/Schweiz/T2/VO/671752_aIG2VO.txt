In the United States the voting system is said to be inefficient because there exists some mistakes by human's hand. The article says that computers could resolve this problem. But in the listenening it is said that computers are programmed by human - and because of this they do not work fluently and mistakeless, because of the errors that the human had made while having programmed the computer.
And other reason why it could not work is, that voting happens very seldom. The danger, that there will be anything that will not work is to high, as the listening says, because one has to improve the system very often and when it is not used that much it is difficult to fix this problem.
Especially for people with bad eyesight this new voting system could be a chance, because they put sometimes the wrong name on the ballot. On the other hand, it is mentioned that people who are not used to computers could have some problems. For example people who can not afford one or for older people it is a big hurdle. 
Conculding, there are pros and contras for this computerized voting system and there are still some questions which could be the best way to improve this system in the United States.
