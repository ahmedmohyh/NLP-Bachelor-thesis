Voting system

It is claimed that computerized voting is not easier than the traditional voting. Especially for people who are not used to working with this technology it can be troublesome and they are going to make mistakes. The voting is not safe from human errors as well. Although they do not make mistakes in counting as humans would do, they were programmed by humans. As a consequenze errors are able to exist and they lead up to even bigger faults at the election. Because the votes are not written on paper, there would not even be a chance to recount them and mistakes are hard to detect. The national voting only takes place once every two years. For this long period of time between the elections, it does not hurt to have some more people who are busy with this action. 
The arguments speak against the text which states that computerized voting is better, faster and easier with less faults.It is also claimed that there are a lot of human errors during the count up of the votes. Furthermore, it is really expensive to count votes in the traditional way. And they also consider that some people think it is dangerous.
