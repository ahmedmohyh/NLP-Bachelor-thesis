Computerized voting systems can be easier for people who are used to working on computers and with technology in general. But for those that can't afford a computer, have poor eyesight or don't know how to use computers properly, it is very difficult to vote like this. If somebody makes a mistake in countig the ballots, it is not that hard to detect the error. But when a copmuterized system made a mistake, thousands of votes would be miscounted. Of course, computer systems that are used for banking or communications work perfectly and don't do any mistakes, eventhough they are created by humans and humans can make mistakes. But a computerized voting system would only be used once or twice a year, therefore it is hard to improve the system like they improved other system which are used daily. In the text it is mentioned that it takes a lot of staff to count the votes traditionally and someone could easily miscount a vote. But the error could be detected. This is certainly not the case in computer programms, so at the end of the day a computerized system will cause more trouble than the traditional voting system.
