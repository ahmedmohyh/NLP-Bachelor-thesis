The record told us that a computerized voting system could lead to bigger problems than the actual voting system. For example what if somebody isn't used to copmuters or is afraid of technology? Those people would have some problems if we the voting would be on the computer. Also if there is an error in the computer system there could be 1000 of misvotes or miscounting, which is way worse than a miscount made by humans. Furthermore they think that it would be unnecessary to construct a new voting system just for two selections each year. The text I read more into the idea of computerized voting. It says that with computerized voting has an easy-to-use-touch-screen which would help people with poor eyesight so they won't accidently vote for the wrong candidate. Also are humans more likley to make mistakes while counting the votes than a computer system. And why not to use technology for voting when we also use it in banking transactions where it also works perectly fine?
