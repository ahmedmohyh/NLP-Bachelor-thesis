In the presentation the woman stated that it isn't fully correct to assume that computers would do a better job concerning the counting of the votes. She said that computers are also programmed by humans, so human errors can also happen in technology. She went on to say that if there is a counting mistake in the system, it would be far more difficult to recount the votes because there is no actual physical proof of them. With these arguments she negotiates the thesis in the text, which says that computerized voting would prevent human mistakes during the counting process.
In contrary to the passage in the text, which says that voting on computers would be a lot easier (for example for citizens with poor eyesight), the woman in the presentation said that it is easier, but only for the people that are used to work with computers. There is a possibility that older people won't even vote, just because their fear of technology.
The last point that is being discussed is whether or not to give computerized voting a try. The presentation says that computers need to be improved so often, that it is hardly sufficient to trust on new technological ways. Where as the text insists to just try it, because we already rely so much on compouters (for example for communicating secret information) that this argument does not make sense.
