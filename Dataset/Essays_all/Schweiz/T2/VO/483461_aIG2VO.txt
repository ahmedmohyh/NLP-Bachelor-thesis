The woman in the presentation doubts that a voting system based on computer programms is better than the one they currently have in the United States. According to her, there are many problems involved with such a system. People who don't use computers every day or people who don't even posses a computer may have difficulties voting for their candidate. This could lead to people voting for the wrong person or even make them not vote at all. However, the computerized system could abolish counting mistakes made by humans. But this is only possible if it's programmed properly. Because one single mistake could have huge effects, far worse than those made by humans. 
The text thinks that we shouldn't be afraid of that, because our every day life is entirely based on programms like this and it works just fine. The woman on the other hand points out that when those programmes were established, they didn't work well either. They have only improved because we have used them so intensively.
