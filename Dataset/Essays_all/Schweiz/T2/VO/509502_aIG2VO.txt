As said in the presentation, a computerized voting system may be better for people who are used to working with computers in their daily life. But there are people who are not familiar with those new technologies and don't have a computer. Those people probably won't vote in case the voting system gets changed, or they will vote for the wrong candidate. This leads to the same mistakes that happen in the current voting systems. Therefor, the new system might be better for certain people but at the same time it is worse for others.

Also, it is true that counting mistakes probably happen because mistakes are a human thing. But since computer programms are made by human too, it is possible that there will be mistakes in the voting programm as well. These mistakes will then lead to a much bigger impact on the voting results because there will not just be a few but maybe thousands of miscounted or lost votes. In case of such a counting mistake, a recount is almost impossible.

Third, people do in fact rely on other computer systems in their daily life but it is a fact that those systems were not perfect from the beginning. They got improved over time and because they are used on a daily basis, it is more likely that mistakes get detected. Voting only takes place once in four years in the United States so finding the flaws of the system will take much longer.
