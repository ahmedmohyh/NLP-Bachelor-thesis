In the United States, as in many other countries, they still use a traditional voting system.The text pleads for a developpement in the voting system, so to say to use an electronic one. Conversly, the presentation argues for the old system. How do they both argue their points?

First of all critics find the traditional system inefficient und inaccurate. Furthermore one of the things that happens often, is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, if they have for example a poor eyesight. However supporters of the traditional system find that an electronic voting system would be difficult for people having trouble with technology,or for some that don't have a computer. This would then discourage them and they might not vote aymore at all.

Secondly, opposers find that humans make to many mistakes, especially when they have to deal with thousands of votes. On the other hands people in favour of the old system argue that computers can make mistakes aswell, especially because they are programmed by humans. Those errors that would then arose would be far more fatal and not easily recognised.

Lastly, the critical people don't understand why not to use an electronic system, if we trust in it for our banking transactions and communication every day. The supporters then argue, that this is exactly the difference. We have been using those things every day. They had problems at first aswell, but are now well known to us. However a voting system would be only used a couple of times a year, so it could be hardly sufficient.

For both sides there are valid arguments and the truth may lie somewhere in the middle.
