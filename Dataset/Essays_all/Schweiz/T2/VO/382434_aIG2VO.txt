The lecturer is trying to convince its listener to agree that our traditional voting system isn't a bad thing and that we aren't yet ready to change to a computerized voting system. The first argument given is about elderly people, who are not used to modern, complex technology. This will lead to a discuragement. Or people who can't afford a computer will have some big disadvantages. The teacher agrees, that people are making mistakes and are also doing so when it comes down to counting the ballots. But these will first of all be only a few mistakes and they are able to find such mistakes, if they check the ballots again. Computers on the other hand side will not be recogniseing mistakes as mistakes! Programmes are something made by humans. So there will be falsely programmed programmes. Our modern baking system is only as good and secure as it is now because of its long develope history. Till a voting system is good enough to be properly used, it will take ages, since they have national eletions every two year
