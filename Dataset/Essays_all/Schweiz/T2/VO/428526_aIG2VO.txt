In the audio are a few arguments against the use of technology at votings. One of them is, that older people barrely konw how to use a computer, so they could maybe answer something wrong. I would say that they have a little fear of the new technology, so they don't want even to try that new technology. It's not that every older person thinks like that, there are a lot of old people working with computers everyday.
One point that also was against the use of technology, was that if a human being makes a mistake at counting the vote than it's not too bad, because he maybe counted one or two too much. But if a computer has a error with thousands of votes in it, that would be a huge catastroph.
In the written part it says that the use of technology is a huge advantage and it should be used. The counting of the ballots would be much easier as if an human had to count every single ballot. The other Problem with the old voting system is, that people with bad eyesight can easily mark the wrong person, because they have to find the right name on a large sheet of paper and tha i could happen fast, to mark the wrong person.
