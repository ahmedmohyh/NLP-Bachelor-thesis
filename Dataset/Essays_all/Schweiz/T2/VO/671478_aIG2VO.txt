Many people would like the traditional voting systments to be replaced with more computerized voting systems. But what is with all these people who aren't used to technology, with al these older people ? For themit wpuld be very difficult to access to the computerized voting systems. They maybe not eve have a computer. The possibility of making a mistake would be very high for them.
Critics say that the result of the votes counted by poepole could often be wrong or not exact. But who can assure us that the computer won't make mistakes? Computers are programmed by humans, by people and people make mistakes. A mistake in a computer program hase a much bigger consequence on the vots' result than a human error. Maybe the error includes thousend of votes and not only one or two and taht would be worse.
It is too riskyto implent voting technology. It's true that goverments and individuals trust computer technology in banking transacions as well as in the communication of higly sensitive information, but this are everyday-life stuff. These systems have been improved since they have been invented. They are used every day. Voting systems are used maybe once or twice every two or four years in the United States. They wouldn't be so supervisioned and perfectly improved like banking programs. It's simply too risky to trust a such rearly used technology.
