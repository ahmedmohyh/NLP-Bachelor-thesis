In the USA the people have to make a tick at a long list of candidats for the election. People with bad eyesight can easely make tick the wrong candidat. If their is computer voting they can zoom. An other problem of the traditionl voting sysrem is the counting. The votes have to be counted by hand and there is a huge possibility of humen error. Computer voting would also be a lot faster and more efficient. It is worth to give computerized voting a thought.

On the other side not everybody is used to computers and not every family has one. Some people are afraid of technology. The programms are written by humen itself and this could cause big errors. Imagine the programm loses some counts or register the voting false, there have to be a revote because a recount isn't possible with digital voting. Programms like that have to be proofed to make them more sufficient. But there aren't many elections so the prosses would be so long that the technology would to old for the next election.
