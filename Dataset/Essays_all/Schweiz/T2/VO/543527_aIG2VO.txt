In the text was explained that critics say, that the traditional voting system has a few problems and is unefficient. A voting system on the computer would be much better and more efficient. On the traditional system where people have to vote on a paper one has hto set a mark next to the person you would like to elect. But that mark is such small that the people who count the votes easily can see the mark by an other person than next to the person you wanted to vote. If the traditional system has an error or is counted incorrect you have to repeat the whole election. If the system would be replaced by a system with computers it would be much more efficent and it would also be more easily for people that don't see perfect. If the election would have to be repeated it could be repeated faster and more precise. On the computer it would be easier to count the votes and nobody could see the important informations that are on the paper of the voters.

On the presentation of the critics of the "new" system is explained that voting on the computer also wouldn't be just better. Voting on the computer is easy, but only for those who know how to handle a computer. For people that haven't that much experience with technology is voting on the computer very difficult. And there is also to admit that computers are programmed by people and are not free of problems. The traditional voting system was tested during a long time and so it's not a bad system for the US. And also important is that on the computer is no physical counter, so it could be that the computer would give a really wrong result and nobody would check it. And if someone would see the wrong result, the count would also have to be repeated.
