The lady explaining the downside of computerized voting mentions many different points against voting on computers.
First of all she says, that some people can't afford computers or aren't used to dealing with them. Those people who therefore mind computers or don't have access to one, would surely not be happy. In fact it is much more likely they'd not vote again.
Then she mentions the fact that also computers are programmed by humans and humans do make mistake. So a computerized system would not grant flawless counting. In fact any potential mistake in the programm could lead to huge disasters, by deleting thousands of votes all together. And of course, she says, there are other programms which get improved often but those are daily used programms where the collecting of information is easy. That does not apply for electory programms though, which would be used twice per year at most.
Those arguments contradict the ones in the text though, where the advantages of computerized electionsystems are highligted. The text clearly says, that the electory system needs improvements due to lacking certainty of counts, accidential vots for the wrong person. The advantage of computerized elections would be the help a computer can provide you with, such as showing larger writing on the screen for people with poor eyesight or that it would be sufficient to click a name on the screen in order to vote for that person. No need to tick or in the worst case miss a box next to a name.
