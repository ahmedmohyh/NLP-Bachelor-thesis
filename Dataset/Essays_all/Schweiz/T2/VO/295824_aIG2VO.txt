Even though mistakes happen in the traditional counting system there are still many reasons that speak against replacing it with new computerized voting systems.

The firat reason against it would be that not everyone knows how to use a touch-screen technology. Often the voters are elder people with less experience with technology, making them use technology the are not confronted with sn't right. they could easily touch the wrong name on the computer and like that - just like in the ballot- vote for the wrong person. 
the next question would be that are computer really that trust-worthy. they are programmed by humans and one mistake could lead to a huge problem because other than with parers which you can recount computers lost there deta which would lead to voting once again, from the start.
The arguement that speaks against the last part is that the complex computer technology that we use everyday were developed and programmed and corrected day by day over the years and also had made huge mistake. To take that risk for something that important which only takes place once or twice in two years it to risky to change it for now.
