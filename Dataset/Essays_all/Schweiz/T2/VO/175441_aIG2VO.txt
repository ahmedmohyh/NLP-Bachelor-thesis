The text mentions the benefits of using computers. It's better for people who have a bad eyesight because they can use a touchscreen instead of a little paper. Another benefit of using computers is that they are much faster then a normal human. They are able to count quikly so that we dont need weeks to count the votes. 
However the hearingpassage is completely against the usage of technology. Additionally they mention that when a human counts wrong it isn't that bad as if a computer makes a fault. Because if a computer doesn't work right it will lead to 1000 miscounted votes. Accordingly our systems dont work flawless. They are developped by humans, so it's not impossible that they make faults. Another reason to be against the ussage of computers is that many people are afraid of computers and doesn't understand modern technology. 

So all in all I have to conclud that bouth sytems have their benefits. However, bouth aren't perfect so we have to accept that bouth systems make faults. In my oppinion we should use the computersystem becasue we are living in the 21. century and in our modern lifestyle we shouldn't make our lives complicated. So it is totally responsibel to have a computer which counts the votes, instead of a person.
