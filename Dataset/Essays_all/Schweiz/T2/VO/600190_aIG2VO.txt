In both texts it is obvious, that the voting system in the United States is inefficient and that the results can have some mistakes. Computers seem to be the answer to this problem in the text above. But in the Presentation the woman talks about her doubts. She thinks that the voting on computers would not be better, because there are lots of people, that are not experienced with computers or people that can not even afford one. For these people it would be an obstacle to vote on a computer. The woman also says, that a computer programm could have lots of mistakes too, because it is programmed by humans and humans make mistakes. In fact the mistakes that computers could make could have a much bigger impact on the results. It is possible that thousand of votes would not even be counted.
As a last argument for a voting technology in the text is, that we already have lots of other complex computer technology, in whitch we trust. But the woman in the presentation explains, that these programs are used daily and have had lots of improvements done already until they were trusted.
