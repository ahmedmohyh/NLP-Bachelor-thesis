First of all I want to say that the current voting systems in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. This is the reason why people search for a better solution like the computerized voting system. Is this computerized voting system really trustworthy and efficient? This question is really important because a computerized voting can also make errors. Moreover people who have problems with the new technology like computers can't use it easily. This can lead to errors because they have no idea of computers. The speaker is not sure if computerized system is better than the current voting systems in the United States. But we can guess that it's faster by counting the votings. In the text there are just positive facts about the computers, for instance that they have an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology and that voters just need to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate. However, as I mentionned before, this can cause problems by people who don't understand computers. So computerized systems can't remove the possibility of human error, as it's written in the text. It's too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide.
