Both the text and the presentation make their point and say that humans make mistakes. In this argument the speaker is a bit more precise, she says that humans may make mistakes but their mistakes aren't that big, because they work one vote at the time. The main argument against the machines and the programmes are, that if a program makes a fault it is written into the program. Also it may cause some serious damage because they would count all the votes together with the same mistakes, it could be fatal. Also did it take a lot of time to improve the programms and it doesn't makes sense to put much effort and money in it, because in the US they vote only every other year. But the main argument of the speaker is that not everyone is used to computers and not everyone is able to handle a computer.
