It is often disscussed if it is a good idea to change the voting system. In the text and presentation we hear some of both sides.
In the text they say that we are human and because of this mistakes in counting the votes are easily made. We not only coud count the votes wrongly no there are some other reasons why the current voting system is probably not the best. People could vote for the wrong candidate by mistake or they mark the wrong name. According to the text best solution for those problems is to have a computerized voting system. One positive aspect about this system is that there is noneed of people who have to count all those votes so there are no more human errors and the counting is much faster and easier. 

An argument against this new system is that there is no garantee that it would work any better. In the presentaion we heard some reasns agaist this compiuterized system. This new idea maybe is an good solution but only for those which are used to work with a computer for all the others it is not that simple. This could lead to wrong votes and that people woould not vote at all because of the difficulties. The other question we have to ask ourselves is: Would the computer really do our job better? They are programmed by us and this could also lead a human error. Additionally there would not be any physical record of the votes and if something gos wrong with the technic everything will be lost. So there are many reasons for the computerized vote sytem but also some against.
