The woman in the lecture says that computeriezed voting would bedoubtful. For people who are used to comuters it would be easy to vote. But for people who doesn't use computers on a regular basis it would be difficult to vote. So they could easily vote for the wrong person or vote for all of them. Computers are programmed by humans. So human errors could also happen. Furthermore they would be fatal. Because a human maybe miscounts a few votes but the computer would miscount thousands of them. And a recount would be imposible. Goverments use computer technology on a daily basis for banking and other stuff. But this technology have been tested for years and have been improved many times. The text says that the traditional voting systems are inefficient.They would be a inaccurate counting of votes. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong person on the long sheet of paper. In this case you would accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. With a new technology it would be easier to vote and to count the votes. Many people say it is too risky to make a new voting system nationwide. But goverments trust computer technology every day.

So the lecture shows us the disadvantages of the new voting system and the text wants to convince us of the benefits of the new technlology.
