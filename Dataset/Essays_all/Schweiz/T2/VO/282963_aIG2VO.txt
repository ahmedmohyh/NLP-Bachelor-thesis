Many people believe that the current voting systems are inefficient and not trustworthy because there are happening so many miscountts or people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate for exemple because they have poor eyesight.
What cause the trouble is that the sheet of paper or better said the list with the candidates contains many names and you have to mark them, which can be very irritating.
A new voting system could be a computerized voting machine and a lot of people are interessted in it. With that system it is a lot easier to vote for a candidate because you only have to touch the candidates name on the screen. But there are risks in that system too. And it seems like it is any better than the old voting system because there are many people who aren't used to computers, especially older people.They would be discouraged and wouldn't vote anymore, because they don't understand how to use a computer. An other point is that computers are programmed by humaines so there will be maid errors too. And if a computer is really programmed wrong or if there are errors in the system 1000 of votes could disapear or permanentely be removed fromthe record without anyone knowing it.Besides that the introducing of the new system would way too   So actually there's no better option for a voting system than they have know.
