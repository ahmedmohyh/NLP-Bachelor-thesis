The woman speaking countered every argument from the text. She started off with everyday use of computers. Not everyone is using a coputer nowaday and even less know how to use them properly. That people vote for the wrong person can also happen on a computer. The coputerisation of the counting is a prolem too. Those computers are programmed by humans and humans make mistakes. If they mess up the programming of the copmuters counting the votes, it may cause even more worse errors. Humans maybe don't count one or two votes but what happens when a computer doesn't count hundrets of votes? Another great argument is, that there is no physical evidence of the votes. It sure is a time and money consuming thing to recount a whole election but with computers a chance to recount the votes isn't even there. In banking or on wall street (economy in general) computers are used on a dayly base. The programms can be rewritten hundrets of times a year to fix all the errors. But the programm for  electional voting would only be used once every two years and getting an errorfree programm would take ages.
