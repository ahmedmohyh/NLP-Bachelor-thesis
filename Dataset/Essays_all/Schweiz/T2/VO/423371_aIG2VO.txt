The speaker says that using a computerized voting system would be hard to use for people that are not used to computers. This is the first point that goes against the text. In there, it is said that the paper voting is much harder to use, as the voter has to pick the right name from a list.
Another point the tutor makes is the one of technical errors. Even if computer systems were free of errors, there would always be the possibility of a human failing in programming the whole system. That would be a much bigger catastrophy, because a big part of all votes could be distructed. Not with the paper system, where just a few votes could be invalid.
The text argues that we already use big-sized computer systems, as the ones in banks or big companies. The speaker replies that these systems are improved over a long time and that most of them haven't fully worked till the beginning.
