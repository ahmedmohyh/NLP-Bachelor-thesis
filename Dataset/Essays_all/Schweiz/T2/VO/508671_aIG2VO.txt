The woman who gave the presentation is against computerized voting machines, giving several reasons for it.
First she says that this new system probably seems easy to those people used to working with computers, but not so to the others not to mention the people that can't even afford a computer. This could possibly lead to them being discouraged and not voting anymore. Her argument is opposed to the texts that states how easy it is to use the touch screen technology because the people need only to touch the cadidate's name.
She also says that even though humans are not perfect as stated in the text, neither are computers. The reason for that is that computers are made by humans. But opposed to the few votes probably being misscounted by human error, an error in a programm could have much worse consequences. Opposed to the text she thinks that computerized systems wouldn't remove the possibility of human error but imply the danger of an even greater error.
Finally she says that trusting the computer technology for banking transactions on a daily basis isn't the same as trusting a computerized voting system. That is because the technology for banking transactions wasn't perfect at the beginning neither but has been developped to a nearly perfect level because of its frequent usage. But the voting only take place every two years which is not very often. Therefore the computerized system couldn't develop at such a fast pace and would stay unreliable for a long time.
