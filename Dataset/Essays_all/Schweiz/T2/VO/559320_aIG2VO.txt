The old system is useful for people who aren't used to the computerized voting system.
These people can make the wrong vote if they don't understand the technic things. For these people it is more efficient to use the sheet of paper. Another problem is that the older people haven't got a computer at home and as a result they can not vote. The computer can also make errors and can be manipulate by hackers. So the technic doesn't show us the truth always.
