Critics also say that it is doubtful, that computer-systems will make voting any better. What about the people that can not use or even afford computers? People who can not use computers could easily cast for the wrong vote.
We also have to assure that computers are made/programmed by humans. So the computers could also make mistakes counting the votes. And computers also could make bigger errors whereas a human maybe will oversee one or two votes a computer will maybe oversee thousands or millions.
A solution for that would be improvising the problem. But the problem here is, that improvising will not be easy because f.e. in America we just vote once a year or in other countries twice a year or more.
So the risk of bringing the "easy-to-use touch-screen technology" is too high, first of all because the programming of the voting-system is made by humans which could lead to bigger mistakes and secondly because the improvisation of the programm will not be easy.
