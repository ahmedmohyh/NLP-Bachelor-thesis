The first argument for the new system is that the old one is inefficent and lead to inaccurate counting of votes. The first argument against the computerized voting system is that people who aren`t used to work with computers can have problems with the system. Another similar argument is that the people who cannot afford a computer couldn`t vote if there is a computerized voting system. 

An argument who speaks for the new system is that people sometimes accidentally vote for the wrong candidate in the old system. It`s not difficult  to mark the false name on this large sheet of paper with a lot of names.
But on the computer you can also cast easily the wrong vote because the fields are very close. 

Another argument for the new system is that its really difficult to count the votes one by one and going through every ballot. So a lot of mistakes happen. 
But the humans can also make mistakes if they developp this computerizes voting system and this programs also doesn`t work flawless.
