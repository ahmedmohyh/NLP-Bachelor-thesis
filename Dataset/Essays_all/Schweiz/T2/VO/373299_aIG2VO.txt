Computerized voting is a completely new system. Some say it will make the election process better while some completely disagree. It is certainly a very controversial topic.

In the previously heard presentation , the presenter is completely sure that computerized voting won't make any progress at all. She is certain that it will not make the results more accurate but it could make them just worse. Her arguments include that there is a great number of people which are not used to computers, especially eldery people. Some might even decline to vote at all because of their fear of technology. 

What's more, computers are also human-made, in other words they are not flawless at all. A mistake in a computer voting system could therefore have a much greater impact than any inaccuracy due to traditional voting systems. 

However, not everyone agrees; in the previous read article about the same topic the writer does try to convince the readers that this modernised system does have more positive aspects than negative.

Personnally, I think that it is a part of our society to make progress and to advance our systems and computerized voting would evidently be a further step to making our society work better.
