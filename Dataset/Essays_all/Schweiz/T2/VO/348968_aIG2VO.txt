Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. It`s because people make mistakes, while filling out the election sheets. They have for exemple a very poor eyesight and easily mark the wrong name. But on the other hand, if we would use computers as for our election methode that would include the possibility, that some of the electors wouldn't know how to use a computer. In my opinion, thats a really important argument, that should be considered. Think at old people, an other generation, grown up without electronics. Further, electing, or more generally, giving in data into a comuter is somehow always a risk. Think at hacker whose interest is, to manipulate the results. The information you gave the computer disappears in the network and from now on, it`s invisible for all the electors.
