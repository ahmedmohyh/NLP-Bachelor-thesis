in the presentation before,it was told that the computerbased voting system is not really efficient as it is in theory. People who are used with computers are able to do it normally but peolpe who do not use the computer through a normal day will have problems using it. So it could lead to misvoting and mistakes.

The paragraph criticizesexactly the opposite. The traditional voting is full of mistakes. Firstly you will get a large sheet of paper containing al lot of names. Then you have to mark next to the name you wantto choose.But people with poor eyesightwill haveproblemsbecausethey couldchoose thewrongone because of their poor eyesight. The computer baed voting could handle that situation because itis smarter and uses his technology to avoid mistakes. Butthe computer baed voting can be hacked and the votes fora personcan be deleted orone person could getall of the votesand couldbe elected.

Wecan seethat bothsides have their negative butthey bothare simpleand couldbe usedas voting systems.
