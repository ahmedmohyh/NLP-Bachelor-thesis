Computerzied voting machines are easy and usefull for people who are used to use computer and use it regularly. But people who have fear of the technology have trouble to use such e voting system because they do not know how to use a computer. The touch-screen technology is easy to use, but if the people do not know how to use the new technology they have no chance to vote.
The computersized voting systems are programmed by humans. So if humans make a mistake, the mistake is also in the voting programm. Humans have had developped the comutersized voting systems during the last years, so a suspected error of the programm is not impossible. But at the traditional voting it is also possible that they make mistakes. They must count thousands of votes and it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes.
If there is an error in the computersystem, all the records are removed and thousands of votes can be lost. But the computerzied systems can remove the possibility of human errors.
