One of the first points made was the fact that not all people are used to compuret tecnology and that inexperienced voters might not elect the right candidate by mistake. Some may be discouraged by the fact that they are unfamiliar with the new way of voting. Additively, not everyone has or is able to afford a computer, which would be a discrimination of not whealthy people.
Also, the woman talked about the human caused errors mentioned in the text. She argues that during the process of programming a software capable of taking down and counting all votes, mistakes can be made too. An error in the program would cause the results to be gravely wrong, not by maybe ten that the officials count wrong, but by thousands. Since no phsical votes exist, there would be no chance of noticing and tracing the cause. Also, if there is the suspicion of someone faking the results, there would be no way of recounting the votes.
At the end, she came to talk about the last paragraph of the text about the accuracy of complex computer technology in banikng transactions and communication. She mentioned the long time needed to perfect these thechnologies and that the US only voted few times per year. In her opinion, it would take far too long to perfect the system to be efficient.
