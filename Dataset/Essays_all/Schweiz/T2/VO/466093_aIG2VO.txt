All people know only the traditional voting system where they vote for their candidate on a sheet of paper. There, they have to mark the candidate they prefer on a long list. Then the votes were counted by people which could make mistakes and the result would be a wrong. If we would use a computerized voting, the voters could pick their prefered candidate on a touch screen where the names of the candidates are written down which is alot easier for the people wich are used to computer.
Another problem shows up when the votes have to be counted. In the traditional voting systems people count without any electronical help. The pro of the computerized voting system is that they do not have to count all the votings so instead of humans the technology solves this problem. It can count thousands of votes in a short time. But what if there is a problem with the counting in the ccomputer? There would be a huge problem if thousands of votes are discouted or removed. If this happens the whole voting have to be repeated because they do not know which votes have been discounted or removed. This mistake cannot happen to the traditional voting system because the people cannot cause such a huge mistake by hand. They just have to count them again which takes a lot of time.
