The woman said that the traditional voting is good sure can human do mistakes but a computer can do that too. If a computer makes a mistake it can't be fixed everyone has tovote again but if a human makes a mistake they simply can recount the votes. The technology is made by humans so can we trust computer any better? Every technology does mistakes in the beginning. Computers can't be fully trusted. There is no reason to swap the voting system on a technological base. Another point is that not every person can handle a computer. They will panic when something doesn't work and they are scared of the technology. The women tells us all the points which are speaking for the traditional voting but on the other hand there are some good points too. The traditional voting systemsheavily rely on people counting the votes. There will often be mistakes in counting and the people have to do the whole hard work again. A computer doesn't have this problem. In seconds the computer counts the votes and there can't be any mistakes. Even governments and individuals alike trust other complex computer technology every day so why shouldn't we trust computers and technologize the voting? It will make the voting way easier.
