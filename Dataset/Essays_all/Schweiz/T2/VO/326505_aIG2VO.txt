In every democracy they have a voting system. There are many different kinds to vote. In some places you can vote on the computer, in others you mark the person you`re voting for on a list. Both systems work. But is one better than the otherone?
In the USA you vote by marking the right person on the list and send it in. A problem is that people with poor eyesight are likely to mark the wrong name on the list. Aferwards the votes get counted by people. This can change the election a lot. People often do mistakes with the counting. That`s no surprise if they have to deal with thousands of ballots. 
All in all the voting system in the USA is very inefficient und uncorrect. This can have a big impact on the result if the election is closely contested. Because of that, the USA is thinking about replacing their system by a computerized voting system.
Many think that like this, there won`t be any mistakes made by the counting. But what if this is wrong?
Critics say that the computers are programmed by people. And if the computer is wrong programmed, this will have a much bigger impact.  We rely on computer systems every day, for example in a bank or at work. But these systems also weren`t perfect when they were first used. But after some time the programmers found the mistakes and the programm hasn`t any mistakes. But the computerized voting system gets used only twice a year. Therefore the possibility that a lot goes wrong is very big.
