In the text the actual traditional voting system is critizied like in the record. They said that this system is inefficient and lead to inaccurate countings of votes. On ballots there are a lot name written on it and they're written small, so people with poor eyesight could have a problem and maybe mark the wrong name. The other problem is that the votes were counted one by one y people and as we know humans could make mistakes. So if one mistake occured they had to do a expensive recount. That's whay they changed everything to computers. Now you have to vote on computers wich have a touch-screen and the votes are counted by computerized machines so there are no mistakes.

The text say that this solution is better and now there are no more faults. But the record has an other opinion. In the record they said that computers are just good for people who use computers and know how to use them. The other persons who doesen't know how to get along with a computer have a big problem. Also who says that computers don't make mistakes? They have been created by humans, so it is possible that human's mistake is on the computer. The other thing is that computers have to be improved to get to the best results of their use. But this takes a lot of time and the votings in the US are every two years. So it would take a lot more time to improve the computers and we will nerver be secure if they work hundert percent or not.

Conlusion: Computers are not in all ways better than humains and all kind of persons should have the possibility to vote without problems.
