Critics say that the traditional voting system isn't as effective as an computerized voting system would be. One advantage is that the voters couldn't make as much mistakes with voting for the wrong person because there would be an  easy touch-screen-technology. But with that argument we're assuming that everybody has a computer and also knows how to work with them. It's easy for the ones who work with computer on a daily basis but what's with the people who can't afford a computer or don't really know hot to use one? Are they going to have zero influence on the oresidental voting?
On the other hand the counting of te votes in the traditional voting system is done by people. It takes time to count all the votes and it's difficult to not make any mistakes. But we're all human so if there is made a mistake a long and expensive recount has to take place. But not only humans make mistakes a computer can also make mistakes. But if that happens than it's impossible to make a recount. And the mistake on the computer is also much bigger than the mistake with the traditional voting systems. There would thousands of wrong votes in the computerized system.
As it was said before we're all human and we make mistakes. But the computer is also made by a human so there is also the possibility that they're mistakes in the computerized voting systems. Another argument for the computerized voting system is that governments and individuals alike trust in computer technology every day as in banking transactions. But before they were used they had to be improved many times. The banking system is also something that is being used every day from many people while a voting is once or twice a year.
