It is a widely discussed topic, whether we have to reform ourvoting system and replace it by a computerized system or whether we can trust our ancesters and stick with the traditional one.
Critics against our current voting system point out the ineffieciency and inaccuracy that it brings along. They suggest to develop a computerized program that can avoid any kind of human error.
On the other hand, there are lots of people that doubt the technoligal alternaative. They say that computers are programmed by humans so we aren't safe at all from our own mistakes. Further, if there is a mistake in the computers program, it's impacts on the result are going to be way more dramatic. Also you'd have no physical prove and it would be impossible to start a recount.
As a response to that the computerized voting system approvers show us our daily use and trust into technology such as online banking or communication of sensitive information.
To make it easiest for people to vote, which is a goal that both methods are trying to achieve, the following arguments are being listed: With a computerized system it is almost impossible for people to make mistakes, since all they have to do is click on the name. In contrary, being able to handle computers should not be taken for granted. Those who aren't used to a computer will have major difficulties to hand in their votes. Also not everyone is able to affor a computer, therefore a computerized voting system would make it very uncomfortable for them to vote.
