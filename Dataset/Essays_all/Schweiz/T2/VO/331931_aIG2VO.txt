The text and the audio are both about the voting system and say that the system wich is active at the moment is too inefficient because it has a weak ifor the people wich votte per hand and not with the online sytem. The weak is, that that the different persons you can vote aren't explained that good for the people wich don't vote online. It's also a weak that you don't have an oversîght as good as on the computer on the voting papers.
They also say that coputers are also made by humans and that means that they also make fails and these fails are often very big fails because the numbers of the voting people are very high.
It is also explained that some people don't trust the softweres wich count the votes of the USA and that's too dangerous to give such a important work to the computer technologicy.
