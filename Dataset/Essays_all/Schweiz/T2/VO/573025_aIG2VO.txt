With the rise of technology, our world is becoming more and more dependent on computer systems. Everyday situations are replaced by computerized programming, for example a cachier at a supermarket is replaced by a machine. 
Critics even say that the voting system should be computerized. The old traditional way has to many flaws. 

One point is that there are too many candidates on one large sheet of paper and people with poor eyesight may make the mark at the wrong place, thus cast the wrong vote. If computers were used to vote, such accidents wouldn't happen because the computerized voting have an easy-to-use touch-screen techonology. 
However many people don't have the money to buy the used techonology and the older population aren't used to computers. That's why it is also possible there for mistakes to happen. 
Additionally these people who are not used to computers may lose their interest to vote completely. 

It is true that there are often miscounts, because human error is almost unavoidable, but this also must be true for the computerized voting. Humans programm the system and if there a mistake happened, the result would be much worse. Peopel may miscount some votes, but an error in the entire system may cause thousands of votes to be misinterpreted and the worst, there would not be any physical data to control. 

The voting system now is not traditional. It has been improved many times over the history and it is still improving. Votings don't happen too many times, in fact in the United States, only every two years there is a vote. Is that really enough time to develop a new, full functioning voting system? What if there are errors? The worst thing that could happen in current system are some miscounted votes, but a failure in a comupeterized system may lead to a much larger catastrophy, causing many people to lose their interest in voting.
