To start things off I want to say that the article likes the idea of computerized voting not as the person who speaks. The two opinions are contrary to eachother so one is against the other. 

The text says that the US voting is inefficient and inaccurate. In the US humans count the votings and we need to consider that humans make errors. As a consequence the inaccurate counting can leed to wrong results. To prevent this case it is important to change the counting system. Computer are machines which will not cause any errors. 
Furthermore people with poo eyesight cross the wrong candidate because they have to search him on a large sheet of paper. This would not be a problem on the computer because it is unlikely possible to miss the name of the candidate.

The person who speaks has doubts to the computerized system. It might be an advantage for people who are used to work with computers but people who are afraid of the technology or people who cannot afford computers are in trouble. This could leed to that less people go voting. In addition the coputer programms are made by humans and as we know humans make errors. If the computer has a lack this would cause thousands of thousands of errors in the voting. You cannot change that the counters count inaccurate but they only miss a few ballots and not thousands. 

In essence, we cannot stop the development of the technology but however there will always be people who have prejudices against computers. This dicussion will not end.
