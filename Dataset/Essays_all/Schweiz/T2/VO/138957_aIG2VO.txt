The presentation opposes most of the arguments made in the text. It says that the digitalisation will not help making the outcome of the voting more accurate. It bases this assumption on the programs, which are said to probably still have errors since they are written by humans. And these errors would be far more problematic, as they would affect a tremendous number of votes. Furthermore, the voting data will not be stored after the counting process so recounting is not going to be a possibility to fix said errors. In the text the modern computerized banking transactions are named as an example for well working technology. The presentation neglects this by saying that those programs have gone trough trial and error for a long timespan and that it takes way longer to do that for internet-based voting, since it is not used daily; only twice a year will it come to use at best. Another factor they critisize is that people without computers will not be able to vote anymore, which would make the situation only worse. While it could be said that nowadays everyone posseses a computer, there are still people that either lack the money to buy one or the knowledge to utilise one.
