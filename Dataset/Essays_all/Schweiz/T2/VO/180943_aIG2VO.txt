Firstly, one problem that was mentioned was the use and the comprehension of computer systems. While they provide support for people who have bad eyesight or troubles fiding the name of their favourite candidate, it may be too difficult for people who don't use computers on a regular basis. Furthermore, there are many households without any computers so the effort they would have to make to be able to vote could become quite big.

In addition, the votes are counted by human beings, who make mistakes. A computer system could reduce the  possibility of mistakes. However, computers cannot be trusted unconditionally. They make mistakes too and while the people who count the votes may make a few small mistakes, an error in the computer system could make far more serious faults that affect the whole election instead of just a few votes. 

Furthermore, our society's trust in computer systems is discussd. There are already many computer systems that we use daily, for example to do banking transactions. These systems usually work quite precisely and without any errors. However, these systems have been tested and improved for a very long time and a computer system to vote wouldn't be used so regularly and as a result the system will probably take a long time until it works perfectly.
