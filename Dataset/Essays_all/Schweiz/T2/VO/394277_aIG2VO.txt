There is an enormous controversy between letting computer software count voting ballots and letting people count them by hand. In this essay I am going to discuss some arguments made in a lecture.

It is claimed that computer are often not really better than humans since computers are programmed by humans and humans often tend to make mistakes. However, mistakes are only human and when a human counts the votes there will of course be some missed or mistaken votes. Whereas, if a computer software counts the votes, there is a greater likelihood of 1000 of wrong votes or even deleted votes. Furthermore, there are national votings only every two years so it would not be a problem to count the ballots by hand.

In the text the issue of people voting for the wrong person by accident is discussed further. When someone is not able to see very well there is a probability that they will vote for the wrong person. Or simply, when a person is not very concentrated on what he is doing, a mistake is likely to happen.

Taking everything into account, it is safer for us to stay with the good old counting by hand.
