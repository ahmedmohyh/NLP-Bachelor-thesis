This essay is about the old voting systems and if they are not good enough, is it necessarly to develop an new revolutionary voting system to prevent mistakes, because of counting fails. to make it easyer for peolpe in every age to vote for her favorite candidate. Or is the normal voting system good enough.

First I they criticize they fact, that often people could not vote for her canditate because they do not get the voting system or can not see good enough to make the cross on the right place. Furthermore the second point ist that the votes are count by humans, which naturally make mistakes, when they have to count thousands of votes and papers or crosses. So they would prevent this problem with a new programm, which do not need people to work. Yet the programm is developed by humans which can make a mistake in programming. And what is simple counting mistake, when you can prevent a mistake in a programm, which will probabliy do not count like thousands of votes. Also the voters have to be used with computers, otherwise they will have the same problems like in the old votings system. Also, a development of a good programm need some time and the chances are not that big, that it works perfectly in the first try. Nevertheless there could be such a programm in the next few years.
