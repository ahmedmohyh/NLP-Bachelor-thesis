At the moment there is a discussion about changing the voting system in the United States. The major aspects are the failures that people accidentally make. There are two major groups in the States. One group is for replacing the voting system with a computerized voting. They think that their voting system is far more safe and more easy for the people. Because some people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. One the computer they could make the picture bigger and they think thats the solution for the voting issue.
The other group is not for replacing the voting sytem. They think that the computer make it even worse. Because the computer programs are made from people and if they make a failure the whole voting is wrong. They think too that it is a problem that the votings are not daily and that people don't get used to the new voting system.
