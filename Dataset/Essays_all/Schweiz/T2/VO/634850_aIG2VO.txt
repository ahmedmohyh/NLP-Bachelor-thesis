The problem with the traditionel voting system is that the people have to mark the right person so on the big ballot it is sometimes very difficult to find the right person. It is also very difficult to count all this papers because they all have to be counted by men. The New idea is to replace the system with the new trustworthy computerized system. The new program should prefend that the people can not mark the wrong people anymore. Some people say the biggest problem with the new voting system is, it is not good as the old one because in the beginning of a new system it is possible that there are many human errors and if not every body is using a computer on a daily base  there can be problem connected to the results. The point is the bank transactions are all made by computers but they are used every day and not like the voting system every four year. Which means the numbers in the voting system can be more incorrect because not every body uses a computer as often as an other.
