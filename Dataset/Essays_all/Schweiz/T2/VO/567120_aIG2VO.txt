The points of the critics are that now people often vote for the wrong candidate and that it's difficult for the officials to count the votes. 

But computers probably aren't better than we are. A computerized voting system would be good for people who work dayly with computers. But there are a lot of people who don't know anything of computers or can't afford them. The problem that often the wrong persons get chosen can't be solved with the computerized voting system because this could also happen with computers. Technology is something rather new, computers were invented by humans. Humans make mistakes,  but so do computers. 
When one person votes for the wrong candidate or an official counts one vote wrong, it's not a huge problem. But if the computers did any mistake, thousands of votes could be miscounted.

Computers can't always be trusted. And votings are some of the most important things that exist. So they should be organized with a system we know and we know it works and that's still the human being.
