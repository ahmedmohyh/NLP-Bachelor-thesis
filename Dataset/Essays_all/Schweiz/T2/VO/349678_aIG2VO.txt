It's about the voting system of the United States. Now they count the votings by human. But they want it to change. they want computerized voting machines. Can you trust them? Are they really doing a better job then us? These are the Questions wich are disgused in the presentation. In the text they talk about mark the wrong name because of poor eyesight. But what are computer doing better about poor eyesight? And what about people who arent used to computers? Old people maybe? THey could also mark the wrong name. And what about if the computer makes a fault? What is when he has a leck and the countings are wrong at all? Nobody can recount it. So it is no better to do it with computers and to count so many times by hand istn't that bad just once in a while .
