At the moment there is a discussion about the current voting systems used in the United States. Critics argue that it is unpractiical and want to replace it with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system. The supporter of the traditional system on the other hand want to keep on relying on the system in use. They think that a computerized system could cause big mistakes while counting the ballots. Humans on the other hand will only misread a small amount of ballots what doesnt have much influence on the elections. 
The supporters of an computerized system argue that the traditional system causes many mistakes because people with bad eyesight aren't able to read the candidates names. If there was an electrical system these people could zoom on the screens what makes the names appear larger. 
I think both systems have their strenghts and flaws and they both are threatened by manipulation. Since hacking is an rising problem in our world I believe the traditional system is safer. On the other hand it's in the long-term also much more expensive.
