The text and the lady both agree that the current  system of voting in the US has some deficites.There are a lot of miscountings and even people who choose the wrong candidate because there is an enormous list where you have to pick your candidate. In general the text says that it would be better and more correct to implement a voting technology. The lady herself found some critics against a computer voting-system. People who aren't used to computers or don't use them in daily life could easely get distracted or even make a wrong vote. Inthe text is mentioned that the old voting system is heavenly relied on people and this can cause mistakes. The lady admitted that mistakes happen and thats just human but computers are programmed by humans and a mistake in the computer-programm is far worse than a simple miscount. There could be thousends of wrong votings caused by a simple mitstake in the programm. She also mentioned that the bank systems are used much more then the voting system would be and they were tested and increased a lot which wouldn't be the case with the voting technology.
