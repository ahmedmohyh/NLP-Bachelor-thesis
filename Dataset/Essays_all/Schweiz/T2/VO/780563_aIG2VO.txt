Should the traditional voting system be replaced with a computerized voting system? The audio file neglected the article in many points. The article proposed a replacement of the old votig system, because people tend to make errors at marking the candidates or counting the votes. As a contrast the audio file told that a change to a computerized system would lead to a whole bunch of problems. Critisized was for example that not everybody is used to computers because they are part of an older generation or can not afford computers. Moreover the replacement is an additional effort and the programmes have to be perfectonized over and over again. 
As well important is that computers ar not perfect. They are made by humans and programmes can still content mistakes. The only difference is that those mistakes can lead to a huge consequence. For example could a programme delete a few thousands of votes.
To conclude it is to say that a computerized system does not change the situation to the better. It is being dealt with sensitive information that has to be protected with firewalls, another expensive impact.
