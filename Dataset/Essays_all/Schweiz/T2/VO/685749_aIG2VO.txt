The lecture crtitizised the idea of a new voting system in the United States of America. 
Critics said that a computerized version of a new and more trustworthy voting system would be easier for everybody to use. Especially for people with poor eyesight. But the lecture made clear that voting on computers could be more difficult than the paper version and there would be a huge problem with all the people who are not used to computers in a daily-basis. This could cause a fear of voting and even stop some from actually going to vote.

The text said that the grand amount of votes to count is too big for humans and humans make too many mistakes counting the votes. But another argument against the computerized voting system is the fact that computers make erros too because they're programmed by humans. If only one computer counted the votes wrong, all the results got distorted. And if this happened there were no possibility to recount the votes.

Also mentionned is the rare using of the voting sytsem. Nationwide, there is only one voting every two years and not more than two votings stateswide. Improving the computer system would require a lot of effort and it's questionnable if it was worth the effort.
