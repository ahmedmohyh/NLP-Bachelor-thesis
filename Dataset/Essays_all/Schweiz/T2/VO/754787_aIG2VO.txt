The current voting system of the USA gets critizised a lot, but would a computerised system really be better? People who don`t have enough money or the fear of computers are then excluded from voting. On the other hand, one could argue that the possibility of human error is highly reduced.

The speaker in the listening text clearly states her opinion against computerised system with arguments such as people having a fear of technology or not have the money to by computers, wich would exclude a part of the american society from voting. Another problem are people who don`t use computers on a regular basis, making the voting complicated for them. The speaker also mentions that, if there are human errors made while programming the computer system, the mistake would be huge, as thousands of votes would be wrong.

In the reading text on the other hand the writer does critizise the old voting system and is pushing for a technological development in terms of a computerised voting system in the USA. He relies on human errors that are frequently made while counting the votes. He also mentions that people often choose the wrong candidate by accident. In his opinion, people with poor eyesight are challanged by the old voting system.

The two people have a very different opinion on the voting system of the USA, as they show with several arguments. In the end it`s up to every individual, wich voting system he or she prefers and wich voting system should be used in the future is going to be decided soon, as we always push for technological progress.
