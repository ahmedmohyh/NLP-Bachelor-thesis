The voting system is a very intense discussed subject. Every two year, when it comes to the election all newspaper and citizen talk about the voting system. And there are two groups in the disussion. The one who support the counting by a computer. And the other one who does not support it. 
Here are some pro argument which are for the computer counting.The cpmputerized voting is easy to use. And the traditional caunting is not as efficient as the computerized one. It is easier for everyone because the people do not have a large sheet with a lot of names. Because the large sheet is often a problem for the people with a poor eyesight. Maybe they can't see the right name and choose a wrong one. And everyone trust a computer to do banking transaction so we can also do the election counting on the computer.
The contra argument which are against a computerizerd voting are that the computer counting is only easy for the people who use a computer very often. But for those who do not have a computer at home it is very hard to work with it. Another very important aspect is that computer can also do mistakes because they are also made by human. We used it eery day and that is why we can improve it. But the system to count will only be used twice a year in local election. So we can not improve the computer as much. A misscountig from a computer can be about 1000 votes but a human only make a mistake about 10 votes. 
So the problem of miscountig is alway here so we could choose the computerized counting an try it.
