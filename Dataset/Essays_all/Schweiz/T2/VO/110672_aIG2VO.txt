The text says that it's a good idea to vote on a computer and to let them count by this new technology, but are we sure that the computer makes it better than we as a human. Because computers are programmed by people and if there is one little mistake on it, thousands of votes can't be counted properly, while less votes would be 'forgetten' if we counted by hands. In addition a voting happens just every second year. In this case the amount of time we could save by letting a computer doing our work wouldn't be that big. It was also mentioned that this computerized voting is a good thing for those who are used to a computer, but what is with the others? To make an example: Let us think about the older people who have no idea how to turn on such a technical gadget. An other point is, that not everyone can afford to buy a computer. So why should only count the votes form the rich people, who can buy a computer? The poor have the same right as the rich are. We see that there are many points for both sides.
