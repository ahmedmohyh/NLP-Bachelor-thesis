In the United States there is a very old voting system and many people say that the voting system is too old and that they need a new system. But would a new voting system bether than the old one? 
The traditional voting system is bether than a computerized voting system.

It may be true that there are people who vote accidently for the wrong candidate because of the traditional voting system. But the computerized voting system wouldn't solve this problem. This voting system would only be easier to use for people who often use electronic devices, but for people who don't use often such devices it would be much harder to vote with this modern system. Those people would also vote for the wrong candidate or maybe they wouldn't even vote anymore because they are feared of the electronic.

Another point is that humans count the votes for the candidates. "Errare humanum est", so the humans, who go through the ballots, make mistakes. It's very expensive and needs much time to revers such mistakes. But can we be sure that there aren't any mistakes anymore when we use a computerized voting system? No, we can't! Because some humans have to programm the voting system and also these humans are just humans and make mistakes. Programm-mistakes would be way more heavy than counting mistakes.

The actual voting system is very old and is definitly not perfect, but a new voting system wouldn't be bether.
