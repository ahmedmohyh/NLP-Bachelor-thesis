In the audio and also in the text we heard a lot of negative points about the current voting sytsem in the United States. 
They criticised for example that the use of computers is just for these people useful who are using the new technology daily and not for people who have a fear of it like for example the older generation. 
In the text they said that it should be espescially for the persons with e poor eyesight a better way to vote for their candidate including the older generation.

In addition says text that computers are better counters than the human an that they aren't doing any counting errors but im the audio we heard that it is very important to remember that computers are made by humans and there is everytime the possibility having an fault in the programm.

Even more important is to remember that for example banking transactions are used daily and they are heavily imporoved. Not like a voting system which is just tested once a year.
They remarked too that if a error would be detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place in the old and traditional system. Later in the audio they talked about the enormous problem we would have if the computerprogramm would fail.
