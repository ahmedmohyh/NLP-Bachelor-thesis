The listening is definitely against computer voting but according the text it is an good possibility to change form traditional voting to computer voting. The text is written very objective. 
They say it is much easier to use becuase they do not have to search the name on a lardge sheet of paper and make a cross, but what is with the people they are not used to computers? Accoring, the listening they get a big problem because they may click on the wrong name or it takes them hours to understand how they have to use such a computer.
The text tells also that it is heavy to count the votes becuase every single paper one by one must be counted and often mistakes happen and this effects and long and expensive recount, but computers can make mistakes and can removed from records.
It is a risct to replace traditional voting against computer but we can also see it like a chance for the futre becuase we are get to use computer technolpgy almost every day.
