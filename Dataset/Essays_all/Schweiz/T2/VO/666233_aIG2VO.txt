As one disadvantage the're was mentioned that not everyone's used to computers and that the persons that aren't used to coul easily get in troubles or could vote wrong by accident. As a second reason there was mentioned that we're not shure if computers will really do a better job than humans who are counting the votes. It's sure that humans will make mistakes but if a computer is programmised in a wrong way or if there are mistakes in the technology the resuld would be much bigger. And there isn't any physical help that could remark the mistakes that the computer has probably made. An other important point we have to ad is that the programms we trost every day, like the e- banking, are all daily heavil used. They didn't worked the first time. But the systems for voting aren't used often so they'll probably have some difficulties in the beginning.
