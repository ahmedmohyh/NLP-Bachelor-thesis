Voting is something essential to our lives; by voting we give our opinions about important subjects and we decide who we want to make the important decisions in terms of law, order, health and poltics in general.

Lately, the voting system used in the United States has been critizised a lot.It seems to be inefficient and more than anything - inaccurate. The system relies on people to count the votes, that causes inaccurate results. In addition, there are people - especially old people who easily make mistakes when choosing for whom to vote. Sometimes they cannot read the names, and give their vote to the wrong candidate. 

Therefor, multiple parties have suggested to replace the traditional voting system with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system. That way, the results would be more accurate and counting is done more quickly.

But as told in the audio, a computerized system has got many downsides as well: First of all it is only for people who own a computer, and know how to handle it. Also it is doubtful, that a computerized system is more correct than human counting: Those systems are programmed by humans and a errors inevitable. But an error in the system is far more fatal than one miscounting, since hundreds of votes can be miscounted or even eliminated. Systems like bank transactions have been improved over years of use. Voting on the other side, happens only a few times a year and is therefor harder
