In the text is said that the current voting systems in the United States are inefficient and miscounts are possible. Some people who vote with this voting method vote for the wrong person because some of them have got bad eyesight and mark accidentally the wrong name. Sometimes there are human errors which lead to an expensive recount of the voting. But there is a better way to count the voting namely with a computerized voting system. It has an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology which prevents that some people vote for the wrong person. This new system has less accidentally voting mistakes than the traditional one.

The woman said that the computerized voting system has a lot of problems. First, not everybody can use computers. Second, one mistake can lead to 1000 of miscounts. So in the speaking is the computerized system the worse.
