Current voting systems in the USA are very often criticised due to its lack of accuracy and efficiency. However, those critics do very frequently forget the benefits of traditional voting systems used in the USA. In this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the current voting systems in the USA. 

First of all, many argue that the voting system should be computerised. This does have its advantages as it enables the voter to magnify the name for easier viewing and reduces the inaccuracy of people voting for the wrong cadidate. However, after all some people might struggle to use a computer as they are not used to using a computer. Especially if one doesn't use a computer on a regular basis, one might decide to stop voting. 

Another aspect is the implementation of banking transactions as well as in the communication sector with highly sensitive information, which is all computerised. Those systems appear to be very reliable and trustworthy. Nevertheless, traditionalists argue that those services are used every day and have been improved on from time to time. Voting, however, only takes place every two years and cannot be compared with accordingly. 


To conclude, both sides seems to have strong arguments. Whether you believe that it is better to keep or renew the voting system in the USA propably depends on the fact if it benefits you or not.
