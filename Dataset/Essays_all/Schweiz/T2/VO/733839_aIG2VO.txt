The first important point which both texts mention is that people who want to vote by the computer can make mistakes. It's easy for people who know how they have to use a computers. But there are also others who don't know how a computer functions. For these people this voting is quite a fight because maybe they don't even understand how they have to vote. For older people it's easier to use the traditional way.
It is a fact that when someone has to count all these votings they can make a mistkake and count wrong. Many people have the opinion that because of this the computer system is a better voting system. But how can we be sure that the computer doesn't make mistakes? We don't know. The computer is installed by people and maybe just then there is made a mistake. When one person is counting all the votings on his own then maybe he's making a few counting failures like five or something like this. But a computer can loose a thousend of counts and no one realise this miscounting because all people think that evereything the computer is making has to be right.
The computerized voting is much more efficient than the traditional way and people also think that it makes less mistakes so I'm sure the computer system is more prefered for the future .
