The presentation claims that computer voting could be a very hard task for people who are not used to computers. Instead of enhancing the efficiency of voting it would only discourage those voters who have difficulties in useing the computer. Another reason why computer voting is not as good as some people believe, is that human error can still happen. Computers are programmed by humans and therefore can have flaws or even big issues, which could distort the outcome of the voting much more than just a regular voting miscount. The text claimed that computer technollogy nowadays is perfectly accurate when it comes to banking transations. Therefore computer  voting should not be problem. The presentation on the other hand says that the systems and programs used in banking transactions are used daily and were improved a lot of times until the programs were perfect. But computer voting is a different case. Voting takes place only a few times a year, it is not used on a daily basis. That is why program problems could not be detected early enough and that would lead to serious errors.
The text also says that computer voting would be good for people with poor eyesight, but most people who have difficulties with their eyesight when it comes to reading documents or books are elderly people, which also did not grow up with the technology we use nowadays and would therefore be the people who might be scared of useing the computer to cast a vote. 
All in all traditional voting still seems to be the best option for our society. Computer voting might be a possibility in the future when the people are more used to computers and programming errors can be avoided easierly.
