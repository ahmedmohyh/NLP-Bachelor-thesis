The text says, that we can trust computers more than humans in the subject "voting". There could be a lot of mistakes, if the humans count the votes. If they make one mistake, they will have to recount everything and a computer system doesn't makes such mistakes. The text also say, that many people can't see good and they can easily mark the wrong name, which is a problem for the voting. They found out a solution and the solution is a computer. Computers, which help you to count the voting or where you can mark easily the name you want.
The presentation says the complete opposite. They say, that computers aren't any better, because only the people who are used to it, know, how the function of this difficult technology, works. Computers are very expensive and if somebody hasn't enough money to buy one, he or she can't vote. Many people are afraid of technology and they don't know how to use it and some people just know it. If the computers make a mistake, you won't be able to recount, because the whole programme could be deffect or something else is wrong with the programme. It's also difficult to create a perfect programme, if you use it only twice a year. Thousands of votes can be misscounted, when the computer has a problem. Programmes are good with things, we use daily, but not with things, we use once or twice.
These two opinions are completely different, because the text says, that computers are better and the presentation says, that the humans are better for this job.
