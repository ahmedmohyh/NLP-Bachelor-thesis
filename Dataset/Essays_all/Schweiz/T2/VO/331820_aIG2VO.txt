The text mentions that it's less difficult to vote on a computer than made on paper. What contradicts this argument it that the "easy-to-use-touch-screen" isn't necessarily easier for people who don't come in touch with computers on a daily basis. For instance people who can't afford computers or don't use them regurlarly.This can lead to discouraging those who don't deal with computers every day and to not considering those, who fear technology. These problems can also lead to inaccuracy when voting.
The statement, that computers are more accurate and that they can remove human errors, is false according to the audio recodring. Because humans crated computers, and humans make mistakes, the computer is also a non reliable method to count votes. A human can make few mistakes with the ballet, but if a computer malfonctions, the computer can make far more serious mistakes than a human. 
The every day use of banking transactions etc. can't be used as an argument, that transactions work out and so must voting too. But the difference is, that voting isn't made frequent enough to be sufficient and also not as well improved as ebanking and communication. Online voting has never had a change to make processes for imrovement so it can't be fully trusted.
