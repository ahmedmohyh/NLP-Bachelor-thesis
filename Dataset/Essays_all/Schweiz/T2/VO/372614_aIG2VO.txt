The problem of voting

It's normal that humans make mistakes. But when it comes to voting, the process should work flawlessly.
In the presentation I just heard, the problems of cumputerized voting are named.
It brings just as many problems as the common voting.
Especially the people who aren't as confortable with computers probably wont be able to use the programms.
Also persons, who can't afford a computer wont vote. In the end the participation would be much smaller.
The only better thing of voting by computers would be, that no mistakes would be done, while picking the candidate of yout choice, because of poor eyesight or a bad layout of the votingpaper.  
As a matter of fact, the mistakes, that are done directly by people aren't as bad as a mistake in a computerprogramm, so when the votingprogramm would have a mistake, the error would be wors than a miscounting by human. 
Finally it's better to just keep on voting with the old process.
