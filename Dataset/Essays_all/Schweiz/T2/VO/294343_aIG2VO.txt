The arguments in the presentation were that not everybody is used to computers and don't use them on a daily basis for example older generation.In that case they are afraid of using technology. Somepeople can't afford a computer or other modern technologys.Another problem is that if the computerprogramm has an error  a recount is quiet impossible.People can only count a ballot twice or forget a ballot.

In the text is different, they  say that the mistakes during the counting of the votes is inevitable and that the computerprogramm would remove the possibility of human mistakes. They also say that it's easier for the people to vote and the risk of chosing the wrong name doesn't exist anymore.Also for the people with poor eysight  it would be much easier. But the text doesn't relate to the people who can't get along with modern technology or poor people who can't afford it. So the  text says the computerized voting is easier also for the older people  but in the presentation they also speak about the negative aspects. So all in all the presentation is much more critical and gives us much more information about the risks of the computerized voting.
