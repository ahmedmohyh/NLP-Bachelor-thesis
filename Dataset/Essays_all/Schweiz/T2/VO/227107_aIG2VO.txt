One problem about the voting in the United States is that humans make mistakes when counting because afte hours and hours of counting which person was voted for, it is unavoidable and inevitable that they will make a mistake. The problem is that one will have to recount all the votes, which makes the people in charge even more likely to make an error because of frustration. In the presentation the female reader mentioned that it is unwise or rather foolish to trust computers. The reason for this being that computers are built by humans and humans make mistakes, therefore we should not entrust them for voting.
Another reason for introducing computerized voting systems is that we use computers while making banking transactions anyway, which makes the people wonder why you shouldn't use them for voting. However, taking into consideration that a lot of people, especially poor and old folk, lack the knowledge of modern technology it is unwise to use them for voting since they will be frightened and therefore discouraged to vote.¨
By going further into the above mentioned text, we see that a lot of people, due to poor eyesight, might tick the wrong box, which leads to unwanted results.  On the other hand, if the computer is programmed wrongly, thousands of votes might be eradicated and since there will be no physical record, the election will be heavily afflicted. Using computers for voting might not be that usefull anyway, since there is only one voted per year or less.
