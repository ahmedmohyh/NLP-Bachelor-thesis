Firstly, the text states that the counting of the votes with the traditional voting system is very inaccurate. The lecture opposes that argument and says that a mistake in programming of a digital voting system, also caused by a human, is much worse than inaccurate counting. If there is something wrong with the programme, thousands of votes could be misinterpreted or lost, which has a bigger influence on the voting than inaccurate counting.

Secondly, the author of the text claims, that a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, for example because of poor eyesight. He states that voting would become easier for such people with new voting technology. The lecture does not agree: It claims that a lot of people are not used to computers or even cannot afford a computer. Therefore, the risk of voting for a wrong candidate gets bigger and a lot of people are discouraged to vote.

Thirdly, the text states that it is no problem to rely on the voting system, because modern technology is already used for highly important things such as banking transactions and the experience is that it works reliable. The lecture refuses that argument and says that systems such as the one for the banking transactions had to be developed many years to be as reliable as today and that the development of these systems is easier than the developement of a voting system. The reason for that for example banking transactions are made daily and a voting is only once in two years.
