The woman in the presentation said, that it's doubtful if computers are better for elections than human. The first problem is the fact, that many people don't use the computer all the time so they may have difficulties when they have to vote with them. This ends in trouble and in wrong votes. An other problem is the program. When people write these programs it's not shure that they make no mistakes. These mistakes can lead to errors and the errors to thousand of miscounted votes. And such a huge recount would be impossible. Similar systems are akready used in the bank, but they are used daily and are controlled, not like the voting system.

In the text is written something different. There is written that the current voting system is inefficient what leads to an inaccurate counting of votes. But the woman said that that the computerized system can also lead to mistakes like those. The list with all the names whrere people have to find the name of the candidate are so long that people can miss the right name and do wrong votes. The "toch screen based" computers help to make the voting easier. The people only have to touch the candidate's name. The computers also do not make mistakes when they count the votes. The can prevent the long and expensive recounts. The woman said something different: When the computers make mistakes a recount is impossible because there are to many wrong votes. In general the woman used to say that the computers may lead to errors in the text is written the oppsite.
