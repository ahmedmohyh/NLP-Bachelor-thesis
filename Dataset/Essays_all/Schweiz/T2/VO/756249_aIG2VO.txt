The main problem of the old voting systems is, that it is too time consuming and difficult to count all the votes without making major mistakes. Another issue in this system is that it can be quite challenching to vote for the right candidate, if for example your eyesight is too poor to see the names on the ballot properly. Shifting to the new system of election using computer based voting machines would make the whole thing much easier and more secure, because human failure could be decreased quite effectively. With the very easy to use touchscreen technology, also individuals with slight injuries could vote properly. But this new system also brings its problems with it. Many people aren't used to computers because they're not digital natives, or because they just can't afford a computer on their own. The voting machines will still be programmed by human beings, so the problem with human failure wouldn't just be washed away. It may even be worse, though the consequences of a mistake would be much more significant.
