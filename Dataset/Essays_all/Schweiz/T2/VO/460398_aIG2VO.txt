In the presentation, the speaker is clearly againt the computerised voting system. She says that it may seem easy to use, but only for people who are used to computers and know how to use them. However, there are many people who can't use computers, can't afford them or might just cast a wrong vote based on their fear of modern technology. 
This statement strongly contradicts the text above. In this text it is written that computerised voting - machines would have easy to use touch screen technology, making it a breeze for anyone to use. It would also allow voters to magnify the name in order to be able to read it easier. This way mistakes are  not as possible. 

In the presentation it is also mentioned that while mistakes are possible with the traditional voting system, it is still much better than if a mistake were to happen with the computers. Another point is that computers are also man- made, which is prone or at least very likely to create a mistake. With a computer thousands of votes could be miscounted and that could lead to big problems. Whereas with traditional voting systems, have been used a lot and have constantly been improved until they got better and less mistakes were possible. The last point mentioned in the presentation is also that, in the U.S.A. votes are held every 2 years nationally and at most twice per year in smaller areas, which means that voting isn't that much of a hassle as it is not even held that often.

However, the text above contradicts many of these points, as it supports the computerised voting machines. The text believes that when people count the votes, mistakes are inevitable and more possible, which then lead to a recount of the millions of votes, which have been cast. It is believed that the computerised machines would remove this human error and voting would be much quicker. Also, since computers are trusted in everyday life with much more important things, such as banking, then they can be trusted for voting.
