As is apparent through the divisive opinions, the concept of a new and more modern voting system is a very controversial topic. 

The opinion of the lecturer is quite clear: Computers will not make the voting system better. She argues that people which do not use computers often or cannot afford them might make mistakes or could be discouraged from voting alltogether. The text states, however, that computers can be used by everyone through an easy-to-use touch-screen technology which even allows to magnify the names of the candidates for easier viewing, thus preventing voters on paper to tick the wrong name as a consequence of poor eyesight.

While the text depicts computers as far more accurate and efficient than humans when talking about counting the votes, the lecturer says that computers will make mistakes as well, because they are also made by humans. Furthermore, according to her a mistake in the computer program could cause a lot more damage than some people accidentally counting a few votes wrong. She illustrates her argument with banking and communication programs, they also had many mistakes in the beginning and had to be improved over the years. Voting systems are, however, only used nationally once every two years, thereby making it very difficult to refine the system fast and opening the possibility of grave mistakes. The text on the other hand states that people already entrust computers with highly sensitive information. As a consequence, it would not be so far out of reach to trust computer programs to count the votes as well.

All in all, the two sources present two differing views on the topic. While the lecturer does not belive computers to be more accurate than humans, the text clearly states the possible advantages of modernized voting systems.
