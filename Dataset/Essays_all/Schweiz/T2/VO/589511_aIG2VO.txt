The lecturer strongly advised not to implement a computer in the voting system. She said that since computers are programmed by humans, the same errors would occur but would exeed the impact of a mistake made by a counting human.


Back to what i was talking about before. Planet earth is wonderful. We are one of few planets to have developed live. How amazing's that? Tell you what being alive is terrific. All the cool things you can do. For example participate in world wars, slaughter the entire native american population. You see live as it is is not fair. It's called natural selection. Although one must say that humans cheated a little. They discovered blades and guns. And even today they continue to abuse their power. Humans have reached the top of the evolutionary chain some might say, but i diagress. We are lower tier animals. Our only andvantage is our brain. But in direct contact most animals can kill us. We humans really only have our brain, some animals developped a way of sencing electromagnetic signals sent when your brain does stuff. Others are amazing hunters ore have an actual invisibility cloak. Now sadly enough we don't have that. But our brain is so amazing that we didn't need "evolution" anymore. We took matters in our own hands. We constructed whatever we desired most. Nightvision, flight, atomic bombs, and those are just a few examples.
Alriht I think thats enough gibbergabber about non-necessary stuff. I will shut up now
