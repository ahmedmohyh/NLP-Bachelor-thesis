In the start of the lecture it is critisised that people that are not used to computers would either be scared off the voting or they would make a mistake with voting if the voting was set to happen on a computer. With this argument they counter the argument of the text, which complains about the difficulty of finding the right candidate on the ballot for people with poor eyesight. Then the lecture picked up a part of the text, where it is written that humans make mistakes. The lecturer explains that if humans make mistakes counting the votes they also make mistakes programming the voting computers. That could lead to even bigger amounts of miscounted votes or even delete votes.
And as there are no traces of a lost vote it will be hard to retrieve it. Lastly the lecturer adds, that even if we do use advanced modern technology in our daily lives, it doesn't mean the technologies were perfect from the start. The technologies needed years and many improvements to get where they are today. With this he explains why people say its too risky to implement complicated voting technologie for such an important thing, which also happens to happen very rarely.
