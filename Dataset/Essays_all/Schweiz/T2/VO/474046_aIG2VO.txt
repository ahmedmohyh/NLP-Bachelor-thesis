In the text it talks about the inefficiency about the ballots. That it can be easily manipulated. Many Voters who are poor with eyesight can easily mark the wrong name, because of the large sheet of paper with many names. With a computerprogramm it says, that it's much easier: you only have to touch the candidate's name on the screen. Another big problem is the counting. While the computer can count them in one go, old voting systems take much longer and it has a high possibility, that someone counts wrong, so they have to count twice. But that takes way to long and it's also very expensive. They belive that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error.
 
In the audio they say the complete opposite because the systems are made from humans so it is impossible to make no errors. With programms they use for banking, it's differet because it is used daily, so if there is an error they can change it quickly becuase of the daily using. Voting on the other hand is only used twice a year, so it is harder to develop confidence, maybe even impossible for older people who doesn't use technology. They also talk about, that it's doubtful, if computers are better. For many people it's not even affordable, so they can't vote. Others don't use it daily, so they have problems understanding the programm and have a fear of technology.
