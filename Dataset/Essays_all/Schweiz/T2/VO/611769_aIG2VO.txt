In the presentation they don't trust the system of computer voting. It is only for person easily to vote with a computer system who use the computer every day or often. But their are many people who can't afford a computer or who don't know how they have to use a computer. So this is one argument to not do the voting on computer.

An other reason why the voting shoulnd't be on computer is that their can be big mistakes in the programm which the people have done. So it can follow a big miss counted of the votes and this would be a hard problem. This problem is bigger than when one officer makes a faulth by selceting and recording the votes.

It is true that we trust the computers with important things like in banking transactions but this systems or others have at the begining hardly problems. They didn't work flavely. And this is not usefull, because at some states you have to vote twice time in the year. So they coudln't take the responsibility of much big faulths. The system couldn't even work.
