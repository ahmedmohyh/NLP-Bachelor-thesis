The american woman (lets call her Sarah) who was giving us the lecture explained how it was doubtful that computer could do a better job at registering and counting votes than the "good old-fashioned" way. Sarah strongly believes the new voting system would only cause more problems. 
She explains that a huge problem is that the people who don't know how to use technology well, couldn't utilize these simle voting computers. This would lead to people registering their votes wrong on computers and maybe even discouraged voters who wouldn't even bother voting because of the computer system. I think the text and woman are mostly talking about old people. The text thinks they register wrong votes beacause the ballot is so crowded and written in small font wehre as Sarah claims these people might not be able to use a simple touch-screen computer. The woman continues her fight against the computers by agreeing that officials could make a few mistakes but the number of mistakes is relatively low. On the other hand, if a computer makes a mistake it could mess up 1000s of votes at once. 
The text argues that computers reliabley complete bank transfers and many other extremley tedious and complicated tasks. This means a computer for voting sould be able to work without problems. Sarah has a counterargument here. She claims that online banking is done everyday where as voting only once every two years. At first, these banking computers also made many mistakes and had to be updated and improved over time, knowledge is collected. Sarah thinks this knowledge doesn't exist for voting computers and there would be huge failures with catostrphical effects.
