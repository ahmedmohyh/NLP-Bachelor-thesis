The speaker talked about the problems of different voting systems. The disadvantages of the traditional voting system are that a few people have to count thousands of ballots. What we can easily see is that for shure there will be made some mistakes. But as the speaker says, it is not clear that computers does mot make any mistakes at all. Especially because people had invented computers. And the programmes which are used for the computerised voting had been invented by human too. But the diffrence is that programmes are making a mistake there are thousands of ballots which are wrong, so to say: there are thousands of mistakes not only a few mistakes which are caused by humans in the traditional voting.
