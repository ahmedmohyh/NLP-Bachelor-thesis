What is better using the new technique a computer program or the traditional system for voting? That is the topic in those two textes. 
A human can make mistake which is problematic during the counting of the votes, computers are much more accurate and a recount can cost 1000 of dollar. But dont forget that a computer system is made by a human and as we know we can make faults, a fault in a program is much heavier and dramatical it can affect the result by 1000 votes. 
An other point was which is easier to handle. For people with poor eyesight is the computer system better they can magnify the name. But what is with those who arent used to computers, they can get discouraged and dont want to vote anymore. A other thing is that some people cant afford a computer. But on the other hand the computer system is quicker in cunting the millions of votes. They discuss about the trust in machines aswell. The technology needed years of development to get to the point where it is now but it hardly suffisant to develop the trust in it. It s also to say that computers work in every day situation as for example banking so why shouldnt it work for voting?
