In the presentation they talked negative about a computerized voting and tried to disturb the arguments in the text above my essay. The first argument was, that a computerized voting is just easy for those people who use this art of technology. The other ones, especially elder people who are probably afraid of technology, can make mistakes in the same way they do in the ballots. And generally: Humans are doing mistakes, and a computer programm is also just made of humans, so there can exist as well some mistakes. And if theres one mistake in the computer programm, it could give a catastrophe. There exists, for example in the wolf-of-wallstreet-world, many computer-programms like for bank transactions, and they don't have faults either. But these programms are used daily! And not just once or twice a year. Plus: these programms had at the beginning as well some faults.
