The text and the audio show us two opposing statements about the voting system in the US. The author of the text thinks the current system should be replaced by a more computerized one and the speaker in the audio thinks it is better to stick with the old system. Now I will explain some of their arguments.
The critic of the current system points out, that votes can be easily miscounted today because the ballots all have to be counted by hand. A computer would be much accurater in doing this job. But the speaker thinks that problems caused by programming mistakes could be much worse than little counting mistakes and it would be possible to loose a lot of votes, because there is no physical evidence for them. 
Also, the author of the text thinks, that a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong person because people with poor eyesight can't read the small names on the ballot. But the contra-argument to this is, that there still are a lot of people who aren't good at using computers or who haven't got one at home and these people could be discouraged from voting or could vote for the wrong person because they are not used to work with a computer.
The woman on the audio also thinks, that we can't say that we are using complex computer technology every day in other parts of our lives, because programs for banking for example, are used every day and have been improved over years, whereas voting systems are only used once a year, so there are not as much opportunities to test and improve a program.
