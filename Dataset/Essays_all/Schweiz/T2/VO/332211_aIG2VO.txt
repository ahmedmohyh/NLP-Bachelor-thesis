Voting systems are a highly debated topic. Therefore unsurprisingly, there is a heated discussion going on about whether the traditional system of counting is utile anymore or if a new system should be introduced- e-voting.

In the US, traditional voting is often thought to be inefficient. Further, is accuracy is critisized, e-voting seems to be far more trustworthy. This is because in tradtiotional voting, people are keen to accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. Finding the name of the chosen candidate on a large sheet of paper with many names and mark the right one contains a big chance of error. With poor eyesight, mistakingly marking the wrong name happens often. while traditional voting system contians this source of inaccuracy, newer technology makes us able to only touch the desired candidate to record a vote. Further, another big problem gets diminished by the new system: the inaccurcy of counting. Whereas in traditional voting, officials have to go trough each vote, in the new technology, this is easily and fast done by computers.

But there are also many agrument against the introduction of this new system. For once, not everyone is used to computers- there are still many people who can not afford to buy one, therefore, how should they be able to deal with e-voting? Without any experience with the new technology, many more errors are keen to happen. Considering the fear of technology of some people, it is difficult to visualize an error-free online voting. Moreover, as humas make mistakes, programs made by humans will too. Therefore, many more, even worse mistakes will happen. As systems in banks are widely used and regurarely improved, it would be wrong to say that we simply could solve any starting problems, voting happens only about twice a year, not on a everyday basis.
