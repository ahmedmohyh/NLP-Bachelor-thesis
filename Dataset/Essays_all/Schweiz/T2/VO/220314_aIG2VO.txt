What stands to debate in the lecture and in the text, wherer to start using new technology to count votes or not change the current method and stay with counting ballots. It's been said that it would be more efficient to start using computerized voting machines so no counting mistakes would apprear. Also that maybe elderly people have trouble seeing the candidates names on the bulletins, that it might occure to them making a mark by the wrong candidate. The counting process would be faster and there wouldn't be any mistakes, because it's not being counted by hand. Plus it wouldn't be a big change, because we alreday use computerized machines in our day to day life. So it's nothing new to the society. 
What speaks against it is that especially older people might have problems with this new idea. Some maybe don't know how to use a computer, they don't know what it is and even though still might make mistakes with these circumstances. In the end it'll just be a task they would have to overcome that would't be worth it. In other words, they would e discouraged. And with the counting, yes it might go faster, but who can assure that these computers won't make a mistake? If there some trouble with the system, then it could change the number of 1000 of voters and there wouldn' be any physical record. So no recunstruction is possible. 
It's very hard to debate on because it has it's good and bad sides. Another thing to think about is, wheter or not to use it. Since America only votes once a year nationaly, and maybe every two years state-wide, if the effort is really worth it.
