It askes, what about the people who aren't used to work with the computer, they could easily be confused or demotivated to vote. Also the computer isn't perfet, the lecture suggests, if a human does a mistake the damage is small, but if a computer does one it could have way bigger impact. The lecture goes on with, that there isn't any paper backup, if the computer does a mistake, which would make a recount impossible.
