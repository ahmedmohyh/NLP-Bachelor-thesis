The critics in the text say that the old inefficient voting system should be replaced by the new technologie. The presentation complains about the misscounted votes or that the computer can`t make a physical record.

The negativ aspect of the text is that the voting on a computer is too risky. In the presentation the critics don`t like the new voting.
