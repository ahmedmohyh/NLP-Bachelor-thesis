The people who have written the text have the opinion that computerised voting would be more fairly and accurate than the current voting system, because there are happening many failours because of people who choose the wrong name on the list, because they can't see that good. Another problem, recording to the text is, that the people who count the votes can easily make mistakes, because they have to count really a lot of votes. While the autor of the text is a big fan of computervoting, the person who held the presentation sees it more critically. For exemple there are people who aren't that used of computers or can't afford one. They can easily become stressed if they now would have to vote by computer even if they aren't able. Another aspect is, that it isn't proofed if computers not also make mistakes. If they would, it would affect the whole voting much more, than little mistakes made by people.
