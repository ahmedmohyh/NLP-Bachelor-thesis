What can people do, who can't afford a comuter. They got to be in big truble. Maybe they also have some fear of technology. The question here is, if computer could do better an human? 
Of course human being make some mistakes by counting the votes but by the computers we've got the error. And when an error would happen, you got nicely more misscounts, perhaps about thousands, and this would probably be a much larger fault then a human could do. Therefore, we should give the traditional voting system much more trust in it. And finally in the state there are votings every two years, where the computer comes to action. And in the other regional ellections, the computer  may used twice in a year.Doing this only at the same time may go to an overusing, which ends by en complete collapse of the system. The gouvernement isn't ready to take this risk.
