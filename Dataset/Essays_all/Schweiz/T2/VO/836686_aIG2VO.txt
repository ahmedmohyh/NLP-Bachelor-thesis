Voting is essential for a community and a nation in order to be able to implement the wishes of the people. Therefor it needs to be correctly done and with least misakes as possible. There are two controversial ways of doing so; one way is people phyisically counting the votes but in the age of technology many people tend to think computers are more trustworthy than the human brain. 

Tradional voting can lead to many mistakes since it is very much reliant on humans and their abbility to fill out the ballot correctly and also that the people counting the votes make no mistakes. This can be a very hard task to do since there are so many names on the ballot and they can be easily mixed up. Also the people recording the vote can make many mistakes since they are dealing with thousends of ballots a day and after a long time of doing so it can be really exhausting and a decline in concentration is inevitable.

On the other hand also completly reling on computer technology can be dangerous. In our daily life technology is taking over more and more parts but the programs that we use daily are highly established and developped so the make almost no mistakes. Therefor it can be hard developing a programm that counts the votes effienctly and without errors since the US only votes every two years. Other then that one shouldn't forget that all people have to be able to vote and there are many adults that don't know how to use computers since they are not comfortable using them or don't have enough money to afford them.

Relying on technology is defintily an efficient way in counting votes but there shouldld be a recoung by humans in order to check that the computer hasn't made any severe mistakes and that there are no errors in the program. Both ways have their inefficient characteristics therefor it's hard to find a sufficient solution that is in the minds of all.
