The woman in the lecturesaid that it's verry common, that there happen mistakes with the voting system. it's difficult to count the votes absolutely right and so a solution for the problem would be, that voters don't have to write it on a paper but vote with a computer. In the text the solution with the computer isn't told. But also with computers mistakes can happen because of human mistakes. But the woman did't said anything about the problem that without the computers it's also verry common, that people cannot easily find the person they want to vote for. So the election is manipulated because people made the small mark text to the wrong name. 
Another human mistake, which the woman did't said, is that the people who have to count the votes, have to count them one by one and this takes a lot of time and also a lot of mistakes what is also manipulating the election. So there are many problmes with the old voting system but also with the voting system with a computer.
