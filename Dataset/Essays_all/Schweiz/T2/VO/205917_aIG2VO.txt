The lecture brings three arguments against the three arguments of the text. The first argument of the lecture is that many people aren't able to use computers. Many people don't even have computers at home. This will discourage many people from even voting at all. This argument goes against the firt point of the text, which is that a lot of people, especially those with bad eye-sight, make mistakes during voting.
The second argument is that computer programms are not perfect. These programms are made by humans, so they will contain human error. In case of a disfunction, many votes could be corrupted, and when the programm collapses, a recount wouldn't be possible. This point is an answer to the second argument of the text: Humans will surely miscount in some cases.
The final argument of the lecture is that eventhought we trust in digital banking transactions,as said in the final argument of the text, we cannot trust in a digital voting system. While we use other computer programms on a daily basis, the voting system would only be used twice a year. The heavily used programms get improved constantly, but it would'nt be the case with the voting system.
