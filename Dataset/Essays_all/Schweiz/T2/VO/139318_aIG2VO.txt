The current voting system will be better if we could vote by computer but only for people which use computer often and can afford it. For people which don't use computer often is hard to vote because they can easily vote the wrong person. Humain make mistake but computer can do mistake as well, we're not sure if computers are any better. Because when computer do mistake then it has a bigger problem as when humain makes mistake. Computer are used for banks and communications as well. The voting in the USA is every two years national and sometimes every years in some states. The voters can't learn how to vote with computers as fast they should.
