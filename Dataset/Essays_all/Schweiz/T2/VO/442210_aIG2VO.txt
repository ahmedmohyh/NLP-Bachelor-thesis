The text passage explained the problems with conventional ballot-based voting systems and detailed the advantages of a computer-based voting system. The recording on the other hand emphasized the problems that could be created by a computer-based voting system. The speaker in the recording, like the text passage, did admit that there are problems with the traditional system of voting, however the speaker doubted that computers would do a better job.
One main argument that the speaker used in the recording was that people who are not used to technology could have problems voting by computer and that they may even be discouraged by having to vote digitally. Where the text passage explained how a person could enter a wrong vote on a ballot paper and how making a similar mistake on a touch screen was almost impossible, the recording suggested that a wrong vote could also be given on a computer.
The other main problem the recording spoke about was the possibility of programming errors. Both the recording and the text mentioned that human officials can miscount votes, but the text passage and the speaker's opinion diverged on the possibility of an error on a computer. According to the text passage, counting errors in a computer-based system are nonexistent as the counting is done automatically. The speaker, however, explained that computer systems are also programmed by humans, which still leaves the possibility of mistakes. Also, a miscount by a computer could be much more serious than one by officials and would not necessarily be recountable. The speaker also pointed out that digital banking and communications systems, which the text used as an example for the success of technology, took lots of use and time to perfect. A voting system, only used nationally once every two years in the US, would have much less opportunity for development and would therefore be more likely to malfunction.
