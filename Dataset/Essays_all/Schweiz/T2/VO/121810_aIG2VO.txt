The text claims that the computerized system is easier to use, because people with poor eyesight or those who accidently marked the wrong candidate will have it easier with a touchscreen and a zoom function to see the candidates name that they would like to vote for better. The first argument given, is that if the voting system is computerized it would definitly be easier for people who are used to using computers on a daily basis. But what about the people that aren't? Those who can't afford computers or simply don't trust the new technology. They couldn't vote or wouldn't be willing to vote so their voices would be lost. 

Secondly, it is stated in the text that the officials that count the votes have made multiple mistakes during many elections. They have to count one by one and in that situation a human error can occure any time. The second argument says that the computer is made by humans too. If an error on a computer occures it's worse. The officials might miss one or two votes, but if a computer fails to count, there could be thousands of votes lost and they can't just start all over again.

Finally, the critics claim that the using the computer is to risky and complicated but the text states that we trust our computers also with online banking and communication of sensitive and secret information. So why not use it for the elections? The opposite side answers this question that the elections are once nationwide but also in local states and that the computer technology would be fairly new for that matter.
