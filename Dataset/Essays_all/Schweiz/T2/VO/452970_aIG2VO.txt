An election can be miscounted easily if you use the traditional way. There are several problems. The first one is, because of the sheets. It's a sheet with a lot of names. People with poor eyesight or people who aren't concentrated enough can easily mark the wrong box which is next to the name. With an computer which you can control with a touchscreen you can vote easily. The viewing isn't hard anymore.

The problem is computers aren't that easy to use. For people who don't have to do much with the technology especially older people haven't enough knowledge and the basic to use a computer. It is even harder for them. 

Another problem is the counting. Yes humans can make faults if they need to count all the votes one by one because humans can't be concentrated the whole time and perhaps they need to count another time. But computer algorhythm are made by humans and humans make faults. If there is a fault it can be that thousands of votes are miscounted. Computers can't suspect if there is an error but humans can. You can only save time and money with the computer method but it isn't saver. Computers have to be improved again and again if it shouldn't make any faults.
