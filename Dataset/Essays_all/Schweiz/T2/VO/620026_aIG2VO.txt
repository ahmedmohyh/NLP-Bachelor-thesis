In the audio it is argued that the traditional voting system is still more reliable than a modern one, while the text explains how a computer voting system could improve the process.
In the lecture, the man elaborates, that for people who are not used to technology it might be more difficult and more likely to lead to mistakes, to vote over a computer. However, as the text explains, is voting by hand also problematic, since there is a huge list of names and you only have to put one little mark behind the right name, for people who experience trouble with seeing, a mistake is easily made.
The text raises concerns about the difficulty of counting all the votes by hand, mistakes are usual. However, such circumstance make a recount mandatory, which takes a lot of time. While the audio doesn't argue with the truth of this point, it is mentioned that computer programms are not flawless either and if they make a mistake, it is propably bigger than a mistake directly caused by humans. Critics of the traditional system say, that we long since changed on a computer for banking and it works good. However, the lecturer points out, how modern banking systems are used frequently and have gone through a long phase of improvements. In contrary, the voting system is only used once a year, if not less.
