The text and the recording are about the voting systems in the United States.
It says, that the current voting system is innefficiant an it leads to incorrect counting of the votes. Critics want the current system to be replaced by a different and better computersystem. Apparently most of the faults are made by the elctiors who accidently vote for the fals person. So critics are convinced, that a voting systems on the computer would be easyer and the voter only has to touch the candidates nam on the screen instead of marking it on a long list.
Another problem is, that the countings are made by human, and unfortunately alot of human errors can exist. People have to count the votes one by one and the have to deal with alot of ballots, the ppossibility that some of them get lost is immense and it would lead to an incorrect election.
Even if a lot of people preferd the computer countings you can also find some people which are against it.
The problem is, that we don't know if the computers do bette. They can have a breakdown and if this happens all the votes on it get lost. We don't even know if the computer mantains all the data or if some of it gets lost. Another problem with the computer is: People who are used to them will not have any problem to vote with it, but what about the peolpe who don't have a computer at home? Where should they go to vote? And people who don't understand the system what should they do? 
It is not said which of those voting systemy is better, both of them have theire good and their bad sides.
