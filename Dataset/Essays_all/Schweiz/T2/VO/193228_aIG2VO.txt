The text tells us about some problems with the traditional voting: Making a small mark next to the name on a large paper. They mentioned that it is easy to vote accidentally for the wrong candidate because of poor eyesight. Another problem is that people have to count all the votes on the other side a computer makes this automatically and computers also don't make errors. Computerized voting is a good alternative. 

In the presentation, it is also said that computerized voting is better and don't cause any errors. They say that nowadays we use computers everyday and we rely on them. But the presenter also said some disadvantages of using computerized system for voting. For people who are secure with using computers it is easy to vote but for people who can't afford a computer or aren't commune with computers it is hard to vote. Especially for elderly people it isn't easy to vote because they didn't grow up with computers and some of them might have a fear of technology.

Both,the text and the presentation tells, us to go with the time and try to use computerized voting because it is our future. We have to give it a chance, they said.
