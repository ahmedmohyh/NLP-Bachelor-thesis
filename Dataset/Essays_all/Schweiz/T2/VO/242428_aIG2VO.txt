The lecture is about the problems and dangers caused by a digital voting system. The first point is that a computerized voting system would be hard to use or even discouraging for people that are not used to computers and technology. These people would accidentaly vote for someone else or would not vote at all. In contrast, the article claims that easy-to-use technology would make voting much easier and that voting with a sheet of paper leads to many mistakes. Both the lecture and the article agree that there will be mistakes, but both claim that the other system would cause more mistakes. The second point in the article is that humans need to count the votes by hand in the current system which will inevitably lead to mistakes, sometimes requiring expensive recounts. The lecture states that altough humans make mistakes, the computers counting the votes are programmed by humans. Errors caused by programming failures are also much harder to fix than a simple recount.
The third point of the article is about the risk of implementing a digitalized voting system. It states that the risk cannot be very high since we use the same technology for delicate transactions in banking. The lecture states that these systems have been developed over a long time period which is not true for voting.
