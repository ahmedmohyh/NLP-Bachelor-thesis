In the text, the writer is for using computerized systems in voting systems and in the listening part, the woman is against it. Each of them has three arguments, which I'm going to emphazise in this essay. 

Firstly, the voting system now is inefficient. The wrong candidate could be easily elected, because of the many names on the paper. On the other hand, a coputerized systems could be a problem for those, who can't use a computer or don't have one. 
Furthermore, it is sure that people make mistakes on counting the votes because they have many ballots. A contrast to that is that the computers make also mistakes, since it is a work of a human. In addition, by using a computerized system, it is likely for ballots to be removed.
Finally, the writer says, governments trust other coputer systems, such as bank systems. But the issue here is, that these systems are used every day and they are improved. The difference here is, that votings are maybe once a year.
