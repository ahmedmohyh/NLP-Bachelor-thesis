These two texts revolve around the topic of computerizing the voting system in the USA. They represent two completely different opinions on the matter though. 
The opinion that is represented in the text is that the entire voting system should be changed to voting on computers. Their points are that humans make errors, which would couse inaccuracy in the counting of the votes. This might be a big problem if the result is very close. Computers don't make such mistakes. It also prevents people from casting the wrong vote because the ballots are very confusing and people with poor eyesight might misread something. According to the text those problems would all be fixed, if the voting system was simply computerized.
The other opinion doesn't agree with those points at all. They doubt that a computer would be better because many people, especially the older generation, isn't used to computers and would make more mistakes because of that. They say it would be very easy to cast a wrong vote. They also don't agree on the point that less mistakes would occur. They say that computers are programmed by humans, which obviously make mistakes. Those mistakes would actually be more harmfull because a mistake in the program could possibly miss thousands of votes and becaouse there are no physical votes it would be impossible to recount. They even talk about a possible counter argument that says that we also use computerized banking systems, in which we trust. They say that this system only works because it is used so frequently and perfected over time. The voting system on the other hand would only be used rarely and even only one single mistake could lead to completely wrong results.
