In the auadio-record the arguments claim that compureized voting systemns would not be more efficient than the traditional voting. Three major arguments are presented during the audio: first of all some people may nor be able to afford the required items for the computerized system. There are many people who are not familiar with new technology and who would have to deal with fear and insecurity because of the new system.
