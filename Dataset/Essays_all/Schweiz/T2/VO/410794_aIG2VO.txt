In the text we're told that critics say that current voting systems used in the USA are inefficient. Some People accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because they have to finde the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper and if they have poor eyesight they easily do mistakes. Another problem with the traditional voting system is that it takes a long time to count all the votes and they could easily make mistakes. It would be a long and eypensive proces to correct these mistakes. In the text, they mentionthat these problems could be solved by computerized systems. The voting could be done quickly and without human error. 

On the other hand, in the lecture, we are told that the computerized system could be easier but this system wouldn't be good for people who have problems to understand this system and not everyone can afford to buy a computer. So it would be difficult for them to participate at the voting. In the lecture the person aggrees that with the traditional voting system many mistakes could be made by humans but the computers could make some mistakes too. The persone thinks that with the computer systems, the mistakes will get biger and it would be more difficult to correct it. The traditional system had to be improved many times and thats why it should be a good system.
