The text says that for people with poor eyesight it is easy to mark the wrong name and vote for the wrong candidate because there are so many names on one sheet of paper. Because of this it should be easier only having to touch at the name of the preferred candidate and give him a vote. In the listening exercise it was said that is easy for thoose who work with computers. But there are also persons who are not used to computers because of different reasons like for example they do not have enough money to buy a computer. For thoose people voting on computer is not easy.It is hard because they might vote not on purpose for all the candidates.
In the text it is said that it is a big problem that people count all the votes and that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error. But I heard in the listening that the programmes of the computers might not make mistakes but the computers are programmed by humans so it is possible that the programmes have a faults and count thousands of votes worng.
The text believes that we should trust computerized votes because we use computer technology also for banking transactions and other important stuff. So we should trust the computer also in counting votes. The listening said that we do not yet have the confidence that the computer makes no mistakes. They said that it is important to improof and develop the computer systems.
