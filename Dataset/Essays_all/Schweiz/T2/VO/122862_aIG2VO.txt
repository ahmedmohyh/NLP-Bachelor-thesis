The traditional voting got criticized a lot of times.Do we have to change anything and when what?
The only option would be to use computerized voting technology. But is it truly better? No the woman said during her presentation. She is doubtful of computerized voting . For instance people who can't afford a computer or don't use them will have more problems with the new system. So the risk is that they cast the wrong vote.
Different from the text was the argument over the counting of the votes.On the one hand the writer of the text said that it may be a risk to count every vote one by one so you will miscount some votes for sure on the other hand the woman mentionned that computers are programmed by humans so they won't be a 100% correct. In fact when there is a problem the situation will be even worse than one with human vote counters. With computers the governement is not able to recount the votes. So the text and the speech of the woman are clearly different in almost every case but the most important one. The text says it is too risky to implement a new voting technology and the woman would agrre with this. She compared it with a system in a bank for example where it took them years to develop it to what it is now. The thing is the government doesn't have years they have one try and everything must work like it should so it will be too risky to change anything.
