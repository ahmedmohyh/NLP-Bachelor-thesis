In this speach about voting, the idea of computarized voting is highly critiziced. Despite the human error during a contested count of ballots, the computer hasn't only good sides. First of all, it is programmed by humans, so the human error still exists. Another point is the fact that the people who are not used to technology could make some mistakes or they could even not be voting because of their fear of technology. 
In contrast to this, the text says, that the human error with the old voting system is much higher than with computarized voting. After all, the banking transactions and the communication of highly sensitive informations work as well with technology, so why would it be different with the voting system?
