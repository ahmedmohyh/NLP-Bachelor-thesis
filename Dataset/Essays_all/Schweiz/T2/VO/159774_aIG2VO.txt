Old people, who are not used to this new technology, will have serious problems to vote. Or they wont even vote anymore. On the other hand the older generation has a worse eyesight and it's possible they mark the wrong person on the small voting paper. With the computer, it's easy to zoom in and read the names correctly.
An other fraction of the society will face even more problems, the ones who cannot afford a computer. They have the right to vote too, but they aren't able to.
Every two years there are votings in the USA(except the small ones). The big change in adminstration and counting is not worth it for something once every two years.
The big question is, do computers really make less mistakes? If he does one, it will be difficult to correct the fault. It is not possible to simply recount the stack. On the other hand human errors happen more often. While counting you can easily miss a vote or mistype something.
