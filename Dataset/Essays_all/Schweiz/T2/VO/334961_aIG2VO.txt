The Lecture is against de introduction of computervoting. The lecturer sais that it isn't easy for everyone to vote on a computer because they might not own one or they might be experienced enough to use on effectivly.
These statements contredict the text. The text states that the program will bevery easy to use for everyone and help people with bad eyesight to vote because they can zoom in on the screen in order to read the name of the candidate they wish to vote.
It is said in the lecture that the computer program will be to unreliable to introduce in the near future due to incufficiant testing in the real world. Evanthogh there are many highly reliable programs similar to this voting program already in use, the lecturer doesn't trust that it is a good idea to replace manpower with technology. 
She thinks that it is far easier to do a recount using people than using a computer program. Because the votes don't exist in a physical form in the virtual world, they'r deleted from existance if some sort of error happens, which could end in a disaster.
The lecturer is incredably subborn and cannot see that computers and robots and stuff are the future and she's somehow managed to convince her minions of her opinion in the lecture that she gave. We don't wand this sort of thinking to dominate the future. What if robots will save your life in the future?
