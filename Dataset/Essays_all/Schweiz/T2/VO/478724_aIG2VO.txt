In the presentation it says, that cumputers can't be trusted because if there's a error in the system or program it could lead to a miscount or even worse to a loss of votes. Another problem is, that people who aren't used to computers may be scared to vote and stop voting or don't because they don't understand the procedure of voting on the computer. Even if the computers got far more improved, the errors that they would make would be far more serious then the errors made by the people who count the votes. The text on the other hand tells us the opposite. It says, that old and people with bad eyesight  often misvote cause there are a lot of names on a large sheet and mark the wrong name. The computer on the other hand are simple and you only have to press on the name of the canditate to vote for him and there is also a magnifing button for the people with bad eyesight. Also the mistakes that are made by humans wouldn't happen and the machine can detect when a error is made by a person. I could summarise this text by saying that the lecture says that we can't trust computers and the text says that we can't trust the people. It's a matter if we want to trust the machines (even if we make them) or the people.
