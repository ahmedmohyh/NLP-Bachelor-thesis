The subject that is being discussed is the Voting system in the US. It is being discussed if the traditional voting system should be replaced by an computerized voting system. The pros of a computerized system are that the current voting system is insufficient. There are many misscounts int the traditional system, because the votes have to be counted by people. Sometimes people vote for the wrong candidate because they have to find their names on a large sheet of paper and make a small mark next to it. With the new voting system, they only have to touch the candidate`s name. In addition to that, technology gets better and better and if people can trust  banking transactions, they can trust the computerized system as well. The cons are that people who do not use computers or people who can`t afford a computer can`t vote. They would make mistakes because they aren`tused to using a computer or they wouldn`t vote at all because they can`t afford one. Of course there can be mistakes in the computerized system as well. That clead to misscounted votes or even uncounted votes. Only because people are trusting banking transactions doesn`t mean that they have to trust the new voting system. Banking Transactions are a daily used thing. And even banking transactions had to be improved! But improving the computerized voting system is difficult because the elections are only once every two years. That makes it difficult to build trust.
