In both extracts they talk about traditional and computerized voting systems. In the text it says that the traditional voting system should be replaced by a computerized one. Pros can be that people would less often accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because on the ballot people with poor eyesight often marked the wrong name. Cons, as heard in the presentation, can be that people who aren't used to computers, like the elderly, would struggle with the technology and might not even vote because of fear of technology. Also mentioned are human errors that can lead to inaccurate counting of votes. But computers are made by humans and therefore can have errors as well. Another point against computerized voting systems is that you can't make a recount because there is nothing physically available to recount. You would have to make everyone who voted come back and vote again.
