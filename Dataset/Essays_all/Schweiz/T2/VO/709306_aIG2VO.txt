The voting System is the United states is considered as inefficient and as leading to miscounts. Critics propose a computerized voting system.

They say that the computerized voting system would be beneficial for people with poor eyesight. There are often wrong names marked, because the people can't properly read the paper. The comupterized system would allow a magnifying option to prohibit that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. 

The opponents' argument is, that voting on those voting machines creates even more errors. The people who aren't familiar with using computers, can't use those machines. So it would mean a loss of voters.

But the counting system of today id highly inefficient. All ballots have to be counted one by one and there happen a lot of human errors. The computers can count way faster and way more accurate.

On the  other hand, it is said, that those computers have human errors as well. The programs are programmed by humans, so if there is a fault in the program, the damage would be even worse. And there is no physical record, so there are no recounts possible.

Although, nowadays the government uses a lot of other complex computer technoligy. For instance, banking transactions are made by computer programs.

However, the opponents say, that those banking programs work flawlessly, because they are used daily. Votings are only twice a year, so it lacks of reliabiliy.
