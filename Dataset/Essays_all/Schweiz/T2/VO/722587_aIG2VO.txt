Critics say that voting systems in United States are inefficient. If a human discount an election it could damaging.  Some pf them critics would like to replace them with more efficient computerized voting systems. In fact it is easier to vote on a computre than to write the name on a sheet of paper. Because of the easy-to-use-touch makes more easier to vote for the right candidate. A lot of people would probably write the wrong name. Other good reasen why critics want to replace the old voting system is that with computre system the votes would be counting more quickly and exactly than even before. Lot of human who should count the votes can make an small mistake which would have big  influence at the end. Otherwise an computrized voting systems could have also an error mistake which I think could be worse than a miscountig by a human. 

Finally they are a lot of arguments to replace the voting system or not. Some people does never use an computer and for some it would be much easier to vote on a computer. Furthermore people make mistakes by counting the votes but computerized system could make aswell mistake. Today humans are more based on technology and this is the reason why critics would replace the voting system. The voting process would be faster than even before. But finally it is risky to trust in voting on a computer.
