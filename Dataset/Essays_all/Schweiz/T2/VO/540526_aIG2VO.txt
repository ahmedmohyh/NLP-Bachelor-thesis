In comparison wit the text the arguments in the presentation are based on a luck of confidence for an electric voting system. They say that old humen may be anxious because they are not used to computers. That's why they may cass the wrong vote. Also it is important to see that computers are controlled by human beings. If they put one error in the system, it can affect thousand votes instead of one. This disapproavel is not shown in the text. They tend to think that a computer is even easier to ellect with, because you can magnify the words and names bigger if  needed.  In comparison to the papers where the names are written very small and it gets unclearly where you have to put your mark, it is rarely to make a mistake. Also a computer can count the votes faster and make less mistakes.
As we know every electric system like banking transactions etc, was first proved and proved over and over again. That's how we learned to trust them. But an electric vote machine in the united states is only being used once every two years. That's why it gets very difficult to test it.
But in the text they say, that as we know we also communicate highly sensitive information on our phone, and it is true that we trust banking transactions. They think that this is the point, for us to trust also electric vote systems.
