The current voting system used in the United States does have some issues. It is not efficient and trustworthy. People with poor eyesight can mark the wrong name and vote for the wrong candiate. But computer programms are not that easy as well. People who are not used to the computer, can't affor a computer or can't handle it might be disscouraged to vote. 
The written text passaged explains how inaccurate the traditional way of voting is. Most of the errors happening by the traditional way are human made. But the problem with computer voting is more or less the same. It is programmed by humans. If there is a mistake, all of the votes are affected not only one. 
While the text passage explains how the old voting system rely on people to count the votes. If there is a mistake they have to be recounted. The computer counts all the votes automaticlly, but, as in the listing part was mentioned, if there is an error while counting all the votes, all the datas are lost and it can't be recounted.
The text passage arrgues with the fact, that people trust other complex computer technology such as banking transactions every day. The listing sees exactly in this the problem. Voting is not used everyday. There is only oncce every two year a national voting in the USA and only up to twice a year in smaller location elections.
