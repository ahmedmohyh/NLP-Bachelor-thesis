I think that all results of every nation should be counted by humen brains and not with computers. How often do we hear from mistakes or corruption in the counting of votes for the presidental fight.
But its not a problem of the systems, how we count votes. When we count by humans, coruption is a problem and when we count with computer, there are hakers, who admit false votes. So you can see, it doesent matter how we count the vote, it will have people which fault the count every time.
The END
