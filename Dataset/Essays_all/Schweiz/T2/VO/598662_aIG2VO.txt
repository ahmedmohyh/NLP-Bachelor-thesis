In the lecture they said that the traditional voting system may has its fault but the computorised voting will not make it any better. The contras in traditional voting contain the human errors and that people may mark the wrong person on the election sheet. Computorised voting is even worse, because there are still a lot of people out there that are not familiar with computers. They fear to vote because they fear the electronic world. Furthermore we know that computers are programmed by humans and if there is an error in the program (caused by a human) it is thousand times worse than a counting mistake caused by a human, because a computer system is not capable to recount the result, humans are.

Those arguments are contradicting to those from the text in so far they say that a new system will not contain any adventages. The text says that the old system should be replaced because of human errors by counting votes. Another argument they line up is the wrong touch you probably could make by voting or that you set your mark on the election sheet behind the wrong name caused by a poor eyesight of some people. They say that the possibility of human errors could be removed by the computer system; that this system is way faster and prevents long and expensive recounts.
They trust machines more than humans.
