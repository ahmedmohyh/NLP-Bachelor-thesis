In the first part of the text it is said that miscounts, which can happen in the currently used system can be really damaging, especially if an election is closley contested. This old system should be replaced by a computer system. But the lecture presentator is convinced that some wrongly counted votes are less damaging then a computer with a not properly working system that may lead to tousands of wrongly counted votes. 
Furthermore the text says that people can accidentaly vote for a wrong candidate because they can't see the names. But the presentator says that using a computer may be easier for those who are used to technology, but those who have not a lot to do with it will again have trouble voting. They might even skip on voting because of fear of technologie.
In the last paragraph the text is saying that without trying a new technologie we will not be able to know if we can trust it. It says that banking transactions for excamlpe are made also on computers, therefore we lay a lot of trust in technology. 
Here the presentator says that also in banking transactions a lot of time had to be invested to make it work properly. As this technologie is used daily and havily it was possible to invent it and make it work without creating a big damage in the beginning when it's not working properly. But elections are much rarer and would not be able to develope as fast as for example the banking transactions could.
