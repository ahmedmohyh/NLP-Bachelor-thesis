Voting used to be a very simple process. You raised your hand for the canditate you wanted to vote for and someone counted the votes. Actually we have to face some problems. The population has grown fast, so it is almost impossible to "count hands". People have to mark the canditates on a sheet full of names. Especially for older people this is very challanging, because they have poor eyesight, it can happend that they vote vor the wrong candidate! 
The solution could be computerized voting. But critics say not every person can afford a computer and not the whole population knows how to handle a computer. They even go further and say it is possible that the program can not count the votes propperly. To me this is not realistic at all, it is more likely that someone hacks into the system and manipulates the results/the votes. From my point of view I have to say if it actually is a problem, that the counters make a huge amount of mistakes by not counting correctly, you have to change something!
