Voting system 
The voting system of the United States is heavily discussed lately. Critics claim that the current voting system is inefficient and leads to inaccurate voting results. The people that count all the votes make surely mistakes, but as  it's been said in the audio presentation computer programms are made from humans. The damage a deffect computer programm causes is worse than the few miscounts of people that count them, because it can happen that thousants of votes get lost if a programm is defect and you can't get them back. In the written text it says that some voters have issues to find their candidate they've choosen to vote because of the long list of name and poor eyesight. This leads often to an accidentally wrong vote, towards an other candidate. Computersized voting could solve this problem with its ease-to-use touchscreen. But in the Audio it was said that computersized voting isn't a good option for everyone because some can't afford a computer or aren't used to it.
