Computer voting might be easier than traditional voting for some people, but it might as well be more complicated to others. There are certainly some people that are just not used to computers or are not even able to afford one. Therefore, they could be easily discouraged of voting. Even tough the computerized voting machines have a touchscreen that is easy to use, it can't be said for sure that it is easier to vote. 

Such computerized machines are programmed by human beings, which means that human errors might as well occur in those programmes as they do in traditional votings. If an error happens to appear in a programme, the consequences might be way heavier than they are in traditional voting systems. Therefore the possibility of human errors can not be completely removed, even though this is suggested in the text. 

Nevertheless, if this system of computerized voting machines is given a try nationwide, it must be improved from time to time- it is not possible that it can work perfectly without experience since the beginning. Even banking transactions have gone through improvements in case to gradually gain the accuracy of their purpose and to be wholly trusted by the people.
