In the United States, There is going on a big discussion about whether one should replace the traditional voting systems with computerized ones. The speaker then then says that traditional voting systems may have potential to cause some problems, but it's not that computer systems would increase the reliability of the results. Yes, some people are used to computerized devices, but there is also a large group of people in the USA which can't afford a computer. People who aren't used to computers might be afraid to vote because the can't figure out how to use the device. Furthermore it is also possible, that computers make mistakes whilst counting, just like humans. Computers were designed by humans are equally threatened by errors. The existing traditional system has been improved for many years and is much more efficient.
