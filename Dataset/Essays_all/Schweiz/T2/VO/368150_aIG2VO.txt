Should we rather use computerized voting systems or not?
Critics say, that computerized voting is too complicate for people that aren`t used to computers. Another point is, that computerized voting systems can also make mistakes because the are also just programmed by humans. These could influence far worse on elections. Seriously, how hard is it to programm a voting algorithm?
On the other hand people accidentaly vote for the wrong candidate because they have poor eyesight. In this case, they could also just buy glasses or a magnifier and more inportant: Take voting more serious. Then they wouldn`t miss anything. Another problem is, that they rely on people counting the votes. It`s easy to miss one vote and that leads to inaccuracy.
Both systems have weak points and benefits. Why can`t people not just vote how they want?
