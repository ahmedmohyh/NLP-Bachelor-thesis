In the lecture the woman said that using computers for voting won't make anything better. People who can't afford a computer or don't use computers at home or even have fear of technology are not used to vote on an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. That would cause problems which the author of the text overlooked. For the author of the text these problems are not mentioned. 
The woman also doubted the reliability of computers and their mistakes.  A computer won't make mistakes but the person who programmes it could. If that's the case thousands of votes would not be registered. 
The text mentioned the removement of the possibility of human error with computerized systems. But the problem is that the person who programmes it is a human being, which means there is a possibility of human error in programming.
The woman is not sure if computers would make elections more accurate. A vote that got lost in the computer doesn't exist physicly anymore. 
The author of the text thinks that we use complex computer technology every day for example in banking transactions. The woman in the lecture thinks that using technology for voting is a different thing. In the beginning these complex computer technology had to be developed and had mistakes which now are fixed. We use these every day which is the reason for the improvement of these programms. The problem is that US citizens vote once all two years. Time for developpement isn't here. Programms have to be ready and without mistakes from the beginning.
