The conflict about the way of voting is heavily discused in the United States. Some want to change the elction mode from the paper-version to a digital one. They state that the cumputerized voting would be much more efficient in camparison to votning by paper. Human errors wouldn't exist any more because of the exact work of the computer. The encounters of this idea think otherwise. They are sure that the humanmade programms could also make mistakes which could be even worse. 
But of course this is not the only reason to be against electronical election. They belief that many humans can't afford a computer or don't know how to use one. This would expell many people from voting. Furthermore the enemies of election on PC have the opinion that recounting in case of a massive mistake of the system would be impossible. 
Nevertheless the pro-side comes up with the arugument that we already use so much technology in our every day life, that it would make sense to trust in electronical voting. In their mind the voting system is easy to handle for everybody and could even improve the process of voting.
