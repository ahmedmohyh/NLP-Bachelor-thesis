But the computer isn't the only problem. Also people who haven't a big knowledge about computer can make easily a miscount. Althought people with poor eyesight have an easier viewing on computer, they will get in trouble. We should remember that these systems, which are used for banking transactions or things like that, are used daily and intensive, so we can find errors and eliminate them.
