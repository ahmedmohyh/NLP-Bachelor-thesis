In the text it is said, that the main reason why elections in the United States are inaccurat is the humans: On one Hand, the voters can accidently vote for the wrong candidate, by making the cross in the wrong line. On the other hand, all the counting of the votes is done by hand and so human errors can occure. The logical solution to this problem is of corse, to do all the voting digitaly since this reduces human errors drasticly. But in the lecture it is said, that computerizing the voting process might not even reduce human errors that much because there might be voters that are not familliar with computers or don't own one. Also for the digital counting the counterargument is that computers are still programmed by humans and so there can still be human errors. Furthermore programming mistakes can lead to major inaccuraties or losses of votes that might require correction by looking at the ballots. But this won't be possible then because everyone voted digitaly.
