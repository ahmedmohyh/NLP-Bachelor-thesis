The speaker and the writer almost couldn't disagree more. While the writer higlights the fact that computers work flawlessly in our daily lives and should be implemented on the voting systems as well, the speaker does not support that opinion at all. On the one hand the speaker sees the point that computers are easy to work with - but only for those who are used to working with them. The writer on the other hand thinks that using computers would prevent accidental wrong votes, as it would be easier to chose the right candidate on the computer, especially for people with poor eyesight, while the speaker thinks that more wrong votes would occur when voting electronically. A further point of disagreement is that the writer thinks that computer programmes in our daily lives also transfer highly sensitive information and also do a good job in that, whereas the speaker takes into consideration that those programmes did not work flawlessly from the start and needed a lot of adaptations; which is no problem when they are used on a daily basis but will cause some severe issues when it comes to votings which only take place twice a year nationally. What is more, computers might not be able to recount the votes again, they might be gone forever after a mishap. But the writer does not see this as a threat, he thinks that computers work automatically and won't really make any faults. Another point the speaker wants to get through is that computer programms are also invented by human beings and thus might perform just as weak as humans, which the writer thinks are fare more prone to making mistakes.
