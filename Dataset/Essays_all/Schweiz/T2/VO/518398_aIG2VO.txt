The text extract says, that the computerized systems for voting are better and remove human errors, but in the lecture it's told, that the problems aren't any better computerized. Human errors couldn't be removed completely, because computers are also programmed by humans and they make mistakes. That's natural. For voters who aren't comfortable with the use of computers, also the "easy-to-use" touch-screen technology isn't that easy as it seems.
Trust in complex computer technology is too risky, if they have to recount a voting because of an error by a computer, it's impossible to recount votes on a defected computer program.
If they misscount the votes in form of ballots, they can count them again and again. Sometimes the trust in technology without giving a thought, is very risky and dumb in a way. There won't be any difference soon to big brother is watching you.
