The text critizes the traditional way of voting and suggets to digitalize this whole system. The current voting systems all rely on humans. This can make the process very inaccurate. 
For instance voters have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper cotaining a lot of names. This could easily lead to confusion. It is possible that voters tick the wrong name. In addition it is critized that the counting of the votes is based on people. Officials have to count thousands of vote. An error is almost unavoidable.

In order to solve this problem, the text suggets a digital solution. People could vote on a computer rather than a sheet of paper. This can make the process easier. Voters can tick the name of a candidate on a big computer screen.The counting of the votes is also erased from human error. Computersystems are obviously bound to make less errors.

On the other hand this statement was critized. Computers can be very confusing as well. Especially for people who are not used to this technology. This could also be a discourage to vote. Also are errors not completely avoidable. The presentation states, that computer programs like they are used in banking transactions for example, also had problems to work flawlessly in the first place. They had to be adapetd and redesigned over a longer period of time. A problem with the digital based voting could be devastating, because it would be not possible to recount the votes.
