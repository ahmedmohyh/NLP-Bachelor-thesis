The arguments of the presentation we heard were contra a new voting system and pro the use of a traditional system. That's for sure the most important difference in comparisson with the text I read. First they argue with the incompetence of some people when it comes to using a computer. They said, this could lead to more faults and could even stop people from voting. Also they mentionned that a computer's programmed by a human being, so we can't expect it to do everything correctly. In case of an error it wouldn't concern only one vote but a thousands. Against the argument that we use our computers in our daily life they had again an answer. They agreed that we use our computers for even more important things like banking. But they added that these systems didn't funtion perfectly from the beginning. No they had rather been tested and changed a few times until they worked as well as they do now. Votings are totally different. They take place every two years and to develope a system that one can trust enough and is only being used so few is irrealistic. 

In conclusion these two opinions are totally different, but both share being fully convinced of their pint of view.
