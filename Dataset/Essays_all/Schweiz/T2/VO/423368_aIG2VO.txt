Voting in the USA
The woman who was talking, was speaking about computers and the possibility of joucing them for the voting. She is not that sure if that would be an great idea, beacause a lot of people don't even have a computer, not to forget that a lot of peaple haven't got the knowledg to handle with a computer the right way. So in the end there would be a lot of people who'd have liked to vote but couldn't just because they havn't got the sources or the knowledg. 

Further she was talking about humans and theier faults. All humans make faults, but one fault is less bad when they are counting the votes, as a fault for example in the computer system, wich would be used for the election. 

In the text which we had the read earlier, they are talking about the people and their mistakes. Perhaps their eyes aren't taht good that they can't see who they want to vote for on the ballot. Also people make mistakes with the counting. 

To conclude, the voting systems must be renewd and new organised, because they can't be fully trusted. Some smart people need to sit down and just think about, what would make the most sence, a voting system like before with ballots or a computerised system.
