Critics of the voting system in the USA want to use a computerized voting system to guarant efficient and accurate counting. But are these programs better? Some people are not used to computers, can't afford a computer or are simply feared of this technology. 
The critics of the current voting system say that at the moment a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because of their eye problems. On the big voting sheet they make the tick behind the wrong candidate. In addition to this problem another issue occurs. Still humans count the votes in the United States. Computers would make less faults.
In contrast, the computer-critics say that the programs for the voting are also made by humans so they could contain of mistakes too. And if such a mistake happens it would be way more dangerous and thousands of errors have to be solved. People nowadays normally trust most of the programs they use. But these programs are used daily. The voting program will be new, unsave and only used sometimes. And after all, is it good to exclude people with technological fear from the vote?
