The presentation is all about problems and benefits of the traditional voting system and the computerized voting. While the text argues for the new technologies, the woman presenting it, was against it. She doubts the perfection of such a system, programmed by human. So in the text it's written that there are no human errors, but obviously there could be. Is it actually easier to vote by help of a touch-screen? The author of the text is really sure, but according to the woman, people who are'nt daily confronted by computer may be stuck. In addition one need to mention that a lot of people can't afford expensive technologie. To carry on with the price question, you can argue that votings are quite rare,so it would not be efficient. To finalise, both of the sources are sure, that computer technology is already used or even overused daily.
