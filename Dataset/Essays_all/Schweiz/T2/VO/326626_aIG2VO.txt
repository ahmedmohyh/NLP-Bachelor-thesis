One big problem they talked abaout was, that older people may not be able to read the names which are written really  small. That could lead to the fact that people put there cross next to the wrong person, because many of names are similar. But the lisening we heard says that those people will have far more problems by using a computer, eighter  because they dont understand computers good enough, or they dont even have one at home because they can't afford one.
A second point is that computers wont be able to make better counts of the votes than people do, because national elections in the USA only take part every second years and elections of stattes not more than twice a year, so if the coputers make mistakes then, because they cannot get any better if they only use them twice a year, it would lead to far more votes for the wrong person. The argument they brought which says that the whole banking system gets done every day whitout any errors at all, is not comparable because it would take really long to delet a eroor of a system if it only gets used twice a year instead of ever day like in the banking system.
