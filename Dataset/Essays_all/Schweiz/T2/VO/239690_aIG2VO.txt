The traditional voting system is not that easily changeable as the text implies. If technology replaces the people who count the votes, there still is a danger of getting the results mixed up, due to an error in the programme which could also occur. Thes programms still are developed by people, there is a risk of making mistaked. The text say that with touch screen technology, nothing could go wrong, but that is not the case.
It may be easy to handle for people who are used to computers and technology, but the rest will be challenged by it. When one is not used to something, there is a big chance that one will make mistakes.
Technology is costly, and not everyone can afford a computer to get used to it.
The last two points do in fact not make it easy to gain trust in computerized voting, in addition it takes time to improve the voting programmes.
