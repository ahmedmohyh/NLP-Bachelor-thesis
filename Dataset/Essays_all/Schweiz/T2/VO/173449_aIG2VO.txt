According to the opinion I just heard, the computerized voting systems are not trustworthy at all to those people who are not used to computers in general. Also, old people may not have a problem of reading the ballot but with the computer as a whole. People who do not own a computer at home and are not able to afford one probably have a fear of technology and the new voting system and decide not to vote at all. This is much larger problem than a few elderly people that are not able to see which name they mark.
Furthermore, it is said that computers are also programmed by humans and that is why a small error in the reading of votes is not as harmfull as an error in the programm that leads to missinterpretation of thousands of votes which then cannot be read again since the information taken by the programm are false. This is why this new voting system also heavily relies on people but in another sense. So the possibility of human error is not removed at all. 
Finally, technology and programms like the banking system and transactions have been modified since they were first introduced. Thanks to the fact that they are used daily, errors were found quite soon and in consequence removed. This is why the banking system seems flawless: It has been improved during a long phase of trial and error. The voting system, in comparison is not used daily but once every couple of years hence this process of improvement is much longer. Thus, the trust to banking and communication systems that is mentionned cannot be transmitted directly to another system, in this case a new voting system.
