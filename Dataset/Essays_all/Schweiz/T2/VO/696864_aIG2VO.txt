It's a great discussion in the United States about the voting system. Some people think that the traditional voting system is a problem and others think that computerized voting isn't that better.
The bad thing about the current voting is espacially the work. When every voter has to give his sheet they are many people needed to count the votes. And this people can make faults in counting so a long and expensive recount has to be organized.
And it's difficult for older people with poor eyesight to find the name they want on the long paper.
But on the other hand it's the question if a computerized system is better. But then the older people could have problems because they don't know enough about computer to make sure they vote for the right thing. And Computer can make faults too. The programs are made by people who can make faults. And it's worse if they make a fault because then they aren't only 10 votes. Then they could be about thousands. And it's impossible to make a recount.
And in the worse caste the system can broke down. Because there are only evry second years votings the system can't be right proved for the great day.
So both systems aren't ideal. They will always be faults and difficulties for some people.
