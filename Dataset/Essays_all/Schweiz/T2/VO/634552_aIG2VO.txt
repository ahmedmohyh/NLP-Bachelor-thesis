It's a dicussion about the better way of collecting and processing the votes for a election concerning the traditional voting and the computerized voting. One opinion is that the trational voting is inefficient and leads to inaccurate counting of votes. The other opinion is that computer are way less trustworthy because the mistakes are bigger.
A point to criticise the tradidtional voting is to highlight that every vote has been to count and when mistakes are recognised the recount needs a lot of efford. The computer is far more efficient in counting the votes, there are no human errors, but the programm is designed by humans and errors in this part have a bigger impact on the counting than a few miscounted votes in the traditional system. And the votes are never physically saved, the system depents on the digital saved datas. That's a weak point.
A very important point discussed, is the security of these systems. In normal life we are used to a lot of programms dealing with private informations, like in the banking transactions. But in the beginning the systems had a lot of leaks and still today the not total secure. The programms nedd to be improved in practice, but elections take place less often and there is no room for experiments.
