Our voting system is old. Everyone knows that. We should replace it. But with which system? With a computerized voting system? In this essay I want to talk about this new possibilty of counting. 
First of all I want to talk about the new computer system. It is easy to use for people, which are used to work with a computer. But for the othera, it might be difficult.They have to learn to handle a computer. Furthermore computer programms makes mistaks, because those programmes, which would be used to count the votes, were made by human beings, and as you know, human being makes mistaks. This wouldn't be a problem, if there weren't more thann 1000 votes wich would be misscounted or even lost because of one little software fault. Those errors can't be recounted. On the other hand, the text argues with the pont, that the old voting sytsem is really inefficient and man misscount could happen. After a misscount, the officals has to recount, and that is really expensive. Voters often vote for the wrong candidat, because of their bad eyesight for example. The text also argues versus the point of the errors of a computer software. Today, many complex computer system are used everyday without faults, like banking transactions.
