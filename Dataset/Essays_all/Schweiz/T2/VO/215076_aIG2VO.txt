With a computer voting system people witch can not afford a computer or are not used to a computer or technology are excluded from the voting system. Some may be discouraged to vote at all. Adding to that it is not for sure that a computer voting system does less mistakes then the traditional voiting system. The programm, for the voting system,is also written by humans there can also occure some mistakes. Hence, this mistakes can result in a major error then the errors made by humans counting the votes. A computer programm can remove or delate 1000 of votings. It is fact that in our time there are a lot of computer programms used in banks, officials and other institutions. But for example a programm for banking transactions needed loads of time and tries to improve to have a reliable programm. The votes in the United States are just once a year, there is no time to produce a reliable programm for the voting system. The text disagrees with that statemant in their view it is important to have a go at it. There are already a lot of complex computer programm system. In their view it should be possible to create a reliable voting system programm.
The text has the opinion that there are more errors made by choosing the right name or counting the votes then made by the computer programm. The sheet where the candidates are written down -the ballot- is long and not very clear. Escpecially for older people it is more difficult to find the right candidate. In addition for them the computer voting system is more trustworthy
