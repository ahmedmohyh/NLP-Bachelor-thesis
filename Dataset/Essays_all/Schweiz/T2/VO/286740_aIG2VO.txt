Some say that in the US voting systems are outdated. They want to replace the traditional voting, where your make a cross on a sheet of paper next to the candidate in your favour with computer technology. Others are opposed to the idea of introducing this new method of voting on a national scale. 
They argue that computerized voting would be making it a lot harder to vote for those who are not familar with technology and can even create the negative incentive to not cast ones vote at all. However those who are in favour of it say that the current voting system is much more likely to accidentialy vote for the wrong candidate on paper.

Another argument of the opponents is that while humans could make small mistakes like miscounting a few votes, computers can, if something goes wrong, miscount thousands of votes and even determine the whole election. They also state, that recounts would then be impossible. Proponents on the other hand think, that computers are much more reliable than humans and that when human error can be excluded, voting will be much more fair. 

Lastly, opponents fear that it would no be possible to introduce voting machines nationwide while keeping peoples trust in the voting system as a whole. The argue, that many people are afraid of new technology and that they would never fully accustom to the thought of voting via computer if votes only took place every two years. Proponens however think that giving it a try is worth it since it would make voting much easier.
