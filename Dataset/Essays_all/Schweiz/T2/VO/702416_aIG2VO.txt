In the audio that I heard, they told that the electronic voting system in the USA is unefficient and not for everybody, because it's very hard to understand. In the text they are very opposed to the old voting system and they think that a computerized system would have benefits for all American voters. 
It's been said that its  very hard for people, whose have a lack of technology to vote and therefore they don't know how to vote. In the text they are very convinced that everybody would understand this system, because it's an easy-to-use-screen system. In the audio they also said that when the voters wouldn't understand this electronic system and then they wouldn't vote, because it's too complicated and hard for them. 
They also mentionned in the audio that not only humans do mistakes. Mistkakes and errors could also happen to computers. But in the text they say something completely different. Official counters often miscount the different ballots and at the end they'll get a wrong result. Computers can count the votes more easily and automatically, to them a error is almost impossible.
