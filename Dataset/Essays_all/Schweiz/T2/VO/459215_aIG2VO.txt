In the presentation about the computerized voting system in the USA they especially show the negative points about the new system. They are on the side of the traditional voting system due to the fact that a computer system nationalwide can easily be hacked. Eventhough the computer system is a good alternative to the current system it brings a lot of bad sides along. A governement can't be sure n that everybody in the country has a computer or can handle a computer. If you aren't used to technology it can be really scary to use a computer which can lead you to not vote at all. If this would really happen the votings won't be real neither. The text above shows us the negative things about the traditional voting system and that it isn't efficient or accurate because of the human errors while counting the votes. The presentation talks about the risks of a computerized system because there also can be errores caused by humans while programing a computer systm and the voting system. This could cause that thousands of votes won't be counted which would mean that the result of the votes won't be correct at all. The text stands for a try in technology with the arguement that everythingelse is computerzised nowadays.
