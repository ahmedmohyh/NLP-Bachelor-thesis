The current voting systems are inefficient and can easily lead to inaccurate counting of votes and that can be of high importance in nearly tied elections. That is why the authors of the extract have come up with the idea of a electronic voting system. That should cause no errors in counting the votes. Also people with poor eyesight can't read the names and then cross off the wrong candidate. That couldn't happen either with the computer viting system because there you can magnify the screen easily. 
On the other side, the computers can scare of people, according to the presentation. People who don't use computers very often might have problems, which might lead to them not voting anymore. Also these computers are programmed by people, who were before accused of making faults. The problem is that when a fault happens, you can't recount and there is no proof that you voted for person A and not for person B.
