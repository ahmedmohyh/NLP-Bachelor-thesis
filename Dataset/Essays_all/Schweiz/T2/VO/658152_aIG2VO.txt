Another fact is that computers are programmed by humans. Who says that there can't be no mistake? So if they're programmed false, there would be thousand of faults in the votes. This would be a bigger problem than one counting error in de traditional systems. It's written that some people say it's too risky to impletent complicated voting technology nationwide but computer systems are used very often and heavily.
