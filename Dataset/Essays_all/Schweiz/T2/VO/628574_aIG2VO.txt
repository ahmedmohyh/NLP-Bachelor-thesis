The text is in favour of voting on the computer, beacause of the people who have bad eyelight or the long lists, which no one really looks through can cause confusion. The audio play says that it is not save to say that computers can solve this problem because they are several people who don't use the computer often. They would have troubles and vote the false person, or not at all.
The text also uses the argument that there are humans who count all the votes and humans always make mistakes. But are computers better? aks the audio play. Because we have to think that computers get programmed by humans. So there can also be problems, which would be far more problematic. Because a problem on a computer can cause that the votes get deleated or lost and they can never be found again. Another argument that the audio play uses is, that these voting systems on the computer can't be improved fast because there are not many elections in the United States.
In conclusion the text in in favour of the elctronical voting, the audio play not.
