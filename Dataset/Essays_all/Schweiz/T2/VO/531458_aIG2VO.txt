In the text above it's told that the current voting system in the united states is not really perfect because there can be made a lot of errors. For example the voter could make his cross on the ballot at the wrong name because he has a bad eyesight. Or its always possible that the ones who count the votes on the ballot make a mistake and if one detects a counting error they have too count it all again. The text is proposing to replace the current voting system by a new computerised voting system where you can enlarge the names of the candidates on the screen so you can make the cross at the right name even if you have a bad eyesight. They also want the computersystem because all human countingerrors could be avoid by letting the computer count out all the votings.
The listening input argues against a new computerised votingsystem. It sais that for example old humans would be more comfortable with the normal ballots ensteade of the votingcomputer because they never use computers in thier daily life, so there would be as many or even more voting mistakes by crossing the wrong name in the computer. It also tells us that computers are programmed by humans and so they also make mistakes like humans. The countingerrors wouldn't be eliminated by using computers, it would just make them worse because when you detect one you cant just recount the ballots because there are no ballots to recount. 
The two examples are countering each other with their arguments.
