In the presentation, the first argument against the computerized voting is that not everyone is used to computers. There are people who don't have a computer, who have it but don't use it very often so they understand how it works and there are also people who can't afford to buy this machine. The computerized voting might make it easier for people with poor eyesight, but what about the people who don't have a computer at home? There is a big amount of people who are not used to vote with a computer or don't have enought self-esteem to do it, what means that the computerized voting is not a lot easier. These people also feel descourraged to vote and the numbers of voters in an election could sink with this problem.
Computers make mistakes as well as the people who count the votes do. In the presentation it is said that one small error in the computer could cause a serious error that could lead to thousands of votes that could be wrong count. It's written in the text that human make errors too, but one error in the count by a human being wouldn't have such an enourmous affect on the election results as a computer error could cause.
The last big problem with the computerized voting is that not every programm work completety mistakes-free for the first time. The last part of the text tries to convince us that we should give it a try as we did by our banking transactions, but the development of these programms took years until they were totally safe to use. An election only takes place once in two years so we can't be sure that the computerized voting will work without any problems for the first time when it's used.
