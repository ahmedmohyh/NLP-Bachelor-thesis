In the text as well as in the lecture they have discussed the voting system in the united states. In the written text the author expresses concerns about the errors that have been made by human hand during the voting. There are many occasion, where the mistakes can happen. For instance, if a person has a reduced seight it is much more likely that she could mark the wrong person to vote for. But there is also the option of wrong counting after the voting. Due to mistakes of human hand there is a serious problem especially in election where the result is very critical. 
In the text the author is proposing a computer based voting system. At least we should take it into consideration.
Whereas in the lecture the professor has a diffrent opinion. The professor says that a computer based system can have as much errors as human hand, because the computer is programmed by humans. But what is more important is that if the computer system makes a mistake the outcome would be much more serious. It can not be compared with a banking system which is used every day due to the fact that votings are only every two years. What's more is, that not everyone has access to a computer nor has sufficient knowledge to make the election properly on the computer.
In the end it is to say that both points of view see their own mistakes and insecurenesses, so that a decition depends only on which one is the minor risc to take for the future.
