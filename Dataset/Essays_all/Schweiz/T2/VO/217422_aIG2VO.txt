The traditional way of voting in the United States is criticized by quite a few people and definitely isn't flawless. The lecturer states why Americans should still hang on to this system and not change to a digitalized voting system.
The lecturer states that the problem of voting for the wrong candidate would not be improved by a computerized system, because many people do not frequently use computers and aren't capable of adjusting to this new technology. Another problem is that there's people that can't afford computers or are discouraged when they have to vote on line. In the lecture it is said that there is a problem with counting the votes with the traditional system. But who really knows if digitalized counting is flawless, since it is programmed by humans and in case of miscount the error created would be much larger than with the traditional way. In the text the accurateness of counting by computers is just taken as given. A recount in case of error, would not be possible, since often times computer programs don't store the votes, as mentioned in the lecture.
The last thing the lecturer brings up, is the mistrust that a big part of the people have in these modern, digitalized programs. The fact, that elections only take place once in two years in the US, would not serve to legitimize this program.
