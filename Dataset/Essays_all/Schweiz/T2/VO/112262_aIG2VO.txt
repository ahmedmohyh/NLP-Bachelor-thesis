Todays US voting system is said to be inefficient and some people propose a replacement with a computerized system.
Supporters of the new system claim that it would be a lot easier to cast a vote. But critics, those who would like to keep the old system, say that this is highly doubtful because it's only easy for people who are used to work with computers. They also counter the argument of the supporters that it would cause fewer problems. They admit that problems like miscounting could be irradicated but the program itslef would still be made by a human being, and therefor not be flawless. They claim that an error of such a program would be a lot worse.In addition, if an error occurs, a recount would be impossible because there exist no physical ballot. They also say that the argument that compterized systems are reliable and trustworthy, like banking transactions or communication, are invalid because they are integrated into our daily life for years and therefor had a lot of time to develop and fix their problems. A new computerized voting system would have issues because it would be young and only be used up to twice a year.
