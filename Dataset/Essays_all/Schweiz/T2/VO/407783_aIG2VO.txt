In the current voting system of the USA is the voting often inefficient. People with a bad eyesight can mark the wrong name on the long list of the candidats. Now they want to replace the voting system with computer voting. They only have to touch the candidats name on the computerscreen to vote for him. The second problem with voting by hand is the miscounting of the papers. The thousands of ballots takes very much time to count. If they detect an error they have to recount all the ballots and this takes a very long time and is expensive. With computers you can remove the counting error. It's done quickly by them. So many things are done by the computers today so why not also the voting?

The other opinion is that computer voting is easy to use for the people who works often with computers but people who doesn't use them every day can have troubles with it. The other problem is that counting by hand can make an error of two or three ballots but if a computer has a problem or the whole system it can make an error of thousands of ballots. This would make the whole situation very complicated and expensive. The old system was useful until now so why won't we keep it?
