Tradinional voting may has his problems but it is doubtful that computarized voting would do a better job. The computarized voting is only easier for those who are used to computers and some people, especially older people, may  have troubles using it. There are also a lot of people that are having a fear of technology. 
It may be true that in the traditional way of counting the votes by people it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes but you shouldn't forget that computers are programmed by humans. If there's any error in the system thousand of votes are going to be misscounted. 
It's true that we trust complex computer technology everery day in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information but that's only like this because banking systems are used daily. We need to remember that in the beginning the banking systems were not perfect. They were optimizing the banking systems for years while testing them over and over again. The voting takes place only every two years.
