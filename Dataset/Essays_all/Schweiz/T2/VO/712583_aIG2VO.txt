Voting 

Critics say that the current voting systems in the United States are inefficient and lead most of the time to inaccurate counting of votes from officials, because they have count to votes one by one. They are humans, so mistakes might happen. Miscounts could be damaging an election if it is closely contested. If an error is detected, the officials need to repeat the whole process again. 

They would rather bring up the traditional computerzied voting systems, which are more efficient and trustworthy. One of the major sources of inaccuracy in countings, is that people accidentally mark the wrong candidate on the large sheet of paper for example like people with poor eyesight. 

But what about the people, who never use computers in a regular daily basis or who simply can not afford one. Those people might not know how to use a computer properly, which can lead to thousands of miscounts. Because of that, the computerized voting systems include a touch-screen technology, to decrease the amount of miscounts that might happen.

Some people even say it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology and we should stick to the system we already have. But if you think, that individuals and governments are using complex computer technology in a daily basis to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive communication.
