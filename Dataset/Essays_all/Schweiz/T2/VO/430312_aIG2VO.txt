There is a big debate wether it is more effieicent and secure to use the traditional voting system or the current one which includes computers. In traditional voting, it is inevitable that the people who count the votes make mistakes. So in that case computer are very useful, but on the other hand it is not assured that they aren't programmed, also by a human's mistake, and that can cause much more dammage than just mmissing a few names. Also the voting programm by computers hasn't got enough time to develope, because in the USA there is only a voting once every two years. Another problem is that not everybody can effort a computer. Although computer voting makes it a lot easier for people with poor eyesight because the computer magnify the names for easier viewing. Furthermore computer voting makes everything is done way more quickly.
