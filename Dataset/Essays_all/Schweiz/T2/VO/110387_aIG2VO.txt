This topicis all aboutthe current voting system of the United Statesand in comparison to a future, computerized voting system. The voice presentation that I wasjust listenting to, really douts on the new computerized voting system. It says, that like humans,computers make mistakes, and when they do, it can cost and make severe damage. Of course, banking systems are in daily use and work perefectly fine, but just do to the fact, that they have been updated many times. The difficulty is to establish a flawless computersystem for the elections, but this seems almost impossible because elections happen only every two years, so it's almost impossible to improve this computersysteo to the fact, that there's only little opportunities to update it. In comparison to this opinion, the essay puts huge trust into the new computer system and doesn't even doubt it. It even states, that computer systems remove the possibility of human error.
