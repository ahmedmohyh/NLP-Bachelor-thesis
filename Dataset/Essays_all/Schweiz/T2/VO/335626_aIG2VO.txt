The voting process in the United States is flawed. Experts suggest a voting system where computers analyse and count the votes. The experts argue that this system is superior to the tradional voting system where the ballots are written out by hand, and counted by humans. The experts support the idea that in traditional voting the humans make too many mistakes, leading to to great damage if an election is closely contested. But the experts oversee the fact that the programs are also written by humans, and that an error in the electronic system can be far more devastating. The electronic error is more dangerous because the votes aren't recorded physicaly, which means they can easily be lost. Also the experts ignore the fact that there are people which have with problems with computers, and they have a hard  time understanding the complexity of the technoloogy.
In conclusion, the traditional and electronic voting system are both flawed, and both can lead to errors. But if you compare both the advantages and disadvantages, the traditional voting system is safer and easier to controll, if an error occurs.
