Our world today has become very technological in the last decades. We use technology in our everyday life.
The voting system though, remained still traditional: ballots are being counted by hand.
There are a some diffrents about this voting systesm. 
A lot of people would prefer a computerized voting. At one hand, this process would more efficient.
If for exapmle an error happens, the computer can remove it easily and fast. On the other hand a computer could make a very big error. Because of the big information data, there is a risk, that thousands of votes could be saved wrong.
This shows, that computerized voting are not neccessarily more trusthworthy than the the traditional one. People with poor eyesight though, could mark the wrong name on a ballot. With a computer this would not happen.
The problem with a computerized system is, that a lot people aren't use to technology. So if someone has not the experience or the money for a computer, he can't vote.
