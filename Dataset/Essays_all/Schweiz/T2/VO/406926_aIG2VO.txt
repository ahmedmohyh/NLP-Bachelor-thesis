The voting systems in the United States are inefficient and the voting sytems have big problems. Critics would like the trditional systems to be replaced with far more efficient an trustworthy computerized voting systems.
People vote for the wrong candidate, say the traditional voting. Voters have to fing the nam of their candidate on a large sheet of paper cantaining many names - the ballot - and make a small mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. Th computerized voting machines have an easy to use touch-screnn technology: to cast a vote, a voter needs only to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vot for that candidate; voters can even have the computer magnify the name for easier viewing.
Another major problem with old vozing systems is that they rely heavily one poeple to count the votes. Officials must often count up the votes one by one, goining through every ballot and recording the vote. Since they have to deal with thousands of ballot, it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes. If an error is detected, a long expensive recount has to take place. In contrast, computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all  the vote counting is done quichly and automatically by the computers.
Finally some people say it is too risky to implent complicated voting technology nationwide. But without giving it a thought, goverments and individuals alike trust other coplex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information.
