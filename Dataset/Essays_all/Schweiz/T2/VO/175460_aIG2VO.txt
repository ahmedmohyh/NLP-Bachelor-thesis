The women in the listening doubts the quality of the voting with computers. The her opinion, we should not forget, that there are people who do not use as much computers as we do or people who can not afford a computer. They are going to be afraid of voting, which would be a totally negative aspect. On the other hand, there are a lot of mistakes in the voting process, because people with poor eyesight are often not able to choose the right person on the ballot, because they can not percisely make a cross next to their favourite candidate. 

Some people say, that people make a lot of mistakes during the counting of the votes, because they have to count thousands of votes one by one. But despite this fact, there can also be some mistakes in the computer programms, who are made by humans. If there is an error in a computer programm it is completely impossible to make a recount of the votes. To the opinion of the women in the listening, you can not compare a programm for computer transactions with a program for counting the votes. A bank system had to be improved thousands of times, because it is used every day. Computerized voting will hardly ever get improved, because it will be used only every two years nationwide. This means that computerized voting will never be as secure as a bank system, which can be really dangerous. In worst case, there could be a totally wrong result and there could be a president, for who nobody voted for.
