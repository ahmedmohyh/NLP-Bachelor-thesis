In the age of digitilization, computers are used more and more but should we also trust them for our elections?
It is true that people are making mistakes in counting and of course it is not cheap at all to recount the mistakes, but what if a computer crashes and all files are getting lost? Computers a created by humans, so why should they not fail from time to time. You can not compare programs for online banking with elections, because those systems are used daily and companies are improving them day by day since people are using them.
Another problem is, that some people which can not see perfect any more have trouble to vote for the right person. This especially old people will not have an easier life, if they have to vote on the computer, because they are not used to it. On top of that, not all people can afford a computer, so how should they vote?
All things considered there are many strong arguments on both sides. It is not easy to decide what is better. Both system can make mistakes and some people will have problem with each system. Programs for banking got improved for years and now they work very efficient, so perhaps we should wait a few years to create a reliable program for voting, which will not fail.
