Computerized voting has its pros and cons critics claim that people that are not famillier with computers will have problems wich discourages them to vote. People that do not vote is a huge problem for democracie because when only fifty percent of all people vote and than only a part of these has voted the new president or what ever else maybe all in all only twentyfive percent of the people in country are happy about the voting results and the later changes that happen.
On the other hand there are people that say more people will vote if it is more comuterized because they have problems with the traditional voting sheets wich would cause the same problem mentioned before.

Critics of the traditional voting critisise the accuracie of the counting and the problems it would cause. As we all know humans do errors and when so many people are working oon the counting of the millions of votes there will be some errors althought they might be small they could influence the result of a closely contest. However critics say that computers would not do better they would do even worse because computers are programmed by humans and humans do errors wich results in huge errors in the counting and could damage an election massivly.

There are also arguments concerning the comfort of voting that voting sheets are small and have to much information on this small space which could be problematic for people that do not see good.
