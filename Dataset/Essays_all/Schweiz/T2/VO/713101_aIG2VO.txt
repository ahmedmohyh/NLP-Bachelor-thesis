About the voting system

   Nowadays, a traditional voting system is being made use of by the United States. Voters are given the list of candidates -te ballot- and have precisely make a mark next to the small name of their candidate. Aferwards, the votes are counted one by one by officials following their duty. This system suffers some criticism and those critics propse a new computerized, voting method. 
But which one is better?

   Main arguement of the critics: Inaccuracy. Having so many votes counted by that many people is going to lead to mistakes and these will lead to insufferable recounts. The new, computerized system will eliminate this flaw. Eventhough the conservative opposition says that erorrs in the programming will lead to much more fatal miscounting and can't allow a recount, such an importent programme like the one for voting machines is unlikely to be allowed to be flawed.

But the computers might discourage the elderly generation from voting all together, since they might have fears and doubts on a computerized voting system.

   The critics seem to have a very good point considering inaccuracy. Especially with such close calls in presidential elections these last years it has become ever so it has become ever so important. Accuracy needs to be assured to have fair votings. Technology could indeed deliver that.
