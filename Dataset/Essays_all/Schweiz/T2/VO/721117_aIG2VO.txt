What the text and the and the presentation of the woman have in commun is the opinion that both voting systems (computer and the traditional system) aren't flawless and that there's much room for improvement.
The text claims that the voting system as we have it today is inefficient and not trustwothy and that it should be relaced witha computerized system. It says that there happen way too much mistakes when the votes get counted one by one by normal people. If an error is detected there will be a recount which is very expensive and long.
The woman admits that there may happen some mistakes in the traditional voting system, but these are only small mistakes, only a few ballots. One of her main arguments is, that computers are invented by humans, so why shouldn'd there be human errors in this human systems? She claims that the mistakes that the computers can make are much worse than the ones that are made in the traditionalvoting system. There can be ththousands of wrong counts and there can't be made a recount because there is no physical prove. It's also bad for people who don't have or can't afford computers.
