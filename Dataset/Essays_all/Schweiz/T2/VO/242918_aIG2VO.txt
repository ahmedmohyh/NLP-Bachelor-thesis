They doubt that the computer is the better solution. it only seems to be easier to handle the election but not everybody can afford a computer and not everybody knows how to use it. it might be easy for users that use the computer all day. Eventhough it say's in the text that computer count a lot faster and that recounting from humans is exremly expensive and it takes extremely long. 
People that don't see good have problems to click on the right profile or person. that opposes on the sentence in the text where it say's that in traditional voting people could accidentally vote for the wrong candidate.
Why shouldn't computers make errors, they're made by humans too but an error in a computer system is way worse than a little countig error from human counters. thats conroverse to the text cause it say's that computerized systems remove the possibility of human errors.
