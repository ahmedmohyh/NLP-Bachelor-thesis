According to the presentation, the advantage of the computer based election is that people can easily deal with computers because most of the population use it often and heavily every day. They remarked that not everyone can afford a computer and that many persons have fear of technology or do not trust in them. It is proved that computers make mistakes, too and that they have mistakes in their programmes. When we look in the past, they were not flawless but they have improved a lot by now. Another mistake of computers would be that thousands of votes could easily be lost in the world wide web.

The problem with the old votation system is that people can easily vote for a wrong candidate, miss ballots or the most dramatic mistake would be a wrong calculation in the end. Because it is counted by hand it needs a lot of time and it is not exact. They mention in the text that this system is not efficient and that is also given in the presentation. Another thing that they have in common is that people can not handle very well with the paper thing. They vote wrong or they can not see it properly. 

Now we see, problems exist in both systems. For the older generation it would be more comfortable because they are used to fill in the gaps on papers. But for people who have the habit of sitting in front of the laptop everyday and for them who trust in technology it would be the better option.
