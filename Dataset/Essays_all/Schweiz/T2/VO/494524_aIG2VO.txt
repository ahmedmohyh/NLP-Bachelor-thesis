The presentation criticises voting on computers in following points.
At first there are many people who aren't able to use a computer. Of course humans are growing up with technology today, but the Elderly didn't. Also poor people who can't afford computers aren't used to it. Voting on computers would be a lot harder for them and a reason for mightably mistakes.
In the text, they say that it's impossible that people won't doing mistakes by counting the ballots. But in contrary, computer systems are made by humans and so you can never know if computers are programmed in a wrong way. Maybe there will be thousands of votes be discounted, even nobody noticed it. This would be a huge mistake against a few ballots that are missing. Another point is that the voting system isn't a daily programe like banking systems. That could be also a problem which affects the result of counting the votes.
