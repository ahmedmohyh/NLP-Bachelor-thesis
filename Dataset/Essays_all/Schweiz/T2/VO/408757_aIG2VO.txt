The lecturer is disagreeing in some points that are explained in the text:

Computerized voting is good if we're used to it. But especially in the USA people are not used to it and the whole thing might be more confusing. So voters can't really use computers. There is also the fear of technology, like some people wouldn't even want to vote. 
It might be true that the counting is quite hard and there could be miscounting. Humans make errors, thats also true. But the programs in the computers are made by humans. And there could be also some mistakes. In fact, the consequences by the computerized voting system can be worse than those from the traditional. If there's a problem with the program it could happen that thousands of votings are miscounted. And that would have a bigger effect than these few in the traditional votings. But at that point computerized systems remove the posibility of human error. Problems in computers can be solved easily.
Technology is accurate in banking transactions but thats not the same when we compare it with the voting system.
The lecturer says that computers are also not affordable and would be used twice in a year wich is rarely. The thing is that computers could replace so many humans. And its just easier to work with them when it comes to vote.
