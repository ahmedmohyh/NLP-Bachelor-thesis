If voting should be computerized or still be done in the tradtional way is heavily debated. Some believe the digital version is more accurate and has overall more advantages than its counterpart. The arguments for the traditional system are compared to those of the digital system in this essay.

First of all, the speaker argumented that computerized voting is worse than the traditional voting system because people who cannot afford a computer are not able to vote. Therefore, the voting would not be accurate because of missing votes. But not only could we loose votes because people do not have a computer but also because some voters may have technological fears and consequently will not use it at all. 
The argument that the traditional voting system lacks accuracy as a result of human errors is definitely wrong as computer programs are also programed by humans and as a result may also contain human faults which then would have a serious impact. Finally, computerized processes like transactions only work flawlessly today because we were able to improve it over years. The voting system however, could only be imoroved every two years as elections are not that frequent.

There are definitely arguments for both systems. But I personally believe, that the traditional system is more accurate and should be kept in place.
