_Voting in the US
An important point in the US is now the voting system. Shall it be changed? So, that computers do the work to count the ballots and humans can vote by the computer and not with the hand? Or shall we leave it as it is? Here are some arguments.
The proponent of an computerized system say that it would be more safe. Humans which have to count the ballots one by one can easely make a mistake, while coputer is programmed to count the votes. Furthermore, there are people who haven't got a good eyesight, so they have problems with the old system and tick the wrong candidate in the whole, big list. With the modern technology, they would have oly to klick on the candidate which they have choosen. Another point they mention is that computer systems has yet improoved by many times, for example in banking systems. It wouldn't be a problem to change and use a computerized voting system. 
The oponent say about this, that not everyone is confident with using the computer. Many people aren't able to use the technology correctly, so they would have problems if the voting system got changed. Another reason is that the computers wich make up the oting is programmed by humans. Mistakes there could be much worse than they are now by just overcount one time. At last, they explain that it would be hard to make a safe and well to use system, because we don't vote as often as we use banking.
There are many questions to answer and the different opionions are both srong, so people have tot hink over a while before making a decision.
