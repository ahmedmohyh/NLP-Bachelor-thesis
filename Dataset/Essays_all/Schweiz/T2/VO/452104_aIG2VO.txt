The lady speaking in the lecture is clearly against the computerized voting system. She was explaining how there are a lot of people in America who aren't experienced with working with todays technology. Those people aren't affraid to vote they are simply afraid of the new computers used to vote. Other people can't even afford a lapop or a computer because they are to poor. Because of these points there would be way less votes in american voting system. The lady also mentiones that you can not avoid relying on people counting the votes, because todays computers are made from people. She thinks making a mistake during programming a computer, would be much worse, since thousands of votes could get lost due to the fact that the computer can't recount the votes incase of an error. The person writing the text is convinced that the old voting system must be renewed. It is mentioned that the old system is inaccurate because it heavily relys on the people counting the votes. While the lecture claimes that a computer error would cause bigger problems, the text claims that computers are more efficient and would not make any mistakes. Since the government and individuals trust the complex computer technology the voting system should too.
