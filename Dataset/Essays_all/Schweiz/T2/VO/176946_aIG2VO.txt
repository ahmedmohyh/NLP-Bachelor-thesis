The topic is about the voting system in the United States. Especially the counting of the votes. In the text they said that in traditional voting by hand, the people with poor eyesight can easily make the wrong name. They are saying that it is easyer to vote on the computerized voting machines, when you just have to touch the candidat's name on the screen. Another problem is that people often make mistakes when they have to count all the votes.

But the people aren't the only one who make mistakes. In the presentation she said that people make mistakes but computers are made by humans. So it is cleary, there will be problems with the coputers. Furthermore you have the chance with traditional voting to recount if there are any mistakes, with computers you have not got these oppertunitys. The recount is impossible. 
Another problem is that you can only use the coputerized machines if you are in common with computers. There are many people who have trouble using computers or have a fear of using them.

In conclusion the text is for computerized voting and the presentation is against it. In my opinion the text is in the right position. Because we live in an modernized world with lots of technology and like the text said we trust other complex computer technology every day for example with banking transactions and we use technology in our daily life so why do not use it for voting? With the help form the next generation it will be possible that everybody can vote with the new technology.
