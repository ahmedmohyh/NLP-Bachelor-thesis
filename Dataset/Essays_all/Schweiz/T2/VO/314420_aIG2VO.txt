Computers are programmed by human beeings and human beeing as it is said in the tex make mistakes. So it is not possible to be sure that the cumputer has no mistakes. Because if there are some, the konsequences of wrong counted votes is bigger as if human count the votes.
For computerized voting, the people has to have the knowledge how to get on with the cumputer even if they have an easier -to-use-touchscreen. So if someone do not have the skills, he maybe will choos accidently the wrong candidate. Ans there many people who are afraid of technoligy. So it is not easier to do it with papers because  people with poor eyesight can also mark the wrong name.
Coputers are also used in the bank and there is no problem with counting the money. The texs says too that the wrong countet numer will not be that high. But in contrast the womes sais that the bank proofed the progremm over and over again. They make also use of it every day so if there was a little mistake, they would instantly see it. In case that voting in America is once a year or all four years it will be difficult to see if the system has failed.
