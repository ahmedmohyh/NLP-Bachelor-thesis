Computers aren't owned by everyone because they're not the cheapest thing in the world and also are not easiest to use. So it technically isn't easier for people to vote on a computer than on a sheet of paper.
The text also speaks of human error in the counting of votes, but computers are also made by humans, that means that computers can make mistakes too. A human can only miss some votes but an error in a computer programm could lead to thousands of votes being misplaced or being missed. So a computer error is far more dangerous and complicated to deal with than a human error.
It is also mentioned that some governments use such voting system in banking transactions on a daily basis but a nationwide voting for a president for example isn't every day. That means it is really hard to improve the voting system because you don't really know what the flaws of the system are.
