The woman in the audio states that computerised voting systems would bring a lot more problems with them than people think. Although according to the text, nowadays with the traditional system, many people make mistakes when voting due to poor eyesight and then vote for the wrong candidate. The woman in the audio argues that even more people have problems with computers. If one doesn't use them often, then it can be very difficul and confusing when confronted with them. This would lead to people making mistakes or even being fully discouraged of going to vote. The text also  says that human error could be avoided through computers doing the counting instead of officials. Since officials have to count thousands of votes, they are bound to make mistakes. The woman in the audio thinks that human error cannot be avoided at all if computers do the counting, because they are programmed by humans and if there is something wrong concerning the programme that the mistakes would be much larger than if an official simply counted a few ballots less. She also argues that it took years to trust the computers used in banking today and that voting is far less frequent, which would result in years of adjusting until we could fully rely on these.
