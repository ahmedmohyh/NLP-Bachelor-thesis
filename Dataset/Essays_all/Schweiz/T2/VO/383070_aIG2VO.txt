The article states that voting in the US can be very inefficient and unreliable, given that each of the massively huge amount of votes are counted one by one by humans. It is inevidable to make mistakes while counting, even with extreme precaution. They would rather have computerized voting systems, with easy-to-use touch-screen technology, making it easier for the other source of inaccuracy, people with poor eyesight who might accidentally vote for the wrong candidate by marking the wrong name, to read the names magnified and make voting more comfortable. The woman in the lecture on the other hand arguments that while human mistakes will be made, they will be made in a far more trivial amount in contrast to the catastrophic amount of votes that might disappear if the computers experience a system error. But the article then points out that we trust computers with other sensitive information such as banking trnsactions, then why should we not trust them with our votes? The woman has an answer to that as well. We have had these online banking methods for a while now and have gotten used to it. Initially, there had been issues which needed years to be fixed to a point where we can now easily make these transactions. And this is a diurnal transaction made worldwide. Computerized voting will be once a year, and while people used to these techs can manage to vote easily, others might have big troubles in doing so and then again, mistakes will occur and there will be another massive source of inaccuracy. So in the end it comes down to wether one trusts and is trusted with computers.
