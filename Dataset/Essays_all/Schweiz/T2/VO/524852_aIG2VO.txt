In these days there is a fundamental discussion about how to vote. Is the US letter voting system still the best solutin in our digital world?
Esspecially old people have the oppinion, that a digital voting system isn't bettter. Old people and also others who don't use the computer constantly could have problems to understand the introduction for the voting system. This could lead to much wrong results. A other problem of the digital vating could be the effect, that the people who programms the voting programm could have done a mistake in the system. In this case this could lead to thousands of wrong votes.
The people who prefere the electronic vote are argumenting that the voting letter is very difficult to understand for poor people with lower education. It could be, that these people vote for a person they don't want.
A other problem of the letter voting is, that the letter must be count manuell by humans. this could lead to mistakes. A computer counting system coul'd be much easier in this situation.
