Some people think that the current voting system in the U.S are inefficient and often are full of human mistakes. These people would prefer an computerized voting system who won't make counting mistakes and the names of the candidates will be easiy to find on the computer so the voters won't choose the wrong candidate. But on the other side the computers are programmed by humans so the human faults aren't away. And not everyone has the possibility afford a computer because they are to expensive or they haven't worked on a comuter before. For those people it's impossible to make their votes on a computer and they need to use the old voting system.
