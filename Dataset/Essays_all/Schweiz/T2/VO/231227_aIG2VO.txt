Both are about voting by computersystem instead of voting on paper - on ballots. In the Essay all the points named are positive to change from the old voting system to the new one. They name for example that computers are more accurate than humans. They make less mistakes while they are counting the votes. Another important point is that it is easier to vote on computers because the clicing on the touchscreen or with the mouse is better than making a cross by hand on a ballot. The lecture on the other hand is against all the positive points. She said that we can't trust the computers because if they have a heavily system crash, many votes can be lost and the human accuracy is enough for counting. A human may just miscounta few ballots but if a voting computer system crashes, everything is a big miscount. She also said in the lecture that voting on computers like described in the essay is just easy for people who can handle technology like that pretty well. But there are still people on earth who don't know how to handle a computer. By comparison of these to texts iit is clear that there will be changes in the voting systems on the world.
