voting

The main points made in the presentation concern the people who are not used to technology, wheter it is due to a lack of financial means, age or fear of technology,and the reliability of a computerized voting system.
In the presentation is said that people who are not that used to computers may have problems voting for the candidate they would like to vote for, or, in a worst case scenario, may not even show up to vote due to fear of failing and technology. wheteras in the text is mentioned the high count of people voting another candidate as they wanted to because of poor eyesight. in their opinion this problem wouldn`t exist with a computerbased voting system. 
Another argument in the presentation is that, oposed to the text, human error is still possible with a hightech voting system, since it`humans who build and program the computers, and that an error ocurring with the new voting system would be way more fatal than an error ocurring with  the traditional voting system, since there is always the possibility of a recount and the numbers wouldn`t be as big. Another point made in the presentation doesn`t have an counterpart in the text and that is the point about the frequency of votings ocuuring in relation with the possibility to improve the system
