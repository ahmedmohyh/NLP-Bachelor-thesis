The current voting systems seem to be very discussed. The question is, if the traditional way with ballots is more useful than the voting with computers.

Now, arguments which support the traditional method is for examlpe, that there are many people who aren't used to computers and this could effect that they use the technology false or even stay at home because they don't get it. Secondlly, computers are programmed by humans and aren't unfailable, so they may get human errors and in the worst case all the votes could be deleted. And least, the technology is improved all the time and it has dured many years to get to the point of safety it has now. So now, in the USA they have votings all two years and that's not necesserily vers trustful.

But even if all these facts against computers are very senseful, there are also arguments which support computers. Firstly, there exist many people who have a bad eyesight and it's very easy for them to pick the wrong person. Additionally, the mothod relies on the people who count the ballots, and they can get easily something wrong. When it has to get recount it is very simple because the ballots exist a longer time and they can't get deleted accidetionally. We can also compare the voting system with computers with the datas fro all these big concerns, because they have also to rely on the accurate works of a comomputer.

In conclusion, we can say that both, computers and the traditional system have their positive and negative sites, but it is clear that the computers work faster than all these counters. But the enironement has to decide by it's own if they want to use computers.
