In the presentation several problems of our voting system are named. It's a discussion about the traditional voting system and new computerized systems. But is the new technology easier? The first problem is trouble with the technology. In the United States are people, who have fear of it and the older generation doesn't know who to use a computer. An other problem could be mistakes in the voting programs. In the old system mistakes are just miscounts of one or two ballots, but if a computer program makes mistakes the miscounts and results are a lot bigger. The last problem is the improve of the systems until they're reliable. No computer program has no errors since the begining and in a voting systems this shouldn't be. 
The main difference between the presentation and the text is, that the reader talks about the negativ things for older people and in the text are a lot of positiv ones. For example the using of a computer. The presentation says, that this isn't possible for the older ones, and in the text they say that on a computer it is much easier, because you can zoom in and magnify the name for easier viewing. Also the text sees in contrast to the presentation the positiv things of the computer when you have to count. A computerized system remove the possibility of human errors. In summary the presentation is much more negativ about new technology in elections than the text.
