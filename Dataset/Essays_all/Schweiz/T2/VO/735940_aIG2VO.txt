The lecturer begins the lecture challenging the point made in the text that for example elderly people could more easily vote with a computerized system. She suggests that people who are not used to computers because they are too old, they cannot afford a computer, or are otherwise not able to handle one, might be in an even worse position with a computerized system. 

She then endoubts the statement by the text that computers could do a more reliable and precise job than human counters. She says that, because the programs used for this need to be written by humans, human error can barely be avoided. Therefore, she strongly opposes the suggestion that, with a computerized system, human error could be removed from the equation.

Furthermore, she critizises the lack of a redundance system. Because there is no physical records of any votes, a recount is not possible, she states. This is a major concern for the case of a suspected failure in the system, likely rendering an entire election or vote useless and not valid.

Finally, she opposes the suggestion that other computer technology can be precedent for this type of system, because, according to her, all those systems, such as the banking system, needed years of refinement before they were able to function as well and reliably as they do today. For this level of reliability, a frequent and regular use is vital, because only then bugs and mistakes can be found and erradicated. With the voting system in the US, there are by far not enough events where voting is needed, so the system cannot be tested and used the same way for example the banking system can.
