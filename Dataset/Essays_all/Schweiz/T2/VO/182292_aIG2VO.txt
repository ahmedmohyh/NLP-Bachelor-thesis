Critics think that the current voting system of the USA has some big problems. Human beings make mistakes, count wrong, forget some billots and so on. Additionally it is very heavy and expensive to count all the millions of votes. Of cours this is a problem which has to be solved. But are computers the right answer? Even though we use them every day and we have no problems, they are programmed by humans. In conclusion is possible that if one of all the professional and well-educated labourers who were programming the computersized voting system for many years made one fault, thousands of votes can be miscounted.

The possibilities to make mistakes by votings on computers are smaler because Americans would make less mistakes while they are lookin for the name of their prefered candidat. Eventhough there are critics who acknowledged the problem that many people, eypecially from older generations, are not used with computers. People like them are going to have a lot of trouble unlike the others who can provide from their daily experience withe the new tecnology.
