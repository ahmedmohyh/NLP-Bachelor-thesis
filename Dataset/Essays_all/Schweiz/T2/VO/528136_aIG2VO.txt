The presentation about the voting said that the traditional voting system has its problem but the computarized would have more. There are people who don't have acsess to computers and or don't know how to use them. This can make that those people don't want to vote anymore because they're afraid. But on the otherhand the text says it makes it easier to vote for old people and those with bad eyes. They can magnify the names of the persons they can vote for, to see them better. 
But there are still the conserns that the systems might fail. When the computer fails to work or the programm has an error it is far more tragic than it would be when the persons witch are counting are missing some ballots, says the presentation. On the otherhand the texst gives some examples that we already use computer technology on daily bases just like banking and communication. But the thing is that in the US they're voteing only once or twice a year or every for years. So there is no reason to innovate the voting systems constantly and make them good and trustworfy.
