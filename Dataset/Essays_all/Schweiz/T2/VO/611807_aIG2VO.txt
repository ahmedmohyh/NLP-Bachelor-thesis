In the presentation and the text it is discussed if traditonal voting or technological voting is better. In the presentation they are on the side of the traditonal voting. it is discussed the innacurated counting of votes

They say that computorized voting is not better because people who can not use a computer it is very difficult to vote and so they can easily vote for the wrong candidate. In the text it is said that in the elections were made many voting mistakes because of human errors. The Text says that computers have no errors. But the short presentation says that also computers are programmed by humans and also there humans can make mistakes. But the presentatiom says that the difference is that when someone makes a mistake on a computer thousand votes will not count. So they think that the traditional voting is better. And that is the big difference between the traditional voting and the technological voting.

Nevertheless both types of voting have good and bad things.
