The woman in the listening said, that the computer-voting would be easy for the poeple who are used to technology and who can afford a computer, but for the others it isn't very helpful. There could happen mistakes because of the complicated using. The author of the text thinks the ballots are more risky, because of the many names on one piece of paper, there could easily happen a fault. In the wom opinion there can happen mistakes when they count the ballots by hand, but the computers are also programmed by human beings, so there can also be faults in the programms. These faults could be much more serious, for example there could be thousands of votes deleted and they would not have any physical votings. But in the text it is said that the computerized systems "remove the possibility of human error", so they think there could not be any faults in the systems. In the listening it is also said that the technology in banks and so on are used dayly and we rely on them, but they were improved many times and the votings are only once a year, so they can not be investigated so many times. According to the text, we trust the complex technology without thinking about it, so the technological voting would not be too risky.
