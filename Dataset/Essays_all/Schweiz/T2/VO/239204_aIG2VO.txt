The text and the listening part are both about the problems of the voting system in the United States.

The text explains that there is no other way of solving the problem than computerized systems. Because human counting can lead to various mistakes. It is written that if we rely on computers with important stuff like bank systems it makes no sense to leave out the opportunity of making a better system with less mistakes. In the text they also mentioned the problem of small size of the letters and the long list which can lead to multiple errors.

In this point it contradicts with the listening part because there it's said that if human make mistakes everywhere  who promises that there will be no errors in the systems which are created by humans. it is also said that there is no point in comparing it to banking systems because they are used on a daily basis and they also had mistakes in the beginning.
