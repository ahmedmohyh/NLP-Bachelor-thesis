The woman who is speaking has a rather negative opinion of the computer voting system. Her first argument is, that people who aren't used to use computers will have more problems than with a simpple ballot. For exsmple older people or people who can't afford computers have may never used one before. In the text its said, that the computer voting system is so easy 'you just have to click on the candidats name'. This seems not to be so easy for everyone. Later on in her essay the woman talks about computer errors. If a computer program has an error or a shut down, the fault is much bigger than a counter missing some ballots. If data is lost during a computer error, there has to be a new vote, but if an error in the ballot counting is detected, the counting can simply be restartet. In the text there is mentioned, that computer systems are working very well and without errors in our daily life. The woman counters this  by saying that computer systems didnt work that well, when they were new. So it takes time to find all the errors in  a program and fix them. National votes take place only every second year, so its difficult to build up confidence to the new system.
