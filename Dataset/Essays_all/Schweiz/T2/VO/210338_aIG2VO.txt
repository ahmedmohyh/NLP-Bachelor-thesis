In the presentation there are some good points for the traditional voting system. It's right, people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name and with computerized voting it wouldn't be a problem to magnify the names of the candidates for easier viewing. But what's about old people or poor people who can't afford the money for a computer? What's about my grandparents who don't know how to use the modern technology? Shouldn't they be allowed to vote in the future? This are exactly the problems that I heard too in the presentation, some of them couldn't afford a computer or don't know how to use them. 

Another point is, that officials must count votes one by one and the fact, that they will make mistakes if they have to deal with thousands of ballots. And it's correct, humans can make mistakes. But what's with an error of a computer programm? They can also make mistakes and no one can controll it. Computer systems are used daily and fluently but not the voting system. Maybe one ore two times (sometimes less) per year there's an election or something to vote about. The programms will not be developped as other programms are. So they can have a failure or an error and the people find the problem just at the beginning of a vote.

They should trust more in the power of the human instead of the modern computer technology.
