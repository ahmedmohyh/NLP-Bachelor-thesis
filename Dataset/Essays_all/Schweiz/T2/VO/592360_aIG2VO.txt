In the speech there are discussed positive and negative aspects of computer votin, while in the text it is only said how good it would be. Both agree that computers are easier to vote. But in the speech is also a condition: you have to be used to working with computers. But not everyone can afford a computer, or, especially old people, uses a computer and has therefore no experience with it.
The text states that humans easily make mistakes counting so many ballots, but computers would do it more quickly and with no mistakes. But it isn't mentionned, as in the speech, that the computers are programmed by people. Even though the computer makes no mistakes in running the program, it can be wrong programmed. The effect of that would be much worse than counting one vote wrong.
The last point is, that the systems used every day like banking systems have been developped and corrected many times, before they got so popular. An electronic voting system wom't be used and checked so many times, because it isn't used as much as a banking program.
