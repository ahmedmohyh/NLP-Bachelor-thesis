In the text they say that the current voting system in the United States is inefficient because of error made by people who are counting the votes. It would be more efficient if we used computer programms to count the ballots. The presentation we've heard referes to this point. They say that it is not that easy. Working and voting on a computer is easy for people whor are used to it. For people who are not, it's really complicated. They say that it would be possible that people click on the wrong name if they have a problem with their eyesight or even stop voting which would not be the aim of the new voting system. 

Human failure occures not matter what. If not in the counting of ballots than in making this new voting programm. And this would have horrible consequenses. This would lead to thousands of miscounted votes or even loss of this ballots. The worst: There is no possibility to recount this votes.

We can trust in computer systems in banks etc. because we use them daily and they were improved over years and years. This voting systems would be only use once in two years, so it is hard to develope confidence.
