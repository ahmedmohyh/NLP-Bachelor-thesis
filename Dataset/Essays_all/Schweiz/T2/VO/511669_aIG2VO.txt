The women in the presentation said that voting with computers will not make voting better at all. She said that there are peaople that are not used to computers and will accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. In the text on the otherhand is written that voting with computers is easy to use, more efficient and that people would make less mistakes, because they are using a touchscreen where they just have to click on the name of the candidateIn the text is also written that people with a bad eyesight can magnify the text on the screen for better vision. In the presentation she sais that officials can make mistakes when counting the votes, but she also sais that the code is made by humans. She thinks that an error in the code will led to much heavier problems than misscounting the votes by hand, because in a computer the votes could be lost. The test refers to the financial banking transactions and communication of highly sensitive information. This system work great in every day use and therefore the implemantation of an electronical voting system can be done without big problems. On the other hand the women sais that you cannot compare the financial transactions and the communication system with electronical votes. She sais that the financial system has been developped over time and is used daily. The voting instead is only used several times. She also sais that it is easier to recount the votes when the system without computers is used and that there are people that can't afford a computer for voting.
