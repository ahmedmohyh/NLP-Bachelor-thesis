The woman said that computers are doubtful. They may seem easy but not all the people in the world can use them. Eather ther`re not able to use them because it`s something new for them or the can`t afford a computer. Another reason could be the fear of technology. When a person is afraid of technology, obviously this person won`t have a computer. All these people who are too poor or are afraid can`t vote. This is a contra agrument against the people with bad eyesight, which are named in the text. The woman says aswell that it`s normal that human make mistakes. But computer could make mistakes aswell because they`re developed by human hand. When a human makes a mistake with the counting, it`s possible to recount the votings. But if the computer program has a mistake, it`s far more serious. A recount with computers is impossible. So computer aren`t that trustwothy like the text says it. 
Voting is something that happens every two years. If the countings are now made with computers, the people have to develop a certain trust to the new system. Remember when computers were developed. It was a developmnet that needed time. If the votings are only every two years, it`s very difficult to learn to trust into the voting by computers.
