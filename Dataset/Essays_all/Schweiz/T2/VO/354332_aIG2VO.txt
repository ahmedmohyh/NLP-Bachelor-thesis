Other problems are, that when people count the sheets togehter, it can give mistakes. Now it is the question about computer. Can the computer help us to make less mistakes?

Firstly, not all the human, who live in the Untited state, have a computer. Not all of the people have the basic computer knowledge. So the rate of wrong votes will not at all be better.

In the second place, the computers are programmed by humans. So an error can also happen in a computer. And an error in a computer can count a lot of votes worse, than a human.
