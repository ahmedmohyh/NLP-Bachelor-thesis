First of all, the woman who spoke said that computerized systems have been developped in many years. For example the banking system is used by millions of people daily. So the human knew where to improve the system. In the United States there are votes only once in two years regarding the whole nation and maybe twice in a year regionally so there isn't a lot of time or results to improve to. The IT specialists haven't got much margin of errors. Furthermore the computer is also programmed by humans so it isn't guaranteed that errors in the system are completly isolated. If a human does an error in programming the computer will show us the error. When it comes to voting, only people who are used to useing a computer can vote on a computer because they know how to use a computer while elder people aren't quite used to voting or doing stuff on a computer. Even poor people can't vote on a comuter because they just simply can't afford one. Therefore the state would've to give computers to the poor people. If you now look at the percentage of poor people in the United States it would be so much costs for a system which hasn't proved itself and which is a big risk. Finally it is uncertain whether it would make sense to spend so much money on a system which can make errors as well as a human. The human does it good enough does he?
