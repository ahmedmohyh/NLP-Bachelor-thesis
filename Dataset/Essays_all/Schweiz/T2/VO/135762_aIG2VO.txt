The lecturer says that it is doubtful wether a computerized voting system would actually improve the process and with that disagrees with the critics from the text. She claims that, though it might work for people who are used to working with computers, it will cause more trouble for those who aren't such as elders or people who can't afford a computer. She also claims that these people are very likley to make mistakes and vote for the wrong person or they might not vote at all out of fear of technology. 
Furthermore she says theat human error can still happen even if the votes aren't counted by people anymore because the computer programs that would be used to count the votes are designed by people. With that she disagrees once again with the text which claims that using computer programs would be more accurate. She also says that mistakes in the program would have even worse consequences than miscountings as it would mean that a larger amount of votes would be miscounted and since there is no physical record of the votes recounting is impossible. The argument that we use and trust a similar kind of techonogy in banking is countered by the lecturer by saying that this technology has had far more time to develope and improve since we use it daily and heavily. Voting systems are only used once a year and therefore are more likley to be flawed and would have less time to improve.
