The presentation has the following arguments. First of all, some people cannot use a computer properly, meaning that they do not know how to vote on a computer. Additionally, the might not be able to afford a computer, hence won't be able to vote at all. These two factors I've just mentioned might discourage a few people to vote. Secondly, the program might have technical difficulties, that is errors in the program itself. This will lead to inaccurate voting. The results will be extremely bad because the program might do a huge miscalculation. Lastly, the computer in banks work every day, and have been improved up until now. Voting machines will be used once a year, thus making the risk far greater than the computer in banks. The text says the opposite of the presentation. Following arguments have been listed in the text above. The voting system in the United States is inefficient and inaccurate. That's because the names on a physical list are smaller. Some voters might even have a poor eyesight. This will lead to false voting. Furthermore, real humans count the vote, and because it is a lot, the chances of counting wrong will be higher than counting correctly. However, if machines do the job, the assessment will be better. A machine has a magnifier, thus making the name bigger. Furthermore, the voter has to click on the name to vote. The counting of votes will be faster and done correctly. Lastly, governments and individuals alike trust computers. That's because their bank accounts and other private information are all registered in computers. Ergo, we can conclude that both text and presentation to not agree with eachother.
