In elections, it's often talked about if the votes have been couted correctly. The traditional voting system seems to show problems. But the computerized one isn't a lot better either.
There are a lot of people that can't use a computer, don't know how this technology works or can't even afford one. The opposite side says that the traditional system with the voting sheets is more of a problem, because the writing and the space where you have to tick the box for you're choice of voting is very small. A lot of people cross the wrong candidate because their eyesight isn't good.A computer has far more advantages such as easily choosing the candidate and better reading conditions. 
Then there's also the thing about the counting of the votes. In the audio it was said that computers won't count any better. It's talked about human mistakes in the traditional system. But computers are built by humans. So if there's an error in a program there'll be thousands of miscounted votes. Also a computer can't easily recount the votes if something isn't correct. And even though computers are used in a lot of systems of our life, such as banking, they're not made for the voting of a candidate, because this doesn't happen daily, but only all two years. Elsewhere, computers are used daily and can be improved more and more. But when they only have to work once in such a long time, it's risky to use them.
