The similar point which shows us the text and the presentation is that the current voting system is inefficient because of the people who makes mistake when they choose a person but also because of the people who count the votes and make mistakes like they miss a few for example. 
Additionally, The text says, that the new computersystem is much better for example they have an easy-to-use touc-screen. Overall in their piont of view, electio with the computer improved the traditional system. But the presentation shows us more points of the new computersystem and they oppose with the text. In the presentation they say the new system of election with the computers is even bader. They mention the problem, that maybe not everyone can afford or use a computer and for those people it`s not a fair solution. In addition, they mention the machines also can make mistakes by counting the votes and when they do make mistakes, it`s even worse because recounting is impossible.
