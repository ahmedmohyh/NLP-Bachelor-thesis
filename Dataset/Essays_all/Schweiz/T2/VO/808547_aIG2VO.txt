Today there are broad discussions about the question how votes should be counted.
On one hand, people fear that technology will discourage some people from voting. This people might not work with computers on a regular basis and therefore do not know how to handle such a new system of voting. Others say that not all people can afford a computers and therefore voting would occur in an unfair manner. Not only fear some people this new system due to usage, but also it is not proofed that computers will make less errors than humans. There even could occur serious errors, thousands of votes could be lost or miscounted and what's even worse is that this lost votings are not registered or present in paper-form. People that are agains computerized voting also refuse other opinions that say, that we also use computer systems in every-day life for example in e-banking. The computer critics say that this is a diffrent situation because for example this banking transactions have been improved over many years and are used every day in contrast to vontings that only occur two times a year.
But of course there are also other point of views to this subject. Many people say that computernized votings are essential for the future. What concerns them most is the fear of inaccurtae counting of votes. These errors made by humans could be avoided by computer-systems. It is inevitable that people make mistakes if they have to count votes for several hours, a problem that could be solved by computernized-voting. For people with poor eyesight a new method of voting would also be welcomed. They can have the computer magnify the text for better vieweing. People that would like ghabing the computernized-system reject the arguments, that such a system would be too risky. They argue that technology today is very safe what can be seen if we look at transactions from banks that are done on an everyday basis.
