While it is true that some individuals have got problems with recognising their candidates name and that therefore errors can occur it is questionable weather a computerized system would resolve that issue. For people who arent used to computers or can't afford one but in general people who are more used to the old voting system may have trouble with the computerized method and errors would be made nonetheless. Furthermore it is highly uncertain if computers wouldn't make mistakes counting the votes at all for they were still created and programmed by errormaking humans. And while a human's counting errors would result in some minor number of false votes, if a computer has an error in its programm, thousands of wrong counts may be added to one candidate. And on top of that with using a computerized system recounts are next to impossible.
Finally, regarding the fact that governements and huge corporations already trust and are heavely reliant on computer technology, for example with banking transactions and storing sensitive information, their systems and programs are used intensly on a daily basis. They weren't perfect too when they were first introduced and it took a lot of time to eradicate all errors. And with the computerized counting system only being used every two years on a national scale it is doubtful that it would end up errorless fast enough.
