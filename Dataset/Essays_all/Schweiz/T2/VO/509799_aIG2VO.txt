As already knwon, we can decide the future of our life with our votes. So the best way to save our vote ais that we should modernising our vote systemes.

The best argument for modernising our voting systemes is that the old people who haves pronlems with their eye, sso they could fail while mark the vote task. 
But not the people with exe problem are the only argument. The oter reason that we should intergrate the modern voting system is that in a country is the chanse to fail whil counting the votes big. So we are people and we can laso make mistakes. The result is tjat we have in a counntry more thousens votes that aren't counted. Of cource it could be a problem in the coutries like witzerland whicht the vote system is kind absolute or relative

In conclusion, I am for the intergration of new and moderne vote systemes like electronival systemes which are safe and there is no chanse to fail.
