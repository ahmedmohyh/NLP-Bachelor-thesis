It is something that might will change the hole humanity. We are living in the Age of Technology and everything around us is beginning to change. The computer became an important part of our life and he is getting more and important.
Today our selections are controlled by humans. They plan the hole plot of the selection, they organise it and the claculate the result. It is a lot of work, but it is something usual for humanity. Now we are in the point where the computer also takes this role of the humanity. The computer is much faster than a human in counting the votes, it is also easier to set up a computer programm for the voters.
The computer is raplcing the humanity and there is no one who stops this progress. The human itslf can do a lot of mistakes which is computer can sort out. There is something we ofte forget: A computer is programmed by a human and also this human may wasn't perfect, so why should the computer be perfect? In an important role also might in the selections a computer won't make no mistakes. There are gaps everywehre and we have to learn from them because we just learn when we've done mistakes.
I think that we should trust those machines. It is normal that at the beginning of those changes are more mistakes than at the end. But we should belive in the technology to gain progress with our humanity.
