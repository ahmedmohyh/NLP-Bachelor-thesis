The USA old voting system is said to be inefficient do to human errors by the counting. It can lead to inacurrate couting of votes and some miscounts can appear. This is why the possibility of computerizing the voting is now discussed. Some people say it remove the possibility of human error and the system is quicker and automatic. But the system is beeing critisised by many people. They say that some of the voters just can't afford a computer. This machines are really expensive and when it comes to voting, the population has to have a computer at home. It can also happen that the people are just not comfortable with computers. This motor of research appeared not so long ago and it may still be problematic for people to use it. On one hand, the systems is used daily, which could lead to some problems in the programm itself. On the other hand, can those programms fully trusted? Not to forget is taht the computer systems were invented and made by humans. It is totally possible that some errors in the programms can lead to really problematic counting of votes. This is the reason why some people prefer keeping the old system where they just had to find the name of the candidate they want to choose and make a mark near it. But the problem is that many people accidently choose the wrong candidate because there are so many written. This lead to a counting and a vote that is not completely exact. There are some advantages and some desadvantages on both systems. The old one and the computerized one.
