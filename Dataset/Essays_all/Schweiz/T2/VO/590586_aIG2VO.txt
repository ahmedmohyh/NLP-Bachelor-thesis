In the USA computerized voting is being used in an national election every two years. This voting causes many problems with counting, voting and technic, e.g. the program isn't as good as it should be, because it is made by human hands.
Older people often haven't a good knowledge about computers so they could make mistakes very easily only by not seeing very well. It could be that they click on the wrong button and the election is already done before they really understood what they were doing.
An other problem is the technic. Computer programs are still made by humans so it may be that a öprogram is deffect and the votes will be counted one by one. Or it causes thousands of miscounts. Although the election program is tested so many times there could still be problems with this major computerized voting.

In the text it is said that the other voting (not on the computer) also have miscounts and problems with wrong votes by older people who doesn^e very well.
