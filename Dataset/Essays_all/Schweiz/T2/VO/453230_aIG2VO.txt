In the United States is the current voting system not efficient because of the inaccurate counting of the votes. Counting the votes by hand needs a lot of time and a miscount can damage the result of an election. To avoid miscounts they like to use a new system with the help of the computer. But there are people who can not afford a computer or they do not know how to use it. Who says that computers do not made counting mistakes? If there's a mistake in the programm there would be more miscounts than counting them by hand. It happens that it can come to mistakes when the votes are counted by hand, but there are not every day elections in the country. To count the votes with a computer is too risky.
