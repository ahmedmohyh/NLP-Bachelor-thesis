In the short presentation it was told that voting based on computers isn't maybe that good as the article has told. We got to know a few aspects against computerized voting. It says that this new idea of voting is of course way easier and efficient for people who are used to computers and grew up with them. But for people who have never really used a computer or who just can't afford one, computerized voting becomes a problem. Further we could read in the text, that humans would do lots of mistakes and we have to rely heavily on people who count our votes. Computer would do a much better job. On the other side we were told in the presentation, that all computer systems are programmed by humans and if there were any programm-errors it would have horrible consequences. These consquences would have even more impact on the result and it wouldn't be that easy to do a recounting, because the computer would have the same error function all over again. Technical software has improved over a long period. And it needed to be improved. But the voting system can't be improved that easy, because it is used only once in a year. All these points have been forgotten in the little text.
