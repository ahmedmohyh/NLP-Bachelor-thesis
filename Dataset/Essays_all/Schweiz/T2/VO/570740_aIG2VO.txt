It is said (in the recording) that a computerised voting system has a lot of difficultes and potential dangers (for the whole election). Because first of all not all voters are used to computers and there is a potential that a lot of people do not know how computers work (beacause they cannot afford one or the person is just too old and never really learned how to use a computer). The text says that a computerised voting system would solve lots of prolems. For example people who has problems reading the names on the ballot because of their eyesight. So a computerised system would solve more problems than it would create.
The recorded tetx also sais that a human error would be less dangerous and would have less consequences than a computer error. Because if a human makes a mistake the worst case would be that some lost votes. But if a computer makes a mistake the cosequences could be huge because it could lose way more votes than a human. So the influence on the election would be a lot bigger. Also the system of compuet voting is in its beginning which means there could be  coputer mistakes which are not found yet. On the other hand the written text sais that a computerised voting system wold be a lot safer because it would erase human mistakes. But also the computers are built by humans and are because of that not without mistakes (how the recorded text said).
