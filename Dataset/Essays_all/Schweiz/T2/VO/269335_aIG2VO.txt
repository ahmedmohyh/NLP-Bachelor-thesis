While the written text is supporting the idea of computerized voting, the lecture supports the old, traditional way of voting.

The text argues, that the traditional voting system in the US has often lead to errors and miscounts, helping one side to win the election. The text also mentions that the reasons for the errors are the large ballots. The balllots are first of all very difficult to fill out for people with reduced eyesight. This leads to people voting for candidates they did not intend to vote for. Second, since thousands of ballots have to be manually looked over by a human, mistakes are predestined.

The lecture points out, that the use of computerized voting will not improve the accuracy of the voting, since the computer programs are written by humans and could therefore contain human errors. The lecture goes even further and claims, that the errors made by a computer program could create more serious damage than errors made with the traditional voting system. Moreover, the computerized voting would only be beneficial for people who are used to work with technologie. People who are not used to computers and have a fear of technologie could potentionally be discouraged to vote at all.
