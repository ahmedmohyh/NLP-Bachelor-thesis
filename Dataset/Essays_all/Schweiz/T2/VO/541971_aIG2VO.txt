Should the traditional voting system in the United States be replaced by computerized voting systems?

Critics say yes, because they see many problems which could appear in the voting process. For exemple to find the right name of your candidate and to mark it on a large sheet of paper named 'the ballot'. Voters with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. But can this problem be solved by an computerized system with touchscreen monitor?
The voters are the same as before, people with bad eyesight can also mark the wrong candidate on the new system.
