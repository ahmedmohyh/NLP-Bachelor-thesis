The presentation I just heard about computer voting tells us, that voting based on computers won`t make the situation with miscounted votes any better. In countrary, the speaker is even afraid, that it`ll get worse. 
The text above argues that we use computer technology in everyday life to handle banking transactions and communications with sometimes sensitive information. It says that we can perfectly entrust computers with our voting because they are machines and are freed from human flaws. 
However the person holding the presentation argues, that computers are programmed by real human beeings, so they can make mistakes too. And sometimes if a computersystem is misprogrammed it`ll even be worse than with the ballot`s system. Considering the fact that the votes won`t be recorded anywhere else than the computer could result in miscounting of large numbers of votes or, in a worst case situation, in the loss of thousands and thousands of votes. The systems we use dayly today weren`t flawless from the beginning. But because we use them everyday we were able to improve them fast and make them accurate and trustworthy.
However in the US, there`s a nationwide voting only every two years. And it`s only held twice a year in most districts. 
Furthermore the presentator argues that some people will be prevented from voting, for example people that can`t afford a computer or those that don`t use them everyday and get scared because of technology. The text doesn`t see there a problem at all. It even sees an improvement for the people that have poor eyesight. 
In my opinion it doesn`t matter how they improve the voting system in the US, as long as they improve it in a positive way for everybody.
