In this presentation the woman says that even if the human, if they count it by hand are doing faults. It is not true that a computerprogramm won't do any faults. So she thinks it would be even worst if computerprogramms would count them. She relies on her conclusion with a simple fact: the computerized voting machine has to be programmed by humans and humans are doing mistakes. So if the machine would have an error, resulted in mistakes by the programming, it would result in a much bigger differents in the final voting. 
In this text it is told that the traditional system isn't good because the votes are counted by humans, and because there are that many votes it is more likely to get wrong counts. An other reason why this system isn't that great is because if you're a bit older and you can't see that great or you have some other problemes, it can be that you choose the wrong mark. It would be much clearer and easyier to just touch a touchscreen with bigger icons and pictures.
