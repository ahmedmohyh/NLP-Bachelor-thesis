The text addresses the issue of the inaccurate voting systems in the US, as does the oral presentation. However, their opinions on the matter diverge greatly. 
While the oral presenter recognises the problems with current voting systems, she is not convinced that switching to a computer-based system would be a better option. In fact, she seems to be very sceptical of technology. The writer of the text makes it clear that they think replacing the current system with a computer-based substitute would be for the better.
Firstly, the text argues that using the computer may actually be easier for people with poor eyesight, since the touchscreen would allow them to choose the name of their preferred candidate in a much less complicated way than if they'd do it by hand. The presenter is concerned that people who aren't used to computers would find the voting process more difficult, and may even feel discouraged from voting alltogether.
The text claims that the computer would be better at counting the votes, since human error is almost inevitable in a big election. Again, the oral presenter disagrees, saying that if something goes wrong with the programme, the resulting errors may be far greater. They also mention that if such an error should happen, a recount would be impossible.
Furthermore, the presenter makes the point that while we may trust in technology in other areas (e-banking, etc.), we had a lot of time to improve on those technologies. Since elections only happen sporadically in the US, perfecting the digital voting system would simply take too long.
