Voting systems

I have heard and read two different oppinions about voting systems.  
The text says that the computerized votins machines are better, because the humans make much more mistakes. The people could vote for the wrong candidate because their eyesight isn't good. Or the people who count the votes can make mistakes. They need to count the votes one by one. And than the count must be controled by another person, to make shure that the result of the first count is right. This voting system needs much more attention and concentration. So they think that the computer system is more shure, because it's a machine which calculate the votes and this machine is much more quicker than people haven't to find the name of the canditate they will coose in a large sheet of paper, the have just to touch the candidates name on their computer.
But in the presentation they have another oppinion. The woman explains that the computer system istn't better. This system can also make mistakes. Because the computerized voting machines are made by persons and this persons could also have made mistakes. And nobody controls the machine. 
Also it has people who arent safe with computers. They aren't sympathized with technology and maybe don't vote than.
