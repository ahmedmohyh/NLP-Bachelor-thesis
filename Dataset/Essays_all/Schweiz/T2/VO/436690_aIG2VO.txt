An election is taking place. So now is the question how people should vote. With a computer easy voting or a current voting system. 

The arrguments in the text are for the computer voting because this gives the officials less work and people with poor eyesight can better see it on a screen than on a paper. Computer systems are in order to remove the possibility of human error. The whole election would give less work for the officiers because the computer count it itselve. 

In the presentation about this theme there are many arguments against the coputer system that they want to use for an elecion. Not everybody has a copmputer at home. This is the first problem. Poor people, what are they doing?
Humans can control the election with this voting system. And if there is an error in the system the whole voting was for nothing. If something in the computer system goes wrong they have after that no votes anymore. This is the next problem that they said in the presentation. 

So both election systems has good and bad points and argum.
