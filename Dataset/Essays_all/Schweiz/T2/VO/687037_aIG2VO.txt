The voting system in the Unated States is very traditional. They have to mark the name they vote for. After that the results are counted by hand. It is normal that a human makes mistakes. But if their is a miscount by the voting it would be heavy. The critisizers want the people make it with computers. It would be more sure and easier. 
But not all people which do actually vote can handle with a computer. They have a lot of trouble with the technologie of our decade. There are also a lot of men and women who wouldn't vote because their afraid of using computers. Think of all the people who has ever used a computer their whole life.
Another point is that the computerprogram is made of the humans too. So it may have an error in the program. You can't be sure.
