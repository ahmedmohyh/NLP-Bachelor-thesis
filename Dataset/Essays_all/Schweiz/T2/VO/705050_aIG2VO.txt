Nowadays computers are used on a regular basis, nearly for everything. They are useful in many situation, they can calculate lager numbers and keep a lot of important information and an important part is that, they are most of the time very efficient and correct. But should they be used in every situation? 
For example in the voting system. There are many critics about the traditional voting system, for example that people with poor eyesight can easely mark the wrong name and in such situations aswhile computers bring  many advantages. But there are also some critics about the computerized voting. the most important point ist the danger of miscounts. If there is a miscount in the traditional voting system it's normally just a few votes but if the computer makes a miscount the outcome is imense and drastic. Thousends of votes can go lost for example a whole election can be manipulated. even if computers are very thrustworthy nowadays, there can always go something wrong.
Furthermore the elections in America are only once a year. Of course counting all the votes by hand is a hard job but it's is a way to keep the tradition and not let the computers overtake our lifes.
