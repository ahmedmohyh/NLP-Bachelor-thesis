One of the arguemnts in the audio was that people would not have access to computers or do not know how to use computers. But nowadays in the United States almost everyone has access to the internet and the easy-to-use touch-screen makes the voting easier with people with poor eyesight..

The second argument in the audio is that errors of the a computer can be far more inaccurate than human eroors due to the fact that if counting up votes leads to an extremely low innaccuracy which has no effect. The advanced computer technology makes the counting automatically and cannot have errors.
