In America they discuss wether the voting system shouldchange from the traditional way to a computer voting system. As for any kind of change, there are pro's and con's.
If they change the system, older people will have problems with the technology because they are not used to it. But if you do it the traditional way, older people will also have problems with their eyes, because they need to look for the candidates and need to make a cross right next to them. Accidently, they could choose the wrong person.
A pro for the computers is that there won't be any errors in counting. But that's not true, because even though there won't be any humans counting the votes themselves, there will be still humans programming the voting system. The errors could be even worse because it could delete every vote and a recount wouldn't be possible, because there is no physical proof of the deleted vote. 
Another argument is that it is not necessary to have that much of an effort. In the USA there is only a national voting once every two years. It would be a waste of time and money.
