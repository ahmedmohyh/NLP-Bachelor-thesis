In the text they mentioned all the benefits of computerized voting whereas in the presentation they talked about the shortcommings of this system.
 The writer of the text argued that, people often vote for the wrong candidate because they  can't read propperly or they accidently choose the wrong person, and if computers were used people could alwayas magnify the names or use a search engine to search for theire candidate. The cons of a computerized system are that people who aren't used to computers or who can't afford to buy one, wouldn't be able to vote or refuse it.

The text also mentioned that there is not a big risk of the votes being manipulated because we are using this technoligiy every day with e-banking but the presentation mentioned that the banking systhems were used on a daly bases and had been improofed over the years whereas the voting system in the USA is oly used every four years and won't be flawless fromm the beginning on.
