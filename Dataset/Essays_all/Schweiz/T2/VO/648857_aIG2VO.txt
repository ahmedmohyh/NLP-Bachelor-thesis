The most uf us get in touch with the voting system in the United States some months ago, when Trump became the new president. But there's a lot of critic against the voting system. But is it sure that the idea for a another system are pretending from mistakes?

The author of the text complains about the large sheet of paper containing many names. The people have to make a small mark next to the name of the person for who they want to vote. But that's quite difficult for people with poor eyesight. They can easyily mark the wrong name. The idea to work against this problem is to use computerized voting machines. They have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. To record a vote you have just touch to the candidate's name.
But in the presentation the speaker critizies this computer voting. For people who don't know how to use a computer is the computerized system impossible to use. They can't vote. 
A disadvantage of the traditional voting system are the mistakes. Because of the counters. They have to deal with thousands of ballots. It's uninevitable to make mistakes.
Also the speaker sees the struggle with the mistakes. But she said if a computer makes a mistake there are thousands of errors but if a person count something wrong then it's just one mistake. On top of that the computerized-systems don't work fluently from the beginning. And if these systems are only used all four years the possibilty that they don't want without problems is very small.
