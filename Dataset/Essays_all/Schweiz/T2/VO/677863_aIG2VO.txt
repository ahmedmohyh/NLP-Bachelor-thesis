In the text it is stated that the traditional voting system in the USA is inefficient and inaccurately, a computerized voting system would be much better to remove the possibility of human error. On the paper one can quickly miss a line and accidentally vote for the wrong person, on the computer on the other hand one only has to click on the name to vote and the one can zoom in if there are problems with the eye sight. which is much better than traditional voting. 

The lecture on the other hand states that even though there might be a few ballots wrongly counted because of human mistakes, the computer's programm could be wronly installed. And that would be an even worse problem because thousands of votes might not be counted and a recount isn't possible because there's no hard copies of the votes. Only the middle class and priviledged people are able to purchase a computer, but the lower class and the elder can't or don't want to buy a computer and therefore they aren't used to the whole technology. When it would be time to go out to vote, the are discouraged because they don't understand how to work it and then there's less votes.

The lecture undestands that there are e-banking programs etc. on the internet which are used daily without any problem, but those are used so much that they are frequently improved to be handled very easily by a lot of people. But a country doesn't vote every day, which makes it hard to find flaws in the programming and try to improve them. 

The text really likes the idea of computerized testing but they don't think as far as in the lecture where they explain why it might not work. The text likes the idea of going with the flow of the time. Whereas the lecturer has a rather critical point of view on the subject of technology.
