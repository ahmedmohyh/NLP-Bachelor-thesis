The person who presented his arguments, was against the new voting system. One point was, that the new system with voting at coumputers would only be easy for people who are used to computers. Others, especially older people would be descouraged of voting because of the fear of technical devices. Critics also proclame, that we can't be sure, that computers are more intelligent than we are, because they are developped from the human beings. An other argumet was,that the programm of technical voting wouldn't be so great like for example the bank systems, because they wouldn't be used every day and wouldn't be so improved. A last critical point was, that a mistake in the programm would cause about 1000 misscounted votes, much more than the misscountings a human would do. The controverse arguments in the text were, that with the traditional voting system,were caused many missvotings by people who don't see very well, and many mistakes by counting the ballots of voting papers.The new system, so they say,would be much easier, efficient and trustworthy. The also don't see the computer programms as a problem, because they say, that we can trust them, when we also trust for example the banking transactions.
