The first argument in the lecture was that for people who do not use the computer it more difficult to watch in the new system than in the traditional one. Some peolpe perhaps do not even vote anymore because the fear of computers is too big. Comparing this argument with the text we see that choosing the candidate you want to vote for is easier but only for the persons with computer skills. For the others it is more difficult. 
In the text it is said that computers will count the votes better than humans because they remove the possibility of human errors . In the lecture this fact is doubted. Do computers really do a better job? They are programmed by humans, so there can be errors in the system. And if this take place not just one or two votes will be counted wrong. So errors in computer systems can lead to much bigger problems than two wrong counted ballots.
The lecture has also doubts in an other point. Are computer systems trustworthy? Of course they work for E Banking and communication. But this services we use every day. Does they work when they come up immedeatly? No. They have to be developped. A election system is only used every two year and also this will not work the first time. And then it will be used in two years. So it can never develop confidence.
