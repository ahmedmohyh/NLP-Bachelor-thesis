In the oral part they critized the computer voting. She said, that there are some errors in the traditional voting system, because we are all humans and humans make mistakes. But who will guarantee us, that the computer voting systems doesn`t make mistakes? It can be an easier way to vote, but only for them who use the computers and who knows, how they are working. If a mistakes happens in a computerized system, thousands other votes are involved. So there is a lot more to do, if a mistakes happens in a computersystem. We use also electronic systems for the banking. But that we use nearly every day and there it needed a lot of time, that most of the person understood the e-banking. The elections are only one or two times a year. A lot of the people will forget how the system works.

So the difference between the two statements is, that the written part is for a computerized voting system and the oral part gives some important reasons, why the the computrsystem isn`t better than the traditional one. The written part stands, that it can be easier to have computerized systems and that we can avoid a lot of mistakes with this system. The oral part says that both systems have advantages and disadvantages. But if a mistakes happens in the computerized system, the consequences are much harder.
