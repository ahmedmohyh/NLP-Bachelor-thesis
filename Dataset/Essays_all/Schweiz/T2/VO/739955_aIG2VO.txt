In comparison to the text, the woman in the listening is rather against the computerized voting system. As the text says, there can be counting mistakes in the traditional voting system, which could lead to a wrong winner. This could also happen in the computerized system. Computers are made by humans so there could be an error in the whole computer system which could lead to that thousands of votes are countet wrong.

Another aspect is, that the text doesn't take care to the old-fashioned or poor people. What if you can't afford a computer or don't own a computer? In the traditional voting system everybody is able to vote.

A postitiv aspect in the computerized system is that people who can't see really good do have the opinion to read it better on the computer than on the ballots, so it is less possible that these peolpe tick the wrong name.

Also to mention is, that everybody is already used to the tradtitional system and it's working well since a long time. The computerized system had to be inprooven over the last years and isn't flawless nowadays.
