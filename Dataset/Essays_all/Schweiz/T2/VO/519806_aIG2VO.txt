The text says that computer voting systems are inefficent and that they incourate counting votes. And in the listening they said that the computer voting raised up. Thats a difference between these two statements. But in both texts were said that voting by hand could also have much errors eg. that old people with a poor eyesight make more mistakes or that they couldn't handle with a computer. But also the computer could have mistakes as in  the texts said. They could misscount votes or improve them. But lots of people prefer to vote by hand as in the written text said. It's also hard to look at the handwritten votes because there are sometimes a bad handwritten part (Line 8). As in the written texs said is the computer voting more save than the handwritten voting (Line 10). But as in the listening they said that the computer also make improved votes or that the computer misscount. So the written text is not in the same opinion as the listenting text. Most people don't trust in the computer system voting because they are afraid of personal data using as in the written text described. So the written text sais that computer votung isn't helpful and the listening said that the computer voting is in process. It's important that the older generation learn to manage the use of the computer voting because they have lots of problems in the life because everywhere is today something with computer. For example to buy a ticket for the train.
