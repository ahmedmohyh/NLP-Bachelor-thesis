Both, the text and the audio are about elections and how we should count the votings in future. 

The text says, that we should use a new technologie on cumputers to count the votings on a election. It is a great problem that poor eyesighted people could vote for the wrong one, because of their eyes. The names of the canditates are so close that it is pretty dificult to chose the right one. Furthermore we need to consider that the counting of the election take much time and there is the risk that the humans count false. 

On the other hand side the audio tells that also computerprogramms can cause faults at the counting too. The programms are made by humans and humans are the one's who make faults. An other problem of the Computer technologie is, that there are still people which don't use computer and can't handle them. 

In conclusion the reason against the computer tecnologie are more logical, because just because the poor eyed people vote on a computer they can't see more. And the argument, that programms also can cause faults make sense.
