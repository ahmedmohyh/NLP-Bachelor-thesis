It's been quite a long time since the first computer was made and the technology developed a lot. The reason why we can trust our computers in banking transactions and a lot of other things is because the programms changed a lot over the years and got better and better. A new system which would count votes at an election could make mistakes way easier because it would be new and not well developed yet. On the other hand people often count the votes wrong or forget some what leads to inaccurate results.
Also there are a lot of people which can't afford a computer or don't know how to use one. How should they vote? Of course it is complicated sometimes to find your favourite candidate in a huge list of people and also to set the cross at the right place if all the names are so close together. But let's admit that everyone is able to set a tick at a right place on a piece of paper if the person just takes her time whilst not everyone is able to use a computer.
Computer votings are supposed to be way faster but why does it always have to be so fast? In the end it is the result that counts no matter if we know the result a few minutes later or the day after.
