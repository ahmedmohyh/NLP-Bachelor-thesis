The referee is a critic of the in the text supported opinion that a computer based voting system would be better suited for the United States' voting. 
She doubts that an electronic system would simplify voting. While the text suggests that old people with poor eyesight may tick the wrong box on the ballot, she thinks that it would be too difficult for those people to use a computer since they have never or only rarely used one before. These people would make even more mistakes when filling in the ballot or even stop voting at all. 
Another point made is the occurence of human error. It is criticised in the text that the staff that counts the votes makes mistakes and therefore miscounts occur. A computer system could prevent such miscounts. But the referee believes that the errors that might occur in a computer system would be even worse than those of today's counts. Since computers are programmed by human beings, errors will occur and opposed to physical ballots the votes made with a computer system cannot be recounted. 
The text states that secure systems also work with e-banking so it should work for voting as well. According to the referee it took quite a while to develop these systems. As they are used every day, the time to improve them was much shorter than the time it would take to improve a secure system that is only used twice a year.
