Nowerdays you have to mark the candidate you are voting for on a huge paper. It is difficult to find this candidate and people with bad eyesight sometimes mark the wrong candidate. In a thight vote this can cause wrong results. Computers would be much easier to handle and people with bad eyesight would see better what they do. The critics argumenent that the computer voting system would cause more problems due to the people, wich are not used to work with a computer. Maybe those people would not vote any longer.

Critics from the old voting system say that mistakes often are made while counting the votes. A computer wouldent do any mistakes in caunting votes. Whreas others say, if a computer did a mistake, it would cause a big problem. The computer may deleted all the votes and than it would not be possibel to just count one more time. Computers are programmed by humens, so those people may cause system errors.

For banking transactions computer systems are widely accepted. It is normal to do internet banking.
