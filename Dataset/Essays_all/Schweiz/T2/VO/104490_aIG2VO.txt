In the text is said that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. The solution are computerized voting systems. But the speaker explained that this is doubtful. The advantage of a computer is that people with a poor eyesight can easily find their candidate. To cast a vote they only need to touch the candidate’s name. On the other side people who aren't used to computers will have troubles. They could be discouraged to vote. In addition the speaker said that human errors in programs lead to bigger mistakes than just counting errors. Furthermore a computer recount is impossible. The text asks why we trust other complex computer technology every day without giving it a thought. The response from the speaker is clear. The computer technology we use for banking transactions is used daily and is getting better and better. Computerized voting systems would only get used once in a while.
