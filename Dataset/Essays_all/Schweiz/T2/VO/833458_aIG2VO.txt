Computerized voting systems are only easier for people who can already deal with computers, but what is with old people or poor peolpe who can not afford a computer?

They also say that humans make mistakes, but when a mistakes occurs in a computer programm, many more votes are being deytroyed or lost. The text tells us that computerized programms are better because they can count the votes way faster and that they can detect an error made by humans. We also deal on our  daily bases with computer programms for our bank account and ebanking, so it is not dangerous at all.

In the presentation they tell us that the programms for the votes aren`t as advanced and safe like the banking programms are, because we use the voting programm just one time in two years. So they are not as advanced as the banking programms are who are used on a daily base.

An other argument is that computer programms also make mistakes because they are designed and programmed by humans, so they are not as safe as they seem to be. 

A good argument from the text seems to be that thousands of votes have to be counted by people by hand and when errors accur and they are detected late, a long and expensive recount has to take place. In contrast to that the computers would detect the errors by themselves and remove them automatically and quick.
