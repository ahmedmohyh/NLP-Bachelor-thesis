In the heraring- part the woman told us that the traditional voting system is in many ways better than with the new computerized voting machines. For people, who work with computers everyday, it would be easy for them. But for people, who don't can work with a computer there would be many problems. The fear of the technology is still a big theme for many persons. The argument that that the system with computers are safer because of the fact that human make mistakes isn't a good one. Who is it, who has programmed the computer systems? The humans programmed the computer, so there are mistakes. The argument that we already trust the technology by using it in banking transactions and communications of highly sensitive information is true, but we have to say that these systems were improved and improved until they were like they are now. For a voting we havn't a second chance to improve the system.
 In the text there are arguments like the fact that with the old vonting system it is that they rely heavily on people to count the votes and it would be much easier for a computer. They say the new system would be easier to use for people because of the easy-to-us touch-screen technology. Forthermore we already use computer system in banking and communication of highly sensitive information. Why should we not trust then the technology in voting?
