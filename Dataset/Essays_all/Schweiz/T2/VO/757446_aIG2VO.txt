There are a lot of pro and contra arguments for both systems, the traditional and the computerized. In the listening you heard about the contra arguments. For the computerized voting you need to have a computer. But what about poor people who cant't afford a computer? And what about people, especially older people who aren't grown up with the era of digitalisation and don't know how to use a computer? These people are discouraged of voting because of fear. So is it fair to them  to computerize the voting?

In banking and communication the digitalised system is used dailyand heavily. The programmes have been written by humans. Because no human is free of mistakes the programmes have been checked and repaired to have the right function. But with the start of the computerized system you can have errors in the newly programme, so that it's possible, that the votes can get lost or miscounted. Furthermore the votes are just two times a year for national votings in the USA.

The contra arguments for the traditional system are the possibility of selecting the wrong candidate and to have a mistake in counting the votes. Older people with poor eyesight often mark the wrong name. And there is no way, that this problem can be removed with the method of traditional voting.
