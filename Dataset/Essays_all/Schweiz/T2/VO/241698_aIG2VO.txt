On the one hand side this essay above critisises old voting systems in the US. They claim new and better technologies like the computerized voting machines. According to the essay, it makes life easier for people because they can simply touch the candidate's name on the screen and it will be registered automatically. Additionally, with new computer systems you can get rid of couting errors caused by human mistakes which makes the election more reliable. 

On the other side, conservatives come up with the argument that computerized ones might even pose a threat to people who fear new technologies because they're not experienced with computers so you'd start losing a couple thousands of voters. 
In case there's a mistake from the computer the results would be falsified heavily. 
Due to the fact that there haven't taken place enough elections to prove the  copmuters reliability they still can't garantee to be perfect and as long as we can't rely on them to a 100% we need to hold on to our old-fashioned techniques.
