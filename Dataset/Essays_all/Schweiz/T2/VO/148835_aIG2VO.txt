Lataley there has been a controversy about the voting system in the United Staates. Critics complain that the old voting system should be raplaced by a computerized system.

Surely there are quite some advateges but it also contains a high risque.
For example what do people do if they do not use compters one regualr bases or if they are even afraid of tecnology. They can easly vote for the wrong candiadate or do not want to vote at all.On the other hand to use a touch-screen tecnology where you just have to clic the candidates name is easier for those with bad eyesight. 

Then there is this problem with the manual counting. Some peoble say that is not better to use computer systems in order to prevent counting mistakes. It is clear that the humans make mistakes but the computer programms are also developed by humans. A miskae in a programm could be far more worse than a human error. 

At least some people say that you have to improve such new ideas over a long periode. But it is hadly sufficient because how can you improve some thing that takes place only all two years. But without giving at a try there
