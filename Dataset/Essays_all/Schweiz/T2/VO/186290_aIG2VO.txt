Critics do not say that the computerized voiting system is better. They think that the traditional voiting does less mistakes than the computerized.
For people who are not used with computers, it would be much more complicated. That means that they can get in trouble, when they have a display in front of them, which they didn't use that much or never in their life before. 

It's true that humans do mistakes when they count all of the ballots. But the computers can do also mistakes. Then the computers are made by humans. So if the humans did a mistakes while they created the computer, the computer will do automaticlly mistakes. So it's not sure, that the conmputer count correct and the humans do not.

A big plus for the traditional countig is, that they can recount the ballots. If they know, that they did a mistakes, they can start counting again. it takes more time but they have the chance to do it.
If the computer counted wrong, you can not find the mistakes. And if there is an error with the computer, the counting would me much more wrong than the one of humans.
