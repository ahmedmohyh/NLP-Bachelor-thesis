A lot of people are suspicious when it comes to voting. They are scared of misscounts and choosing the wrong candidate. Does the computerized voting make the voting better?

They say that in traditional voting there are a lot of miscounts because the votes rely heavily on people who count the votes. With hundred thousands of counting votes the counters could easily get tired and they could make more mistakes. The computerized system removes the possibility of human failure. We know that humans make a lot of mistakes and the computer programm is also programmed by humans. An error in the traditional voting would just cause that they have to recount the votes, which would take a lot of time. But an error in the computer system would cause a much bigger problem, because thousands of votes could be go missing.
But computerised voting are easy-to-use. The voters can't choose the wrong candidate like in the paper voting. Other than in the traditional voting where the names of the candidates are written very small, in the computerized voting the names of the candidate are written really big and you just have to touch the screen. But people without any experience with computers could have difficulties of using the computer.

We already rely so much things on computers like in the market or bank business and there the computers make no mistakes. But they are used everyday not like a voting which happends every fourth year. I think at the beggining the computerized voting will have troubles but from time to time they will develop and get more popular by the people.
