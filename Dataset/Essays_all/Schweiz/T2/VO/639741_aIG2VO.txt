In the lecture the woman taks about the negative aspects of computerised voting. The text says the computerised voting is easier, you can even magnify the names for earier viewing. She on the other hand says it may be easier for the people who are already used to computers but not for those who aren't. For them it's worse because thy don't know how computers work,they could cast the wrong vote because they clicked the worng button. They might not even have one because they can't afford them, which manipulates the voting because not everyone is voting.
In the text it's said that with the computers there are less errors than when it's done by humans. Humans can easily do mistakes with counting. She also talks about the human errors saying the computers are programmed by humans. If there's an error in the system the consequences are much worse than a few counting mistakes, thousands of votey could get lost and there can't be a recounting. 
Also it's not easy to trust those computer systems because those systems are only used once in two years, they aren't as improved as the systems we use every day like for banking. Those systems weren't that efficient in the beginning, they had to evolve.
