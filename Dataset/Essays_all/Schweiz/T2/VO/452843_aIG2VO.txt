Computerized voting won't make voting any better. It might be true that the normal handwriting voting cause some difficulties, because of some people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate or that the people who count the votes make mistakes on counting each and every vote. 

Nevertheless a computer could cause damage to a way higher expand. The whole system could crash and in case that happens,not just a few votes would go missing.In a crash, it would be impossible to recount and get the information again. 
The complex computer technology that we use everyday (in a bank for example) is used daily and heavily and it has been improved over the years. But the election in the US is only once every two years nationally and this computer system would hardly be sufficient. 

The people who accidentally vote for the wrong candidate contain such a small percentage compared to people who can't afford a computer. Also, a lot of the people mostly don't have a large experience with technical knowledge.They might even have a fear of technology and much rather prefer the old system with the ballots.

All in all we shouldn't make things even more complicated. We should stick with the old- quite effective- system and concentrate whilst we fill out our candidate in preference in order to not let any mistakes happen.
