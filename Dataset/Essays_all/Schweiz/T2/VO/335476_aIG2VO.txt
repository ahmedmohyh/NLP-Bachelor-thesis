The given passage states that the computerized voting would be better than the traditional voting, because it would be easier and faster to count the votes. Plus, a computer cannot make any mistakes, whereas officials can miscount a ballot or two. 
Another Advantage is that people with poor eyesight cannot make mistakes by accidentally marking the wrong name, because they can magnify the name on the computer. 

 The heard presentation, on the other hand, states that the computerized voting has just as many problems as the traditional voting and is no better than the traditional. Many people are not used to a computer or technology in general. Some even fear technology, so they do not vote at all. 
Another disadvantage is that a computer can make mistakes as well and these mistakes have even worse consequences than the mistakes made by a official, because if a computer makes a mistake, the whole programm has an error in it and all the systems would not work. Plus, the computers and their systems need improvement. The people in the United States only vote one time in four years, so the imporvements do not seem neccessary.
