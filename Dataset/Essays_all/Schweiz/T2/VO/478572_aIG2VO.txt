If you make the voting by hand, it is possible that you chose the wrong candidade cause of a poor eyesight and you have to find the candidade you want to vote for. Now, many critics say, that it is easier to make the voting on computers. But what does someone who can not afford a computer. You would get in trouble very fast. Now you can say, that computers make much less mistakes and are much more serious than a human, but even computers are made by human who make more mistakes. If there is an error in the computer made by an human, it could happen that thousands of fake votings will be counted.
