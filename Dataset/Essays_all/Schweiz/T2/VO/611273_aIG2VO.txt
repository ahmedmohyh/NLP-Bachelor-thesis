Voting: The election and voting of governes is everytime a big thing because it happens only a few time. The people can change a lot with only one election. In every election are happening mistakes. In the US is used a traditional esystem, where the people accidentally vote for the wrong canditate. This system is also very inefficient because people have to count the votes and as we know, people make mistakes, especially under pressure. It says, it would be much easier to have a touch screen system, with which the computers count the votes.
In a different way you can say, that it is not easy for people, who do not use computers very often. For them it would be a disadvanatge. An other problem is, if a computer system has done an error while an election, it would be worse. A human does maybe a few mistakes, but a computer can make 1000 of errors at the same time. 
A voting is only every 2 years and these system are not that often used as par example a bank system with sensitive informations.
