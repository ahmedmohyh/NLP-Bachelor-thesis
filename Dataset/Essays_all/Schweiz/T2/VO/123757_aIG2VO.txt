First, the presentation sayd that computer aren't a better solution than tradiotionally voting. Maybe some people can't afford a computer or don't know how to handle a computer. In the text passage they say that everybody kwows how to use our current technology because they work on a computer every day.
They also said that computer will make mistakes too and that it will be better when the system doesn't change. You can do mistakes more easily by just tipping threw these lists on the computer.
Another big problem is that when everybody is going to vote by computer and there is instantly an error on thousands of computers, so you won't have an accurate counting. computers can just evitate human errors and not technical faults. When there's for exemple a lack of energy in a whole state, you haven't got a clue how of what their opinion and vote is. So because of these things it's more popular to use the current voting system by handwriting like most of the countries on earth do.
