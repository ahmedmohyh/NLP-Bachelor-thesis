To begin with there are many critics of the current american voting systems. They are said to be inefficient and to increase the inaccuracy. These inaccuracy comes from the human errors that are inevitable like people with bad eyesight which leads to falsely marked candidats on the ballot with its tiny text. But there are also people that are unfamiliar with the for voting used technology. The error of falsely counting the votes can occur in human counting as well as in computerized counting because the computers are programmed by humans. These human made programming errors could cause much more damage than the simple miscount, especially because there is no physical evidence of the vote left for a recount. All the similar systems used for banking transactions were developped in a very long phase of testing and improving based on mistakes. Hence these systems have to be constantely tested and improved which is very difficult in a national election that is very important and takes place only once in a while.
