One of the arguments is that people who are not used to the modern technology have it hard to vote. People who don't use computers or smartphones on a daily basis might not know how to vote, or they are afraid of not knowing what to do and don't even try to vote. This argument disagrees with the text. In the text it says that computers can help the people to vote, they can magnify the names for people with bad eyesight and make it easier and faster to vote.
In the speech she also said that it is not impossible to have mistakes in a computer program, because they were written by humans. And if an error happens it is more severe because it can miscount or even delete thousands of  votes and the officials mistakes in counting only influence a few votes. Also are the progremes in banking used on a daily basis and had some mistakes in the beginning, which could decide a presidential election. The voting computers wouldn't be used often, in the most states just every two years. This arguments answer to the text as it says there that the computers won't make any mistakes in counting like humans and will work more quickly. The text also said that we trust computers in banking and in keeping sensitive information so we can trust them also in elections.
