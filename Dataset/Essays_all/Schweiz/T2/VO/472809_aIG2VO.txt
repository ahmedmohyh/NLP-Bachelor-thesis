Voting
In the text it is said that a lot of people think that the traditional voting in the USA is inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of voting. Critics of this system say that it would be better the use computers for voting instead of the traditional sheets because of the fear of the possibly of human errors. On the other hand, in the presentation, it was also mentioned that with a computerized voting system mistakes could be even worse beacause it isn't possible to do a recounting. It is said that it's true that humans make mistakes but computers are created by humans, so why isn't it possible for computer to make mistakes?
The text says that for people with poor eyesight it really difficult to mark the ballots because they are written so tiny. With a voting by computers they wouldn't have this troubles anymore. The presentation agrees with this point but it is mentioned that for people who aren't used to computer a computerized voting system would be terrible because they don't know how to use a computer and they would make mistakes. 
In the text the fact comes up that critics of a computerized voting system say that it is to risky and to untrustworthy. The text doesn't understand this point of view because it says that on the other hand we use computers everyday for banking transactions or other things.
The presentation says thats true but we have had a lot of time to improve computers for banking transactions while we haven't had this time for computer for voting.
