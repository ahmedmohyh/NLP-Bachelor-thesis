The presentation was about the question wether they should introduce technology in the voting process or not.
The text mentiones two main problems that the voting system faces right now.First,that the voters have to search for their candidate on the ballot and then accidentally choose the wrong one,because the letters are so small.Computers could better the situation,because voters would be able to zoom in and then pick the right candidate.
Secondly,there sometimes occure counting errors because the officials forget about some ballots.If everything would be automatic,there would be no chance of human error.
But is that really true?Do computers guarantee a 100% errorfree resultate? The presentation said no.
The first argument is,that not everyone in the country owns a computer,or knows how to use one.This would either lead to errors in the voting process,because the people aren`t able to pick the right candidate properly, or many people would be scared of voting because they are uncertain in using technology.
Also the argument with the human errors was exterminated by the presentation.The woman said,that in the end all technology is programmed by humans.If someone makes a mistake while programming a voting system,this could have fatal consquences and obviously much bigger ones,than some ballots being forgotten.
What the text also talked about,was that we use technology everyday in so many different ways and why would we then not use it in voting? The woman said,that we`ve been using technology everyday for so long,in order to get to the point we are now.The problem with voting is that it happens once every second year so there isn`t that system with learning by doing,because it counts once and then you`ll have to wait two years.
