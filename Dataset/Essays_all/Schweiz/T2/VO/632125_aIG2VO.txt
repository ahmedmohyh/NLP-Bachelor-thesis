"Computerized voting may sound good at first but it will not make voting better." is the main theme of the presentation. Even though in traditional voting some people may vote wrong because of bad eyesight, people who are not used to computers will vote wrong too or just not vote at all.
People make mistakes and so do people programming computers. A person counting vote may miss a few ballots or count wrong but if a computer has a bad code the error may be huge. There is no physical recount of the votes and hundreds of votes could be lost.
And even though it is true that our society trust computers with banks or in communication these systems get used daily and had to be optimized in a long period of time. Voting however happens every few years and does not have this time to become optimized.
In conclusion it is clear that the presentation was an answer to the written text. The writer of the text clearly wants computerized voting and wrote some arguments for it. The presentator then answered and explained why she thinks computerized voting is second to traditional voting.
