There are a few facts that are against computerized voting machines like the maybe unknown usage of computers, the human error in the program, no recount possibilities and the trial and error phase of the technology.
It is true that computerized voting machines would be great for people with poor eyesight and young people that are used to use a computer. But people that can not use an computer, like for example old people or poor people, would have big problems with voting. 
Also the human error would not really be removed because someone has to program those machines. While programming there could happen an error that stays undetected and could lead to an inaccurate counting of votes. And this could be a big problem because there would be no physical records to recount the votes. 
The computer technology was not always as good as it is today. Every new technology went through a phase of trial and error. But because it is used so frequently that phase is pretty short. But the voting system is not used as frequently and therefore this phase would last much longer.
