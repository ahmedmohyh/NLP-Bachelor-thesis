In the text is the method of technologic voting a good idea. You can avoid mistakes like marking the wrong name because of poor eyesight. The technologic voting system is a big step of human for the election. Its a progress: you have a easy-to-use touch-screen, with wich you can vote (without problems) for your favourite candidat. 
But the presentation has a disargument: what if people, like old ones or handicaped ones, dont konow how to use it? What if they are overwhelmed and cant use it right, so the mistake of voting accidently false wont disappear? Adults or seniors often arent that good with things like technology. They know what it is, but dont know how to use it right. 
And when you have an election, wich can decide of your future (like the election of the US president Trump), you have to feel comfort with the voting system and you dont have to feel like overwhelmed. So if you want to intrude a new voting system, you should first of all explain it clearly how it works (probably in the television) and after that, if the adults and seniors are okey with it, you can start a new election and the poulation can decide for themselves, if this new system is going to be accepted or not.
