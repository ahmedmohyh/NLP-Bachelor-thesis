In the lecture we mostly concentrate on the negative aspects of computerised voting. It's said that it may be easy for people who are used to using electronic devices, but the ones who aren't used to it may struggle. On one hand it may be the fear of technology on the other hand also a financial aspect. If you can't afford the technology you can't get used to it. Then it's said how mistakes happen when humans count the votes, but the programmes of the counting system is programmed by humans and the mistakes would be huge if there was a problem in the system, votes could get lost, not be registrated and the vote could turn out completely otherwise than it should. The aspect that we trust the technological communication- and banking system is being turned down. It's said, we use them every day and they got really imptoved with time. The voting system on the other hand is used approximately twice a year, so the improvement would evolve slow and many mistakes could happen in that time.

In the text the tone is different. There we get to know positive aspects of a technological counting system. We humans are inefficient with counting, also we get long lists with names of who we can vote and people with a poor eyesight may easily vote for the wrong person. If the voting and the counting was computerized, the names could be bigger and the counts more accurate, thats mainly in close elections relevant. If there are a few mistakes made by humans the election could turn out wrong. A computer counts way more efficiently.
