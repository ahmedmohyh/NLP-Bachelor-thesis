When humans have to count thousands and thousands of votes, it is very likely to happen, that they make mistakes. Some believe, that a computer would make the job more efficient and without any error. Surely, it doesn't make such a mess, that a human does, but in the end, the computer was made by humans. So, perhaps the programmer made a fault. This one small fault could mess up the whole voting, while a small fault in counting the votes wouldn't be that grave.

The text says: "computerized systems remove the possibility of human error". It is true, if the computer is perfectly programmed, its much more reliable than the counting of a human being. On the other hand, we heard in the speach, that no computer is perfectly programmed, because it's programmed by a human hand. Additional to this, when voting on the computer, the voter only needs to touch the one he wants to vote. On paper, he either needs to write his name down or circle/cross the right name. Therefore, the possibility of making a mistake when voting on the computer is way higher than on paper.

All these argumnts conclude, that no matter, how much we rely on the computer, at some point, it would still be better to count the votes by human, and not by machine.
