The presentation was about the problems of voting in a traditional way or with modern computers. Both the text and the presantation present the problems of the traditional voting for example the human errors when it comes to the counting of the votes. Futhermore, the text mentions the problem of making a mark on a sheet full of names with canditates when one has a bad eyesight, they can easily make a mistake too. 
Whereas the text doesn't say much about computer voting the presentation talks a lot about it. It was mentioned that it could be better, espacelly for those who use the computer often. But computers have been designed by humans, so there can also be errors too. And in fact, a error in a computer programm is worse than a error in the count of votes because several votings can be part of the error and with a false programm a recount is impossible, whereas a recount with humans is long and expensive like the text says but it is possible. 
Some people also think it's a risk to vote at the computer,  but the text reminds them that all our banking transactions and communication is part of the computer technology. But the prestation also mentions that they are not always fluently and they have to been improved for many years. Banking is a everyday task and you can improve it step by step whereas voting ist not so often, usually all two years and to improve this it takes a lot more and it is very complicated.
