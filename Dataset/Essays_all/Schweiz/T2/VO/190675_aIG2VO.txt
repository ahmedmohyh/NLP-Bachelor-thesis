When a nation changes his president, the whole population should be involved, according to the government. That's the reason why there has to be a voting system for the people who live in this specific country. The question is now, how this voting system is structured and organised. How can the inhabitants have a save, fast and reliable way to vote for the candidate that they want to see in the leader position?

First of all, there is the traditional kind of voting. One gets a large sheet of paper containing many names and has to make a small mark next to that name. After everybody has voted, the people who are responsible for counting start their work. Thus this voting system relies on people to count the votes. The problem is now, that this voting system can be pretty inefficient and that the people who have to count the votes are likely to make mistakes. A possible solution could be a voting system with computers who should be faster than the old system. Moreover, the complex computer technology is already used in banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensitive information.

Last but not least, we need to consider that not everybody is able to handle a piece of modern technology like a computer. Maybe there are people who are feared to use a computer. In spite of the thesis that computers could work faster, we need to contemplate that computers' errors are worse than human errors because one simple error can delete many votes. Nevertheless, computers are used in banking transactions daily. But a voting system is only used once every fourth year. Thus we can't be sure if computers will be better.

In a nutshell, one can see that both sides have some good thoughts. But to emphasize my opinion, I am sure that a computer system would work better. We should at least give it a try.
