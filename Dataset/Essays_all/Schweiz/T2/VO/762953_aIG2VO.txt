In the United States they want to do a electronic voting system, some people like it some dont. They say that people with poor eyesight can easily vote but they forget another part of people. Also they say that people vote for the wrong candidate. But we have to say that for old people its difficult to understand computers and its very hard for them to understand the new technology. Some people have also a fear from computers, smartphones and other electronic devices. In the text they say, that in traditional voting the mayor source of inaccuracy is that people accidently count the votes wrong. But the lady is not sure if a computerized voting doesnt do more mistakes, and if there is a big error during an election that would be a huge problem. So its better to have a small amount of mistakes than having a big problem. Also they vote in the US every two years, so its difficult to test a voting system correctly.
