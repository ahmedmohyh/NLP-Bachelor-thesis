The main argument used is that computers can make errors as easily as humans do, but the consequences are much worse. For example a computer error can delete thousands of votes whithout the possibility to recover them, while a human can only miscount a few ballots. since computers are programmed by humans it is indeed possible make mistakes. While we had years of time to improve other electronic devices it would not be possible to improve voting systems since elections take place way too rarely. It is also being said that a lot of people don't know how to use a computer or just simply can't afford one. 
The text tells us the exact opposite: While people can make mistakes a computer isn't able to make one because he wasn't programmed to make one. A computer should also make voting a lot easier because people won't have to mark a small name on a sheet of paper anymore. This would eliminate or at least reduce the possibility of voting for the wrong candidate. 
While the recorded play tells us that people can't afford or use computers the text says that there will be computerized voting machines, so one of these argument is invalid.
