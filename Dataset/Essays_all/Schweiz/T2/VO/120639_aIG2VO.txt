They say that computer are not better. If you are used to them it will be easy. But for people who do not use computers on a daily base it is very hard.In the opinion of the writer of the text people will make an error in counting. That is normal. But computers may be even worse. Because if you, a human beeing, make an error while you are programming it, there will count wrong. So there will be thousand of wrong votes and a recount will not be able to make. The text thinks that we use the computer for a lot of things why not for voting. The problem is that they only reached that far because we improved them a lot over the time. But in the most states in the United States of America you vote twice a year to once evry two years. So you cant really improve them or only very slow.
