Voting with computers can be a problem for a few people because perhaps they have never used an computer before. It could be that this people choose the wrong candidate. For people which used the computer daily a computer voting aren't a problem. When a computer are counting the votes they make a better job instead the human being. But when the computer have an error then it's a big problem because 1000 of votes are miscounted. When a person make a mistake the number of miscounts aren't so big. It's better when a person counts the votes and not the computer because when the compuer have a error then the computer make a biger mistake than a person. With the compuer a person can also choose the wrong candidate not only when a person mark the nampe of the candidate on a sheet. The old system have perhabs problems but a voting with a compuer also. And in America the people are voting every 2 yeras nationaly it's not often that means that it's better when a person counts the votes. The new system would be make more faults than the old system.
