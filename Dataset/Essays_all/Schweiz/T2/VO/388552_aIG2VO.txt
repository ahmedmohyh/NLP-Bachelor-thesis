The woman from the audio file had a strong opinion against computer voting systems. She thinks that those computers will cause more harm than good. Because there are still many people not familiar to computers and they may be confused and will be scared away from voting at all. So the argument that people with bad sight may be confused by the ballots small font is as well applicable to  the people with no knowledge of computers. There is still a percentage of the modern day population that don't own any computers so this would also be a problem. Humans make mistakes by counting out ballots, but the so flawless called Computers are programmed by us humans, so what if we programmed bad code and bugs lead to an overall crash the results would be terrible. Because in comparision the votes in the tradiotional method have a physical record so you can recount them but online votes mostly dont have physical records, so a recount would just be impossible compared to a very expensive recount in the traditional way. We do relay on computers systems daily in banking shopping and in government affairs, but those systems are used daily had time to develop, get better and more efficent. A computer voting systems would be used maybe twice a year in local affairs and every two years on a national level. So there isn't much room to test such systems out. So those to samples are contradicting each other the text is mostly pro based for computer voting but the audio lecture of the woman is against E-Voting.
