Critics of the current voting systems want to replace it by a computerprogramms. In their opinion, people would't vote for the wrong candidate by accident any longer because of an easy-to-touch-screen technology. But the person in the Audio told, that for people without any experience with computers would maybe stopp voting because they're afraid of the new technologie.
Another critized point is the counting. With computers it would be easier and more quickly. Also their wouldn't be a chance of misscounts because of the computer programms. The woman in the Audio mentioned that humans will also make mistakes in the programms. And in her opinion, this would be a bigger problem because nobody will find the mistake. She critized that the other programms used by the government and other individuals has been improved. At the beginning they didn't work as proper as they do now. Another argument is, that people use this programms every day. But they will use the others only every second year.
