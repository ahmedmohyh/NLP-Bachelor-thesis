The lecturere argues that computerized voting should not replace the traditional way.
One of the main arguements says that, while human error is a detrimental factor to the manual vote couting, the impact faulty code can have is orders of magnitude higher than what could be attributed to human error. The point brought up by the lecturer is, after all, code is still written by humans. The lecturer recognizes the trust we give to computers in banking and other software driven areas. But unlike in banking, voting occurs only once a year. The programs used in banking had to be improved and built upon for many years. But the amout of times a code is used once a year is completey insignificant to the reliability of the code. No citations or evidence backing up this claim is brought up.
Another arguement is that there still are alot of people who are unable to vote on the computer, people who are not used to using computers and people who have a fear of technology are maybe discouraged to vote at all. But this claim isn'tbacked up by any form of evidence provided in the lecture. What the lecturer doesn't take into account is that computerized voting also allows people who were unable to vote before can do so with the new system. Because the voting ballot consists of a long list of names, where the voters have to find the name they want, people with poor eyesight might find trouble, which can be avoided with intelligent software.
