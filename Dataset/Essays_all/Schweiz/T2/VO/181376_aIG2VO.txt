Voting in the United States

The text says that the traditional voting is inefficient and lead to inaccurate counting of votes. In  the text there are a lot more pro arguments to replace the humans by computers as arguments against a new system. The only statement against computers is that technology is too risky.

In the presentation they agreed that there are some problems with todays voting system but it isn't sure that computers will do a better job as humans are doing now. Problems could be that not all people are used to computers especally the older ones aren't. This could afford trouble or even lead to anxiety. People could be afraid to vote and this isn't what a new system should bring with it. 

They also agreed that human do make mistakes but computers are also able of doing mistakes. Because they are also programmed by humans. Counting mistakes are happening when humans going through the ballots but if a coomputer should break down it would be lot more worse.  

To conclude, the main point from the text is to replace the traditional system by computers but on the other hand the presentations gives us some good statements against it.
