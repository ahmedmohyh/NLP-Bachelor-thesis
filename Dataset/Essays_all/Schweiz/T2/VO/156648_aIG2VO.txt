The speaker of the presentation was very opposed to the idea that traditional voting systems should be replaced by computerized voting systems. 

She mentioned that not all people are used to computer technology, they don't know how it works and can even fear it. People who don't know how to handle a computer or don't even have one, because they can' afford it, wouldn't be able to vote at all. This opposes to the whole text written in general.

As written above, another problem with the traditional voting system is, that it relies heavily on people to count the votes, where mistakes are inevitable. Computerized systems would remove the possibility of human error. But in the presentation the speaker remarked, that also computers are programmed by humans. If there are any mistakes, there wouldn't be just a few ballots but probably hundreds, thousands, and a recount would be impossible, since it's all electronic. 

At the end of the text, daily-used complex computer technologies, such as banking transactions or communication of highly sensitive information, are being praised and well talked about. But at the end of the presentation we were reminded of how also these technologies weren't perfect at the beginning and had to be improved a lot. Nowadays they're used daily, but a computerized voting system would nationally only be used all two years. 

The speaker of the presentation has many doubts with the compuzerized voting system and is opposed to the whole text written above.
