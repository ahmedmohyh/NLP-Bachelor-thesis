One of the most important argument is that we need to ask ourselves, if computers really are more trustworthy than the old voting system. They are also made by human beings and could contain errors which would result in far more worse consequences as a recount wouldn't be possible if there's such an error. But also when officials make an error a long procedure takes place to resolve that problem of miscounting so where's the difference?
 
Is the computerized version really better? What if some people are not used to computers or some don't even are in posession of such a computer? It wouldn't facilitate the situation of these people. But no one can disagree with the fact that it is much easier to just take the computer and mark the candidates' name on the screen so that the issue of wrong voting, especially for people with poor eye sight, could be resolved in one step.

Some say that it is too risky but one has to take in account that the computer is a device we use and trust every day. The only question left is if it is really necessary to introduce such expensive computerized voting systems as the American don't vote that often. But why don't give it a try?
