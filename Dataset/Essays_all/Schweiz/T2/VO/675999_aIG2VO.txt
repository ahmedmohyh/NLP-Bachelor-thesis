In contrast to the text, the talk describes that the computerized voting systems wouldn't be better than the traditional voting systems. The text says, that People with poor eyesight can easily vote for the wrong candidate. But the talk shows us, that this can also happen with computerized systems, because if the voters aren't used to computers, it isn't easy for them to vote correctly. While the text highlightes the errors that can happen, if people need to count the votes, the talk warns us, that also computerized systems can make errors because they're programmed by people. And if there would be a error in the computerized system, the harm can be huger than in an tradional system and irreversible. In the end the talk explains, that the computerized systems are ,in contrast to the banking systems, not daily used. And in the beginning of using a new system there were always errors that happend until the system improved more and more, so we can't expect the computerized systems to work perfectly right  away from the beginning.
