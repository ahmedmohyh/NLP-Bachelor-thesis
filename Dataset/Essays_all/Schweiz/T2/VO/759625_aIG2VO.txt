Ein Systemabsturz führte zum Datenverlust, deshalb unter Zeitdruck nun die Kurzzusammenfassung der in der Rede genannten Punkte.

- Not everyone has a computer at home
- Therefore not all te people have enough experience in using a computer
- They can vote for the wrong candidate, for example Donald Trump
- They might have fear to use the new technology, what decreases the number ot voting people
- Programmers may do a mistake, what leads to thousands of wrong answers
- The system is used only twice a year. This means the users and admins haven't got a lot of experience

The speech is pretty much the opposite of the text. She is against the digital voting. In my opinion both of them are wrong, because digital Innovation can cause problems. But with enough will, the risks are reducable.
