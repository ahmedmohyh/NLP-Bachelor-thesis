In the audio record it was explained how a computerized voting system can seem way easier and more efficient in the beginning, but it actually could be even more difficult by the following reasons: not every American has access to a computer because not eyerbody owns one. Also, not everybody feels comfortable using a technical device to do such an  important thing such as voting for a new president. They get scared and might won't want to vote anymore. And most importantly, computers are programmed by humans, so human errors won't be gone. And if votes are counted one for one, there might be little mistakes, but compared to a computer system that could either delete many votes or count them wrong could lead to a even bigger problem.
As we compare this audio record to the text, what is most conflicting is the fact that we actually already trust computers to a very high level. Many people do their bank stuff on there which requires a lot of trust. And nobody ever suddenly had 10000 Dollars more on their bank account, so why would such a big error happen when it's about presidency?
In addition, a computerized voting system won't be out by tomorrow, so as this will take time, people who are not used to will be a minority as more time goes by.
