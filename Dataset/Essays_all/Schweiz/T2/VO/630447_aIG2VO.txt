In the speech they say that a compiterized voting isn't that easy as everyone thinks. It may be easy for people who already have a computer or who already know how to handle a computer. But for people who don't have a computer especially older people it could be much harder than we think.
They also said that we shouldn't trust a computer. Computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. So it could be possible that the election is wrong. A computer can't work flawlessly every time.

But the text says something else. They say that it is much easier to have a computerized voting. It would be much easier for everyone and is trustworthy. They think that only the current voting system makes mistakes for example by accidentaly voting for the wrong candidate. And the computerized voting should help people with poor eyesight because they only have to touch the candidates name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate.
They also critizise that the old voting system rely heavily on people to count votes and it would never be posiible that they dont't make any mistakes.
