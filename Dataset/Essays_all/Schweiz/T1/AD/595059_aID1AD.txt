Should advetising directed to young children be forbidden? Do they have negative influences to the developpment of the children? Or do the enterprises have the right to attract their costumers with advertises?

Young children are very easily influencable. This is the reason why there are so many television advertisis these days directed to young children. But many shown products are not good for the developpment of the children. The young children love McDonald's, especially because of its commercial strategy. In the end the children prefer hamburgers and fries over fruits and vegetables. These can be the negative influences of TV advertising toward young children. Brands can influence children for their hole life by using commercials. So the people are unconsciously dependant on brands and their products, which are often overprized or unhealthy.

On the other hand, everybody wants to earn money. The companys offer jobs to workers and the workers earn money for the family. And there are companys whose clients are children. They also want to survive and make their money. To make more money it is inevitably for many enterprises to make televison advertising and then they can offer more jobs.

I think this is a very controversial question. Every enterprise has the right to make money and they need those television advertising but they can have negative aspects, especially the children are endangered. The best solution would be, if we could forbid the commercials with a bad influence on the children to protect them. But the difficulty is do define these "bad commercials". There will be a lot of work for the government.
