Everybody knows the struggle: You`re watching a movie or a serie on TV and get interrupted by avertisements every 20 minutes. Then you swap the TV chanel to watch something different because you don`t want to look at advertising stuff for longer than 30 seconds.

In this essay I want to tell you what I think about TV advertising, especially when it`s directed toward youn children, First I want to say that it`s not an easy thing to talk about television advertising, because in this topic there are a lot of different opinions. In my opinion it depends on what the advertisement is based. If it`s just to show the newest car and the coolest shoes there`s nothing to critisise. On the othere side there are plenty of advertisements for alcohols and other things which absolutely shouldn`t be seen by children in the age of two to five. Last year I`ve heard about a child who had seen an advertising for sex toys, just because he swaped to the next chanel. 

Please don`t misunderstand me, Television advertising isn`t always something bad. I think it`s just impossible to control what children nowadays get confronted with. If they don`t see stuff like alcohol, porns, drugs or voilence etc. on TV, it`s somewhere else. 
Last of all I want to say that Tv advertising can help you to find out what is new on the market and to get inspired by ideas. Especially in time of christmas or easter the chanels are overfluded with advertisement. This can be a help for children to find out what they want but it can be very stressful for their parents. I think that`s not as worse as sex toys, alcohol, drugs etc.
