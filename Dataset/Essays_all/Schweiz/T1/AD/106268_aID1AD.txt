Sure ther are some pedagogical helpful series for children, but there is just to much crab on the program and sadly this part overweight. Sure, for parents it is quite comftable to just let their children hanging arround infront of tv: They do not make any work and they are silent, make and may the learn something from a pedagogical helpful serie, but hardly most of the shows or movies they watch are not. And there are many other bad things about let children gamble in front of a television. I know that they will enjoy it at this moment, but some years later they probabely will not adore anymore a life like this, because it brings many bad aspects with it. It is really unhealthy to watch television too often, because of your all day long by your own and just sitting. There is not any possibility to make friends or to get a social life. Those children who sit at all the time in their childhood will be inivertal and lonely and thats a really bad thing for mental health. The human is a social species and needs other idividuals around him. Also for physical health it is terrible. The children are just sitting arround and likely are eating amounts of snacks, mosetly unhealthy sweets. There can not grow any muscles which would be necessairy for a healthy body also for the higher age. Instead the amount of bodyfat would increas and those children will get overweight and may get worse health issues. Thei should not sit all the day in a room and just see the world on a screen. They should learn the world know through their experiences with all their sens and not just join via a screen. I think television can forming minds and so the children will not get the chance to develop their owne thoughts about anything.
