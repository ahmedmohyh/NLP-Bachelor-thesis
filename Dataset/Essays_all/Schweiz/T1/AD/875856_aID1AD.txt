The first question which came in my mind was if children at this age are even able to understand the meaning of an advertisment. So in my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising for young children. Because can they really understand that the advertising was directed toward them, I mean do they understand that let`s say it should stimulate them to buy something? I don`t think so, because they don`t even own money and the`re not really supposed to watch television at this age anyway. And I dont`t see in what way it could be bad for them, I mean yes they can maybe influenced by television but not really in a bad way. So why would you not allow them?

It could be a good thing if they would forbid advertising which is for young children, because today we have so much electronic devices and young children get involved more and more. I think it would somehow aso protect the parents, because the children will run to them first when they see an advertisment with something in it they want to have. On the other hand they also have to learn how to resist and that they can not have everything they see on Tv. So it could be a protection because everybody know how easy it is to influence such a young child. And the parents could probably avoid lots of conversations with their kids becaus they want to have something they saw on television.

All together I think it would be an overreaction if they would not allow the advertising for kids, eventhough it also has some good sides to it. And there are also parents who have to tell their kids what is good and what isn`t and they have to teach them how they can and how they should react to advertising. So why should they not allow advertising just because the children are too young or that they don`t really have their own opinion and reliability? For me it is for sure a no, I mean we all grew up with children advertising on television and we are completely fine so why change it?
