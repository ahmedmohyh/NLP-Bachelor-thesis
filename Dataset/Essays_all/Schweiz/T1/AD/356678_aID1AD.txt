Now-a-days even young children watch television quite often. As a consequenze, there are more adverts especially made for them so that they know what they could set on their next birthdaywish letter.

Firstly, it is not possible for these young children not to see any adverts. Although you can ban telvision advertising, they still are confrontet with adverts for older people, adverts on the street and adverts in different shops. They have an effect on them as well. No matter where we are, there is always some kind of advertising. In spite of this fact there is no ability to ban television advertising for young children unless advertising is banned at all. 

Secondly, if there is an influence toward young children, their parents will have the power to say no to the wishes triggered from the adverts. Furthermore, they cannot allow their children to watch television. The children might learn how to deal with it and they learn to decide what they really need and what they should not buy. During the time when most children watch TV, one could ban adverts which work with psychological tricks to make the children buy their product.
In conclusion, TV adverts do not have to be banned. o
