The other day whilst watching television I saw an advertisement, which was directly telling children that they should go to a certain water park. I was quite apalled by it and thought about the reasons for this ad for a long time. I came to the conclusion that television advertising aimed towards young children should be prohibited. Children are very suggestible and if they see an ad they are very likely to believe it. The might pester their parents about beeing alowed to buy a certain toy, or go to an entertainment venue.
Through advertising directly to the youngsters, the advertisers bypass the parents and get the children to want to do something that the parents are against. One might say that it helps children make their own decisions or that parents, who don't want their children to  be influenced by the media, shouldn't let them watch television. I however think that television, atleast certain channels, should be children safe. They should not in any way strive to influence or scare a young child. Children under five may also not understand the difference between a normal television programme and an advertisement. This may lead to severe misinformation. Even though an ad directed to youngsters will not be of a scary or harmful nature, it will be ingrained in the mind of a child and through this influence its decisions till adulthood. 
Parents, confronted with a whiny child, or even a tantrum, may forget all their education values and buy the item. This sets pressure on the parents and the child, as children may not learn that no means no. It can also teach them that everything materialistic that hey want, they can get.
Because advertisements can greatly impact a child and the family dynamics, I came to the conclusion that telivision advertising directed towards young children should be forbidden.
