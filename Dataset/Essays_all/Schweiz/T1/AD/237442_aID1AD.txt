I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Beause the children which are looking television became the feeling, that they must have everything what they see in the televison. Later, if they are older, it could be, that they order things which they can't pay. That could be very dangerous! Also it`s more difficult for adults to satisfite their childrens. 
A big playmobil tower chatch the eyes of the young children, now they think every tower should be so big an high as the tower in the televison advertising. If they wish a tower for birthday, they will be sad if the tower isn't that big. 
But on the other side, i think television advertising can have positive affects. The children learn in young age how it is to have wishes and how they have to handle this wishes. Maybe they can wish the things that catched their eyes for birthday. Or they have to save money. They learn the use of money. Also they learn how to react, if the wishes don't come true.
