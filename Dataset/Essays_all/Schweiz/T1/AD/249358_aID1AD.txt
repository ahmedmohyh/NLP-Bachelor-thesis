There are a lot of reasons which speak for television advertising directed toward young children and also against:
So beginning with the cons: 
- First we have to mention that there are maybe some parents who hate it that her child have the desire to have a product because the child saw it on television.
- Then we have to say that it should be the last thing to make advertising because which parents want to break the desire of the child.
Continuing with the pros:
- Why should we forbide things like that? There are so much limitations in our daily life, I speak about laws.
- I think the parents should be enough strict with their parents so that they can also say "no" to a personally desire from their child. Then the parents can play another film for the chidren so they have time for taking heroin and go to the toilet because of their rectal disfunction. 
- Bolassi would say it should be legitim to show advertising directed toward young children.
