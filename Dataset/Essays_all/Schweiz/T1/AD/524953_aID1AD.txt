Television advertising targeted at children
In today's media and in television specifically, advertisment is omipresent. For not government funded networks it is the primary source of income and they have to rely on it. Institutions that belong to the government have to obey certain rules and either don't show any commercials, like the bbc for example, or have to clearly mark the start and end of an ad break. Whereas private networks can incorporate advertisments even inside a show or program and also on childrens channels and in childrens shows. I don't think this is appropriate for young children for the following reasons;
Young children can't destinguish between fiction and reality very well yet and also if the ad seems to be part of the show they might be confused and think that it is very important for them to have a certain product. 
Because children are usually much more easily manipulated than adults, if a character on tv tells them something is a nice thing they will believe it and probably wanting to own it. And many children will not stop terrorizing their parents until they will buy it for them. Of course the products and their ads are specifically targeted at children and cleverly made to appeal to children, which I think is wrong and exploits how young children easily believe anything adults will tell them because they don't now yet. 
I don't think children should even be seen as a target audience as they don't earn their own money yet and in particular young children who most of the time also don't get money to spend on things from their parents also because they can't judge what to buy correctly yet. In conclusions I think regulations have to be introduced to protect children and their parents from the bombardement through advertising.
