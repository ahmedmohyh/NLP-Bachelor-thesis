Advertisment is a part of our daily life. As the day passes, we see uncountble ads on streetsigns, our computers and the television. It also affects the smallest in our society, the 2-5 year old kids. Do they really need to bare this constant flood of advertisment? 

When we watch a commercial on television, we often think about it for a second or two. Like, do I need this or where could I find this. Small children do not think much about their actions or anything that happens around them. They live for the moment. So wehn they see an advertisement in television, they do not waste another second on thinking about it.

Though, how often does a kid that age really see an ad in television. They play with their siblings, parents or other children of the same age. Every day they live is a new adventure to them. So why waste any of this precious time watching television? They do not spend hours a day looking at a screem, so they would not really be affected by it.

If they do spend hours and hours in front of the television and see a lot of advertisment directed to them, they could not do aynthing with that information since they do not have any money to buy something. They would start to ignore the commercial, like we do every day. So it would rather help them for their adult life then harm them.

Small children do not watch a lot of television and if they do, commercials do not have the same effect on them then it has on an older human. So why bann commercials for children that age, if they do not even work the way they were supposed
