The brain of a young child aged two to five doesn't work like the brain of a adolescent or an adult. A young child sees the world in a different way compared to an adult. A child won't buy a product by it's own. The parents decide wether to buy something for his child or not. So I don't think that it is useful for a company to make television advertising toward young children. On the other side nothing will happen if a child watches a television advertising. It won't affect the child in a bad way because a company won't do an advertise that young children don't like. So in the small clip there would be toys or other things a young child wants to have.  The memory of a child is different too. The brain of an adult can recognise things he saw somewhere, like on television. I don't think a child wants to buy something only because he or she saw a television advertising. 
These were only a few of the arguments for this topic. In my opinion it should be allowed. If a company wants to risk doing an television advertising directed toward young children then they should do it. I'm not sure wether there is a point for doing that or not because of the reason I've written about in the upper half of the essay. If I were in the promotion departement of a company I wouldn't do a television advertising for young children. But I don't see a reason why it shouldn't be allowed. It doesn't affect the child in a bad way so there is no reason to not allow it.
