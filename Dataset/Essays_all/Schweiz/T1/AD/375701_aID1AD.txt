Television advertising directed toward young children - allowed or not?

young cjildren are growing physically and physisch. Not just their bodys develop themselves, also their brains are in one of the most important process of life. Children want to explor the world. They are  fascinated of the environnement and animals. They love to play with other children outside. Spending time with their parents and siblings is such an important thing in their lifes which should be saved fot the rest of their lifetime. So why should their be any advertising directed toward young children when they aren't used to watch television?
 Stay at home  while watching television isn't that good for children - especially for the younger ones. In reality is this the most common activity of younger children. Why parents let their kids doing something like that isn't understandable. Maybe they are to lazy do play or entertain them or just haven't any time.  The problem is that children who watch television soaps are doing nothing - they are inactive and are just consuming stuff. The affecting of childrens from all this consummed television shows is giant. They influence them in their opinion and in their young  personality. As usually children want to improve the "big ones". They want to be like their parents, neighbours - just like any older person which are included in their life. Children aren't abel to see the diffrence between good and bad personalities. It is not a bad thing at all but it shows as how important it is with whom children are going through this very sensitive part of life. Advertising will creat desires. We can not say if they will affect the little ones good or bad yet but we can expect. Most of the people would say they will not and so I. Parents should decide what if their children are needy and what exactely they need to can not live whitout it. Advertising just make unimportant desires.
