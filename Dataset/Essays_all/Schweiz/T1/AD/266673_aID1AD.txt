Children at the age of two to five can be impressed and influenced very easy. Companies want to reach the individual person to buy their product. And companies that direct their advertisements towards the children use them to reach the parents because parents are the ones with the money, not the children. But parents would never see a toy on tv and say I have to buy that so these companies need a stream to reach their customers. A child is influenced by an advertisement and the parents are influenced by their child and so the parents buy the product. The idea of this would be good but it might damage social aspects of the children. They cannot seperate advertisements and normal tv shows from reality. For example a child sees an advertisement of a sad person that gets happy with chocolate and when the child is sad at the moment it tries out that chocolate and gets happy again. In the time the kid is eating its chocolate it`s getting happy again but maybe only because it forgot why it was sad not caused by the chocolate. The only thing the child will remember is that it was unhappy until it ate chocolate and from now on the child will always eat chocolate when its sad or angry or depressed. That was just an example who knows if it has serious consequences and the child will be extremly overweight in the future, but it can really influence what the child thinks and can have higher damages in the future. I think that the companies should wait until the child really understands the meaning of advertisements.
