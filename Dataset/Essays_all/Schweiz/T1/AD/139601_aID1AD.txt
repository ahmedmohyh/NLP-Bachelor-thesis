My opinion to this statement is really clear. I think that so young childrend doesn`t need to watch television which contained advertising. I thing in general childrens don`t need to watch Tv.There are so many other good possibilities to show the children the live without TV. For example: The children are watching an animal movie and in the break there is an advertisement for a hairshampoo or a special car or something else. At the end the childrens are so fascinated from cars and all the other stuff that they`ve forgot the animals. And why they doesn`t go with the hole family to the zoo and watch the animals in live so for the childrens there are no advertisements and they`ve been outside as well. The parents can calm down from work and also enjoy the nature and the world of animals. Or the families could also go swimming with their childrens because I think to be able to swim can save lifes and thats much better than television advertising where all stuff is fake and in a glamour world.
I know that the TV is financed by advertisement but I really ask me why there is advertisment on the childrens channles on Tv? For what, they advertising on a childrens platform for a car or a shampoo? Most of the childrens won`t be able to take these informations from the really glamour word into the real world and after that they will have big problems. And they won`t go to the shop and buy the shampoo beacuse they`re too young.
In my opinion the television advertising shouldn`t be allowed on kids channels. Nowbody will buy the stuff.
And for me it`s also a bit unnormal that 2 years old childs are allowed to watch Tv.
I hope that our generation doesn`t get their childrens too much into the whole thing with computers, televison and also not mobile phones. My wish is that there is not television advertising or advertising in general which isn`t good for our childrens beacause they destroy the mind of our childrens and childrenschildren.
