I agree with this statement because I think they shouldn't be allowed. But I think it's difficult to built a meaning to this theme because most of the people don't have real memories to the age between two and five, and therefore one can't decide quickly and easily how the reaction of young children towards this form of television advertising is.
First of all, such young children don't really judge about what is good and useful for them, and what is bad and not useful for them. But according to the normal television advertisings, they'll think they have to get these stuff that seems great and good to them. But sometimes, they're wrong. 
Of course, it are the parents who decide to buy or don't buy the advertisements, but the television advertisings are directed towards the children, and not the parents. 
Another remark is, that these children can easily be influenced, and some of the advertisements are a way too bad for that they should influence the children.
Additionally, the children who want one item that they have seen on television, and are seeing it in reality (in the supermarket etc.) they are influencing the parents by their target to buy stuff. Of course, this isn't generally a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing if the item isn't as good as it seems. And if parents do not want to buy this item, it's probable that the younger children are starting to cry. And this would be annoying for everyone.
But there are also points that are pro-allowing these forms of advertisements. For example, there are many children which don't often watch TV, and therefore it wouldn't have much need to change the situation and prohibit the television advertising which are directed toward young children. 
But just because some don't consume television (advertisings), it doesn't mean that this me gets irrelevant, because there are many children who do this.
