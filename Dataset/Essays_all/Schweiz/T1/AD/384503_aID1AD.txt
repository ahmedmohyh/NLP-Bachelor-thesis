Should the television advertising directed toward young children be allowed ?
This questions is very tricky to answer because there are on both sides good arguments for and against the advertising.
If a advertsinig with young children should gets directed then you need the "Okay" from hteir parents and if they agree with the plans of the directors there should be no problems. But it also can be that the parents have not enough money and don't want it but have to , and because of this there are huge discussions.
On the one side is an television advert with babys more cute or brings the message for a product more to the customers then just a slogan. But the baby knows at that time not what it's going to do and this is a very important argument for this discussion. The parents must give the "Okay" but do they really know that their child is going to be exposed for all people around hte world who do watch this advert ? But I also think that the adverts with babys are no danger for the children's future because they just walk around and look cute so is this argument not that good as other ones.
I'm not an expert in television advertising with young children but in my opinon this television advertising shouldn't be taken that serious as the critics do, at the end no one gets hurt and everyone gets their peace, and so I think this television advertising directed toward kids should stay like it is now and shouldn't be changed because the way it is now is a good one.
