Nowdays the television adverdising is a part of our lives. We see everyday some television adverdising directed toward the adults, but there is also some of them that are directed toward young children at the age of two or five years old. Because of that fact, i would like to express my opinion about that controversial statement and discuss if that should be allowed or not.

First of all i would like to explain why there are some adverdising directed toward children. As long as there are products such as toys consumed just by children it is normal that children are the "goal" of the adverdising. Because of that we cannot avoid it. Children are easy to get adverdised, because when they see something they probably want to buy it without thinking how expensive that is or if it is something that she need. 

On the other hand adverdising toward children is manipulated and that manipulating people is illegal. So we may should not allowed children to look TV at the  time of adverdising. Furthermore it is difficult to protect. Adverdising is manipulated but is also very important for our economy. So if we just refuse to see any adverdising then we have a bad influence to the economy. Moreover not just children get adverdising, but adults, too.

In conclusion, i do not think that we can protect ourselfs and of course children from adverdising. We should just be carefull and do not get influenced easily. Adverdising should be allowed, also for young children, but it should not be so extreme, because we all know that children are easy to adverdising. Young children may should reduse the TV so the adverdising shoud also be redused.
