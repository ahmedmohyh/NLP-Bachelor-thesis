Even though I mostly agree with the statemant, there are a lotof complex problems surounding it. I shall start with an example from our past: In England in the 1950s television only just started gaining mass popularity. At the time there were only about two TV channels to choose from (BBC 1, BBC 2 and possibly BBC 3). They all were funded by the government and didn't therefore have to have advertising to be able to fund themselves. This all changed when the first commercial TV station was born. This was inherently a good thing, as it offered another choice next to the BBC channels, but it was a subject to heavy critisism because of the commercials. People asked the same question as today, whether or not it should be alowed to advertise directly to their children. But there was a major difference. Ads were hidden directly into children's TV shows. For example you could be wathing the Flintstones and suddently one of the characters would pull out a pack of cigarets and start sellig it to your children. This "fluid" ads were quickly banned. As all other ads seemed much better and less agresive people learned to live with them. 
In today's age things are more complicated, as many children (even aged two to five) are actualy able to buy thing on their own even if it means using their parents' phone or credit card. This of course is not common, but still makes the problem more important. This of course doesn't only apply to TV, but also to the internet and games aimed at children. Probably th biggest argument for keeping the things the way they are is that buissnises have to somehow make money. The children market is huge and advertising to it is mostly a safe bet. It mostly comess down to watching over your children and keeping and eye on what they do and watch.
