I watched the first time televison when I was like 3 and the I watcched my DvDs. I think children are supposed to play outside and enjoy the life and not sit the whole day in front of a televison. It is also the responsibility from the parents what their children are watching. When I was young I hardly watched televison and till today I can not watch any horror move or something like that. From my point of view there is not that much diffence between televison advertising directed toward young children and adults. Of course it is always a good way to make money. Little kids are watching TV an they see something what they want and I can tell there are things every little girl always wants. Puppies who can talk and Barbies with long blonde hair who can sing an so on. The problem is that many children have then an imagination of something wich isn't real but their parents have to tell them. But just because there is advertising doesen't mean you have to buy these things your children have seen. It is the part from the parents to say no. Otherwise your kids see something interesting like an advertising from a zoo or museum so they can also get imputs and learn something new. What might be a problem is how you deal with it.If parents think it is not good for their children they have to decide if the kid can watch tv included advertising or not. I think it is not an option that advertising shouldn't be allowed. For many people is this the way to make money. Of course I also find it kind of annoing when there is that much advertiting in the Tv. From my point of view advertising should be allowed for everyone and if it schouldn't then also for everyone not only for young children.
