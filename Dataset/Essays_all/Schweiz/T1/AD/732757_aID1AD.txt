Television advertising directed toward young children should  not be allowed.

Young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays. There special Tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren such as KiKa in germany. In order to run the channel sucessfully, they have to place commercials in between the different TV series. These commercials are often adressed to young children, the target group of the tv channel.

In my opinion, adressing a commercial to young children has several problems. First of all, these young kids do not realise that this is a commercial and the promoted products are often very expensive. They want to have this products and since they have no money their parents have to buy it. Secondary, young children basically love everything that looks fun. They cannot decide wheather they really need this products or not. They just want to have it. Another important point to mention is that even elder people often cannot resist the demand to get the latest gadget. How should kids realise that the companies just want to earn money by selling these products. 

As we can see, commercials adressed to children is very difficult.
