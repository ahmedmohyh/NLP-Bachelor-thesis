First, I am sure very few people like television advertising because it divides the mostly valuable, real TV content. On the other side, advertising is essential for many companies to earn money and even to survive, tough a large part of their revenues is advertising. So how to decide whether to decide an advert is directed toward young children or toward their parents or even other people? I think this would be extremely difficult, and if such a law exists, there may even appear some court cases where parents do not agree with former decicions.
On the other side, TV adverts are quite manipulative, expacially if directed toward young children: Such advertisers want children to annoy their parents until they finally buy the advertiser's product. Additionally, adverts shown to young children will burn into their memories, I think. In other words, these children will be secretly, unknownly influenced and manipulated during their whole life. But to really prove these statements, it is necessary to look up some studies already existing in this area. So how about other advertising young children are inevitably seing whenever they watch television? In fact, children will also be influenced by these. This thesis leads toward denying every single advert which is economically simply unpossible.
To sum up, there are definitely real problems, but its a very difficult and dangerous question where to draw the line.
