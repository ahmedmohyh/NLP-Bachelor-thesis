Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?

Nowdays almost everyone has a TV in their home. Children grow up with them and can not imagine a life without a television. There are a lot channels for different aged children. Of course there are also a lot of advertisment. We can not imagine a channel without that. So is it right to make it direct toward young children?

If you watch TV and swich the channels often, you will see that every ten minutes you have to watch advertisment about everything and not surprising it is everywhere the same. At children channels there are of course a lot advertisment about children things like toys and so on. They need to do that so those people can make them intersted and then they go and buy it. This is the point of advertising. The children will get a view about things that exist and how they can have fun with things they do not have. But it is important that they do not make pressure that the kids think they have to buy those things or they can not be happy. It should be childfriendly that makes them happy. So they should give them an oppurtunity to learn new stuff.

But if they sit 24 hours in front of a screen and they can not have enough, the situation can escalade very quickly. The kids trust them and think they have to get all those stuff. So the parents begin to buy it, but they never have enough and the kid want more and more. Poor parents! It is import to limit the quantity that the kids and parents are happy. So TV advertising should watch that they say and do the right things.

To sum up, I think it should not be permitted to advertise direct toward young children. But we have to look that we show them the right things and do not esagerade. Those kids have to learn so much things give them the freedom.
