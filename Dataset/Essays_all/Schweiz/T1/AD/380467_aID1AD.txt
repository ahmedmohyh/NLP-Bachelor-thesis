Television advertising directed toward young children (aged tow of five) should not be allowed

Children in age of two to five do not know what the advertising in television want. All what children see in televisison they want to have. But it can not be not allowed for companis because afterwords we do not know which new toys there are and than no advertising should be allowed and not just advertising for children.

First of all they are to young to know why companis make television advertising. It should be not allowed because companis know how to make children that they want this new toy. As an parent you can not say no because there children sees other children how have this new toy and they do not understand why that they do not can have this.

Altough we all felt in a advertising once. We can not say the companis that they it is not allowed to make television advertising. Also adult know the feeling if they see something new. When adults eat something new they want to know how to cook it. So it is normal that we always want the new one. But without advertising there is no market. So we can not not allowed it. If we have a compani we also want that others buy much of our stuff.

To sum up i think it is a problem from the parents. They should look that there children do not watch as much television that they see so much advertising. Parents should also look that there children appreciat what they have. But not just children should be careful also adults have to be careful to not fell in ba an advertising.
