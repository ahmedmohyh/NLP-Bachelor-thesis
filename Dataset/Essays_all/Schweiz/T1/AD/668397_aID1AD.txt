Nowadays it's a very discussed topic so I think it's really important to take a break and to think intensly about it. Social media no matter if the internet, or like here the television, marks our life dramatically. And the more years pass the younger the people get who are confronted with the fast moving social media. So the question of young children beiing in connection with these commercials can be discussed deeply. 

There are some positive things about such commercials in a young age. Children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need. And if the parents take some time they can explain their children that not everything what's shown to us is essential for a happy life (what sadly most of the advertisings claim).
 But there are also a lot misleading parts about it. If you spend too much time with people, in this case commercials, telling you what you need to have to be complete can be very dangerous. Why do I say that? Well imagine if someone tells you every morning you have to brush your hair to have a propper appearance someday you will start doing that and believing that yourself. That's the trick about commercials. They do the same thing to you and if such young people grow with that idea of needing everything they tell you they will have it a lot more difficult to think for themselves and to difference what they really need or what they just crave for.

In my opinion children shouldn't be confronted that directly with these commercials because the negative points that are listed have a bigger effect on the future life and they aren't able to think in a rational way. We fall too fast into that dependence of the advertisings don't we?
