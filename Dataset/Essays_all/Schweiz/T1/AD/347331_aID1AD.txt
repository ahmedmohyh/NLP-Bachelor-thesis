Television advertising is a well known possibility to make great business by introducing products or showing a typical point of view that the company stands for. I mean who hasn't watched a advertisement and was inspired to buy the product afterwards? We see often large companies like Niike, Coca Cola or Nestle  advertising in television for a new product because they can afford the costs because television advertising is a very expensive thing. In my opinion the advertisment has in general not a big impact on me. Some of them are done very well that I even like to watch them but others are just complete bullshit. I think the young years of life specificaly the years in between 2-5 are very important. I think in general that the they shouldn't sit in front of the television. Advertisement is not usefull for a young child. The child can't do alot with it. Maybe it can ask some random things like " What is that daddy?" but thats not even that interesting for a child. In his young years a child likes to move and to play with certain stuff. In these first years it learns to balance to walk to jump and to think in a way to create relations between objects or things he knows and I think advertisment has nothing to do with all of that. I can imagine that advertisment could confuse a child because its very random sometimes. I wouldnt prohibit it but it is not necessary.
