In this essay I want to talk about if television advertising directed toward young childern who are between  two to five should be allowed or not. There's a big contraversy on this topic and there are many different oppinions on it. My goal is it to show you the positiv and the negativ aspects of this topic and at the end I want to explain my own oppinion.
I want to start with the positiv aspects. At the moment we are conforonted every day with advertisement. There is no day where you don't see or hear advertisement in any form. So why should it not be allowed to make advertisment which is direct toward yound children? They are confronted to it even if it is not directly toward them. If they see it in young age they maybe even learn from their parents how to look at them in a critisizing way.
Even if there are a couple of positive aspects to it there are aspects which are not that positv aswell. For example that young children especially between two to five can be easily influenced by the advertisement. Maybe there's a danger which we are not aware of. Like this you could manipulate the children when they're watching TV and they don't even realise it.
In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but in a way where they don't get influenced that much. You can make advertising about healthy food for example. Like this they get influenced but in a good way. At this young age you shouldn't let your children whatch TV on their own anyway.
