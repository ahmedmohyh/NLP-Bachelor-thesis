It has become a common thing that you have to watch advertisment throughout the day, if you want to consum modern media. For the television ads have and will always be the best way for the channels to fund themselves. In such situations I for myself prefer to watch ads wich aims at my peer. Therefore I do not mind watching an adverstisment for a game rather than baby diapers.
On the other hand I will have to ask myself from where the companys know which age class I belong to. It is the question of neutrality. Of course it is easy for the companies to find out which age I am. They got my name, I got facebook. Although I doupt that they have to use social media for that. If I had to guess I would say, that they know that kind of stuff from accounts which I have to login in order to use the television properly. Never the less it doesent matter how they get the information they want. As a matter of fact they got it and there is nothing I can do about it. 
So why bother asking if it is good to be advertised with ads which live up to my expectations of entertainment? Because it is not only a question of neutrality but also what adverstising makes with me. Even without me noticing it. For people of young age it is important what other people think of them, wo they are easily convinced to follow a new trend. Stereotypes are formed by the advertisment Industrie. So if I, as a youth, get to hear and see the same stuff more and more, with more precision, convincing me to buy or do something I am a easy victim. So if the companys dont want to sell goods but a thought or political adverstisment it is queit disturping, being the aim of a well organised and proffesional campain. All in all It would not be like that if the advertisment would be if waider spread.
In the end watching ads for a lipstick will never be as entertaining as watching a good movie trailer. But at least I can be convieniend, that I am nor beeing mind washed.
