There were many concerns raised in the last coupple of years , about weither television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not .

The supporters of such a law that would forbid this type of advertisement,  argue that the advertisements seen on television could have a huge, negative  impact on children , who are easy targets for companies. Especially the clips advertising candy or Fast Food , could influence the eating habits of toddlers and lead to overweight or obeysity. The advertisors defend themselves from these accusations. Stating that they are not ones to blame and that it is the parents responsibility to educate their children and make sure that they are eating healthy.
A second attack on TV advertisement is , that the pictures presented by them are stereo typing gender or ethnics and therefore disturbing the development of children .The product placer anwser to this statement again by pushing all responsibility on the parents and therefore away from them.

My personal opinion is that we can`t and shouldn`t prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons. First of all , a law like this would violate the freedom of speech and media in an irreparable way. If we start prohibiting children advertisements , there will be soon demands to ban all sorts of advertisement on TV. 
Second , children will become desensibelized to advertisement in media, which will then lead to problems in the future  when they are suddenly exposed to it.
The only and true solution to this problem is , that advertisors should take more responsibility and maybe change the way or content they are showing to children . So for example there should be more advertisement for healthy food and girls product placements should not only contain pink toys and dolls , which are stereotizing the role of women . I hope for new advertisement which try to challenge the stereo typesof
