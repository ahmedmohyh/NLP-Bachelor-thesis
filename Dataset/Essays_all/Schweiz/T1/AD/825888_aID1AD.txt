I guess this topic is a very popular one to talk about right now. Television advertising just like many other kinds of advertising are mostly very controverial. They can beeinflussen kids in a lot of ways sometimes more that parents do. Advertisings are especially known for dividing gender. Children, especially from two to five, are still learing things so they belive everything they see and hear. If they see advertisings in which little girls only play with dolls and babies they are more likely to belive that real life is like that as well. They start to internalize everything. Some gender scientisty belived that if kids wouldn't see such advertisings they wouldn't pick their ''specific'' toys. Boys would also pick Barbies and girls would maybe pick Cars at the Store. Toys are beeinflussen kids so bad that they start beliving that women need to stay at home and take care of the baby while men have to go out, work and be mechanics. A lot of people don't even come up with the idea that something so normal in our society could in a way change the thaughts of kids. Others think it is even better to let kids see those kind of advertisings so they know how it is going to be in life later. They belive in gender roles and that diffrences between male and female have to be how they are now. A very good example for how advertising teaches kids how to be are the colours pink and blue. Before televison existed, colours like pink and blue were not identified with gender. Children were wearing all kind of colours without thinking about it. Nowdays boys would never wear colours like pink already at the age of three. 
My opinion is clearly that advertising in general should not be how it is now. It should'nt show any diffrences between women and men especially not with kids. I hope that it will change in the future.
