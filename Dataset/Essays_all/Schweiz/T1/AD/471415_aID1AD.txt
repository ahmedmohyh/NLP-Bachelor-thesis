"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."

First of all, there's a difference between adult television programms and children programm. So you have to define about which programm we are speaking. 

When we talk about the adult programm, I agree with this hypothesis. There are to many commericals and things that isn't for young children. E.g. There are a few commercials where women and men are half nacked. When children see this commericals, they maybe think what the commericals shows is real. So their sexual behavior will be an other as the sexual behavior of the children who didn't see the commericals in young age. There are also too much movies with violence. E.g. war films like Hotel Ruanda or American Sniper. This movies aren't good for the children's mental. 

But when we talk about the children programm, I mostly disagree with the hypothesis. The programm is made for the children. The aim of this series is that children learn and see new things so. It's really important in this world that you have a big knowledge. And the easiest way to learn is when you do it in young age. Children can learn e.g. how to act with teachers or with other children. They see that there's more than just the house where they live and the family. The learn that there is more than a cat or a dog or there is more than their mothertongue. Otherwise it's really difficult to learn children something that they can't see. It's really important for the developpment of the tolerance. Maybe they never saw a black man before and when they see one at the first time the maybe think that this man is ill or something like this. 

In my opinion the parents have watch something children friendly when their children are around. So the children can learn something and also the parents can maybe learn something.
