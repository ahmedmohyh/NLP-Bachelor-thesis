No television advertising for young children

Sadly also young children aged two to five already watch a lot of TV. But should advertisments which address this group of people be allowed? I think no, because there is no need  to address any products at people aged this young.
Young children should not even be watching television at this age. They should go play outside in real life, not in front of the TV. If there are advertisments addressing them they want to watch TV even more. They may see the commercial on a "grown up" channel and then after that a show which is not supposed to be for them. Sure you can argue that they could only bring these commercials between programs for children in that age but it would still not be good.
One point is also that children in that age are not active consumers. When you advertise something to them they can not just go in a store and buy it. They have to ask their parents to get it for them. So it indirectly would also have to address parents. And parents usually will not just get it for their childrens.
In addition to that I believe that children will become more of materialists which is not good at any age but especially not that young. Television commercials are  usually for something materialistic so they would learn to only want to own more and more things. Children should learn to also have fun without or with few toys. If you show them advertisments at this age they would learn that they need all these things.
In opposition you can say that some advertisments could help them learn some things, how to use language or learn about specific products. But there are surer other ways they can learn that.
