Some people think that television advertising directed toward young childeren should not be allowed. They say that advertising for children aged two to five leads to a more developed TV programme for kids and thus also a higher risk for television addiction. If a child for example watches TV where there are lots of brakes with boring advertising for adults, children will be more likely to stop watching TV. But if there are lots of advertisements which kids are interessted in, they won't get bored as fast so they'll keep on watching TV. The opponents of television advertising for young children are concerned about more children spending their time watching TV instead of playing outside which is important for the developement for a kid. These people also fear that children will get more unhappy through advertisment. They think that it is very important especially for little kids to learn to be happy with what they have rather than to experience a lack of consumption goods.
Others say that television advertising improves a child's developement. They think that it's better for  children to see TV advertisments for their age than adult advertisements. These people also say that child advertisement will lead to a better economy because more kids beg their parents to buy them the products and toys that they had seen in TV.
In my opinion television advertisement for children should be prohibited. I think that it is important for children to learn to be happy with what they have than to experience a lack of something. I also encourage kids to play than watching TV and I am afraid that television advertisment for kids will lead them to get more used to watching TV.
