Nowadays, television advertising is a very common way for companys to bring their products straight to the consumers. While it may seem to be a good idea to show off products to a lot of people at the same time instead of talking to them on the street or whatever way they would chose besides that, it also contains hidden threat for the consumers, which many do not really know about. The companys manage to influence the TV watchers to the point, of where they feel like they really need something although they've never felt the need before, until watching a certain advertisement.
When it comes to children, it seems to be even more severe. Young children have wish after wish and those may change from one minute to the other. If they really urge to have banana you can almost bet if you ask them 5 minutes later, what they want rightnow, that their answer probably won't be "a banana" anymore.
So in my eyes it's quite unrealistic to even consider advertising stuff for young children as they want everything at once and can't really decide wheter or not they really need something. Apart from that, are the parents the one who decide what to, or not to buy. As we're talking about the role of parents; children between two and five years shouldn't be allowed to regularly watch TV on their own as TV programmes can contain a lot of violence younger children may not understand jet. 
To finish, I have to say I definitely agree with prohibiting television advertising toward young children.
