Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed...?
(I never had a Tv at home, so I don`t know much about it...)
pro: 
- bloody pictures, viedos
- the content isn`t for their age
- sexual content 
- bad influence
- THEY SHOULD GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY THEIR, THEY DONT HAVE TO WACH TV! 

contra: 
- how you wanna forbit it? 
- parents have to decide waht their children can wach

I think the biggest problem is, if the parents are waching tv all day long, I understand that their kids are waching too. But I think the most thinks that are shown in Tv is wronge, stupid or a bad influence. There are so many progarmms wich bloody staff and their is also a lot of sexual content. their are also good and helpfull thinks in tv but it`s just a small part of it. The kids shouldn`t wach much Tv in this age. It would be better if they play outside or inside with friends in their age. Now a day many childrens haven`t a childhood more because they were all the time wich electronic staff. (tv, mobilphone, playstation) But I think it`s very dificult to forbit it in general. 

My opinon is that it should be a decison of the parents.
