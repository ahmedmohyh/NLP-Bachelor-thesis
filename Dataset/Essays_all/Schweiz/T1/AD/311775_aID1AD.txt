Advertising
A lot of people of two until hundert years old people watch televsison. Watch TV is a important thing in our world. Because with watch TV we learn a lot of things par example with the news on TV, whats going on with the word or the document films, the life of an animal. But should watch TV be allowed to the two until five years old childern also? With this question I will be going on.

It is not good for the very young childern to watch television because it is not good for the healthy for par example for the eyes. And when the children will be older they look enough televison. That is the reason why I think televison advertising directed toward the two until five years old children should not be allowed. Because when the televison advertising should be allowed to the children then they watch televison. But in this young ages we can do a lot of other things. Probably the childern don't want go out for playing whith their friends.They are only sitting in theirs room an focused on watch TV.

But sometimes the television advertisting brings a lot of good things. So that the childern can learn a lot of things in this young ages. That is an avantage for the children later. They can learn things in an other way and that could be funny. 

In the end I want say that television advertisting could be an avantage but also a desavantage. When the parents look that the children don't watch televison a lot then I think television advertisting should be allowed.
