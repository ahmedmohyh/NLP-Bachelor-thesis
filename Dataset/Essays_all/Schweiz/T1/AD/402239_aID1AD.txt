Television advertising for young children
Fourteen years ago, I was five years old and after every television advertisings with toys I asked my mother, if she can buy that for me. I think it was horrible for my mother. Because I had a lot of toys, but I wanted more. Because every toy in the advertising looks very nice and funny. They want that the children ask her parents all the time for a special toy. So I think for unstressed parents, television advertising must be forbidden.
In the television advertising they get the children a wrong Imagination. Often when I bought a toy, which I saw, then it wasn't so funny like in the advertising. In the advertising every thing make a sound and you can see a lot of colours. Another trick, how they make that everybody want to buy this toy, is that they make a very nice background. It could be that the toy is in a very nice room or the toy is in the real world. For example the advertising of Playmobil. They make an advertising for one toy but in the advertising are a lot of other toys. So when you bought one toy, then it's boring. You have to buy all toys, that you can play like in the advertising. Another thing with Playmobil is, that they have playmens and in the advertising sometimes they can speak. but in the real world it's impossible. 
In the Television advertising you can see things for the first time. You couldn't know that they exist. And sometimes you see something and you realy want it but your parents are again this toy or this play. For example it's a war game. The problem is, that when your parents say no, you'll go to your grandparents or to your godfather or godmother. you ask everybody until  somebody say yes. And then your parents can't say no. 
I think for a better relationship between the parents and the children television advertising shouldn't be allowed for children.
