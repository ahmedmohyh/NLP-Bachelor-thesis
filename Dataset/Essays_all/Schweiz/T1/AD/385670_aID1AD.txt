Today we ask the quesion: "Should TV advertising towards young children be forbidden?" 
A Fact that is for this statement is that young children should' be involved in such things yet. Young children can be easesly manipulated for someone's needs and advertising could be seen as something similar to manipulating. The main reason of advertising is to convince the consumer to buy their product. So children could be heavely affected by this and because many parents often try to fullfill every wish of their kids, they are affected by it too.
A Point wich speaks against this statement, are the basics of Economicliberation. Almost every western country has free economics. You can't just forbid the Companies to make advertisments. It's clear that the companies have to let their costumers know, what products they have and convince them in every way possible. Every Company has to do that for surviving and that the Economic system can work.
We also have to talk about the actual problem of this topic. The Problem isn't the fact that there are advertisments for Children. The real Problem here is that parents let the kids get affected by something like that, because they let them look TV too long. We wouldn't have this problem, when parents wouldn't let their Chilren look TV all day long. So it's nonsense to sarch the solution in the companies. 
And the last argument states my oppinion towards this topic. When parents complain that their children get affected by TV advertisments too heavely, it's just pushing the debths from them. Parents should just reduce the TV consume of their Children and the problem would be gone. So in my oppinion the question should be different and the solution to the Problem should be searched elsewhere.
