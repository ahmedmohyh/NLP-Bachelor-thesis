Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. 
To start with an important point, why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is,
that alot of young children can learn by watching TV, sure they have to watch a programm which is good for their age.
If they watch programms in diffrent languages they can learn some words and important sentences.
An other case is, that their parents have more time for themselfes so they are less stressed and they have not to pay money for an expensive babysitter.
It is also important to confront childrens early with electronic devises, like the TV, because actually you should have the know-how for these things, how they work, how to find the right programm, how to change language and so on. If every child is allowed to watch TV, just partly of the day, maeby an hour or an half, the children could have more the same chances later at kindergarden and at school. 
But there are also some things which are contra watching TV in these ages. 
A child which is just two to five years old should also play with other childrens outside. When children pass a lot of time by watching TV they have no time to play outside. An other bad case is that there is a lot of unimportant, bad things in TV and children could be anxious after watching TV. The parents also should not forget to do something with their child because it is important for a child.
In my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but just partly.
