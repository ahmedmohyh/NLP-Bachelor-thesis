Television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because two to five year olds shouldn't be watching TV all the time. They should play outside and socialize. They don't learn as much if they are just at home watching TV as they do if they are active and social.

Also, children can get addicted to watching TV quite easily. They don't want to do anything else but watching TV and once they're used to watching many hours of television per day, it's hard to change the habit. 

Parent's shouldn't think it's ok for their young children to be watching TV. Television advertising directed towards young children can give parents the impression that they should buy a television for their kids, which can have bad effects on their childhood, as stated above.

On the other hand, a company shouldn't have too many regulations with respect to competition. A free market requires free competition. A business has to think of ways to sell their products. If they feel the need to direct television advertising toward young children, then they should be free to do so.

Parents who aren't aware of the consequences that letting their children watch television can have, should be taught about them. Yet, television advertising toward young children won't change anything about the problem. Parents should be old enough to be able to decide if they want to buy a TV for their kids or not.

In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. It is immoral and doesn't help with the problem that too many kids nowadays watch too many hours of television in their free time.
