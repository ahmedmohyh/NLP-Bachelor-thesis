Television advertising direced toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Children in this age don't knowe anything about life. Theyr are dependent from theyr parents. 

The economy is a big part of evrybody life ist a part of the children too. There is a winn winn situation. The children need some plays how Lego or Playmobil. The children lean by playing. The economy use the television to present the children the new plays and whats its possible with this tihngs. So why shouldn't it be allowed when the parent of the children do the same and let them inspired by the adversiting. So the economy can grow and the children can learn. 

But there are some negative points. If its allowed the children are slaves of the economy. They don't know anything about life and how it works. The economy use the joung people to make money. The children don't know how mutch they have to pay for for it. They haven't money. The parents have to realise the children dreams. At the end  the children have all the won't and don't know what it calls to have not anything. There are children who have to work in this age in othe continents. Ant our children have all things. 

I question myself why children are watching TV between this age. The children sould play aoutside on the street withe theyr freinds. They tould play in the forest and enjoy the nature. In this age they souldent be aroundet from TV, laptop, smartphone ant things like this. They soult just be children. In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed. This children are our future. We shoulden't influence them in this young age with strategies from the economy and from the TV.
