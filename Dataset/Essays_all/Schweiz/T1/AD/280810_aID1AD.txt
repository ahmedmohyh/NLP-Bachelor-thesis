There is a discussion on whether or not commercials should be legal when directed to young children. Kids do not understand what advertisement is, so the offspring tends to fall for many marketing methods. For example; "Buy one little stuffed bear and get one free", the innocence of not understanding that buying a product and getting one free does not exist, and the price for both products is being paid; make children immensely vunerable. Capitalism is oversmarting children, and not many individuals seem to care. 
 On the other hand, commercials and product placements are nowadays as common as water is. So, it does make much sense to prepare the offspring for reality. The parents are responsable for teaching kids on how to overlook or detect false advertisement. Therefore, the future adults know how to make educated choices, when it comes to their consuming activity. Balancing out what the commercials promise and what is real, such behaviour is a part of common sense.
  After examinating both points of view, my opinion is that there are no reliable reasons for children not being exposed to advertisement. Even though kids might be easy victims for selling strategies, it is important that such experiences can be made. Parents have the obligation of teaching and preapairing offspring  for the world, so the addition of common sense should not be destracted by fooling protection policies.
