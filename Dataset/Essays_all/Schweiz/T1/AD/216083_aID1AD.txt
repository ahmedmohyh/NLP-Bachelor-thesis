I totally disagree with this statement. I absolutly see no reason why advertising for young people shouldn't be allowed. But I see the discussting point because in this age of evolution you can manipulate children so easy. The mean point of this is the developpers of the television advertising go directly to the feelings and emotions of the children. The target is: they want to manipulate them that the children go to the parents and they say like: I want this teddybear I want it please buy me one. But I think the advertising shouldn't be cancered because it is the case of the parents what they buy or not. The parents also should control the using of the television for the child because advisement isn't the most dangerous thing in the tv. 

But in general I stay by my opinion I disagree with the statement. The best argument is the parents should control it and you never can say this advise is for children and this not. Where is the frontier between them? I rather don't know where and the managers of the tv channels have got the same problem. 

So as a overview I can see some arguments for the statement but I don't see the better ones. Mabye I can show a exemple of my life. When I was younger, I always wanted an action man. I wanted spiderman, batman and my favorite one superman. In the tv there exist a advise for action man and I loved this adversing show. but my parents never gave one to me.
