Advertising is an important thing to influence small children. Now the big companys (which have already enough money) get more rich than before. The message to the children is that the need something but in real they do not need it. The poor parents have to pay thing for their kinds. With this things the small childrens never play and it ends in the corner. All of this is not important. The most important reason is that the companys earn morer money. This is good for the economy and a strong economy is good for everyone. This leads to a happy society. Sure you can say that is not nice. As I was a child I liked this advertising very much and it makes me to the person who I am. I often fight with my mother because she does not give the gift who I saw in television. These are the negative effect. But the money is more important. The advertising also inform the small children (what is new?). So the companys are able to influence the life of the children (which is not good!). Our children are part of the economy.
