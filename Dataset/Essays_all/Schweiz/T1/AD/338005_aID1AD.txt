Almost every Family has a TV at home. And most of the people like to watch TV after their long day. When children get home from school or kindergraten is it really a good idea to let them watch Spongebob?
Watching TV is not always something bad or stupid, you can also watch smart TV Shows where you can learn something and these Shows are made for children too. As i said can children also learn from watching TV and then it should be allowed so kids can learn quick, beacause I think that children learn quicker when it makes fun and every child likes watching TV. For example Dora the TV Show so many children have watched this or are watching this and that's a show where they can really learn something. If you watch Dora in german you may learn english what is great. You may also learn something about animals and stuff that happens in this world. But should the children really see this in a screen or in reallife? 
There are also not that smart TV Shows for children that are just for amusement for example Spongebob. I have watched Sppngebob but when I think back now I think it is a bad show for children because you learn nothing but useless things and children may come bad ideas by watching this kind of shows. And young people should also get out of the house and play on the playground instead of watching Spongebob cooking Burgers. This is where these kids get to know the real, important things and where they are in contact with other children what is also very important in that age. 
Watching television in the age of two to five should not be forbidden but the parents should look that the kids won't watch too much or silly things. It won't be bad for children to watch half an hour or something around that.
