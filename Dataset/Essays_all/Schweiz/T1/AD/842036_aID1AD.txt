Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
That opinion on advertisments is not that strange because advertisements encourage people to buy things and if a little kid sees something really cool on the tv it might run to its mother or its fahter and tell them to buy it. That is really common way to gain customers.

At one side it is kind of mean using children for getting a product bought. Children don't know that advertisments want us to buy things and aren't really that cool than in the advertisememts. They see all these nice things the product can do and then thay want that product. But isn't it the same with adults? Adults are might seeing other advertisements on tv but they they get to want products the same as little children.

In fact we have to  ask ourselves why a five year old children would watch that much tv that they see some advertisement of a product they want?It is not good for children to send so much time inside watching television. Children should go outside and play with other children, make friends and have fun on a playground.
Moreover it is a bit suspious that advertisement for older children or adults are apparently so horrible, that they totally distract little children and give them nightmares, so you have to make advertisement for little children. If it is really like this than older children or might even adults shouldn't watch them as well.

In my opinion I can't see a problem in making advertisements for little children, but I can in fact see a problem in parents who let their children watch tv all day.Altough I have to say that I don't think it ist really okay to gain customers on this way. For me it is a problem in the moral.
