Today, the most of the families in Switzerland have an television at home and there are many children which like very much to watch TV. But like I think, that everyone of us knows, is there in every programm a lot of advertising between. So it's important, that we think about, if this is good for little children or, if it's bad for joung children and sholdn't be allowed.

Actually, there are many sorts of advertising, which are about things, like errotic stuff or pages for meeting someone in the internet, which children should learn from their parents or someone else, but shurely not from the television. Things like this, they can also mot understand in a age under six years.

On the other hand,there is many funny advertising, which children like to watch. And the children are our next generation and so the next consuments. Also, are there a lot of errotiacal scenes or scenes of violence in the normal programm, like films or series. So shouldn't we rather think about young children should watch TV generall?

In think that the parents of young children should think about which programmes and how longand often in a week they want their children to watch tV. Because there are a lot of programms, which are extra made for little children, and in these series there isn't advertising witch for example errotic stuff in it. But in my opinion children under six years don't have to watch TV, theyshould rather play with their parents or with other kids outdoors.
