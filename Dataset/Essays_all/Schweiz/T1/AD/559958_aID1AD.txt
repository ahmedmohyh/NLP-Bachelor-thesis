So today we have commercials about everything for everybody but is it correct to make commercials for "young childrens"?
I mean it isn't allowed to make commercials about ciggarettes and tabaco bacause of the children so why should we make commercials only for children?
I agree the whole television/commercial industry are doing a litle bit of "propoganda" for there products or TV shows', wich penetrade your way of thinking about things, but young chidrens aren't very sensitiv about such things.
But how often are commercials directed to such young childrens?
I mean every commerical on channels like nickelodeon or super RTL are directed to children and whats the problem about am LEGO commercial?
Maybe they need to know wich playmobil they're going to wish for their birthday. 
Clearly they could go to store but parents woud never let them go alone and maybe don't have time for such things.
I personally can't imagine a scenario, wich such commercials could harm or influence a child.
In my point of view it isn't the young children. No. its the children between 10-13 years because they start to think and refelct thing they see.
they haven't enough education to analsye things. 
So I don't have point why they should prohbit avertising to young children.
