First of all I would say that it is an important question what the content of the advertising is. I think children with an age of two to five shouldn't be watching that much TV, so if there's television advertising which attracts the young children that much then it could be difficult to bring them away again. In the world of today there's a huge value on the technology and children grow up with it but I don't think that this is the right way to do it. Children get manipulated by these television advertisings and they often get an illusion of reality. So if they have their first day in school all they can talk about is TV, games and other things.
Parents often don't come around with the situation if the children aren't quiet and then they put their children in front of the TV. Mostly of the time they are quiet then and the mother can do her homework and whatever she has to do and she can leave her children for a couple of hours alone. Maybe children at this young age can learn a lot of things by themselves if they are watching these television advertisings. Many series for young children are made to learn, for example counting or easy reading. 
I think I agree a lot with this statement because there's so much more you can do with your children than hanging around in front of the TV and watching those advertisings. The kids at this young age probably won't understand it and if they get used to it they just want more and more. Kids who watched a lot of TV at this young age have later higher wishes especially to the parents. So as a parent it could be difficult to make the wishes come true for them
