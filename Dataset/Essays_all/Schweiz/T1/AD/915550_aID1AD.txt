Nowadays young children are often very early in touch with our modern technology. It's normal to have an IPhone in the 5th grade of primary school. Parents allow their children to watch television when they go out or it's okay to see a film under the week after school. For example I sometimes go babysitting a child named Lily. She's five years old and on a Saturday evening she always wants to watch TV. Their parents think it's okay. But is this the way it should be? Shouldn't television towards young children be forbidden?

On the one hand there are very funny and entertaining channels for kids, for example KIKA or Super Channel. The children enjoy watching fantasy stories or interessting stories with a happy end. When they get so early in touch with television it's easier for them to use other technoogical things later. Maybe they see things on the TV they learn from.
On the other side there are many channels on the TV with aren't thought for children aged from two to five years. Maybe they get shocked by the things they see and can't sleep again. The possiblility that they get addicted is also very high. They watch TV for many hours on a nice Saturday afternoon. They haven't time to play with their friends.

My opinion is that so young children should enjoy their live playing with friends outside and go on an adventure by themselves. They have enough time to watch TV when they're older.
