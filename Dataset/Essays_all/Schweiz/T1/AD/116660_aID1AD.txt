In my oppinon its not a problem the make advertisment on TV for young children. I mean they also see new/ other toys they would like to have when they are playing with an other child. That has the same influene. In my view the parents have a big influence on their child and they can controle what their children are watching. So it's in the hands of the parents what they think is the best for their child. And yes it can also be challanging for parents, when their child wants to have something that it saw in an advert, but you as a parent can use it wisely and can show their child that it can't always get what it wants and that it has to wait for something. I think for the economy its really important that they can advertise on TV because thats the most efficant way to advertise in these days. Not many people specially childrend, are looking in a magasin to choose their new toys. In TV you can also choose exactly who should watch your advert and who doesnt so the advertisement is very efficient. 
On the other hand children cant filter the information they get. So if in the advert a plane is flying, the child thinks that the plane is actually able to fly and thats not fair. If they then get the plane and realise, that the plane cant fly, they will be very disappointed. 
I think that we cant say that advertisment in TV is not allowed towards young people. We should make strict rules on how the advertisment for young people should be made. An imortant rule in my view would be, that there should be no lies allowed or graphical tricks. The rest should be in the hands of the parents. There are TV channels just for children without any advert in it. If parents disagree with it they can just make their child watch one of those channels.
