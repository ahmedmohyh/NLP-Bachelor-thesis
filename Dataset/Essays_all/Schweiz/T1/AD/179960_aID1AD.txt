Advertising is all about knowing how to influence the audience. 

Kids between 2-5 are too young to be influenced by television.

What do you want? This is a really hard question to answer nowadays. When I was little though, I remember knowing way better what I wanted and what I didn't. Everybody did. This is why advertising young kids is so much easier. Theyare predictable, easy to influence and with that to be fooled by ads. They will look at this clip on the flatscreen and since the advertising market knows exactly what they are doing, those kids will be sure that this is the thing they need, now. They will go to their parents and beg for this toy. This way the ad is working through the kid to reach the parents. It gives the advertiser an easier job, but are we really aloud to use kids for business?

At this age you could call most kids naiv. They live their life day per day, like they would go through a big game.Even though they do forgive and forget way faster than adults do,  there is dohave litlle fights quite often. A tease hera and another there, it doesn't need more for a kid to start crying. Most young children get their first experience with the different Money-status of their family vs. theone of another. This wouldn'tbe anything bad if it wouldn't mean that they haven't got something, other kids got. I'm not talking about a rugby ball, I'm talking about those expensive toys, which get advertised in TV and a few families just can't afford it. After a while, those expensive Toys get to a trend and those kids with the poorer familiesget bullied because they don't have those new toys. 

I think that advertiser shouldonly be aloudto promote something to someone who actually understands what's happening. There is no reason, they should be aloud touse kids to reach the parents, even if this would be the easier way for them. They should be able to choose without any in
