The television as we know it is a significant invention and has taken the globe by storm. In his beginnings there was not this unbelievable selection of channels from all around the world. The opportunities are endless and it is by now not just where to ... us. There are endless functions, so for example the app Netflix you can download without problems and enjoy the latest TV shows and much more. But it is not just fun: If you decide to watch a movie on a saturday night, have you ever count how much time you waste by watching the whole advertising? Oh dear! It is way too much. So which arguments to prevail now?

Television advertising has become a real problem it is not just about the amount but also about the contents. Throughout the years they reached a whole new image. But the biggest problem are the young children, who grow up with the myths transfered by marketers. Little kids are easy to manipulate and develope because of fake information and input a false state of mind about things like success, money and fame directed toward the advertise. Marketers want them to believe everything they say. Children at the age of two to five are until then not able to build their own opinion about things, so they think the perspective of the marketers and elders is the way they have to look at things and that they ahve to support the same point of view. 
It not just about the superficial things they show us on TV screen, in life it is about the little things. But they never even looked behinde the masquerade, why would they, they are kids! 

There is television advertising for everything: toys, food, games, cars, everything you could imagine. In my eyes it has become a real problem and the negative arguments dominate for sure! Television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed!
