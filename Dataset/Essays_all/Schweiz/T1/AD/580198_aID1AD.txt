Advertising becomes more and more important in our world. But adverts are also dangerous, because they influence us in the way they want us to think. This can have a very bad impact on children that's why I think ads that target children between the age of two and five should be forbitten.

Making a child think, that for eg. a special toy is something they have to have, creates multible problems. 
One of those problems is that the child will ennoy its parents because it wants to have this toy. This is especially a problem if the parents don't want to buy the toy eighter because they don't have the money or because they don't think it's a good toy for their child. 
This creates another problem, because if there is a group of children and some of them have this adverted toy and some of them don't the ones without the toy will probably feel bad or even be bullied. This also creates even more stress for the parents.

Children are also more likely to remember an ad. I've seen this phenomen with my little brother: When I saw the ad, I just told myself: "it's an ad, don't think about it to much". But smaller children like my brother don't realise that, my brother now knows some ad by heart which means he definetly got influenced by them.

To pick up a point I wrote about earlier: Often toys or other things, that are shown in an ad, aren't very good things for children that's why parents mostly don't want their child to have them. Very good toys for example have hardly ever an ad campaign.

Making ads that target two to five years old children illegal would be a huge step in the right direction. But to do this, there are still some problems to overcome. Who decideds which ads are banned for example. Also with younger and younger children using the internet it also gets more and more difficult to ban ads because on the internet goverments sometimes cant control everything
