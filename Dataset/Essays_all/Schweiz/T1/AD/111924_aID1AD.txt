Advertising - especially in television is prone to be controversial. Its goal is to show the best side of the product which is tried to be sold. Even if the product has many drawbacks the advertisers and marketing people try to hide them. The audience has to develop an own feeling which statements can be trusted an which you should maby overthink. Should children be exposed to heavy marketing in a young age?
It is freedom of speach and general freedom to be able to make almost every advertisment (even tough in some peoples opinion there should be more control over what ads are on for instance national TV). To sort of lie about a certain product is not considered illicit. Every person exposed to advertisments (today you can't escape the PR and marketing) should have developed a sense of whom can be trusted in advertising and who just tries to sell you a bad product. In the early stages of life my parents decided for me what was good and bad to be influenced with, for example if a toy is . And just as my parents did, most parents try to protect their children in this age. Of course they have to develop an own sense of justice and own view on things. But because young kids are so easily influenced (for good and bad) it's not wrong to want to protect your little kid and want to give them your view on things on their way. It's the parents decision what their kid is exposed to and influence with, but advertising especially for kids is like exploiting even the youngest generation.
