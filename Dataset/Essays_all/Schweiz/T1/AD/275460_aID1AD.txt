Already between the age of two and five years we have a huge problem with the children. They are sitting in front of the television watching their favorite series without communicating to other young poeple. At all there would be a lot of postitive points putting a sign and say that`s not allowed to watch TV for children between two and five. They would automatically prefer playing oustide and making friends. Not only that. If we know what`s happening in the TV show sometimes, we should really change the rules.  


But on the other side I think the series of small children on "Super-RTL" or something like that is a good point for the imaganition and the phantasy. They even learn something by watching TV and that`s the positive point of it. Not only this, it`s a kind of living into the aged person. They already know how to use it. 
On my opinion it shouldn`t be changed a lot but it should be controlled strictly by the parents. The children may watch maybe only a half an hour per day or something like that. Bacause the most impotant thing in life is communicating to other pepole. You cannot afford poeple to watch TV, they should realize themselfe, where they should stop. That`s just a kind of human intelligence. And because of this it shouldn`t be changed anything.
