First, I dont think that advertisments directed to children at the age of two to five would be worth paying for, because children in this age usually don't have much or any money at all. So this means that the advertisement relies on a two to five year old child beeing able to persuade their parents into buying something they want. I dont think thats a very good idea. Additionaly most kids in this age dont watch a lot of TV or are surfing in the internet for a limited time per day, so they are not exposed to the advertisements very much, for example some of my relatives allow their kids to use electronic devices for just thirty minutes to one hour per day, and they dont watch a lot of advertisements in this time. In addition a lot of people skip the advertisements with an ad-blocker in the internet or by switching to another channel when the advertisements start on TV. So even if there is a lot of advertisement aimed towards young children, it's not very effective in my opinion.
About if advertisements should not be allowed, I dont really know. Children in young age are easely so maybe we should try to protect them from the influence of the medias and big companies. On the other side some channels on TV or some website in the internet need the money they get from showing advertisements to provide a free service, and with less advertisement and then less money maybe some smaller sites or channels or some that show a lot advertisements aimed towards children would not be able to exist as a free service and they would need to shut down or to demand money for their sevice.
In the end I think the ones publishing the advertisments and the ones that make it and pay for it just need to know for themself if they want to manipulate children or not.
