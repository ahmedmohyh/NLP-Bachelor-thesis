When I was young I regularly watched television and I do not regret it. As far as I can remember I never liked those television advertising.  My mother did not like it at all when I was in front of the television because it would not be good for the eyes but my father thought that I would learn new things while watching. But did I learn anything from advertisings? Are advertisings good for children?

First of all, watching advertisings makes children curious because they show things with the newest technology and this stops the children appreciating what they actually have. My father thaught me then that I should not believe everything I see on TV because most of them just want to sell as much as possible even when they have to lie.

Advertisings are good for children when they cannot speak the language fluently. Watching TV teachs their listening and comprehension skills. Of course, you will not learn much from advertisings but they often do only use simple words, so most of the people will understand. In this way it is a good training for the children.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons. You may let the children watch to practise the language skills or you do not let them because you want to protect them. In my opinion, I think the parents should decide on their own what their children should watch or not. There is actually no bad or good side of watching advertisings. No matter where you are you see those advertisings everywhere and when you think that your child will be influenced by some more advertisings in the TV then do not let you child watch them.
