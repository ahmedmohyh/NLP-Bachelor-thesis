Years ago, when my brother was 5 years old and we watched TV together I always was genervt of the advertising. But my brother was looking forward to the interrupts in the best scenes of the film. But some advertisement weren't for his eyes I thought. And then I asked me why they show them if little children it watches.

A cons is that young children don't understand what they watches. They can't link one thing with the other. Another point is that the parents can decide if their child are allowed to watch TV and so they can steuern the advertisement which the children are watching. On the top of that, you can't stop the advertising on the television.

An argument for the pro side is that young children can see some thing they don't have to see. There are television advertising which aren't for young-children-eyes. Another point is that children should have the possibility to decide for themself what they find good. Finally, it's difficult to control what the children are watching.

In my opinion it depends on the advertisment and the product which are the advertising for. Each parents have to decide what they show their children. I think the best is when young children play in the nature instead of watching TV.
