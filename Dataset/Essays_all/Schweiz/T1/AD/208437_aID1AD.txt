In our time the advertisement, especially on TV, is mostly directed towards certain interest groups. While watching a action movie with lots of explosions and stunts the advertisement, which is placed in the breaks of the movie you will get for example mostly advertisement for products that men need. But in my opinion young children should not be pulled into this as well and it should not be allowed to direct advertisement toward this group of people.

Yes this would be an injury of the economic freedom for companies, which would than be less competitive in the world market. Also this could start a chain reaction and more and more criteria would be introduced into the tv-advertising sector. Also not all advertisements present a bad good. There can certainly be an advert for a product that is useful for a child and can help it in everyday life.

But to be honest there are hardly people that get excited when the movie or tv-show that they are watching gets interrupted by an advertisement break. Sometimes there is this funny or well made advert but in general they are plain, boring and tell you something that is only half the truth. Teens and adults easily realise the false advertisement and see the intentions of the companies, but the young children, they do not. They can easily be influenced and one could even say that they get brainwashed into a consumption cultur, because the idea of always having to have the best and newest product gets planted in their head from a young age. 

To sum up I think children should not be adressed in advertisement because they are too young to distinguish between lie and truth.
