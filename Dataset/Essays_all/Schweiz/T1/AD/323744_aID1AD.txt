In our society advertisment is a big part of our everyday live but should it affect really young children?
This is a hard question. In this essay I try tho find arguments for and against this statement.
One argument against televison advertisments towards young children is the fact that those children can not even buy the things that are advertised. They can only annoy their parents to the point that the buy them a new doll or the sweets. So the parents are the onces which actually suffer from the advertisments. Another agument is that those children have not yet learned how to respond to advertisments in a healthy way, they don't even know that they affect them. The children don't know that the things shown in the advertisments don't show the reality. 
But there are arguments for advertisments directed towards children aswell. One important argument is that the children have to learn a healthy way of responding to advertisments sooner or later. Especially since nowadays they are very present in our lives. It can be helpful for the children to get used to the advertisments by seeing them on the tv but it is very important that the parents talk about the advertisments with their children. Another arguments is the fact that advertisment is a very important thing for our economie. Companies couldn'tsurvive without advertising their products. It can be seen as unfair that a company, producing furniture is allowed to do advertisments while another company is not allowed to because they produce toys.
My conclusion is that this is a very controversial question and it is hard to answer it. My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be allowed to do television advertisments toward young children. I think that they are not ready to proceed the thing the see and that the companies use use small children to make a great deal out of it.
