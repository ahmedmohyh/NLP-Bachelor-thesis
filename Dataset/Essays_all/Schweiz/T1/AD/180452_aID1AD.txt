Advertising is everywhere. It influences people and makes them buy some unnecessary stuff. But is it right to influence young children by television advertising? 

Children are very influencable. They imitate and copy to learn. Their dependence from adults is huge. Small children are not yet able to think in a complexe way. They often can not even say what they need or want. So it is not right to show them television advertising - they will want whatever they see without really knowing what it is. They are helpless and can not understand that they are influenced. If television advertising gets a normal thing, they may be more influencable when they are adults.

On the other hand, they do not have a long term memory. When they see the product from the television advertising in a magazine, they will not remember the television spot. So the advertising may have almost no influence on them. I think that the advertising adresses the parents. They imagine the joy their children will have with the product and maybe they will buy it then to make their children happy.

In conclusion, i do not think that television advertising toward young children is useful. Maybe it has a bad influence on them and it would be better to forbid television advertising directed toward young children, but I think that it adresses the parents and not directly the children because they can not say what they want, so it makes no sense to forbid it.
