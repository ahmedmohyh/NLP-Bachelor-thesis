I think in the age of two to five, children shouldn't watch TV. Their childhood would be better if they'd go outside and play with friends. I think advertising in TV directed to young children is pretty stupid, because they belive everything they see or hear. I mean, as a kid I told my grandfather everything I heard and made him believe me, because I thought that this was the truth, just because the influence of my surrounding was very big. I hardly ever watch TV, but when I do, the adverts are mostly stupid and not really realistic. The children would watch these stupid adverts and believe everything. They would be influenced by TV and the parents have it harder than ever to help their children grow up in a good way. To be honest, I don't want to see the next two or three generations grow up. I can't stand the young children now. They all run around with smartphones and at home they watch TV or play videogames. If they get even more influenced by  TV it will get worse than now. So in my opinion it should be forbidden to make adverts for young children, they should have a childhood, not growing up in front of an influencing TV.
