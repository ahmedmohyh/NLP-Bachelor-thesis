Essay 1¨

In the following lines you are going to read about specific reasons according to the topic statement, For example how television could cause an addiction and why you should not let a two to five years old child watch television.¨

Firstly your child could miss an important part of his life if it is watching television all the time. Especially at the age of two to five years a child learns a lot of things. They start to ask questions and discover the world. If a child sits in front off the television all day long, there will not be much time left to learn new stuff. Often they start so see television as a reality and therefore they are going to have a problem later on. 

According to the argument from above, children are not going to spend a lot of time with friends and other human beings. They are just going to sit in front of the television and do not do anything. However, it is important to have social contacts and not to get isolated. If a child is watching TV at that age, the risk is getting bigger and bigger. 

Lastly we all know that watching television too often could cause an addiction. Lots of human beings are addicted to TV. Especially at a young age you should not watch television too often, It's okay to watch TV but you should not spend too much time in front of it. Therefore you minimize the risk of getting addicted. 

In my opinion you should allow your child to watch television, but you should definitely have rules. For example: "Not more than 30 minutes a day". It is important to not let the TV educate your child, you should do it yourself and show your son or your daugther how beautiful life can be.
