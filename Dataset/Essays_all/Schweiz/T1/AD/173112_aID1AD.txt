Surround ourself we have so many advertising. In our daily life we are confronted with advertising nearly every single minute. In the bus in the morning, in the internet during work or even during the break time when we watch a football game on television with our close friends or family. But is the advertising also positive for the evolution from the little children (aged two to five). In this short essay I want to give advantages and disadvantages for this topic. 

An advantage for the television advertising directed toward childern is, when their is a advertising with toys or attraction (e.g. funparks). When there are politic propaganda in child television then it is a problem, because children can not difference the good  from the bad things so they are not able to make their own opinion. 

A disadvantage is it when their is non children advertising in a child television programm. The reason for this point is more in an economic way. You should not be allowed to make money because of the little children. They still live in their own world and we should not disturb them their. 

Finally I would say it is better that it should not be allowed to show advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five). It is not fair to give them no choose because they are still to young and maybe to stupid to see the advantages and disadvantages of one advertising.
