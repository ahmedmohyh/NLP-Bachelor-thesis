Television for all ages

We all see them. They are everywhere. From the televisions to the streets, which we are using everyday. I'm speaking of adverdisments. Advertisments have a very big impact on the people, not only on the adults but also on young children. For example: when a young boy sees a new advertisment for a new toy car, he wants to have it and annoys his parents to buy them that. Should it be allowed to produce adverstiments directed to young children ?

On the good side it's positive for the people who sell the products for children. Children are the easiest clients, because they are naive and they don't look at a price of a product. When they want something, they want to have it and beg their parents to buy it for them. That's an intresting and also a save way to sell their products.

But on the other side most parents can't refuse anythung to their children. Because they don't want them to be sad and to hate them. So they buy them for example: the new toy car because their son saw it on the televison ad. It has also a very good impact on the childrens minds, they TV advertisments can control the opinions of the kids. For example: what toy is cool, what jacket you should by next.

In my opinion it's a very good marketing technic, but also a very mean one. Because children have a very big impact on their parents, the parents want their child to be happy and buy them what they want. They spoil the children, but not only the parents also the media. For me the parents should be a little more stricter and shouldn't buy everything that their children wants. Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
