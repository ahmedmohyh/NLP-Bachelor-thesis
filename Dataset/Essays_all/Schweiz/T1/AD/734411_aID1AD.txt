"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
Television can learn you much things, like beeing social in good company or solving things, with that I just mean "what do I do when...?". Children do learn fastly and good so television can be very good. But technoligy isn`t always good, children need to go out and "explore" the world, they need to fail so they can learn how to do it right so always sitting infront of the TV is not the best thing you could let your children do. 
Many series who are for young kids are full of phantasie and they need much imagination and that is very good because sometimes they just need phantasie, as we do in writing tests. But it has its dark side, a lot series are about fighting and war, the hate and the distruction, that is not fine at all. Kids need to learn how to love and be grateful for that what they have and not spend their time watching TV.
So I think that this is a critical subject and I`m not sure at all what I should think, but I grew up not watchig TV till I was like eight years old or something. So my oppinion is that children shouldn`t watch much TV, they need to spend their time outside watching birds or just explore the nature. But TV isn`t always bad, so I think that it should be allowed to let the kids watch TV but not much just a lil bit  a day.
