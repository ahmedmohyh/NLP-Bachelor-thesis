Television advertising is more or less a new thing. In the past we did not have any television or computer, We only bought what we needed. But nowadays we live in a comercial world. You can buy and sell everything all over the world. Thats the 21th century. So I think advertising should be allowed.

First of all, young children have no money to spend. So the parents buy all important things for them. The children have no problem with the advertising, because they can not buy anything. They also too young to understand what they really see on TV.

My second point is, that I think young children should not watch TV. And in this case we have not any problem with television advertising. They just do not see it. And I think that is also right so. They have other things to learn. Children should play outside and explore the nature and the life. Sitting infront of the television is not healthy for their growth  and their education. 

And my last point in this essay is that if children do not see the advertise, nobody will pay for this advertising service. Because it would be useless. And that creates no money for a company. So this hole debate about the permission or not is for nothing. Big Companies can advertise with other things.

To put it in a nutshell, I think we do not need this prohibition. Companies can do it if they want but in the end it is useless. I want heathy children with experience, not stupid TV people. Go outside, explore the world and its secrets, but do not raise a new TV generation. We live in a democracy and we have a lot of rights. For example to advertise. So I do not think we need to interrupt this. So leave this televison with away and be free.
