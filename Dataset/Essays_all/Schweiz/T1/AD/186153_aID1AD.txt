Advertisement has become a debated tobic in our modern society, most specificly in the world of television. Advertisetments inspire people from all ages to buy a product, which they sometimes dont even need. Especially children are easy to be manipulated by advertisements. The question is, should Television advertising directed toward young children be prohibited? In this essay i will list the pro and cons and come to a rational conclusion.

For a start, children in the US and all over the world spend a lot of time in front of their televisions, watching their shows. Once in a while, the show stops, and some loud advertisements fill the room with an annoying sound. Children go to their parents, and scream about new toys they have been seeing in the television. That is a problem, because most of the children are not capable to understand that they are just tricked into buying some cheap toys. So the children are manipulated by the brainwashing advertisements to spend money.

On the other hand, how are TV studios which air a children show supposed to earn money? Or creators of kids Shows or movies? That would damage the whole television industry, because children entertainment makes up a big part of this business.

In conclusion, although it is cruel to manipulate children, i must say that it wouldnt work to ban television advertisments, because it would create great finincial losses for different participants.
