If you turn the tv on, you will see commericals after commericals. They seduct you to buy a product, that most probely istn't even something you really need. But we as young adults know that the things they promise us aren't neccessarly the truth. But what happens when we confront young children form the age of two to five with those television advertises?

For parents those commericals can turn into lots of argument with their child when they're out  goinig shopping. For example when a child sees a toy, which had been in a commercial on tv he will beg for it next time he's in the store with his parents and often they cry until he gets his way. It make the life of parents a lot harder especially when the parents are struggling with money.

A reason tho allow televison advertising directed toward young children is, that they will be confornted with it sooner or later no matter what. It's important to learn to know what you need and what simply is just luxuary to have. It should make you think about how bad you want it. And what's truly worth spending money on.


My opinon on this 
We're living in the 21 centuary. Technology is everywhere and so are commercials. That's just a natrual result of it and we humans have to accept it. We have to show children that all of it. This is a part of living in this generation. Building a shell isn't going to help them in the futur, because when they're older it would be even harder to teach them not to fall for every televison advertising. It's better to teach them when they're young.
