Why should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not? In fact, this is not an easy question, because in the development of children, the age betwen two and five is important. So they are influenced by everything they see in television. Most advertising is directed toward adults and for this reason completely unuseful for little childrens development. I personally don't think that advertising is good for children even if it's especially made for them.

At first, the effect of the advertising for the enterprise is not so clear. Children in young age are dependent from their parents, so the children have to ask their parents for the product they have seen in advertising. Since most stuff in children advertising are really stupid or useless things, the parents are probably not going to buy things, unless they think it's good. So it's better to do the advertising toward adults anyway.

On the other hand, I personally think that it has no good effect on children watching television advertising. It's more or less prooved that there are much better and more intelligent things to do for children than watching TV for hours. If children are used to advertising, the enterprises can do even more and more advertising later, because nobody reclaims. It got normal.

I think the advertising to young children should get forbidden. That would not even get the enterprises in finacial debts. They nearly don't make any advertising for children now. Fact is, children can watch TV advertising early enough when they grew older.
