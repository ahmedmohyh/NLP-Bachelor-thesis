Everybody knows those annoying commercials that interrupt a good movie. Many companies are trying to win the people for their product and they mostly succeed because otherwise they'd quit because it's not worth it and they couldn't afford it anymore. Often their aiming at young people in order to generate new loyal customers because once they like your product there's a high possibility that they'll always buy it. I want to answer the question whether this kind of commercial should be allowed or prohibited. 
Commercials are often responsible for addiction in any way. If you eat at Mac Donalds for instance you'll get to see a lot of young people (like from two to five years old) and when you see them eating those "Happy Meals" you can conclude that they were inspired by these remarkable advertisements from the TV spots. But from now on they'll always eat at Mac Donalds and over the years they'll most likely gain weight what damages their image and perhaps they be bullied one day. 
But when you think about I bet you'll come up with some good arguments that emphasize the importance of those advertisement. I mean think about our economy: It need's to work like this. Companies are supposed to grew and enlarge all the time and they generate new employers what reduces the number of unemployed workers. Imagine the government would forbid commercials for those people; Companies would get stuck and wouls have effects for other companies like for example the companies who deliver products and so on. 
So imagine commercials for young people were forbidden companies would have a big lack in perhaps twenty years. What would for example companies like "Lego" do if they didn't have any customers anymore. 
In my opinion it would be ridiculous if the government didn't allow commercials directed to young people anymore. They would restrict their own economy system and made a huge mistake they cannot be frogiven for.
