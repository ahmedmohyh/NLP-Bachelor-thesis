Should television advertising for childern be allowed?

In earlier times televisons were not so popular as today. They had only one or two chanels and adverties were too expensive. But today we have a lot of chanels and also a lot of advertisy. But is it nessecary to advert on a chanel for children?

In my opinion the companys which produce products for children can get a lot of money if the show their products on those chanels for the kids. You can easy make a children to want something even when it does not need it. They would ran to their parents and ask them to buy that thing as soon as they see it  on their television. The parants always want to make their kids happy so they would go and buy it. The advertisy does not even have to be very special to turn a childrens mind. That is also a good point for the company. They do not have to spend a lot of money on the production of an adverting. It just has to look funny and cool and the rest dose not even matter for the little children.

On the other hand I think that it is okey to make money on this way. Because the kids can not decide how good the product is. They only want to have it. I mean, the companys do some tricks. So if the parents do not buy that thing for their kid, it will be very sad. Some children can fall into depressions and feel uncool. That is not good for later on. If a children dose not have that thing and all the others have it and this little sad kid has to watch the product everyday on the televison, it loses the motivation for playing. 

All things considered I would bann television advertising for children. I think it is not fair to play whit the childrens mind and feelings. I would rather try to get little costumers on an other way.
