Televison advertising to young children in the ages of two to five years should be allowed because they learn how to use the medium in a good way. They should know which programmes they are allowed to see and which ones aren't good for their ages.

Televison adevertising can influence the children in a way so they would like to see all the stuff they hear and also see and have no feeling for a good amount af time they watch TV.

The televison can make dependant so the childrens have no feeling for how long it is good to look at the televison. They only know the virtual world and haven't got an idea what else there is in the world. The children haven't got lots of social contacts. Later in school this can be a problem beacause they aren't able to work and play with other classmates or friends in the same age. 

The televison also can make that the childrens which are often watch programmes suffer at being concentrated and have no feeling for a good amount of watching TV.

But the televison is usefull to learn important things like the colours or how to count or to learn the language. But it is only good when they look at specific programmes which are especially made for childrens. When they look at programmes which aren't allowed for their ages they can feel frighten.


In my opinion it isn't a good thing to advertising toward young children because they don't know which damage it can make when they look all the programmes which are directed to them. But it can be a good thing if they watch at programmes which are especially made for them. So they can learn to count, learn the colours or only to sleep better at night. I think there shouldn't be televison advertising directed to young childrens becuase in my opinion the parents have the responsibility to their children if they are allowed to watch television and which channel their children are allowed to watch.
