Often parents let their children watch television without observation. Thus these young kids are on their own and can do whatever they want. In fact many times they are even too young to decide what to watch or to do. So they get automatically influid by everything they see, as well the advertising.

 I have often seen short clips about 'Kinder Schokolade' or about Apps, which are directed toward young children. This could result a wish of them toward their parents. Maybe now this kids always ask about choclate and annoy their parents. The same situation might happen with a new App, which was presented in an advertising. Although the parents have not given any electronic advice to their children. They get to know tablets, cell phones and could become a victim of the media society. 

An other reason why it should be forbidden could be the health of the children. Often their brain can not handle all the pictures, which are shown in television advertising. In worst case their eyes could be harmed. Maybe they even get a wrong imagination of the world. 

At the age of two to five years they are not able to differate between what is good for them and what is not. So everything seem exciting and intersting to them. This is not any good influence. They are overwhelmed from impressions and irritated. At many times young children do not get the message of the adveritsing, so it is not usefull. I totally agree, that it should not be allowed.
