Advertising

I think that television advertising for kids isn't a good thing, because they have to watch TV to get this information. When the childrens are too young they shouldn't watch too much TV or look at other displays, because that hurts the eyes after a while and the kids won't go out anymore. If there weren't an advertisment for this kids, they couldn't can watch it. 
Often informs the advertisment about things which are not comparable with the real facts or it shows you something which is made for adults and is just a little bit changed for a young child. So the kids get connected by that with things, which are not for there age and maybe they make out of that a wrong imagination about there lifes. 
On the other hand are advertisments for young children a good thing, because they can learn something new and maybe there is a good product for them. When parents watch TV with there young children, the kid has something to concentrait on and the parents have some time to relax. Then when the kid saw something interesting on TV the parents can buy it and don't have to go in a store. That makes it easier for the parents and the kid has something to play with.
But another fact is that advertisments are only between two shows on TV. When a kid can watched TV it saw automaticly the advertisments aswell.
When you don't want, that your young child didn't see an advertisment on TV, you shoudn't allow him to watch TV. They are both not good for a human in such a young age.
I agree with this statement, because I don't want that kids get hurt and stupid from TV advertisments. And when they are watching TV they shoudn't get some stupid information about a new play.
