In my opinion it isn't as harmful as some of the publicity which little children are confronted with. Children nowedays grow up with electronic devices and it is quite normal and safe to say that children see things which they shouldn't see or what they should not see yet. Advertising isn't harmful, it is the content in it which isn't okay. The content should be checked before some companys publish it. But children could learn from advertisement. They could improve their language and their vocabulary just by listening to the conversation or what is being told in it. I'm sure the children don't know all of the words which they hear while watching TV so it is an improvement. At this age children are keen on developing their abilities, even though they might don't know it yet. It is important that they have a basis to build on. It isn't useful for anybody to keep the children isolated from the environment and slow down the improvement of the abilities thich they will need in the upcoming future. On the other hand the advertising is directly directed to children so the companies which produce the adverts won't use difficult words. They have to make sure that even the youngest children are able to understand what they are saying. So the fact is that children won't learn that much of new words because of the difficulty, which isn't really given. Children from two to five are there in an age where they start building longer sentences with words they start using from hearing and picking up whereever they are. So to be honest, I don't mind giving the companys that much of freedom to let them produce adverts for young children. It is a win-win situation in which the children learn something and the companys make profit. I'm not sure whether it should be allowed or not that isn't down to me to decide but it I have made my point and I see more positve contribution than negative.
