Should advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
A lot of children in the age two to five watch a lot of television, and the television industry know it, so the put on special times some advertisings for children. I think its not that bad, because parents know with such things what thier children want for christmas or for they birthday.
On the other side there are also a lot of useless things in this advertisings or things that are realy expensiv and because it was on television, they want it. That is not very good, because there are also people that can't afford thes things.
Of course the people also have responibility for their children and if they don't want that their children want a lot of expensiv things, they have to look at their own, that the kids don't watch these advertisings on TV. I think for this it is too late, because these toys advertisings are extreamly popular on youtube ond other social media, that it don't depend it there is also advertising on television.
But these advertisings also manipulate the children a bit, because on these advertisings only a few things are shown and they are shown in that way, that the kids think ist the best toy ever, and the toys are often diffrent, than in the advertising.
In my opinion there can be advertisings on television, because there are a lot of other channels for children, that don't show a lot of advertising and also its everywhere on the internet. In some cases its also usefull for the parents to know what their children want.
