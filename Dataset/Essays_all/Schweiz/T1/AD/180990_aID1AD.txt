Should television advertising directed toward young children between the ages of two to five be prohibited?

First of all, advertising is not always a bad thing, but if we as a society ban a television advertisement for young children, we would be censuring the media! Advertisement is in our favour, it is true that companies profit through advertisements but it is their job to sell their goods to us consumers. Therefore it would be a bad thing to ban advertising which is directed to children, because companies have to do marketing somewhere and the best place for that is the media.

On the other hand, children can be influenced a lot easier than adults, they would automatically want to buy something that showed up in the advertisement. Thus children would be aggressive and sad when their parents do not buy for them for instance the pink toy in the Toys' R'us store. This would change in some of their behaviour in the future. Futhermore, they would start to not listen to their parents from an early age which does not have the best outcome. Nevertheless, advertisements are boring and definitely not interesting enough for young children, so why should companies invest in more advertising and thus spend more money on marketing their products, if it is not a hundred percent sure whether or not the children and their parents would actually buy the advertised products.

To sum up, advertisement toward young children should be banned because it would have an impact in their behaviour with their parents. And companies would spend more money on advertising their products when they can not be sure if the chidlren's parents would buy their advertised products.
