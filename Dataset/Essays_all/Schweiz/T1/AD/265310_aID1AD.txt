Advertising nevertheless

First of all I think that advertising for small children should be prohibited because they can get tricked very easily. Also the advertises have a great influence on the children because they do want the things that are in the tv spot and if their parents will not buy it they will be disappointed.

On the other hand children aged two to five should not watch television at all because the are too young to really get whats going on on the screen and they are overwhelmed very fast. So if every parent would know that watching tv at that age is not very healthy for their children and that they should rather go out and play with them advertising directet toward toddlers wouln't be a problem because they would never see the adverts.

But also the children will not be able to tell whats good for them and what they shoul not like. So if there is an advert about plastic guns they can not see that this is a very violent thing and thet they should better let it be. The children will be loving the guns displayed on tv because the ads are made to attrackt them.

Nevertheless adverts towards toddlers are not only seen on television but also on the street, in shops and in magazines. So why should television spots that are made for small children be forbidden? Even if there will not be any televison ads for children they will still see these ads only that they are printet and no longer on television.

In conclusion I strongly disagree with advertising directet toward toddlers because as I said they can get tricked very easily and the ads do have a great influence on them. Even if they don't watch television very often they will come across spots that are directet to them so we should prevent that they are going to love gunviolence only because they saw several advertises about plastic guns.
