I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising to children at the age between two to five, because you manipulate the children. The children is in this state trying to understand the world and with advertising you are messing them up. They think, that they really need the toy, bag or whatever is advertised. But there is an other problem; why do children whatch television at that age? They're way to young. By whatching tv they don't learn anything important. They learn things, that are shown in the ty and sadly they get confronted with advertisement. Many companies know that and falsly use that. They shouldn't manipulate those children. The sad thing is, that there isn't a good reason to show them advertisement. There may be some good reasons to show television, like there are some good channels, where they teach kids to understand nature, or they craft something etc. But advertisement is a selfish act from companies which only want more profit. And they pay their profit with the knowledge of children. I got a neighbor and he is now 12 years old, I can remember, that he always whatched tv and always wanted the cool stuff, that was shown in the tv. Now he is a selfish, snobby baggar. But his older brother who is 18 know isn't like this. He is the complete oposite, When I and he were in that age, we palyed football all the time and only watched tv once a week. 
This shows an other problem: now there is a lot more media and the youth grows up witch it. Like I said, it isn't paticulary a bad thing, but evereyone can influence the media today and that sadly hits also the youngest of us.
Now, how can we ban these advertisements? They pay a lot of money for these advertisments and how can they show the world their product. 
Maybe we can make it with the help of the coverment, but these companies will find an other way to get throgh to the children.
