The statement about the television advertising directed toward young chlidren is a very interesting and also often discussed subject. Some people say it's great because their children know that the television is also interested in young humans. Children, who produce much noise are often very silent whilst watching television, therefore it could be perfect for parents, when the kids are busy they can work at home. But the advertising can make the kids addicted to watch television and finally their only theme they are talking about is something they saw in television. Does it really matter, if advertising is directed toward an adult or a child? Yes of course because children can't understand that the companies, who produce the advertising is only interesting in their profit. Let's look at an example which shows the nagative side of advertising directed to young aged people. A poor family with two children sits in front of the TV, that shows advertising for kids, afterwards both kids want the teddybear the've seen in the TV. Now the parents have to explain to them, that they will not get such a teddybear and the kids are very sad and disturb the inventar of the appartment. The parents have to repair all destroyed things and have no money left for their hobbies. 

In the end every person can decide if the advertising shall be allowed or not, I think young aged humans should go outside and not watching television all the time. I would forbit my children to watch TV, and it doesn't matter if advertising is for them or for adult people. In the nature they lern many more things than at home in front of the TV. Finally I agree with the statement becuase the parents are maybe forced to buy the children things they have seen in television although they have not enough money for it.
