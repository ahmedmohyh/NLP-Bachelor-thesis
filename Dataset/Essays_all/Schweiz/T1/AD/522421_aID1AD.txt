I personally think tv advertising should not be allowed at all, so I obviously also think it shouldn't be allowed, when directed at young children. The problem with television adverts is how constant they are. We don't have time to prosses what we have seen, because the next advert is already being shown. With young children this, I think, is even more extrem. They see a toy they like and people having a good time with it and then it's gone and a different toy or game is being advertised. Who wouldn't want a toy that works perfectly ( toys always work better on Tv) and people have a good time with? Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does. This is a part of childhood and it's part of what makes children have a great time, living in a bit of a dream world. But it should not be exploited by firms advertising there products, making the children want something and feel like they are missing out on something if they don't get it. Besides that, children at that age can't buy anything on there own anyway, making the original idea of the advertisers even worse. They count on the children wanting something and then going to ask there parents to buy it. meaning they don't advertise to thepeople they end up getting the money from, but to the children of those people, there loved ones.
