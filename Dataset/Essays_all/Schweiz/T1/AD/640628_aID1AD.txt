Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
When we watch television we can see a lot of television advertising. A lot children in the age of two to five watch every day television, so they can see a lot of television advertising. I think, the television advertising can influence the behaviour of  young children but it don't have to. I think this is from child to child different. I think it could have negative aspects but also positive aspects. In the one side, the children can learn new things and they can discover a lot but on the other side maybe it can have negatives aspects, for example a bad behaviour or something. Maybe the children don't understand the television advertising right. When they don't understand this right it could give many of problems. And  I think lots of the children don't understand the television advertising right because they are very young, don't have so much experience as the older people and don't have the same humour as peoples who are a little bit older. A little bit of television advertising is good and also important and it also doesn't give any problems for the young children, but too much of television advertising isn't good, because on the one side it is really boring and of the other side it could give many of negative aspects to the behaviour of young children. I think we have to find a good mixture of television advertising.
