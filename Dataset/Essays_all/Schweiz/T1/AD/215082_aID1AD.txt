Argumets why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is on one hand that the parents have an overview of the stuff they could buy for their children. If the children see the advertisments and like the toy, the parents know what the next birthday present could be. 
On the other hand it's good for the company that sells the toys or clothes for young children because the mentality of adults is to make kids happy by giving them what they want. The television advertising is the best, most efficient one if you are an adult with small children because when you are at home and you have things to do, you turn on the television so the kids aren't bored. The companies can profit from this and don't hurt no one.

Television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed because they influence the childhood. Children should make their own experiences by playing and being outside. With those advertisments they just want to have what the kids in the television have because they seem happy with it.
Technology shouldn't be part of a child's daily life. By showing this advertisments more kids start to watch TV.
Kids are influenced by those things and annoy their parents because they want the what other kids have. Therefore, parents have to deal with kids, being influenced by technology that isn't made for them.

My opinion is that It shouldn't be allowed because it changes the childhood and the children's lifestyle. Children should live the nature and not the technology like nowadays
