Today advertising is part of our everyday life. We can`t watch television without being distracted and interrupted by adverts. For adults these are simply annoying, but when it comes to children it gets problematic.

Children spend much of their time watching television, so it is inevitable that they come across advertising. They are easier manipulated and believe everything they see or hear. The parents want to make their children happy and are often forced to buy the advertised products. For the companies this is a huge advantage, because this means they can sell more products and make more profit. So it could effect the economy negatively, if these adverts weren't allowed.
But children shouldn't be manipulated at such a young age. What they see on television isn't how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas. They aren't able to differentiate between reality and advertising. One problem that might occur is how to control the regulation. It is very difficult to legally fix what belongs to advertising directed toward young children and companies may find a way to outgo this law.

I believe that children shouldn't be exposed to advertising, mainly because it effects their view on reality. In my opinion the companies should find a way to make their profit without manipulating children. It would be a relief for the parents and the children.
