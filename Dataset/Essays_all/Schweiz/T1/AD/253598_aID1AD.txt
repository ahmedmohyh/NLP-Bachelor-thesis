To the question, if television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed, we need to disguss their efficiency just as well as reasons they should be strictly forbidden.
Advertising on television directed to young children are a questionable topic, since we don't know how much little children actually understand about the product you're trying to advertise. You could spend thousands of dollars on creating a good advertisment for a toy, without being sure if the audience is listening to what you're trying to tell them. 
On the other hand, you could direct your advertising towards children with the goal to make their parents like your product, because after all, it willl be them spending the money and buying something for their children. You'd have to make sure that adults are enjoying your advertisment just as much as young children are, to make them want to get your product for their children.
An important consequence of all that advertising might be, that little children enjoy watching TV more because they see things they like all the time. So if now we would ban any advertising towards young children, this problem could be solved. In our generation it's very important for us to make sure children, starting at a young age, get outside often enough.
Creating a new law that bans that kind of advertising wouldn't be exactly fair towards all the labels that are producing things for young children. Without advertisment on TV, there aren't many other possibilities for them to sell their products.
Summarizing this all together, I don't think it's necessary to ban advertising directed towards young children. As longs as there are nice pictures and music in the backround, even children  at a very young age like something or don't like something. Also children wouldn't watch less TV, unless they stop showing their favourite show and their parents need to find out somehow what they would like to get their children for christmas.
