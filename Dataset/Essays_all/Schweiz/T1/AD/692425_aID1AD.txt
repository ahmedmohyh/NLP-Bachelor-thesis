Nowaday children watch a lot more television than they used to at the end of the 20th century. Today nearly every house has a television. People often do not watch tv for the latest news but to watch movies or documentaries. So it's normal that young children watch tv for fun but is it healthy for them?

Children at the age of two to five learn a lot of things and it is the age where children learn the most and the brain has the biggest capacity to learn and understand things. Children (also Tenagers/Adults) who watch television turn off their brain and they forgett the things they "laerned" a few moments before. The brain needs time to overthink and repeat the things so that the children can remember and it ist saved in their heads. If children watch tv the brain cannot repeat the informations. Also teenagers schould not watch tv or game on their sell phones after studying. Better than watch tv ist reading a book or listening to music so that the brain can work and make the important connections.
Children who wtched tv when they were younger are not that succesful when they grow up than children who didn't watch that much tv. They learn to spent their time with other things and they developpe their social behaviour by playing with other children and spend time outside.
When tv advertisings are directed toward young children they feel welcome, they are includet in the "world of television". If there weren't these advertisements the children may not feel comfortable.

I think advertising directly toward young children schould not be allowed. But the most tv programms has them
