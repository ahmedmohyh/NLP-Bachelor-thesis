This statement depends a lot on what kind of advertisement ist ment. In general i don't think that advertisement ist something bad, because without it we wouldn't explore new products, which could help us much in the everyday life. Also children could see something they would love to play with. For examle in
christmas time the TV is completely crowded with advertisement for things to play with. A startup company, which has it's focus on toys for children, would have no chance without the advertisement on the TV. The negative side of this theme ist thet the opinion uf a child is very easy to influent. The consequence of this is that all the companys produce advertisement to make the children want this specific toy, which is the very best and is just a must have to be one of the cool one's in the class. So these children all watch TV and see this advertisement. After that they will ask their parents all day long, if they could have one of these. The parents may resist at the beginning, but the longer it lasts they will buy their children this toy, even if its complete rubbish. Another negative point is that on childrens'  programm there isn't just advertisement for children aged two to five, but also more violent advertisement for older children. So these children get in touch with violence very early ( for example advertisement for a new airsoft gun). At the end of this essay i think children aged two to five sholdn't watch TV at all. But if they do, in my opinion if the advertisement  isn't violent or shocking it should be allowed, because also the adults get manipulated through advertisement without beeing aware of it.
