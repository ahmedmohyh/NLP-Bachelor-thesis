We have to think about that these children that we are talkking about are in a very early period of their lifes. Children in this age can easily be influenced by their surroundings. Bad advertising can have bad influence on their further development. In extreme examples governments could even use ads to spread their thoughts to the youngest. As we see, the potential is huge. 
In our days electronic devices are more and more used by younger people. TV chanels use this fact to specificaly target these young people and sell their advertisment time to for example toy manufacturers. For them this time is litteraly a gold mine. As long as they makke their ads "cool" in a sence of showing how awsome their new toy is the kids will beleive them. The children also don't care if they allready own a simullar toy, they just see the newer and awsome one. Because of that kids do not learn to be happy with what they allready own. They usually don't ask themselfs about the nagatives of what is advetised. I would say that this is normal though.
This influencial power can and should be used in a positive way. Telling them about environment, solidarity and moral would be possile. It had to be packed into a good ad though. In that way the earlier mentioned potential would be used to teach important stuff to children. 
In my opinion advertising targeted towards young children is dangerous and should regularly be controlled by adults. However the possibilities are to big to just not use it and I really think this potencial has to be used.
