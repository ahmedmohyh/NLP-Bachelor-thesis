Advertising Children

Many companies try to get new costumers by advertising on television. Some companies try to get children between two and five years. These companies try to sell candy, fast food or toys.

I agree with the statement because young children are easily influenced by advertisments on TV. These advertisements are a reason why many children are fat. Companies like Mc Donalds try to target young children by making advertisments that cater towards children. At that age children can't think logically yet and get addicted to fast food. Once they are addicted, they will go to these restaurants for the rest of their lives. It's very difficult to get adults to come to your restaurant because they know that fast food is bad for your health and children don't know that yet. It's also annoying for the parents of the children because they always want to go to that restaurant and to no other. But on the other hand do I think that it's the parents fault to let the children watch TV at that age. When I was that age my parents didn't let me watch TV, so I played with my friends or with my sister. The parents could also let the children watch only one program like spongebob and when the episode is over they can turn the TV off. 

All in all, I think that advertisments with the target audience being young children should be banned because young children are easily influenced by these advertisments. Some of these kids could become fat if they go to fast  food restaurants too often.
