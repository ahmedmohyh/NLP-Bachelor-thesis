Since the last few years television became a bigger part of our life. There are not just more possibilitys to watch television as well there are more and more movies and television shows for young children. More and more we have to ask us how good is that. 
With watching television comes with less time to be active. Children, which grow up to watch television in early their age, are more depence on television. Today there are television shows for everyone and specially for young children. This television shows promote that children learn important things with watching television. The television shows want to teach children Math or English with little games. This games are easy and should be fun. That moves more and more parents to give their young children the apportunity to watch television. In this time the parents do not have to look after their children, because they are watching television. 
If the children are older they still want to see television, because they grow up with that. To play outside is something that many children do not know how to do with bad concequenses. 
We find more children in our time, who needs glases. The most of them are first in kindergarten. Thre is a connection between the qualitiy of eyes and watching television. Sincetists say the children need glasses, because they have started watching television with an early age.
There are good things on television as well. I am sure children could
In my view of point television is not just bad, but young children should not watch television to often. One or two times in a week will be enought.
