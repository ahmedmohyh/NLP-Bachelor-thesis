Nowdays advertisment seems to be everywhere. Whether in Magazines, Radio or on Television, companies are always trying to reach for people. As annoying as it sometimes seems it is an important thing especially for new companies and their products. The main aim is to reach the right audience for the product and the television seems to be the perfect medium. Surely young and old will throw (even may a short)  glanze to a TV.
But is is right to show advertisment whitch are meant for young children? 

What speaks for it is, that young children in these days watch a lot more TV. A perfect way to show an advertisment at the break of their favourite show.The product is  meant for them so why shouldnt't they be able to see it.
But a problem that may occure is, they are children, still young and without the feeling of responsability. They wouldn't be able to buy it on their own or to make a deal by themself. What is the point of showing it to a part of the audience who couldn't buy by themself. It would be of course the parents who have to grab into their wallet and buy it. Children may get overwhelmed by all those products and want them all, which could turn into some unpleasants row between parent and child.All in all i think it is unneccesary to show an advertisment to such young people becaus
