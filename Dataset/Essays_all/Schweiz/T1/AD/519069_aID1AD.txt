We are living in a time of many differents ways of communication. Children, who are watching TV with their parents, get influenced easily by the huge amount of adverts on TV. But we have to question the authority. Shouldn't your child get educated and influenced by you, as a parent? 


Television adverts can be a helping hand. While your child gets to know television, advertising and fun at the same time, specific adverts are nothing but support in your daily life. Of course, not every advert should be watched when you're a child, but specific advertising can help in the learning process, whether it's the spoken language, the grammar or the way of talking - your child can see and hear and learn alot. Over the two channels seeing and hearing, more information get's provided. Letting your child watch TV can also be relaxing for you. Your child is having fun, learning at the same time and you can lean back. Sound's perfect, doesn't it? 

On the other hand, you are the one who cares about your child, who wants your child to learn about the important things in life. And when there's a anonymous voice in TV talking to your child, trying to convince it to do something or trying to show a specific opinion, aren't you failing in doing your job? And here we have the worst case: adverts are for the normal, classic child. If your child has any problems with learning, it might won't get the message behind an advert. I'll start worrying and maybe won't even understand what the person wanted to say at all. Then it's again you, who has to do all the work. 


To conclude, my personal opinion is clear. Nothing is better than the communication between a parent and it's child. People on TV are to far away, and often exagurate their subject. There's no emotional connection and the amout of information is huge. A child learns infinite without TV, and will watch enough adverts in his life. Watching TV shouldn't start when they're young.
