"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."

I'm not sure whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. On the one hand you can say it isn't really fair to do television advertisting directed to young children, because they aren't old enough to decide whether it's a good or a bad thing, which they are seeing in TV. They still need their parents to help them through their life. They need their parents to show them problems, dangers and difficulties, but when there are like TV spots directed especially to young children, children will be very influenced by it. So when you go shopping with your child they want everything they have seen in television and maybe you can't afford it, so it's not easy to say no to your child.

On the other hand you can say that's life. Honestly in our world, it's all about money. And in a world, full of captalism it's clear that even young children are important clients, so why shouldn't television advertising directed toward young children be allowed? And maybe you could even go that far that you can say that children learn from TV. They are going to  improve their language skills, but most important they are going to get more mature, because they are going to compare the TV spots and the products they're about. So they become more independent and mature in early age.

After looking through the arguments I can say that I don't really have an opinion to this statement. Honestly I do not care. There are some arguments that support the statement but there are arguments which are against it as well.I think everybody should decide for himself whether he does support the statement or not. If you support the statement, you need to live with the consequences because we live in a capitalistic world and this isn't going to change.
