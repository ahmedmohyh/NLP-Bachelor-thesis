In the following essay I'll talk about this following statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
An argument for this statement is, that a lot of people think that advertising is a good idea also for children, because while watching it they can learn the language and so when they got to kindergarden they don't have that much difficulties in the language. Of course we can say here, that the parents talk to their children and there's no need to watch the advertising to learn the language, but here's a problem. Not all parents talk to their children in the official language because not all people have the same nationality.
An argument against this statement is, that children often believe in something new they see a and so their reality gets destroyed. For example if they see a speaking animal they could start believe that it really exists and so they would learn something new that is actually wrong. Also if the children enjoy the advertising they want to see it really often and that leads into that the children want to stay in front of the television the whole day. 
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I don't really see the good in that. I think it's important for a children to go out and see the world with their eyes and not from the television. All people see things in a different way and think different of something, so it's also important for the children to have a own view of new things they learn.
