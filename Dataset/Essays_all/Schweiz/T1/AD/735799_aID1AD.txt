In my essay I am going to write about the statement; Television advertising directed toward young children, aged between two to five, should not be allowed.
Of course this is a critical topic because there are lots of different opinions and so I will give you the chance to have a short look out of these points of view.
First of all I chose to start with the cons, which means with the statements that are for television advertising ad think this sentence is not true.
It also depends on the presons situaution, whether she grew up wachting television often or if the person did never have the 'chance' to sit in front of it. People who grew up with a TV at home were probably often watching there a film, a serie or something like that. So they got much more accustomed to advertisements than others and learned since little how to react with them. They know that most of those products that are shown there, are not that great as presented. But we have to make a difference between normal TV advertisements and other advertisements on web pages that are erotic, because then I think most of the people, especially parents would not agree with television advertising.
But now lets turn to the other part, the pros which support the statement. There is a lot of television advertising in TV and it often comes in a film, when the scene is the most interesting, perhaps you also know this situation. Then you are not so concentrated on the film and you change the channel because you may do not want to watch these people, making out of everything the best so that you pretty much have to buy it. It disturbs the tense in the room which has to rebuild when the film continues.
In my opinion is advertisement also good for to clam down the tense and for to have a short break so tht you could think about the film and what ha d happened in it. But of course sometimes I also get frustrated when the film stops in the worst scene but what e3lse can we do?
