Nowadays parents let ther children watch television all day so they don't have to worry about them. But this is not the job of the television to look after the children. The parents should do this. But why shouldn't this be not allowed?

Children which looks often television are going to get this language. In the young age this is very important that the children learn good language. But in the television there are many bad words which arent't good for the children. They will start using this words over and over again.

Against this the children learning the language faster because they hear it often. When they have parents which have to do much things in their job and don't have time like this the children are learning faster. But it al suppose at which channel the children are watching. Are they watching MTV odr a little children series? Or even Discovery Channel? When they watching something like that the children can learn from it or not.

One problem is that the children getting used to the television. They only wanna watch television and don't go outside and play with other kids. They get attached to it. That is a huge problem. You can see this in many families in the USA. Many children are sitting in front of the television and getting fat and fatter day by the day. They just sit there the whole day and watch television and eat fast food. This isn't good. We need to stop that.

I think chidren can watch television but only like a specific time, Maybe a half an hour a day or somethiing like that. Otherwise the children getting used to it. And they should look stuff in their age and not whit bad words.
