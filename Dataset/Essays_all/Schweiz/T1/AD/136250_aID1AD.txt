I am writing an essay about the question, if it is good when the television advertising directed toward young children. You often see on televison that advertising is directed to young childten, age two or five. The reason is, that they want that the children want to have something how they saw at the television. They run to their partens and scream and want this wonderful teddy the saw on televison. Is this bad for the revolution of the children?

It is right that the parents often are stresst and have no time. Then it is good when the children have something to do. The television is the best thing for that. All children love to whatch something funny. But at the advertising comes a lot of rubbish. There are things for adults and not for children.On this point is it good that the advertisindis directed toward young children. Because it is better when they saw something about the easther bunny then what the Kardashians are make with her money.

On the other hand there is so many rubbish to see at advertising. It is not good for the children when they saw all these things on television. They become to children how want everything. The do not live in a real world. I would be better when they whatch one film in one piece without advertisig. After that they could go outside and play football with friend and have social contact.

In the end I would say, that it have positiv and negativ points that the television advertising directed toward young children aged two or five. The most of them is not very bad for the children, so it is no problem. But I think it is not good when the young children whatch to often television.
