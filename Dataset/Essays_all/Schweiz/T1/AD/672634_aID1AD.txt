When nowadays someone turns on the tv, he or she will probably be confronted with some kind of commercial they've already seen somewhere else. But in most cases this doesn't mean they're going to buy it just because they saw it on tv. In fact, a lot of people find television advertising very annoying, especially when their favorite show is being interrupted by it. But what about the children? Should there be television advertising on the favorite channel of a three years old child?
First of all, advertising was invented to make the customers interested in different products, like a shampoo, a razor or maybe some kind of makeup. The customer would then go to a store and buy it. But a child doesn't have any money. It would ask it's parents to buy it and start to cry when they say no. The parents would eventually be exhausted. And their wallet would become thinner and thinner.
A child wouldn't understand what advertising is. It would think the products are awesome and want them, no matter what they are. Manipulating a small child and tricking it into wanting expensive toys and other products should never be allowed. Imagine a child watching its favorite show when it suddenly gets interrupted by some kind of commercial. Once wouldn't be the end of the world, but all the time would. If it doesn't want the products, it will get annoyed by it. Maybe it would even stop to watch tv and do something else. It would be bad for the tv industry. But on the other hand, it might do something better, like play outside with its friends.
This would be the only positive aspect of tv advertising directed toward young children I can think of. But I'm still against it, because the child might still stay inside and watch tv instead of playing with friends. There is no garanty for it. And the bad aspects outweight the good ones by far.
