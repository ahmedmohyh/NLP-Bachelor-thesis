One reason why it shoudn`t be allowed, is that young children don`t really understand what they see in television. They can missunderstand things or they can get manipulated, what can make it difficult for parents to help them grow up. At the age of for example four years, children are in my opinion not in position think about what they saw or what the advertise really means and they don`t know what to believe in when they hear things in the television advertise. But I ask me the quesion if the advertising really can manipulate the children that much that there are problems for the parents or for the children themselves. Maybe, when the children see an advertise of, for example, a very tasty looking candy, and they see it in the next supermarket, the parents can still say no. Another question is if the children really get sort of manipulated or if they are really happier when they see an advertise of something in the television, they seem to like it and they get it bought by her parents. 
So at the end, there are arguments for both opinions. So the real question is if a very strict rule like forbit it completely, is really the way to solve the problem. Tough it is not sure that it really is a problem. I think of myself that it`s a too strict measure for a (in my opinion) little problem. I think that the parents can for example see that her child don`t watch too much of television or something like that.
