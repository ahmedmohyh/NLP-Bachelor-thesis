In the 21st century television advertising takes a huge part in companie's marketing techniques. Ads nowadays follow certain terms and conventions based on target audiences the specific products are meant to attract. More and more advertising companies don't just talk to adults or adolescants anymore, they are also directly adressed to younger children around the age of two to five. These specific kind of ad rises a lot of critical questions in today's society.

Young children are really easily affected by the things they see around them. Wether they copy things done by people in their envirement or recreate things seen on TV or the internet. Therefore ads directed to younger audiences are specifically meant to persuade children. Even if the ad just introduces new toys or games, children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them due to the lack of rational decision skills. Children will then also persue to influence other family members whithout even noticing. They might mention the item to a sibling or ask one of their parents to buy it for them.

On the other hand, ads for  this speci target audience are most often constructed in a non-offensive way and therefore don't disturb audiences watching them. It also is a huge marketing platform for companies. Even if the product is not entirely meant for childrens use, if the ad is designed in a child-like, humorous way it will still affect children, which as a result carry the message or the content of the ad to older audiences such as their parents or relatives.

In my opinion TV advertisement directly addressed to children is not problematic, as long as term and conventions of childrens advertisement are not obeyed. At the end of the day a TV advertisement will not have a huge impact on children aged between two to five and will most certainly not change consumption habits of adults in their envirement.
