In this essay I will write about television advertising directed toward young childer. Is it okay to advertis young childern? Should that be allowed?

Very often young childern, aged two to five, watching television, because the parents doesn't want to playwith them or aren't at home. In the pauses is every time advertising. There is a advertisment about the sale in the Migros and Coop or about the new Ford. Young childern doesn't understand this stuff. But there is also advertising about a new toy, the best Bobbycar or about a better babyborn, which can eat and cry. On one hand it is good, because the young childern sees what they can put on their christmas-wishlist. On the other hand is in the internet and the television often stupid and bad stuff. So the childern put stupid stuff on their wishlist and are cry when it isn't under the christmas tree.
Advertising isn't that good for young childern, because more often is advertings sexualised. Children shouldn't be confront with that so early in their life. They should enjoy the childhood outside with their friends and not alone at home with watching televison.
When a little girl sees the newest babyborn in the television she runs to her mother and says: "Mummy, mumm I want to have this babyborn! It only costs 69£." The mother answers: "Hmmmm... I don't know sewatheart. I have to think about it." One or two weeks later she says to her daughter that she will buy the babyborn. She went to the store and sees that the babyborn costs now 100£. She must buy the babyborn if it costs 69£ or 100£. As we see  the factory or the store makes profit because of a young girl and in my view it is not okay!

As you maybe saw I'm not that happy with television advertising directed young children. For the parents it isn't that good and also for the children. Television advertising is totally okay but not directed to young childern! They shouldn't even watch televison but that is an other question.
