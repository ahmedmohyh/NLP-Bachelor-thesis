On one hand, television advertising to children isn't good, because they alsways want to have, what they see in the advertising and almost it is not as good as in the advertising. So parents buy things for their children to make them happy and in the end the children play once or twice with it and then it becomes uninteresting and boring. But when the parents say "No, you won't get it, we don't by this game, because you won't play with it.", the children are angry with the parents.
On the other hand the advertising could be good for parents, if they're looking for christmas or birthday presents they could find something good, because adults can more see the differences between fantasy and reality. They could better imagine how the games are without the animals or faries in the advertising.
Some people think that television is bad for children, even when they look a film or a serie, because they're so focused on the screen, that they becomes agressive, when parents turn off the TV.
Other people say that looking films can be positive, because children learn something new.

In my opinion, in the advertising it looks always great, but when you buy it, it is much more worse. For me, the advertising for children is okay, but i think it should be more realistic and with less fantasy.
