Well I think first of all, children that are younger than five years old should not be watching TV at all, because for several reasons it's not good for their personal development. But back to the point, I think it definitely shouldn't be allowed, since it's really annoying for parents if their children are wanting to get something in the supermarket really badly, they know out of a TV ad and was directed to them. These kinds of advertisements make little childeren already wanting everything they see in the television, which is already bad enough with children at age ten. 
But I also tend more to make this a parent's responsibility, that they should not allow their young children to watch TV at this age. And it's their fault if the child won't develop as much creativity and imagination or the ability to have fun playing outside. 
I don't really get why businesses would spend money on TV advertisements pointed towards young children. I mean I get it for children at the age of ten, because it's always an emotional decision at this time and every child wants to buy what's advertised in the TV and looks cool to them. 

Regarding the arguments, I'm not totally against the advertising directed toward young children, because when they become older they will remember certain advertisements and there is a chance they will buy some products which is a huge market for businesses. But I'm definitely not supporting advertisements directed toward young children, since it is affecting their childhood in a negative way and it also has negative impacts on their personal development.
