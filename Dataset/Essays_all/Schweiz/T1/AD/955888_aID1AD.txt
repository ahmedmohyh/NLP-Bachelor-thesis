There many families who have a television in their houshold. So often children are sitting in front of in their freetime when it's allowed by parents side. But isn't it wors to put the children in front of the TV and let them watch?
There are many disagreements for it, but also some agreements. The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something. There are many Sierie about like Dora, the little pirates ore the einsteins who try to make a connection between a mean story and schoolsubjects. Per example learning numbers, learning the alphabet or how animals live and so on... And if there's a houshold who the mother have to cook they can leave her children in front of the TV. So the children can't disturb them.
There also some disagreements. When the children are to long in front of it, they see to many advertisings and in this advertisings sometimes are not nessecery informations and stufs. And if this advertisings directed to young childred they are going to be manipulated. If they see a toy in the commercial they realy want that and the parents should buy it. and if they have enogh money they will and if they haven't enough money the can't. So thats the way to become very rich childrens and poor childrens.
