We are living in the era of technology and media. The internet has grown huge and we depend on technology no matter if we want to research, need to find a place we do not know, or just want to watch some movies or series. The children growing up in this era are as depended on the media as everyone else. You can see many children with an iPod or an iPhone and they even posess an own laptop. No wonder they spend so much time on television. There are series made for children, to make them learn things. With that comes the advertising of toys to make children buy it.

Adults might think that you can not use advertising on children, because that is pure manipulation. Advertisers know how to make people want to buy their products, simply by using AIDA. They might want wo protect children of this kind of manipulation. However, even though they manage to protect them now, as soon as they get older they are going to watch advertisement and are going to get manipulated nonetheless. 

On the other hand: how are you going to sell products for children without any advertising? There is going to be a decrease of profit if the refineries lack advertisings. They earn less money and they might need to close because they can not afford the producement. The more refineries need to close, the less toys are going to be there for children. What are they supposed to play with? 

My opinion is that there should be advertising directed toward young children. I do not think that it might affect the children. And even though you prohibit advertisments for children, there are still going to be some directed toward young adults and adults, which the children are going to see as well. These might manipulate them as well, so why only not allow advertisings for children? I think that if you want to not allow it, you need to prohibit advertising in general.
