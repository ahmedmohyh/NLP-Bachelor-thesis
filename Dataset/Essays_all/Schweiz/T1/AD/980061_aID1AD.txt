I think young children between two and five do really like watching television. They usually watch cartoons or some series that explain things and why they are like they are in a very easy way. Of course they also have to watch the advertising, because nearly all channels do advertising. The advertising that is directed to young children is mostly advertising for games. Children as we know are getting influenced very easy. Advertising is a kind of influencing, because the goal of advertising is to make the people, in this case the children, to buy or consum the things they see in tv.

Now should advertising for children be forbidden?

Children between two and five are not able to do the last step I described on top. They can not buy or consumate the things they see in tv, unless their parents are buying it for them. Now you could say, that if children watch advertising they go to their parents and just argue with them until they get the things they saw on tv. But if that happens, the parents are in my opinion just very weak. And who says that the things they advertise for in tv are just bad and unusefull?
Maybe the child watchs something in tv and  shows it to her mother and she thinks that is a good thing and buys it.

So I think you can not forbid advertising for children.
