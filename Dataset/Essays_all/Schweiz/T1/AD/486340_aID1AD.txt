There exists the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. It is not easy to say if that is right or false, because it depends to the point of view. A manager of a toy company sees it diffrent than parents. 

At one hand, advertising is good to know the world. So the children see what there exists, like toys or movies and can start to have an own opinion. For example, they see a lot of ponies in television. So a young girl can start loving horses and want to learn horseriding. She starts to develope an own character.

At the other hand, television advertising can make that all children love the same things when they watch the same advertisement. So, pherhaps most girls love playing with barbies and had many of them. If a girl doesn't have a television or doesn't see this advertisement, she's automatically an outsider.

It's easy to make children in this age believe that what they see in television is true. So, big companies can sell a lot of their products, if the children want their products, and if they don't get them, they're unhappy. 

I think it's not bad if children in this age see television advertising, but the parents have to take care, what their children see in television. In our time, we can't prohibit that children see advertisements. If they always see advertisement of McDonalds, they start wanting eat only this food and forget that it's not healthy. 
And in my opinion, the parents don't have to buy all the things which children see in advertisement and then want it. They have to keep strict.
