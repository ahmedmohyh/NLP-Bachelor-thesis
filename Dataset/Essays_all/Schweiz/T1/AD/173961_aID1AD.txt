We see advertisements no matter where we go, only by switiching on the television or walking through the city we are influenced by any kind of advertisements. Our children are also affected by this and they are also influenced by advertisments, but this is nothing to be afraid of. 

Nowadays it is a common thing to let your child watch television or to let it use an iPad even though there are a lot of advertisements in the background.
It is true that children have fun while watching advertisements which are directed to people their age because they usually contain things that makes children want that specific product. Mostly those products are connected to unhealthy food so on the on hand side it can be dangerous if young children start eating too many unhealthy meals just because they are influenced by advertisements. On the other hand side parents still have the control over what their children eat and they can easily control this. 

Furthermore you can mostly see some speaking animals experiencing adventures while using that special product that should attract a child so it harldy happens that television advertising for children contains violence. Even though they get influenced by young age and they might force their parents to only buy a specific kind of product because they prefer it after having seen the advertisement many times, the main power still remains with the parents. 

In my opinion television advertisting for young children is not something to be afraid of because as long as parents control what children buy and what they eat there is no danger. For me it is evident that anything can be dangerous to children but that is also the reason why they have parents to look after them and to make sure that they do not spend too many hours a day in front of a television and therefore being influenced by advertisements.
