In this generation it's normal that young children watch a lot of TV all day, because it's the easiest thing: they have something to do and don't make any noises. But television advertising can influence young children a lot, more than their parents, because they want something faster than adults. If they want something from the television advertisment, the parents buy it. the parents can't protect their children from television advertising and they often don't notice it. Another point is, that kids often don't know what they want and when they see in the television, that other children have something, that make fun, they want it too. 
I think television advertising shouldn't be allowed, because its unfair for the parents, who want the best for their children and that's why they buy a lot of things for example toys for them. The best for the kids were that they don't watch so much TV and go out to play with their friends or they shouldn't put so much advertisment in kids programs.
