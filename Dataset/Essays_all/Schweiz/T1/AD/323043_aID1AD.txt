I think there is a lot of advertising everywhere. The television advertising is just another kind. It's normal for us to have it everywhere. And with the television you have it even at home. It can influence our decisions a lot. Specially young children. When they see at television the newest Barbie or a game for the computer they want to have it. But should it really be not allowed? In some kind it is a problem but it is also a decision of the parents. When the children are not allowed to watch a lot of TV, I think it is not an as big problem as when they watch the whole day. When I look at my childhood it was never a problem because we didn't have a television at home. It was a bigger problem to go with us in a shop and we saw some chocolat which we really wanted. So I think it's not only the TV which influence the decisions of a lot children. It's just everywhere we go. There are a lot things they want to have and the parents have just to say no.
Television advertising comes everytime after a television show. So it's a kind of boring and after the fifth time they won't give as much attention as on the first time they saw it. May be we see just a problem in it where it isn't one. So for me it is not the problem of the television it is more how they have grown up and what they were allowed to do. If they aren't allowed to have new things they won't make any problems. Television advertising directed toward young children is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television. It doesn't matter if it is directed to children or to adults. It is important what we do with this informations.
