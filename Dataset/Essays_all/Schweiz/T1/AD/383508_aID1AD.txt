This subject had been often discussed, if young children should watch television or not. I think also it depends in wich country we are, in some countries there isn't a problem with that, in other that's a big problem. First of all I think, the young children have better things to do than watching television. The time you're spending on the television, is a time wasted. The young children should go out and paly with other children. When I was young I always went outdoors and played with the children in the street. The chidlren, who are so young, they shouln't spend so much time on the television. An other suspect is physical, I mean the young children, they watch TV so close on the screen and this isn't good for the eyes. They are really fragile and it's not worth to damage them, because the chidlren want to watch television. For example, a friend of mine, in the young age, he had really problems with his eyes, and his parents didn't know what it was , so they went to the doctor and and after five minutes  the doctor said, if my friend would watch a lot of television,because the lightning of the screen isn't healthy for our eyes. Since than my friend really stopped watching series or something else. Instead he went more often out with his friend or he read a lot, That's why he became today a very good writer, maybe one day he's gonna be a very good journalist. Like I mentionned, the young children coud read books and do something in their lifes, which they can profit of. 
On the other side, the children can learn from television. It also depends what you're watching or which serires. For example there is one serie, it called Dorie and there can chidlren learn speaking english, or some sentences. So it doesn't have to be always bad for the children, and so I think,it shouln't be forbidden. I think just the parents have to look after their children, that they have both of them.
