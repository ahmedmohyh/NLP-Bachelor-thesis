Young children, aged two to five, should not watch Television. It is proved that children who watch television since the age of two later will have a lower intelligent quotient that children who play with dolls for example. But there are a lot of children who watch television anyway and are confronted with television advertising. 
Firstly, Television toward young children influences them in various ways. If they see a girl wearing a rosa dress and playing with a doll, they may think girls have to do that. So they learn stereotype behaviours.
Others may say that television advertising has not that much power. More important is the behavoiur which children observe of  their parents or of other children. If they see the girl with the rosa dress, but their parents show them that they can play with dolls or cars, in most cases they will be influenced by the parents and not by the advertisment.
Secondly, if children are confronted with advertisment they will want things that they do not really need. They just want it because they have seen it on Television and think



I do not think that television advertising toward young children should be banned generally. Because in my view they do not affect the children badly. But I think that it is important that young children dont watch TV, it is important that they play with other children and that they go outside.
