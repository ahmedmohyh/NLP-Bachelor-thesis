I think, that some television series can be very educational for the children to learn more about the world or to learn for exaple English. But in the age of two to five, the children maybe don't understand the educational television series. So it is difficult to find the right serie, that you can let your children in front of the television. The problem which I can see is, that in the television are so many different series, which are making your chose for the best serie more difficult.
I disagree also with the fact, that it can be very usefull, when the mother is in the kitchen and the father is at work. So you can switch the TV on and you can let the children in front of the TV so that they have something to do. In such a situation it is ok, when your children watch TV, so that you can cook in calm and you don't have to worry about what to do with the children.
But I think, that when your children wating TV the whole time, it is not good. You, as a mother or as a fahter, have to go outside with the children or play a puzzle or something like that with them. It can be very good for your soul and for the children imagination to go outside with them. They learn how to play alone in the nature. The fresh air also helps the children to be or to stay fit, not to get sick. When your children still stay in the house and sitting in front of the TV, they don't run around and keep fit. 
I think, that the TV stop the imagination of the children. When they draw, they use the imagination so the children learn something while doing something with the hands. 

I think it is ok, when the children in the age of two to five watch television, but it should not be the whole time. Maybe on Sunday afternoon watiching a movie together is a good idea. But the rest of the week you can go outside or play cards with the children.
