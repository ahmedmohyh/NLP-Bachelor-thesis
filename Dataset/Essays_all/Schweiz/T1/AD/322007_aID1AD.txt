Should television advertising directed toward young people be prohibited?

Young childrens are watching more and more tv these days and so they also watch more and more adverts which are made for them. But should advertising directed to young childrens be allowed or not?

Of course there are reasons why this shouldn't be allowed. At first small childrens always want what they have seen at the tv because they think it is cool. But for the parents this is really anoying because the childrens always want them to buy what they want and some of them just stop if they have what they want. The problem is that some parents always buy what the childs want and so they never learn that they can't get everything they have seen at the television.

On the other side it is not just the job of the state to look for the childrens. It is the job of the parents to look for them. This also contains, that they have to look what their childs could see on tv and that they especially do not watch too much tv. Because if they watch less tv they of course also see less advertising. And there is also a really good aspect on advertsing directed to children. They have to learn that they not just allways get everything they want. Which is an important lesson for the whole life. Because a child who learned (when it was small) that it could have everything it has seen at the television advertising might have some problems when it grows up and has to pay the things by itself. They often sped too much money and so they have allready mony problems when they are young. 

I think that advertising directed on young childrens shouldn't be frobidden because it is the job of the parents too look to the childrens. So if they don't want that their childs see too much adverts they have to look that their childrens don't watch too much tv. And if they don't see too much adverts it is also no problem for the childs.
