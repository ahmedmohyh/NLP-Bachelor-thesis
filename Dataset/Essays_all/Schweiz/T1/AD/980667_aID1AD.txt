I disagree with this statement.
Sure there are many reasons to support this, but thinking logically, I really can't agree. The main reason is because we are living in a free country and I think everthing that doesn't damage another person should be allowed. Even if it doesn't help anybody, people should be allowed doing it if they see a personal improvement. We could say that these advertisings are bad for our children, but if this is a fact, why do you let them watch it? It's the minime risk you would take for giving your children more freedom. I really don't want my kid brainwashed by this publication rubbish, but since I'm free to decide what I'm doing here, I'm not against it. Imagine they wouldn't be allowed, how should they be promoting their products? If people have problems with advertisings, they must also have a problem with the product they're selling. So if an advertising is so bad for children that it can't be played in television, don't you have to ban the actual product it's all about aswell?
Before trying to shut down others, you have to try helping yourself first!
