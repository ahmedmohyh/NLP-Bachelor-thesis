I will explain you the reasons why I am against this Statement. I think when they can't do television advertising they find other ways who are as well as succesfull as the Television advertising to sell there products.I mean just when you go in a  shopping mal you get everywhere influenced and you don't even remark it .Also it is hard to forbid it because you have to make rules , and its hard to decide when an television advertising is for five years old children and when not, they could easily say no our toy is for six years old children. So they could put it on Television. And I don' agree with the age, in my opinion you can't understand and memorise a Television advertising with two years. More efficient it would be from the age six to ten.Becaus in this age you understand the advertising completely and you remember the wonderful pink dog toy( for example). And when I was a little kid i didn't watch that much Television I nearly never watched it.Hoever our society has changed during the last ten years the families with young children that I know don't let the chidren watch often television as well.So i come to the conclusion that it isn' the write age because they didn' alway understand an memorise it and they don't watch as much Television as older childrens do. It is a really big act who in my opinion wouldn' t be really succesfull because you get nowadays nearly everyday and everywher influenced to buy something. Thats why I am against the Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed:
