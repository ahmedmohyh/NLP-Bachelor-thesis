We live in a world that is pretty much controlled by advertising. We get in touch with advertising everywhere. Wether it is on the street,on the internet or while watching television. Now the question is if it should be allowed to make these advertisings directed toward young children. 

My first thought to these theme was: Yes, why not? Because I do not remember myself watching television at this age. So I figured that parents could just not allow their children to watch television like my parents did. The problem would be solved. 

But then I realised that nowadays children do watch television at this age. And they get manipulated by advertising. A good exemple for this manipulation is that advertising directed to little girls are often very pink and very "ladylike". Advertising for little boys are often colored blue or just dark. They show weapons and they are often filled with violance. And that is how they get pushed into our societys gender roles.

Children at this age are easy to manipulate. So in my opinion advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. Of course you do not have to watch it but you cannot ignore it. Because sooner or later you will come across advertising. And just not watching television is not the solution. I have to say I do not appreciate advertising towards young children but I think we need to get alongwith it. That is how this world works.
