Television advertising directed toward young childeren (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

In our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes. By many people it is used for relaxation purposes, to inform you about recent events around the globe or just out of boredom. Therefore advertisers have found it a very good place for their ads, because many people of different countries, culutural background, intellectual standard and age can be reached with your ads. If you confront yourself extensively with advertising, you will seek to answer the question, which age group you are most likely to reach and for which ones it doesn't make sense. 

The advertisers should definitly be allowed to target young childeren, especially because the ads mostly consist of toys, most of which are harmless. Maybe it gives them an inkling of what to wish for for their birthday or christmas. The childeren ask their parents and they can decide to buy said toy or article, if found usefull or apropriate. 

I question the use of television advertising for young childeren because I doubt they are effective. Young childeren may be fast mulled over and excited by the item displayed and praised in the ad, however the are not capable of purchasing it themselfes. Ads for  toys should be aimed at the parents who can then show their child what they find fit and present  it to them.

Childeren aged two to five are naiv and have no experience, they will choose the toy or item they are most partial without thinking about the price or usefullness, hence it's the parents or guardians task to give them what they need. On the whole, young childeren should not be watching a lot of television at such a young age. Their creativeness can be very limited and by playing (in or outdoors) they can develop a lot better.
