Television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
 Last weekend I was babysitting two little girls. The younger girl just had her birthday in the week before and is now 5 years old. I asked her about the gifts she got. And she showed me her new Barby. She told me that she will soon get the pink car for her Barby but she have to wait because the car was'nt avaible in the shop. So it's relatively clear that she had the informations about the Barby from the televisionadvertising. I think especially in the Sender like Nikelodeon or other television for children in the breaks between the series are advertisings like this. They moestly advertise for things that the children can wish themselfs for birthday or christmasgifts. It's difficult for the parents to controll if their children see advertises like this when they are allowed to see Tv in the time the parents have to cook or something. So the children see the advertise and then the parents have two possibilities. One possibility is to pay for the things the children want. And the other possibiltiy is to stand when the children cry and shout  please, please, please. So it wouldnb idea to permit the advertise for little children. Especially in the age from two to five.
But on the other hand we live in a world that advertising is a part of. I think when the advertising in the TV would be permited they would find other ways to give the little children informations about all the wonderfull things they had. And in general I think the parents should decide how much time their children are allowed to spend next to the televison. So I think it isn't possible to permit the advertising for little children at all but maybe to start with a permitition in the Television wouldn't be a bad Idea.
