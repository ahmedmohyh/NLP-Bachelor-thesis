When you watch a film in the evening on television their are always breaks for adverts. Some adverts are interestening, some adverts are funny and some adverts are just sexist and weird. Mostly the adverts are nonsense and they aren't usefull. But how do they seem to young children? Young children don't konw as much as a teenager or even an adult.Young children are naiv and and can't order the adverts. 
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

Adverts are't usefull for young children, because they can't even buy things by themself. Young children normally don't have enough money to buy things, for example toys. 
But I think that adverts still can influence young children which toys they want for example for christmas. I think that totally fine, because the parents of the young child can still decide, which toy they will buy their children.
Another negative point is that television at all is bad for children. It's not good for the eyes if the young children watch always television. They waste so much time watching television. It would be so much healthier to play outside, for example in the garden.

I don't think that television advertising toward young children ) should not be allowed. But I think that children should watch less television at all and play more
outside.
