"Advertising"
Since the 20th century, companies use television as an important tool to reach millions of people by annoying them with a great deal of advertisement.
Nowadays advertisement is also present in TV-series for children. What effect does this have on our children? Should this be forbidden?

Advertising children leeds to big discussions in families. It is that simple to influence children by televison, so they nearly believe everything the advertisement says. They immediately run to there parents after the film and wanted them to buy the latest things they had seen.
Furthermore, most of childrens whises have been created by an extern influence, which means that children who are less influenced by televison or other sources for advertisement have much less whishes.
Children in the age between two and five years are psychologiclally not that far developped to decide between what they need and what is only a spontanious whish.

On one hand, we have the manipulation effect from advertisement on children, but on the other hand, we all know, that children once become adults. As an adult you have the same problems but they are even much biger and diverse. So why should the children be protected of this problems? If they are faced up to reality at there prime of life they learn much earlier how to deal with there problems.

Nevertheless advertising children is an important ecological way to increase welfare of the producer. Consumers often buy things -leaded by advertisement- they really do not need. So in my oppinion, advertising children makes only sense for the economy. That is why I think we shold limit advertisement in children's tv programmes.
