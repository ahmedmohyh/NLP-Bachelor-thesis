Nowadays lots of people watch television. There are different age groupes of people such as young children, teenagers, adults or even old people who sit in front of the TV at least once a day. The one thing everyone hates are advertisements which interrupt our series in the most interesting part. There are different types of advertisements but is that a problem for the younger generation? does it have an affect to youg children?

Television advertising takes a lot of time when you are watching TV and most of the time these are harmeless to us, but is it the same for young children? Young children watch TV more and more. This is a great chance to advertise some kind of game that the young children want to have. This works actually really well because if the child sees it, it goes to his parents and asks them to buy it. When they don't, they will cry until the game is bought. But is this a problem for the child itself?
It depends what kind of game it is. There are friendly games which makes children play together or make them learn something in a playfull way. In that case I dont think that it is a problem to advertise because it takes the child to play with others or to learn new stuff. In another case where games are brutal or lead to violence, I think it shouldn't be allowed because this could lead to an aggressive child in the feature. 

In the end, my opinion to ''television advertising toward young children'' is that if the advertisement advertises something fun or intelligent where young children can learn something or learn to play with a group it should be allowed. But if the advertisment has content of something brutal or violent , content where it's obvious that there is brutallity in it, it shouldn't be allowed, because I think it has a small influence to the little child in the future.
