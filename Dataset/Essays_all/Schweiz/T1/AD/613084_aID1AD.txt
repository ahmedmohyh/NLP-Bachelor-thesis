In this essay, I am writing about television advertising directed toward young children. The question is, are this kinds of adds okay or should it not be allowed.

In my opinion, it is totally okay to show children things like that, because for the economics it is importent to catch money from the kids. I mean when a kid likes a new toy from the television spot, then it is clear when it askes for it by the parents. And if the parents are grateful and have enough money to buy it them go for it. But when they haven't got enough money, why should the spend money on a television for the kids. It is important that a country can earn enough money and for that they should also go for the children. A full school career costs a lot for a country and why shouldn't give them some money back.

I can understand a father who doesn't like these kind of adverts, but then he has to search the problem by his salary. Maybe he has to make rules, how much a child can spend on toys. The kids have to learn how to spend money, but the main problem isnt television advertising. A good father is someone who loves to spend money for their kids, because nothing makes him more happier than a happy face of his child.

We have to look at this theme from two sides. One side is a worker at a toy industrie. The other one is a broke human, because the own kid costs a lot... I just realised that i made the whole essay wrong, but what can I do when the description in written in German.

A good argument for adverts in the television is, that everybody from the economic side profites. A negative statement is that a kid gets influenced even before the can think alone. They cannot build their own opinion. For the guy who reads this, you're wasting your time. haha. I'm sorry but i don't know what I should write anymore. :/ I'm sitting here, and I am waiting until the 30 minutes are done, I also think tha i am wasting my time.

I think a human never gets mature, only the toys are getting more expensive.
