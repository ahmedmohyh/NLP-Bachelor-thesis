Television advertising is common in today's society. Nobody is enjoying them and nobody actually watch them, but young children can be influenced strongly by the loud music in the background, the many colours and the speaker. They simply cannot ignore television advertising and get influenced by it.

Television advertising should not be allowed. Young children are very easy to manipulate and therefor it should be illegal to produce television adverts directed towards them. Some parents tend to buy their children everything they want and if there's a new advert in the television every week, they'll either have to say no to a child that's used to get everything it wants or face financial issues. Eventhough children will cry like they are dying, as soon as they have their new toy they're happybut after a week it's already boring again and it gathers dust in the wardrobe.

On the other hand, if the children don't see the adverts, visiting a friend has almost the same effect. Everybody has something different and it seems to have an even stronger effect on the influenced child. A child can be as easily influenced by friends as by television, but actually making television advertising for young children should be against the law.

I can remember playing with a friend of mine and he had black and white lego blocks. Nobody I knew in that time had those. Till today we're best friends just because of a toy. Then again, I also had alot of toys I simply watched on television, I didn't even know that they existed until I saw them.

In the end I can only repeat what I've already said. Television advertising should not be allowed for young children, because they can be influenced easily and it's just immoral.
