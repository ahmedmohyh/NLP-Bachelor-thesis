First of all, I think we have to ask ourselfs, what kind of advertisement we want to forbid. Is an advertisement, in which small children eat cereals, also an advertising toward young children? Because adults could eat these cereals to though. Or do we want to forbid only advertising for toys or things like that, which are clearly only meant for children. Actually I think there is a wide range for interpretation, what kind of product is specifiacilly meant for young children, but I think there are some interesting aspects from both, the pro and the kontra site, which I'm going to talk about later on.
I agree in some kind with the statement, as the fact. that young children can be influenced pretty well. If your an adult you can also be influenced pretty well by the advertisements, but it's not really the same. As a small child you're like a sponge. Everything what was told to you, you immediately believe. Same is it with the advertisements. If the clown in the TV tells you, that this specific toy is the ultimate thing you've got to have, you want it. So this is kind of unfair, because basically you can sell every kind of product to a small child, because it just has no clue if it's good or not; it just believes you. I think this can also be really exhausting as a parent. Imagine if your son or daughter, just saw an advertisement like this and it really want's this toy. He would cry like hell and in the end, because he never gets calm, you simply have to buy it.
 I don't know, if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because in some way the companies, who sell their products literally would have no way, to make their main target group buy their products.
