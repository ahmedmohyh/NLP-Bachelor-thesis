It is a well-known fact that at the age of three, children get extremely exploreous and start to discover new things. It is a phase in there life where they catch up every movement around them and try to understand or imitate it. That's also the point where eduaction starts to be important and useful for small children. But what happens if their mentalities get influenced by television advertising telling the girls to love princesses and the boys to be into pirates and adventures?

Advertisement often has eyecatching pictures and rememberable slogans which appeal to our younger generation. Once they see an interesting advertisement, they'll remember it because of that. Hence, they don't really get attracted by the message that comes along with it (like "this new pair of shoes will make you look cool"), but with its noticible surroundings such as the background music, colors or protagonists. In that case the youngsters aren't really affected by the advertisement itself. 

On the other hand it is important to give the children an idea of forming their own opinions and discover their interests. You should rather let them play in the garden than placing them in front of a television where they get informations through pictures and stories. A small boy learns much more things if he tries to build a wooden castle in the forest with his friends than seeing an advertisement telling him how amazing the new play-castle is he could wish to his next birthday. 

So actually the parents shouldn't underestimate their responsabilites. In my opinion it doesn't have to be strictly forbidden, but parents should get aware of the advertisement their sons and daughters are watching allday and based on that they shoud decide on their own if they stand behind such influence by television. 






On one hand it is certainly not the best idea to let young children watch television allday
