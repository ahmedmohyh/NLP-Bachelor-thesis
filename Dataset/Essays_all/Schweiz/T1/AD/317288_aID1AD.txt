Personally, I don't like the idea involving young children to our "buissness-world", a child should act like a child, he or she should be able to laugh with others or to play with toys, or even start argueing about small things with his or her fellow classmates. A child should learn how to become someone reliable and trustworthy. Plus advertisment was the most annoying thing on television. Children are not watching tv for the sake of advertisment, they are watching it because they love a certain movie or they want to watch their beloved series.

On the other hand if these advertisments include informations like, when the next spongebob squarepants movie comes out it's a good opportunity for children to get hyped. And if they are looking forward to it, they are easily to bait out. Then it's just a matter of time, when these children want their new spongebob action-figure. So that means: adultes, who only cares about money for them its an easy way to make money, because the parents of these children are paying for their toys.

Somehing against the idea is that it's going to take so much effort, just think about the advertisment which are perfect for children. They don't want advertisment about trash or online banking or stuff like that. They want something to laugh at.

And the most important questions are: Are they even able to understand that? Does it matter to them? Is it all about the money?
and do we really want to encourage them to sit more next to the television? Should they not rather play outside? I think it's improtant for Children to play outside and enjoy their childhood, because they are not always going to be children.
