This text should be helpful for parents who have young children aged two to five because here we awnser the question if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not!                                                                                                                                                        

Pro to the statement is that they can learn more if they see like learning matter in the television and that they can see and hear it and learn it in that way a lot quicker.
Contra to the statement is the aspect that they lose their social abillitys and don't meet friends insted they are looking television and aren't playing outside.
Then what also speeks for the television statement is that if there is just a mother at home with her small children she can easily switch on the television with a good program and let the childern watch that so she can clean something up in the mean time.
An other contra argument is that if they just watch television they don't now what the reality looks like so they have just theoretical know-ledge and not practical this is important because the reality is diffrent then the television world.
The least pro argument is that they get confortable with the electronic devises of this century wich are important for the whole life like for jobs and the future.
The least and most important contra argument is that the childern lose touch with the parents when they are just watching tv and not talking to the parents wich avoids emotional connection with the family.

to sum things up I personaly think that they should do that because I mean if you are just like watching a lot of television and not doing something else you are just in this mood of beeing lazy and tired and not willing to do something else.
