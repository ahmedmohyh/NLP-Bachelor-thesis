Television advertising is a difficult theme, were many people discause about, especially the one directed to young children, children at all. 

It looks like, it's the easiest way to advertise new consumer. It's much harder to make an adult buy your stuff, than a child. Produce a nice, funny and sweet short videoclip and they'll love it. And these two minutes during a break while watching tv, it won't disturb anyone. Everyother company does the same, so why can't I?! And if the parents allow small children at the age of two to five to watch tv, they don't even know what their child is watching, so they won't care at all.

Sure? Me not...
Why would you make a child love your products, if it can't even think clearly? Do you like to say: "The only one who buy my things are small children without really thinking about"? I wouldn't. They would choose your company only because the sweet bunny in the advertise or the nice music playing while watching the ad. If parents allow their kids to sit in front of the tv and watch a cute story, they want them to see the film and not an advertise about fastfood or expensive, not working toys! If you show small kids how tasty fastfood can look, it's clear, that they want to try it. But as known, that's not healthy at all. It's also known, that many many peolpe in for example the USA carry around to many weight. So why don't show kids whow you can live and eat healthy instead of promoting fastfood

So for me it's clear, that I wouldn't allow television advertisement toward young children. They can't really think about which toy they want to buy, because kids get easily influenced by cute or funny ad. So it's not fair to lie to them with cool shots of a toy, which the thing can't even do, as shown in the tv.
