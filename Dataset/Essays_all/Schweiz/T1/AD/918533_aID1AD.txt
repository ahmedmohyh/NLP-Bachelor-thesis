It isn't quite easy to answer this question. First of all it should be obvious that the television is directed to everyone. Even young childern already grow up with it and are influenced by it. The programm they watch influences them and so does advertising. It's part of the programm like every other movie, series or whatever. On the other hand childern want what they see, because it's new to them and they want to make new experiences. That's natural. The problem is that this behaviour can force parents to spend their money on these things and this can be dangerous during the hard financial conditions we're in at the moment. For some people life becomens even harder like this, because they want to give their childern everything they want. In addition advertising on  television is really annoying, because it interrupts the movie you are watching every few minutes. Another important argument is the fact that the company which produces the ads can make a lot of money by selling what they offer. And right now this is really important for the economy, since we're in a global financial crysis. 

Because of the arguments I previously mentioned I clearly agree with the statement. Myself I have a small sister and I can see how advertising on television already influences her. Sometimes she comes to me and asks me to buy her things, even really expensive ones, for which I don't have the money. I think most countries economy can take the hit it'll get from banning advertising on tv, but in exchange we can live a less sttessful life with at least one thinl less bothering us.
