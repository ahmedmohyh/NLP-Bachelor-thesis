Television advertising directed towards young children should be forbidden, because it influences them in the wrong way. They are getting animated to ask their parents for games or clothes they do not need. Further they are able to manipulate their parents into getting what they want. The parents are almost forced to buy the desired things, because otherwise they would have magnificent problems at home with their children. 

On the other hand, it is an advantage for the parents to always be informed abot the latest games or parks the could go to as a family. They do not only send ads for the children but also for the parents, because they know that more than half of the kids on front of the TV are watching with their parents in the background. I think that some of the ads are made specially for parents to get them into buying something for their kids or as a present for other families.

I personally think it is not a good thing to place ads on kids channels, because I do not like advertising in general and would not like my children being influenced by something I cannot control. I think the kids have a right to watch their channels and not to be overwhelmed by information about things they would like to have but yet most of the time not really know what it actually is. So to sum up my text, I do not agree with the statement and think it should be forbidden, so that we can protect our children.
