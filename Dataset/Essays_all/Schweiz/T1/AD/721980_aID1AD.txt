Everybody knows these annoying ads when you are watching tv. They are everywhere and it is impossible to ignore them as we want to. They are quite different, like specific products for men or women, for children and more. But is this really useful that some ads are directed toward  young children? I would like to investigate this question. 
First of all let's have a look to the children. They are pretty young and they do not really know how to handle with these adverts. If they see a thing like a mini electric car they want it. They do not think how they could get it or who pays it. They just want it. Maybe it is possible that they also buy something without the permission of their parents. Because this there are coming a few problems. And I think this is not nice for every parents. 
In the other side you  can see young children as helpful for ads because as I said if they see something that looks nice the want it. So they try to persuade their parents to buy it. And that is what factories want. They want to sell their products. 
Last but not least I think it is not really correct to sell products in this way. Sure they need to sell them but it is not correct.
To sum up I would like to say that I agree with the statement that television advertising directed towardd young children should not be allowed because it is not nice for the parents and young children do not know always what they are doing so they can buy something not because they want to but because the have done a mistake pressed on "buy" for example. And this is not necessary.
