Kids are no consumers...

If we watch television today, it's full with advertising for the newest volumenshampoo, the most comfortable car, the best accurancy. Yes, advertising is every where in our time now, but in television it has the greatest influence, because you see it again and again. Adult people can better decide between the bullshit and useful things in advertising. But how does it look by young children? They believe what they see. They think, that they all need to have from the advertising. Imagine an advertising for the new Barbiecastle. The little girl watch it and thinks "wooow", I need this. She wants that her parents buy it for her,  the parents say now and she gets very angry and sad. But I have to say, there are other parents, who want a happy child  and so they buy it. The problem is now, that the child think it gets everything. It shouldn't be like that. In childhood, the human brain learns very fast. Kids explore the world they live in. But if we imagine that a lot of these young children spend their time with watching advertising, learning the advertisnig spells by hearth and thinking always to it. Its shocking. Kids should go out and play with other children. These are reasons why I'm really against directed television advertising for young children.
