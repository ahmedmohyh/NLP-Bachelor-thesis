Nowadays there is a lot of advertisment in modern media. The goal of those advertisments is making people buy their products. Obviously every product is working perfectly in the advertisment. People have to make their own opinion and decide if they should believe what they see and if they want to buy it.

Firstly, it is obvious that young children are not able to buy products and clearly not because of advertisment on their own. They depend on their parents. Their parents are caring for them, buying them food and even clothes. Children do not know yet that not everything what comes in television advertisments is true. Children aged two to five cannot make their own decisions about what they want to buy. Moreover they do not have the money for that and they are not allowed to buy stuff on their own because of the law. Although they can say what they would like best it is the parents who make the decisons in the end. That is why it does not make a lot of sense if television is advertising toward that specific age. 

On the other hand it is well-known that young children talk a lot. It could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things. I guess that is cleary what the advertisment industry is aiming for. They try to influence the childrens mind so that they talk more about what they really want instead of just letting their parents buy what they think it is best. Furthermore it is an ethical question if it is alright to influence innocent young child.

In conclusion, altough I can see what goal for the industry is I do not think that it makes a lot of sense to advertise directed toward young children. That is why it should not be allowed in my opinion.
