I agree with this statement because in my opinion children don't see the television advertisings as we see them. They don't know if its true or false, what they say in the television. And because they believe it all they want to want to buy the barbie doll, witch you can feed for example even if they have 3 others at home. Or when you're in a store and your child wants to buy the chocolate chip cookie instad of a healthy joghurt because they saw it on tv . So that the television advertising  have a big influence in the life of the children and also parents because they have to pay it in the end. 
Also small children can't see the difference of a television series and a televisoin advertising. They think the film or series is still on so that their focus stayes.
So that they become to new targets of markenting. Every company does them and tries to get you tu buy their product. In our capitalistic world you have to do this to survive as a company but I think children should not be part of this. Because they want to get to the money of the parents and the children are just a way to get to it.  
Also I have to mension that parents can control it in a way. They can do rules so that the children do not watch television all day long and so they aren't effected by the television advertisings. 
So that in the end the parents have to point the finger at themselves a little if they allow their children to watch tv all day, if they have seen a game in the television adertisings and now want to buy it now.
