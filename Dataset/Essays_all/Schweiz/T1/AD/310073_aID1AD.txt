Television advertising is important for young children for learning not to believe everything what is showed in television. They have to learn that they can't have everything they want and television advertising is a good way to improve that.  Children also get a feeling for what is possible in this world and could already make a mind about what they are going to buy in the future.
But now to the con arguments. In my view children shouldn't see all that nonsense, which is often mentioned in adverts. Children are to young to make a diffrence between the reality and the informations in adverts. Adults know what's the truth behinde  them in opposite of the kids. Futhermore children shouldn't
see some of those adverts, because for example there are somtimes online games presented,which are cruel and show violent. Or what's with the adverts of online cambling websites? Most the of them are very colourful and seem very interresting. And if a child visit such a website, it will become very dangerous for it. The adverts of social media is also not very good for young children. They come in contact with things for those they are not old enough. 
To sum it up I continue with my own oppinion. I totally agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. In my view children, who are aged two to five, are not old enough for even watching television or seeing adverts. Children couldn't really make their own opinion about a advert, because they don't have any experience with them. Kids are kids and on should let them their lifes without any lyings about  products. They are too young for understanding what's behind the adverts
