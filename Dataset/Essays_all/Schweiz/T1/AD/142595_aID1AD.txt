It is known, that tv advertisements often contain promises which they can`t hold or facts that aren`t true. But unfortuanately, young children tend to belive them when theysee these advertisements on tv. Therefore, many people think, that advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. An advantage in illegalizing these advertisements would be, that parents wouldn`t have to face the problem, that their children are crying or screaming, because they want to have something, they saw in an advertisement. Another advantage could probably be, that there would be less advrtising on tv and so, the adults would probably profit also because of the fact that there would be less annoying advertisement breaks, when they want to watch a programm on tv. An argument against the illegalization of these advertisements is that the children should better learn at a young age, that advertisements on tv often lie to them and that they shouldn`t belive everything they get told, especially not, if it is on tv. Another argument si, that the toy industry would be affected negatively. Certainly, this argument only affects a rather small specific group of people, but it would bevery bad for these people, who are working in the toy industry. Also, the private tv channels need the money they get through these advertisements and so they would be affected negatively too. Because of the reasons I just named, I am against the illegalization of tv advertisements directed to young children.
