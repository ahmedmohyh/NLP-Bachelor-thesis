Young children can be manipulated quite easy. They still have to learn very much of their environment and mostly the take older people as their (Vorbild). If they grow up with a television and it's advertisements the toddlers either whatch it with full attention or they aren't really interested and don't take it too serious. But if they love what they see, television advertising can make them to want the shown product or to be like the children/persons who show up in the ads.
