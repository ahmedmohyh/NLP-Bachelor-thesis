Since a child of two to five can't buy something itself, there's no danger that a child buys something it shouldnt buy, but the advert can make the children want the product.
The content of the advert plays an important rule.  When there's any kind of violence, sexism or racism in it, it should be forbidden, but then it shouldn't be allowed anyway for everybody. Maybe an advert about a videogame, which is not dangerous for an older child to see, but a younger one shouldn't see it because it cannot differentiate between reality and fiction. That the most series and movies for children are fiction, the question comes up, if watching television should even be allowed to a child aged under five, but that's another question.
  
The most adverts designed with the goal to make children desire their products, are about tools to play. What bad is about that, is that the child wants something new, even it mostly has enough things to play with. That supports the consume society, and probably the child was happy and content before, but now it wants something more that it doesn't even need. When a child is bored, it makes up its mind and thinks of other things to play and to do, and a child always will find a way to pass the time senseful. Adverts that promise happyness and lots of fun with their product, only limit the childs natural ability to make up very creative things to play with.

So I think the advert isn't helping any child or parent, but the decision what to buy, make the parents. There's no need to forbid the advertisment.
