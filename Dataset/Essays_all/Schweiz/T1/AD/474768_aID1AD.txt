contra arguments:
Television isn`t good for young children because it can destroy their eyes. More children suffer on shortseeing and they need glasses to correct it. The children don`t learn of the television. The television is only used for the entertainment of children. Maybe the social contact is reduced because the children don`t want to play with their freinds anymore because to watch television is more important. 
pro arguments:
The children are entertained. They don`t need attention of somebody and are silence.
