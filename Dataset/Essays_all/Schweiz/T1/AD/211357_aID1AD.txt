Advertising is all about the content these days and it is false to ban all of them, because most of it is harmless to young children

First of all ,Children shouldn`t be allowed to look to much tv anyway, they should do some activities for example: meet friends or go play outside.
Parents have to pay attention and take care of their children, they could watch TV together and if some strange advert comes up the parents should be there
to explain whats going on in this advert. So its a question of how the parents raise the children, the adverts doesn`t have to be taken out. And the other important thing is here what content it is in the adverts, it could affect the children a little bit perhaps to buy some games or something but that isn`t a reason to ban an advert because they`re an important part of the oeconomics, that wouldn`t be very rentable to ban it. When its toward young children it won`t be very dangerous, they won`t ruin their future or harm them in an other way. I disagree to ban advert to young children because it wouldn`t hurt them. The most important reason why i am disagreeing with this is because that would be just to make  small problem not even a problem into something big that would just be unecessary action to do because it doesn`t affect them much, we have to concentrate on real problem. For me it just to overprotective.
