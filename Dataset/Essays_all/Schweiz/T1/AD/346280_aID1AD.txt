Television advertising directed toward young children is very difficult because the kids do not watch many channels either than a long period of time. All that makes it not easy to direct only children. But when children watch some advertises for example of a play they want to have it and that is very difficult for parents because they do not want to buy new things for their children all the time. That is why I agree with the satement. 

An other reason is that the children see every day a new advertise and they want all these plays. After it is very difficult for parents to say no because the others of the class get this new play. When the parents have more than one child it costs a lot of money and they have too much plays at home. Also when the parents are not as rich it is too expensive for them to buy every week a new play. 

Additionally, the children have to learn to be contnet with the plays they have. Already, they do not understand that their parents work for buying the plays and that the plays cost money. But when they are adults they have to earn their own money before buying something new. That is why I think that it is important to understand that already as a child that you have to earn money and and that plays or stuff like that are expenisve.

At least in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children from two up to five years should not be allowed. It is less stressful for the parents who have not to spent a lot of money and also for the children who do not want to have the newest plays all the time when the advertises are not allowed.
