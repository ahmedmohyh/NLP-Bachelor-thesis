So the question is, if Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. Let us discuss about it and look at the arguments. 

Firstly young children can be easily manipulated without noticing it. They could use this fact to influence the kids to buy stuff they do not really need. And it is not their money they use, it is money from their parents. So the parents have to buy stuff the do not need. The children do not really understand the economy system and in cause of that they will get sad, if they do not get the things they want to have. 

On the other hand the parnets are the ones who decide if they buy these stuff for their children. They have the authority to tell, what their kids can have and what not. So no matter what the children see in the advertising, they have to ask first their parents before they can have the advertised stuff. Even if the kids get sad or angry, the parents get the same problem, when they go shopping with their children, but there it is more embaressing. 

What also could be important is the fact that parents have to deal with the complains of their children. It can be stressing if the kid always argues about things he wants. But this is a question of how to raise a child and this have every parents to deal with. If you do not want to deal with stress then you should not have children. 

Eventually it does not really matter if there are Television advertising, because the child do not have the power of buying everything they want. It is the decide of the parents. I think  advertising is a good way for the companies, which are running the TV shows, to get money and then they can use the money for even better shows.
