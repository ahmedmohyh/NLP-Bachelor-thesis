My little cousin is three years old. He is very activ and loves to be outside. He always climbs on trees or plays on the playground. He doesn't really care about television and electricitiy. I think thats how little children should grow up. They should go outside and play with other little kids and make their own experience with dirt and sand.
There is so much visual media in our world that young children shouldn't care about. In their life it's the only time when they don't really realize whats important to the rest of the world. Because in our time everybody is starring at his phone while watching youtube clips on the internet. Three-years-old  live on their own little planet and there they shouldn't be hipnotisized by technology. In my opinion its okay to watch a film with your kids but not everyday. It must be something  extraordinary and special to watch TV. Like my little cousin I adore to watch a movie saturday night. Then we take some chocolates or biscuits with us and eat them to " Winnie the Pho " .  His eyes are always shining as bright as the sun he played to the whole day. I think parents shouldnt forbit watching TV but they should controll it and take a limit. They may watch together so they can make a family evening. I think when more families would control the consumation  of TV , than it would become less important. 
I think it's not a bad thing to produce films for young children but they should be beautiful and lovely. I think advertising shouldn't be for young children because they don't really understand. I think advertising for children products should be more for mothers or fathers. Because they have to buy things for kids. I think we cant forbid advertising toward children but we should minimize it. And we shouldn't show bad advertising for adults in TV because we never know if children watch and thats why parents should controll the consumation of television time.
