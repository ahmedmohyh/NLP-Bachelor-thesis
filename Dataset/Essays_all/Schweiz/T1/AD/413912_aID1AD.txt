Many young children watch very often television, should it be allowed or not?
The most of the children, who watch televiosion, watch a movie or a serie. But there are good and bad movies for children, or movies, whitch aren't for children. By some movies the children will learn something, for example, when they watch a documentary or a movie for their age. On the oposite, if they watch a movie about war or something uninterant for children, it isn't godd for this young children.
But, what is, when a child watch a movie or an other thing in the televioson, whitch isn't good for children? Maybe they have later a problem or are scary from things they saw in the television. 
An other point is, if they see every free minute television, they haven't time to play with friends or to do things, whitch are normally for so young children. This will be a problem when they are older, they haven't friends or any social contact. 
I think, the little children should more play and be a child in this age, without watching television or playing videogames or sometihnig. But in this poin, the parents play a important rule, they have to say, if it's okey when their child watchs television or not. Maybe they can make a "Movie rule" for their children, whitch movies and series their children can watch.
