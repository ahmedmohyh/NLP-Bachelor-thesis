Arguments: I disgree
I think that children shouldn't watch a lot of television during that age anyway because they should play with friends and be social and enjoy their time. But if they watch Television I think that during that age they should rather watch shows with Crafts and "Do it yourselfs" without any advertisement so thats they or rather their parents don't have to buy a lot of expenssive stuff from the advertisment. And also because kids kind of want to have everything that they see it can cause some sad kids which don't get everything what they want or what they wanted as a present. A lot of stuff from advertisments is very expensive because most likely big brands like for example Lego or Playmobil do the advertisements and because of the price some parents may not be able to give their children what they want. Another possibility may be that if a child gets a gift for lets say their birthday and they are happy but then they see a brand new adversisement they may want the thing which is advertised and aren't happy anymore with their "old" gift. 

Arguments: I agree
I think around christmas time or the birthday advertisements can be a great way for parents to see what their child likes and what it wants as the next gift because with that way the parents don't have to go around in the whole city for finding a fitting gift. 

My final oppinion: 
I thing that it isn't a good idea to spam young children with a lot of advertisement because even on the "adult channels" like RTL or Sat1 it can be very annoying to always have to watch the advertisments so why should these kids have to watch that stuff when they just want to enjoy their show on their channel.
