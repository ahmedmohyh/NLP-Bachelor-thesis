A lot of children spend most of their free time watching television and with that a lot of advertisement. The companies soon realised this and started to make advertisement specifically for children. Studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a rather dangerous thing, because the brain of a child is yet to be fully developed. Being less responsible than their parents, the children often go to their parents to beg for the advertised product. Even if the product is absolutely no fun to have or play with, the children will believe it is if the advertisement makes it look like it does. Some companies have made advertisements where the sound has a higher frequency which only the young children are able to percieve and so delivering a subconcious message to the children without the parents noticing. 

The parents are the ones who buy the pruduct in the end, but it is the children who are used by the companies to sell them. Using young children without the right judgement to evaluate the product is unethical and is a mild form of child slavery.Although the children are not forced to do anything against their will, the companies make them believe that what the children want is their will, but in reality it is just the advertisement controlling them. 

Brainwashing children and taking their freedom of choice just for more profit is morally wrong and should not be allowed.
