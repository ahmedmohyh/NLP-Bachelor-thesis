When you watch tv there are allways breaks where they show advertising. On programs for Children like "Super RTL" or "Nikeloden"  the advertising is often directed toward young children. They show plays and toys and young children thing that they absolutly want that toy the saw on tv. Often the children woudn't want that toy if they just seen it in a store but the advertising has a psychologly effect on the children. An that's a big problem the children are manipulatet by the advertising. In order to do something agantst that manipulation some People say that advertisind directed toward young children should not be allowed. 

The Problem with this sentenc is that you often can't see to witch age of children is the advertising. A LEGO advertising is for children from 4-8 years so it's difficult to make it just for children from 5-8 years. Also every child is diffrent some children may be more attractet to the advertising for older children. 
A solution for this problem would be that the tv programs for children don't show advertising. An exemple for this would be "KIKA", they know that often young children watch their shows and don't want children to be manipulatat by advertising directet to these cildren so they don't show advertising at all.

I think it's an good idee and more Tv programs should make it like "KIKA" because we have to protekt oure Children  when they are so young.
