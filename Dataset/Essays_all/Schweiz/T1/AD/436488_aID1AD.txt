Advertising directed toward young children has been a critical topic for years. It is a powerful meaning to speak directly to children and make them want things really bad that they didn`t even know about five seconds earlier.

But before arguing about whether advertisement is good or not, I think you need to make a difference between advertising for things that don`t do no harm to children, such as toys or events for kids, and things that really are bad for children, fast food chains for example, like McDonald`s or Burger King.

Since children don`t have much experience they do not really know what is good for them and what is rather unhealthy. So if they see a funny advertising of McDonald`s in TV that, overall even promises them a toy delivered with their happy meal, they might feel the need to eat unhealthy things, which is rather bad. Children are easily influenced, so I think it could be seen as dangerous to advertise for children.

On the other hand children are still people. So wouldn`t not showing advertisements for them mean to kind of disrespect them? Moreover, TV advertisements can have a good influence on children. For example, if you advertise a sports camp in TV that children all over the country can go to, you motivate children to stay active and be healthy. Also, toys aren`t so bad, as long as they don`t have anything to do with people fighting and hurting each other.

I think that advertising for children is a really difficult and complex topic. There are things being advertised that, at least in my opinion, children should not be confronted with at all. But they can also influence kids in a positive way. I think the solution would be to simply decide for each advertisment whether it influences kids in a good or in a bad way. The positive ones can be played, while the rather negative ones should be banned from TV. But still, who is going to decide which advertisements are good and which ones are bad?
