The goal of an ad is to show something to someone and make them to buy it. So my question is, if children can get that feeling to buy something and if they even recognicethe ad.

The first thing that comes in my mind when I read this is, if children in that age realise that something is an ad or not. Maybe they think it's just another show or series they can enjoy. For example, if there is an ad for a doll, maybe an animated one, they dont realise that they could play with it or even recognise it as a thing. In that case most of the children this young age I think wont see any difference between an ad or a normal tv show. The other thing is, if they can feel the    urge to get something just by watching an ad or if they are just like "oh it's cool but I dont need it". In the case a child saw an ad and really wanted it, they dont even have the goods to buy it or even don't know where to get it. The other thing is, if children are watching tv with their parents they are confrotated with ads to. Maybe it's not directed towards them but they'll see it too. An other problem I see with this is, that there are other methods of showing an ad. We are living in a time where maybe even childre be at the PC doing something. I think online advertising is getting more and more popular. So they might get confrontated there. 

In the end I cant find anything, that speaks against advertising directly toward young children. Everywhere we go, we get to see or hear ads. And I think children will see or hear ad^s too. Even if it's not through the TV.
