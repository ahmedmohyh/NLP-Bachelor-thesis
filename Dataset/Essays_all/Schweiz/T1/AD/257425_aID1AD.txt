The porupose pf this essay is to have a brief look at the above mentioned statment talk about my own oppinion on this subject.
Television advertinsing has become a big part of watching different episodes on telvesion. Not only can it be very annoying and stupid, but also can it be harming for small children. As a first point I would like to mention that television advertising has no point of learining new things, or understanding something better. There is no aspect of gaining new knowledge, at leat not to small children.
 It is said that television advertising can make small children become impatient and loud, since their brains are uncapable of storing so much information at once, so much information that they don't need. Small children have no chance in understanding the language that is being used in different advertisements. They are lacking of vovocabulary and they can't find a cotext between the advertisements and daily life. 
Although there are many negative aspects, I would like to talk about some positive ones. 
Advertising is the marketing of real life products, which small children will use someday. So,why not showing and teaching them as early as possible about products they might need someday. 
As a last point  I would like to mention that television advertising will be a point of life someday, since small children will grow up and get older, they will be face to face with advertisments, so why not start showing advertinsments as soon as possible?
By lookimg at the above mentioned arguments, it is clearly to be seen that for me television advertising directing to small chiildren is no good idea. 
There is simply no aspect of learing and understanding, but more of annoyance and stupidity. So, I my oppinion television advertings should be forbidden to small children.
