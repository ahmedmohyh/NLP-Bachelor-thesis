Nowadays the question, if television advertising which are directed toward young children should be allowed, is well discussed in public. But where are the advantages and the disadvantages?

On the one hand it would be a success for toy shops, because children would see their toy of their dreams and aske their parents to buy it for them.
Secondly if a couple have thei first child and don't know what they have to posses, this advertisement could be helpful for them to make their child growing up well. It also would be able to find something new to try for example light balls for falling asleep instead of a night lamp.

On the other hand this influence of advertising would bring up new mobbing victims, because you would be an outsider if you wouldn't posses this stuff that the others do. Additionally stores which haven't the money for such big advertisement have to be closed, because people would stop buying things thei didn't have seen before. Furthermore other Television series or programms would earn less money because there would be a longer section of advertisement.

In my opinion it should be prohibited, so I agree, because children should't be influenced by things from televisionno they should be able to make their own descisions, free willed. I think young boys and gils shouldn't watch Television, in their yung years they have to enjoy the environment and playgrounds and go out with kindergarden friends or spend time with their family.
