Today, television advertisement is directed toward allmost all ages from five to sixty or even seventy years of age. Now, should televison advertisement toward children aged two to five years be sanctioned? This depends on how much television this group of people watch and how much of this time is filled with advertisement. Also, children of today use more handys and tablets to play and watching televison as a free time event isn't probably more interesting for them.

In today's world with handys and tablets to play with and where parents haven't that much time left for their children, they buy them tablets to entertain them. So the children would rather use these because they are more entertaining then TV. This could meen that a sanction against the advertisement in TV isn't needed anymore.
But for the same reason that parents haven't enough time for their children, a disallowement of the advertisement is needed when the children don't have tablets to play with and instead of using tablets watch too much TV.

The second point is, if these very young children can even understand the advertisements shown on TV. Because if this is the case, advertisements and a sanction of them would be both totally sensless. But if they can understand it and then want the things that are advertised on TV, it shouldn't be of much harm because the things advertised in childrens TV shows are mostly toys. And children love toys anyways.

At the end of my essay, I would like to present my own opinion to the question questionned. TV advertisement and other advertisements are found everywhere today. It should totally depend on the children's parents how much they see from it and how much they watch TV. We don't need a disallowement of TV advertisement if the grown ups watch for their children and spend enough time with them rather than only work and let the children's entertainment to tablets and TV.
