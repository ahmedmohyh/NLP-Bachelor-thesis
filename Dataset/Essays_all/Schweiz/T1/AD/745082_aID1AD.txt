The television is often used to influence and manipulate people. Especially children are manipulated very easily. But television advertising can entertain too, because it makes children see the new toys they could have. This manipulation not only happens in television, also the stores are full of candy when you are leaving. If television advertising should not be allowed there would be so many things which had to be not allowed too.
Otherwise it is not good to show children what toys they must have to be cool or something. Children should have the possibility to think about their favorite toy by themselves. Of course it can also be a great thing, when you see something in television for your wishlist for Christmas or your birthday. Children don't go everyday to the stores to buy new toys, so where would they be able to see them? As television is a very common thing for young and old people, the advertising is also a good thing to see what's new without having to run into the next store.
But if parents don't raise their children right, the children might get angry when they don't get what they want. The parents would need to make sure that their children know that they get manipulated by advertising and that the toy maybe isn't that perfect and fun as it looks in the television.

I think television advertising for children should be allowed, because I know how much fun it was for me to see a new toy and to put it on my wishlist for Christmas. Wishing and dreaming are some of the best things in childhood. And as a child I knew exactly what toys I wanted and which not. Not every advertising was attractive for me, so children do know exactly what they like or want no matter how the advertising looks like.
