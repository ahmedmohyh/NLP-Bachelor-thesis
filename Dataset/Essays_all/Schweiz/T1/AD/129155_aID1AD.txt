Television advertising direceted toward young children has been a thing ever since television started to be a platform for advertising. To see advertisement every day, as soon as we turn on our TV or computer is a very normal thing for us today. Is it good, though, to be manipulated from the very start of life?

Advertisements are everywhere, as soon as we get out of our house or apartement, turn on the TV or the phone or reading the newspapers. It's normal for our daily life to be confronted with pictures, logos and catchy phrases which are intended to make you want to buy a product. One argument against the banning of television advertising directed toward young children is, that they will need to get used to it and be able to cope with it eventually. Furthermore, it's good for their education if they can see the methods with which the companies use to make their advertisement good.

On the other hand, such a yound child can never extinguish truth or exaggaration and it cannot see how it's being manipulated. I wouldn't want the kids of the future to get manipulated into wanting thing they don't necessarily need from the very start of their lives.
If you aren't aware of it and just see it without thinking about it, the media is manipulating you into wanting the newest iPhone, Body Lotion or Ice Cream. That could be very bad for your wallet. Also, it's very unhealthy to plant ideas in the heads of the kids, that happiness can be bought and that that's the only thing that matters. Finally, the parents feel a pressure coming from those advertisements. The spots tell them, how they can make their kidi happy with buying that one product, which is not true, obviously.

I agree to the statement that kids should be prevented of seeing the advertisement and think, that the kids should not get manipulated into an object of our economy. They're sinply too young to know and understand whats happening and too naïve.
