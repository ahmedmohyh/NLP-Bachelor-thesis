In TV you find all five minutes some annoying ads. Unfortunaly do those ads know which kind of groups in our soiciety should realize, that they are meant. Also young children. It's normal for kids, that they watch TV and charming advertising. But I think, because of these ads, kids can get some bad influence. The children get the feeling that they have to buy that product even though they don't have the money. There are situations where some kids start to steal the money from their parents. The producers of those ads know how to provocate a meanful thought where the people think, they need it. Ads are very manipulating and do have a strong, hidden message. The worst thing is, that there are ads, for example about video games which have violent scenes and death delicts which could cause psychological damage. Even though, I disagree with the statement, that televisions advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. I think, that kids should watch TV and also those ads. If they don't watch them now, they'll never learn how to bend the feeling to buy these products which are shown in the advertisment. The later they would watch TV and ads, the less they know how to handle the necessities. And while you get older, the more rights and possibilities you get. As a young kid you are not allowed to buy expensive products. But as a 18-aged person you can buy whatever you want, as long as it's legal. After all the parents do still have the decision, what to buy for or to allow their kids until they're 18.
