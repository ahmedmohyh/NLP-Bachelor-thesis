pro advertising: Advertising is an important instrument of a company to make their products or brands popular. This is essential for the economy, stricter regulations would not only hurt the marketing business, they would have an infect on every business. And since there are not only swiss tv-channels, a law only in one country could not work at all. therefore, all the other countires with tv channels that are available in switzerland would have to do the same- otherwise it wouldn`t work. And it`s not probably that so many countries would see the need for stricter regulations of advertising. It`s also problematic to say which ads are directed toward children between two and five, not five to seven etc.
 Marketing is only necessary because a company needs to be popular to sell its products. The market can therefore regulate itself without any difficulties. If a company addresses ads directly towards young children and peoople mind, they could just stop buying the products of this company. If it really matters, more than just a few people will boycott the company and then, the enterprise will change something for sure and stop the problematic advertising.



contra advertising: Opinionating advertising that has an influence on little children is dangerous, because young children are easy to manipulate. Therefore, they ain`t able to distinguish between true facts and only advertising elements that make the ad more intresting, like for example flying toy cars. If there were an ad with toy cars who would start flying during the ad, little children would buy them because they`d think the cars would fly at home as well. It could also affect the developement of the young children, since they are very easy to controll, because they can`t know yet how the world is working.
