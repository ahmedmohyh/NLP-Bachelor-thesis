I totally agree with this statement.
Kids in the age between two and five years pick things really fast up they see and hear. They try to orientate on everything that seems interesting for their eyes and do the same. Surelly they start to think on their own but it's pretty easy to influence their thoughts and their actions. Of course this has an influence on the rest of their life because a lot experiences (pictures) are memorized unconciouss. So when they see those advertisers, for example for Barbie they'll have this brand in their had. Then they want one from their parents because the advertisers know how to get children on their side (the right music, colours, quotes etc.) So they play with the Barbie for their hole childhood and it can happen that when they get older they'll have body issues because they've allways seen this Barbie in the Media, than at home and of course it get's somehow something to orientate on.
About the comment i said at the beginning that kids copy things they see. So for example they see some kids playing with thousands of toys, their parents are of course lovely and everthings seems like the perfect family. The children see those images and they "burn" into their head propably they'll wonder why it isn't like this at their own home because they can't differntiate from the real life and an illusion of life. So they want those things they see and propably it's harder for them to understand that they can't have all of this beucause it's just unrealistic. 
I think children should generally not watch television in this adge because you can't allways controll what they see and even if the advertisers are ment to be for this age, they're not allways good and you never know in which ways it will influence your own child.
