Both talk about the different strategies of voting. In the text its written about the traditional voting, and especially about the critic about this way of voting. They think it would be better to computerize the system, because a major problem is the inefficience and that it often leads to inaccurate counting of votes. And for the voters its often hard to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper (so whats with these people with poor eye sight?)  and in the computerized voting they would only have to touch the candidates name. 

On the other side there was a clear statement in the listening part against the computerized voting system. In their opinion the computerized version would be a good invention for all these people who knows how to handle with a computer, but what about those who can not use a computer or the internet. For example old peolpe who havent grown up with all these digital devices. So they would need help to make their voting or when they try it on their own, maybe something could go wrong and the result of the voting would be false. 
Another argument that speakes for the traditional way and against the computerized system was, that it could lead to a error with the computers, so in the worst case you would loose all your votings. And this would also lead to a false voting result.
