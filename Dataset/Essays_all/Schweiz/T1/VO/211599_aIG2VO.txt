The oppinions about the least problematic voting system are heavily divided. The traditional system leads to a lot of accidental failures when used by a person with poor eyesight but the computerized system wouldn't be all that better since old people or people who aren't used to computers are just as likely to cast the wrong vote because they're not familiar with them. This could even discourage them to vote at all.
Because people count the votes we can't even be certain they won't make any mistakes and are bound to make a few a computer wouldn't make. On the other hand, it's programmed by a human and if this human fails the consequences would be a lot more dire and the mistake would produce a much larger problem. Though computers are used for banking transactions and communications this systems were flawed at first and it took a long time until they worked as smooth as they do now and a voting system wouldn't be used nearly as much so it would take much longer until it underwent the same process and no longer risked to contain human errors.
