It may seem easier to use a computerized method of voting, but that it only true for people who are used to this technology. Older people will have some troubles. Also not everybody can afford a computer or Laptop. Since older people aren't familier with this technology, there's a big chance that they'll vote for the wrong person aswell. 
It is true that by counting the votes one-on-one can (and probably will) cause mistakes but that'd be only three or four mistakes per official. Besides computers need a system aswell, which is installed by a human begin. Human Error can show up through that system too.
If we put them next to eachother we can clearly see that an error in a system would be much worse and far more problematic than a counting human error of 3-5 mistakes. To get rid of a problem in a system would be much more difficult than solving a problem on just one person.
That whole proceder only happens once in two years, which makes it too rarley for a change that big. (It would probably cost alot too) So at the end of the day it wouldn't make that much of a difference.
