Every time it is voted, thousands of people have to help to count all the votes. The discussion that is going on at the moment is about the question what voting system would be the best for this country. 
So what speaks for voting traditionally and voting on the computer?

First of all, the traditional voting is a long process, where thousands of people are included. If one fault happens, in the worst case the whole counting has to be redone. That problem would be solved with computers; the fault could be easily removed and the counting would go on. Another thing is accidentally voting for the wrong candidate. You have your voting papers with many names on it and have to find the person you want to vote for; for people with poor eyesight often a problem. Computers are included everywhere in today's world, so why not also in the voting system?

Humans make computers, so there could be made a fault, like with the traditional voting. What also speaks against voting with computers is, that faults can happen in traditional voting, but it would never be as bad as an error with the computer because we never know how long technology will last. Also the voting with computers is made for those, who are used to computers, but what is with the people who aren't? With those who can't afford it or even wouldn't vote anymore vecause they are afraid of technology.
It is a difficult discussion, where every opinion counts. It has to be found something that fits for everyone and maybe even motivates those to vote  who didn't vote to that point.
