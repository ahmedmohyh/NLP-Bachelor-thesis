Computerized voting system in the United States

Today people are used to the old voting system of the US and sometimes you can have failures in the voting, for example they wrote down the false number of their candidate. It needs a lot of time to repair these failures, because this votings are all handmade. Now with computerized you can easily choose for which candidate you want to vote.
 For young people i won't be a problem to vote like this because they're used to computers, but what do you do with people who can't afford a computer? or are fear of technology or just don't understand computersystem really good. They could easily vote for the wrong candiate. The old votings are humanmade and with computers it should work better but computer are also humanmade and could have a failure in the software. Computerized system like banking systems are used every day and you won't have problems, but the votes are every 2 years. So if something goes wrong you could lost 1000 of votings and it would be a lot of work to repair this mistake.
