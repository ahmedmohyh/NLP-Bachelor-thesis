Both the text and the presentation are about voting systems and if they work good or of they should be differend

The mainly arguments are that voting in the way it is right now is not good and inefficient and that should get replaced by a computerised voting. People vote accidentally and they often vote the wrong candidate. Furthermore another problem with the system we have is that the voting system rely on people to count the votes and so are made a lot of mistakes.
 
At the presentation is also claimed that we have many problems nowadays and we could have another system. It is about a computerised voting. That means a voting system on the computer that may be more efficient. The problem would be that not everyone have computer knowledge and so the people who cannot use a computer would be in trouble.

Moreover it is claimed that we cannot be sure that a computerised voting would be better. Computers are programised from people and that means that they can also make mistakes.
