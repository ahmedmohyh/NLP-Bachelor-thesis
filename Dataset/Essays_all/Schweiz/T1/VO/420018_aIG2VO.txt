    One of the main arguments from the lecture against computer votings is, that computers aren't that reliable in case of an error. While both agree, that the traditional system has some counting errors, the lecture says, that errors by computers would be way worse. 
The lectures says, that computers are difficult to use for people who don't use computers that often. The text however says, that those computers would have easy to use touchscreens. 
    The lecture also mentions, that people who aren't that familiar with computers would have a high chance to accidentaly vote for the wrong person. However the text states, that the errors people make when using the traditional system, are mistakes that are caused by the small text.This text could be magnified on one ofthe before mentioned touchscreens. 
    The lecture also says, that banking systems and others are only reliable as they have been used daily and therefore have been improved more. The election-system would only be used every two years, so there wouldn't be any good way to improve the computers. The text however trusts the computer and says, that humans make more errors. 
    Another arguments the lecture says, is that some people have a fear of technology. The text never states anything about that. The last argument that the lecture says is, that in case of a serious error a computer wouldn't be able to recount the votes, while humans could do that with no problem.
