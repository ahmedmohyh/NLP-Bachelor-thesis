Voting systems

Critics say that the national voting systems in the United States of America is heavily inaccourate. They also say it is inefficient. But is it really true that computers would solve these problems as the critics say? If all votes would be done with a computerized voting machine there wouldn't be a possibility for humans to miscount the ballots. But it would be possible, that the person who programmed the software of those machines made a mistake while programming. Remember how long it took other softwares to work like they do today. The international banking systems had years of develompent until they worked properly. And people use those systems every day, a national vote is only done every two years. So the possibility of an error is immense. The worst about this is, that if all votes are done with a computer, there isn't a physical copy of the votes, so if there happens to be an error you can't correct it or recount. So there could possibly be thousands of miscounted votes, while a human counting only makes a few mistakes once in a while. Another aspect to think about is that some people aren't used to use a computer. Many older citizens or poor people don't have a computer at home. They could be overwhelmed (überfordert?) by the computerized voting machines. So in conclusion it isn't a good idea to computerize the voting because the risk of something going wrong is too big. The texts states exactly the opposite. It says that computers would make the voting easier especially for older people, because they can see what they vote by zooming in, you can't do that with a traditional voting system. Also there wouldn't be any human errors.
