Critics of the current voting system say that it is easy to vote for the wrong candidate and the USA should switch to computerized voting machines. But there are also people who say that the electronic system may be easy to use for people who are used to them others could have fear of the technology. Nowdays an error in counting is possible and an expensive recount is needed but you can do it without any further problems. The computer is programmed by human this means that the critics of the actual voting system lie. With the computerized voting human error is possible and if the computer is programmed wrong a recount is nearly impossible. And they would have to vote again with a hopefully repaired program. It isn't easy to get the confidence with the computer because votings are only every second year.
