They want to do a computerized programm to count the votes because human can do faults. They think that a computer will be correct and more efficient than people. Perhaps it's right that the computer is faster than a human and don't do a lot of faults but when it's going to do with a computer you lose the tradition. There are some people who always count the ballot and they like to do it because it is a tradition. A lot of things are computerized. Why do we have to do this with all things? 
A lot of people can't use a computer. So they have to do there votes with someone, because they haven't a computer or they don't want to use it. Most of the older people are afraid of the new technologies, because they never saw it before and they never learned to use it. It can't be a solution to vote with the help of another person because this person can influence your oppinion.
