In the lecture they say that through computerized voting there won't be any human errors which make a difference if an election is closely contested, but since computers are programmed by humans there is still a possibility, that a human made an error programming it, which can cause a much larger misscout of  votes. Plus if a human made an error in counting there will be the possibility of a long and expensive recount, but if there is an error detected in the computer system there won't be this possibility. As for people with bad vision, which are mostley elderly people, not being able to find the correct candidates name due to many names on the ballot, might not be easier with the computer since there are lots of people including most of the elderly who can't use a computer. Even though the governements and individuals trust other complex computers technology there is still part of the community that doesn't. Even computers had to be inproved to get to where they are now, therefore we can't develop confidence in computers. They aren't flawless now, nor will they be in the near future.
