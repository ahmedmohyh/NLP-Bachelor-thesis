Due to the face that I was unable to hear the listening and only heard the last few words, it is difficult for me to compare the presentation to the text excerpt. I did though hear part of the last argument in which I believe the speaker mentioned that the computer system is difficult to use and inefficient, though I am unsure of whether this comment was indeed directed at the computer system. The most I can do is offer some arguments as to why someone might find a computerized voting system unsatisfactory. A possible counterargument to a modernized system is that it should not be generally accepted that all members of a society would be willing to use a computerized system. Many people prefer to rely on traditional means of completing transactions and refuse to use online banking for example. A computerized voting system could lead to some people feeling as if voting is something that they are no longer able to partake in. These groups of people would most likely be of a mature age and taking away their ability to vote could perhaps cut out a whole demographic from the votes. It is also not inconceivable that an organization or individual could hack the programme and change peoples' votes in favor of a certain candidate, the hacking of said programme could also lead to a severe leak of private information and be misused for financial gain or blackmail. Another possible problem of the system would be that it would be extremely costly for the government to update the voting system and put so many computers in voting stations. A power out could also affect the people's ability to vote.
