The text says that the computerized voting is trustworthier, because on a large sheet, it is more often to cross accidentaly the wrong feeld of the candidare than on the screen. But in the computerized voting, there happen also many mistakes from people who aren't used to computers, some people are even afraid that they make somthing wrong on the computer, so they don't vote at all. 
In traditional voting, human count the votes. This is a long and exhausting process and it happen easily that some votes aren't counted, because of a countig mistake or when the sheet is overseen. In the contrast if a computer has an error, maybe every fourth vote isn't count at all or for the wrong candidat. 
A computer is made by humain and if humain make faults in counting the votes they also can make mistakes in the instalation of the computer. And if the counting mistakes are realized, people can recount a vote, but for a computer it's impossible to recount the votes. People are used to counting things, but the voting programm for the votess is only used twice a year, so there is less experience than people has.
