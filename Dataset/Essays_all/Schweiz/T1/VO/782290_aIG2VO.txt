The current voting system of the United States is not computerized and relies on human staff.
The lecturer opposes the idea of this new voting system out of the following reasons.

Althought computers prevent human errors, the are still programmed by humans themselves and therefore not flawless. For example, mistakes in a counting programm will have a dramatic influence on voting results, whereas counting mistakes made by one single person will only affect the results slightly.

Critics on the traditional voting state that computerized voting will make it easier for people to actually vote for the person they want due to easy to use programmes and ajustable fonts. The lecturer argues that a computer may be more convenient to vote for people who are used to them, but will also prevent people from voting who are not confident with this technology or who cannot afford a computer.

At last, computerized banking or communication does not guarantee an accurate and save use of computers for voting. Because the use of computers in these areas have been practiced and improves over many years and are used frequently. This is not the case for voting, where people do not have the opportunities to practice.
