The subject of this essay are the advantages, aswell as the disadvantages of our traditional voting system in comparison with computer technology.
First of all, the point is made, that people with poor eyesight might confuse the voting brackets and vote for the wrong person. The computer system on the other hand, is promised to be easy-to-use. 
Furthermore, thetraditional system relies on humans to count the votes. This can lead to errors, as they are dealing with thousands of ballots. Also, if an error is detected, a recount has to take place, which also takes a lot of time. Computer systemsare not bound to make these kinds of mistakes. They are also more efficient and quicker. 
The argument is made, that the risk of using this technology nationwide is not too big, as people and companies rely on computer transactions on a daily basis.
On the other hand, there are also arguments who speak against this automatized system. First of all, in our day and age, there are still people who aren't used to technology. In this case, the odds of making a mistake are still present. Also, there are no physical records of the votes. So if a computer malfunctions and loses the votes, they are gone for real. 
This system also relies heavily on computers being able to function properly from the get-go.  But banking systems in the past have shown that they don`t always work perfectly at first. These are used on a daily basis. So if a voting computer doesn`t work on the first time it`s used, it can lead to serious problems.
