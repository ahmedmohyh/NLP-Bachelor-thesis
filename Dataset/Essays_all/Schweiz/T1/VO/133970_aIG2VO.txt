Essay

While in the presentation it is only talked about the new voting system means using computers with touch-screen for example the text also counts some points about the old voting system which means voting for a candidate on a sheet of paper and send it with the mail.

In the presentation it is told that voting with a computer isn't as good as it seems. Computers are built by humans so they do the same mistakes as we do. In the text it is written that a computer wouldn't do these errors because all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.

Further the presentation told that not everybody knows how to use a computer so they will do something false as they are voting but in the text it's standing that a voting machine has an easy-to-use touch-screen and that the people who do something wrong have a bad eyesight. And with this we get to the next point: Voting in the United States happens only once all two years. It's hard tho make the voting machines attractiv for the population because they are so rarely used. In the text they don't talk about the people who have nothing to do with technology but about those who get confronted with it every day which doesn't include every single person.

The last point is the way how it can be prooven that a voting system made a mistake. There is no way to find a physical vote and proof that a mistake has happend. The opposit is showed in the text: An error by the old voting system is hard and expensiv to recount because of the amount of sheets of papers and with so many work there will be an error somewhen.
