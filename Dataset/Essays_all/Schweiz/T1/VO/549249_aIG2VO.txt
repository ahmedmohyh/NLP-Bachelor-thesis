In the two textes they talk about the voting system in the United States. They have a different point of vew about it. 

The first text wants to change the system in a electronic way. he says that therer would be less errors when woting because it is difficoult to count the votes andif a computer would do it no errors would happen. it says also that many people who do not see well have problems by voting with the scedule because they do not see well what they are voting.

The second text says that the system is good like he is and that it should not be changed. It says that if the errors are not really big and that if there would be a programming error it would be a much bigger problem. It says also that many people who do not use electronic devices for them it wouldbe more difficoult to use an electronic system than the current one.
