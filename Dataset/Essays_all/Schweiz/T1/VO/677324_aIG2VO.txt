The listening talks about voting in the USA. Is voting with a computer better? In the listening they said that the people count the votes false. But Coputers are made from  people  and when these people who programm the sythems make a fault, maybe the computers  don`t count a lot of votes.And what is with the people who don`t use a comuper? What is with the people who don`t now how to use a computer?Iin the text they said the people count false and computers are better. They said that it cost very much muney to count all the votes without computers and wen the people couns false they had to count it again and it costs again very much money.In the listening they said that we haven`t experience with voting on a computer and it takes time to get experience and we need experience because it wouldn`t work at the beginning. In the USA the people only vote all two years for the president and it`s a risk to vote on computers without experience.What is the better solution,voting with or without computers?
