Voting systems in the USA are often seen as inefficient. Some people say that the traditional voting is better, because everyone can vote and it's easy to do, you just have to mark a name. But there is all so a problem, some people with poor eyesight easily mark the wrong name. Another problem is that the votes have to be count by a Person, that often leeds to misscount.
Another voting system is computerized voting. You can vote with your smartphone or on your computer. The counting of the votes can be easily and quickly be done by a computer programm. But there are risks to the programm is written by a person so when this person makes a mistak it can have a big influenz on the result. Than it's not only a fue votes e person would miss it can be a very large nummer that cout be miscount. The other problem with computers is that not everybody can effort one so they can't vote because they are poor and that would be diskrimination. 
So both systems have theire good and bad site.
