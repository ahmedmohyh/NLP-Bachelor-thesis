The presentation about the voting said that many people would have problems with the computer voting because they have fears of technology or trouble with the computer. This people like to vote traditional. The other people think that computer voting is much easier then the traditional one. Computers are used daily and heavely so there will be less human errors and mistake. But the computers are progamized by humans so perhaps there are errors too. There is on 2 year one national voting and 2 regional votings in one year so they don't have to vote many times. They trust the system too. In text they said too that with computer the voting will be easier because the easy-to touch-screen technology and the other problem with counting the votes will also be cancled with computers who made this automaticly. Different as in the presentation is that in the text they don't trust the technology or they find it to risky because the highly sensitive informations but we use each day this technologies at the bank or with our mobilephones. The text is more for the computer voting and the presentation is more for the traditional voting.
