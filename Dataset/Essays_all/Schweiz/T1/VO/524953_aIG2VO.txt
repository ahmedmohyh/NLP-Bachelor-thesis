Voting
The lecture about computerized voting is very critical of the subject and only focuses on the negative aspects of this alternative method. It seems to represent the interests of a maybe older and more conservative group of people, as it names problems like people having trouble using computers or people refusing to vote because they fear technology. While the text states that computerzized voting would simplify the procedure and minimize countig mistakes. Contrary to the text which focuses on how voting could be improved it adresses the arguments from the text and states an opposite opinion. Like for example in the text mentions how voters can accidentally tick the wrong box and therefore vote for the wrong candidate and also the quite likely possibility of counting mistakes as the numerous votes all have to be counted by hand. The lecture admits that there might be voting errors in the current system, but that new methods might not be better and the problems may even be on a much lager scale. The human error which is mantioned in the text is also existent in technology, says the lecture, because computers and programms are made by humans and therefore also falible. In conlusion the lecture doesn't want a new system without it being developed thoroughly first.
