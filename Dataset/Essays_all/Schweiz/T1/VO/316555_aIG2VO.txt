In the presentation the computer voting is being shown from a much more critical side. It says that the computer voting can be better but just if you can handle a computer and have knowledge about technic. There are so many people who are afraid of the technology and it`s effort, that it can be they will make mistakes when they are voting. In the presentation also the issue of errors came up. Because computers are programmed by humans it can also be that they will have made an mistake. Because if there is an error of the computer programm thousands of votes will be misscounted and by example a whole city is forced to vote again just because the computer programm was broken. The trustworthy of computer voting programms is presented in a very uncertain and critical way so you can make your own thoughts about it.
In the text computer voting was shown as the best possible conclusion and there is no way to pass by the technical voting.
So If you compare the presentation and the text one side is definitively sure about the computer voting programm and the effort which can be made with it and the other side is unsure if technology is trustworthy enough to replace a humans made cross to vote for the right person.
