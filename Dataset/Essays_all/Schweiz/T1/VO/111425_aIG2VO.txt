Voting is a serious theme. Both, the text and the listening have shown some arguments, but they aren't the same opinion:
Fitstly, the text says that a lot of people (mostly with poor eyesight) make a mistake by voting for the wrong person, because there is a large sheet of paper with names on it and you have to make a mark beside the name. So it is obvious that the mark is maybe one row up or down. Computer should solve this problem because you can just touch the name on the screen and you have voted. Nice, but the listening says that there are also people who don't often come in contact with computers and don't have much experience or there are people who just can't afford a computer.

Secondly, the text says that people make a lot of mistakes when they count the votes, but computer doesn't make mistakes. The listening disagrees. Also computer have been programmed by human being and how easy could they have made an error. They just have to forget a bracket and maybe thousands of votes would be removed.

And finally the text thinks that the technology is easy to accurate perfectly, but the listening says that it is a long way to improve the technology. Even longer than banking technology, because voting technology is only used one to two times a year and not every day.
