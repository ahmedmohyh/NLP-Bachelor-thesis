Almost everybody knows what a TV is and almost everybody has ever seen a TV show in which were some votings. We forget that current voting systems were used every day in our world. Computers do all the work, they count the votes and show us the result. But computers are not perfect, they are inefficient an there were often a lot of errors in their statistics and votes. But why are they inefficient and make mistakes? First of all we have to search the mistakes by ourselves. Do we have a poor eyesight and choose the wrong candidat or did we just forget the number of our favorite candidat at a several TV-show? No, that could not be possible. Computers make the mistake. They are programmed by humans and humans are not perfect. If there are people who know their talent, they use a computer very good and without errors. But if there were people who don't know anything about a computer? They do mistakes and it is clear that for a voting-show or an important voting there has to be somebody who knows their work. A voting system is everytime a thing you can't totally trust in. The problem of many people is, that they trust a computer more than a human. In some case that could be true but to be sure about a result of a voting-system you have to take an error-possibility in. Maybe the computer, programmed by humans, did make the mistake or it was the person who knows nothing about a computer. Errors do exist all over the world, accept that and don't be furious.
