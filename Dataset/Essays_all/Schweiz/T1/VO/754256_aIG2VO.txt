The U.S. voting system is known to be inefficient and that it leads to inaccurate results. Critics of the voting system want to replace the traditional one with a new modern and computerised version. In the traditonal system the people have to find their candidate's name on a very long list and make a smalll mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight often mark the wrong name. In the new computurised version people could zoom in on the names and make sure its the right one. Another problem with traditional voting is that officials have to count up the votes one by one. With so many votes or ballots it is obvious that mistakes will be made. In the computerised version the counting of the voted would be completly automatic and with that removing the possibility of human error. The opposing arguments are that many people in the United States simply cant afford or aren`t used to computers. Because of that it will make it very hard for those people to vote or even discourage them completly. Another issue with the computerised version would be that the program for the system would be written by humans. So the possibility of human errort would still exist. In the presentation it is said that the early version of programs are never very precise or even perfect and that it takes to time to always better and renew programs. Since voting doesnt take place often it would take a long time until the program for the computerised version would be perfect and would work smoothly.
