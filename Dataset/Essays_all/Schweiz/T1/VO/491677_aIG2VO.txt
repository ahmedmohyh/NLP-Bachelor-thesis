Critics say that the voting system used in the USA is inefficient and not accurate. The system relies on human counting, in which mistakes are easily made. The counters have to count every single vote one by one, which is a common source of miscounting. But not only the counters can make mistakes. Also the people who vote for the candidates have some hindrances to manage. The lists of canditates are often very long, and it is hard to find the right cantidate you want to vote for. In these so called ballots the people can easily miss the right line, and make their mark on the false canditate. This is why the critics believe that a computerized countign system has its advantages. The computerized system has a touchscreen on which the voters can find the canditates name by scrolling through the list and choose them with a simple touch on the name on the touchscreen. The computer counts the votes automatically and by this the human error of miscounting any votes is removed. 
But if we take a closer look on the computerized system we see that it also has its problems. What do we do with the voter who have never used a computer before, or people who do not understand the system properly? Another issue that comes up, is that the computer programm which counts the votes is programmed by humans. The people who programmed the voting system could make an error in programming as easily as the people who maually count the votes. The computerized programm will most likely not be flawless on first use, so the errors that could occur could be much worse than a bunch of miscounted votes in the manusal system.
