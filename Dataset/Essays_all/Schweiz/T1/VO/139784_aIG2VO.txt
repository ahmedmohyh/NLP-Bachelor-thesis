The woman,who held the presentation thinks the current voting system is better than using a computer program, because not everyone has the ability to handle with such a program. There are people, who have fear of the new technology, who cannot afford a computer or who just don´t want to use a computer program for such an important thing. So there will be more trouble than it is now. Humans can make errors, but all the computer programs are also programed by humans and if there is an error in the program the effect of the voting result is much more dramatic. One aspect is also that people trust in online banking systems and such things, because they know that we use them daily and that these programs are improved. In the beginning these programs where far not as good as they are nowadays. On the other side the voting system we need just once in two years and it would be tragic if there would be errors in the program. The author of the text has not the same oppinion. He says a computerized system would be better, because it´s too complicated to do it by hand and there would be less mistakes with a computer program. So he thinks it would just make it much more easier with the computorized system.
