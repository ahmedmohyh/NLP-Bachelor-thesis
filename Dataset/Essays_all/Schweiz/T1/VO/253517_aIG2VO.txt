Critics have the opinion that many erros can occur by voting manually becuase of eldery people not having good eyesight or votes being miscount however the computerized system isn't perfect either. It won't be used on a daily basis and because of that it'll have many errors in the beginning and has to be tested heavily before being used.  On a computer you could magnify a canditates name but you can do that in real life too. Computers aren't used by everyone on a daily life basis so not everyone has them (or can afford them) and because of that not everyone can use them or atleast use them properly. It's true that computers are far more accurate than a human but if a human makes an error while coding the software the error would be way more fatal and so it would cause way more damage. However counting would be much more easier and faster on a computer and even recount is possible (even in case of a system failure) because data is being saved on servers (not like the women told us). Computerized voting would be cheaper because there would only be the cost of the systems and the developer and maybe a helper but not more so wouldn't need many people too count the ballots.
The government should give computerized voting a thought and maybe try it out intern there is not much too lose just to gain.
