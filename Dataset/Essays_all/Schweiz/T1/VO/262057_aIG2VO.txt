Voting systems in the United States

The test and the presentation is all about the voting systems in the United States and how the voting system of today could be improved. First af all the voting system of today has a few mistakes but is the voting system with computers really better. The voting system of today is not very effective and many mistakes could be made while voting and by counting the votes. On these touchpads it is very easy to accidentally vote for the wrong candidat and after the voting the counting of the votes needs a lot of time and many mistakes could happen. But is a voting system with computers better? On the one hand the counting of the votes would be much easier and maybe with less mistakes. But computers make mistakes too and if the computer is not working right these datas are lost. We trust the computer technology every day, so why do not we use them for voting? On the other hand the voting with computers is for some people pretty complicated, because their not used to it or the do not own a computer because they have not got enough money. So there are advanteges and disadvanteges for both voting systems.
