Some of the arguments of the reading part are similar to the ones from the listening part. The problem that causes to think about a new voting system is that the current voting system seems to be inefficient. There is an inaccurate counting of votes in the countries. With computers there would not be any errors. The people are likely to vote for the wrong person. The voter have to chose their candidats from a sheet of paper containing lots of names, so they easily pick the wrong one. In addition to that it is quite difficult especially for elder people with poor eyelight. Moreover the world nowaday uses computer technologies in many other parts of the working life. So why should they nobe used for voting process. These are just a few arguments in favour for a computerized voting system. For people which are used to work with computers this would be a good thing.

On the other hand there are arguments against the new system too. It is not guaranteed thatcomputers will not make any mistakes. And if a mistake happens it would be a massive problem. Thousands of votes could be deleted. A massive effort would be needed to fix it. A Problem would be much worse than it would be in the current voting system. Furthermore many people can not afford a computer or they do not know how to work with them. It would last many years until people would trust these computers because theyvote only two times a year. So they would have to be improved. It is not an easy decision to make.
