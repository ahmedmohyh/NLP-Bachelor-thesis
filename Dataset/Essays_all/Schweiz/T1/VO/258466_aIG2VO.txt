The text says that current systems are inefficient and lead to mistakes by counting votes and that it would be much more efficient to have an computer programm. In the audio the woman says against this,  that not all people have access to an computer or knowlege how to use it, besides from computers being programmed by humans. So if we make an mistake during counting the votes by hand, there's the possibility to correct the mistake even if that means that you have to recount every vote. If there's a mistake in the computer programm the entire election can be unusless and false and the mistake that was caused is much bigger. Of course you could say that people with poor eyesight easily mix up the names but on the other hand you can say that people who don't see well will probably also have massive problems using a computer then on the computer screen everything is small written. The problem with easy-to-use-touch-screen is that the people by mistake klick on the wrong name and the vote is wrong. Also we don't how the programm was disigned, so actually someone can just programm the programm with not having the world knowing how he proframmed the programm. I personaly would totally agree with the people who say it's to risky to have an computer system. An other point we vote twice a year so it's not really necessary to have an programm. Of course it would be quicker if we had an programm. But if we had one it were again jobs which would get lost and I find that a very bad thing to lose jobs because of a computer system.
