Overall, there is a big discussion about the current voting system. Some people think, it would be more efficient and trustworthy to work with computers, while others think that this would cause many problems. In the following points there will be some pros and contras why a digital voting system would be better or why not.

First of all, there is the chance to vote for the wrong candidate. On the traditional paper, if you have a bad eye sight, you can easily vote for the wrong candidate because of the many words on the sheet. But opponents of the digital system say, that this would be the same with the computer voting, and there were even more problems.They think, that there are many people which are not used to computers, and for them it would be very hard to understand the new voting system, and maybe some of them wouldn't even vote anymore just because they don't understand how or they are afraid of the new technology. 

An other point is, that people could make mistakes in counting the ballots and this would cause, in worst case, a wrong result. But if the people which programm the voting system would make mistakes, this could end much worse, especially because there is no recount possible!

A point for the digital system was, that we trust computers with our banking transactions as well, but this systems didn't work flawlessy in the first time, they were improved a lotand over a long time, and we worked with them on a daily base, while the voting system would be used twice a year, so it would use much longer to improve them.

There are many different opinions, and it is hard to decide yet if it would be better to introduce the new system or not.
