The voting system in the United States

Often the current voting system is critisized because people have to count thousands of barrots. The presentation brings up a nice argument against the computerized voting systems, becuase people, often older people, who don't know how to work with computers can mark the wrong name. This argument is the opposite of that in the text. The text says that people with poor eyesight often mark the wrong name, because it have many.  The autor of the text pretends, that compuers make no errors. But computers are programmed by humans and if the programmer makes a mistake the error could me much bigger, because all barrots are counted wrong. Therefore the traditional voting system could be better bacause one wrong counted barrot is less bad than a programme, that counts wrong. The people vote only ervery 2 years, which make it difficult to teach the new computerized voting system to all the people, especially to old or disaled people, who don't work with computers. This is the opinion of the presentation, but the text says, also in banking transactions the computer technology works perfecty, so why not vote with a computerized system. The presentation is more fot the traditional and the text for the computerized system.
