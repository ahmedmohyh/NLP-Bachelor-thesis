In the presentation it is discussed, whether the US gouvernment should switch to a technological voting system or if they should stay with the traditional pen and paper version. It would be much easier for instance, to mark the candidates name on the computer then making a small cross on a huge list of candidates.
Whilst human errors are also garanteed when counting the ballots from hand, a computer makes no mistakes counting the votes. Since the computers software has been programmed by human hands though, it is possible that there is an error in it and thousands of votes are wrong, instead of only the few wrong counted ones when counting by hand. 
So the main argument is, that we can not trust computers completly, even though we use them to complete bank transactions and a lot more in our daily life. That is, because the software for these actions are used daily and have been improved over years. They were absolutely not perfect when they first came out and even today there are failures. So we do not want to risk a rigged vote in the US, since the computer votes would have to be retaken, but the old fashioned paper ballots can easily be recounted.
