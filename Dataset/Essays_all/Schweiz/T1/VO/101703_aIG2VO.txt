The woman who did the presentation told about difficulties and problems about the computerized voting system, but the text says that exactly this system would be better to vote with and would avoid a lot of mistakes.  It says that the current voting systems are inefficient. Especially if someone does a mistake during counting and they have to count all the votes again. But the woman in the presentation said that they are voting only once a year and that this is worth it. She also said that computers are programmed by human beings, so it's possible that they do mistakes too. An other argument she brought was that people who have difficulties with using a computer and aren't used to it would have problems and probalbly won't vote because of the fear of technology. But in the text it says that people with a poor eyesight would have less problems (because on the large sheet of paper which is used in the common voting system are a lot of names written and you should make a small mark next to that name of the person you vote for) and the possibiliy that they would vote for the wrong person would be completely gone. It says also that the problem of miscounting the votes wouldn't be there anymore but on the other hand, if the computerized system has an error, there would be the possiblity that more than 1000 votes are wrong counted. With the other traditional system the risk is much smaller.
