In the presentation, I just listened to, she also talked about the voting in the United States. She thinks, that computerized voting isn't such a good idea because there are many people, who aren't used to use a computer. They struggle with the programme and in the end, they can't even vote because it's too difficult for them. She also points out, that it is of course possible that computers make mistakes because they're programmed by humans. If an error happens in a complex computer system then thousands of votings can't be used anymore. 
As we see in the text above, the traditional system has its problems too. It happens very often, that people can't properly read what's on their ballot. They struggle with that and in the end they vote for the wrong person. In a computer system they can magnify the name for easier viewing. Another argument against the traditional voting system is, that it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes during the counting of the votes. Computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically. People should at least give it a try and trust like they trust computers when it comes to highly sensitive information or banking transactions.
