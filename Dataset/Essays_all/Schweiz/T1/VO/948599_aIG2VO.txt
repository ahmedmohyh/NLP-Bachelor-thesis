In the text it is told that people often vote for the wrong candidate because they have a poor eyesight or just tick the wrong one in the list because it is a large sheet of paper that contains many names. The traditional system is quite oldfashioned.
Now there are many critics that say that the traditional voting system should be replaced by easier, computerized voting machines. In the presentation against the critics, the argument is brought up, that these new techniques are only easier for mostly young people or others that daily use computers and know how to handle them. So, the mostly old people with a poor eyesight might have also problems with the computerized voting system.
In the text it is told that the traditional voting system has many flaws because the votes are counted seperately by humans, and this is a huge source of mistakes, when the humans make mistakes in counting. In the presentation against the critics, the argument against this statement is, that the computers are also being programmed by humans, so the programmers could make mistakes as well. These tiny little mistakes in programming could even be much worse, bacause for example all the votes could be counted wrong, if the system does not work correctly. A negative point about the computerized technique is that there is no physical reference about the votes. If the computer system shuts down and the votes are not saved correctly, all of the votes may disappear and nobody knows the results of the voting.
In a nutshell, both systems have pros and contras.
