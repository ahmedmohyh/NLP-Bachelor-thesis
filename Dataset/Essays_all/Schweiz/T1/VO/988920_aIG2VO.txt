Critics say, that the current voting system in the United States are inefficient. So they want to replace it, with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system. But a computer is only easy to handle for people, who use a computer often. The others will have trouble and are going to vote wrong, for example vote for the false candidate.
Is it sure, that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error? A computer is made by humans and it's possible, that there are errors. A computer can make an error too at counting votes, because the technology is made by humans.
The computer technology in banking transactions are used daily and so they are reliable, but the computerized voting system is only used a few times a year, so it can't be trusted and it's not trustworthy.
It isn't a good idea to replace the current voting system with a computerized voting system.
