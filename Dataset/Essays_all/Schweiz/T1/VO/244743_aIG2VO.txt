Voting by computer is very difficult because not every person work with computers or know how they work. Espcially for old people who weren't grow up with technology is an election on computers not good. Computers can also be damaged or had an error function so the election can be misscounted. But a traditional old voting on papers is also not good. People with poor eyesight can fast make the small mark on the false name so they elect a person they didn't want to elect. The votings must also be counting by a person one by one. This person can also make mistakes or they can make that the result is wrong. In contrast the computer election is quite faster and easier for young people and people who need a computer everyday. But for People without the knowing about this technology system is a computer not quite a good idea. First the people had to trust into computer and the new technology.
