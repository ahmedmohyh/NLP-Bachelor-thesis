What is better, voting traditionel or voting with by an computer?
There are different arguments, but its sure there are on bouth voting problems.

By the traditional voting are used many people and they have work and something to do. But humen are making many mistake, so it`s possible that the end result is wrong. For the traditional voting are used many of papers and it is not so conftebly for all the people who vote. 
The voting system by an computer is much easlyer, becouse the computer doesn`t make so many mistakes like an humen, but you have to know that computers are programmed by normaly people, so they can also have mistakes. One problem is that some people can`t work with an computer or haven`t one. that means that they can`t vote. And for an voting you have to have many voises who votes. On an computer all people can do the voting at the same time and don`t have to stand in a qiue. 

I think in this time it`s a bit heavy to use computers for an voting, becouse some people can`t work with an computer and they are to old to know how does it work. One time later we can change the system and can make all the votings with computers, but the time isn`t ready for that big change. And the voting in the Unitet Stats is only all two years, so it doesn`t have to be quiq.
