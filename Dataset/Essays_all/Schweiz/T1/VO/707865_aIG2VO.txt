In the USA, peopleare discussing the possibility of a new election system. Of course there are people for and against the changes. Now In the speach the woman expressed people who couldn't use computers, for one reason or another, would either vote for the wrong person or be discouraged to vote altogether. Critics think the ballot system is more damaging, as people with poor eyesight could place the mark on the wrong line. The computers would allow for an easy-to-use touch-screen display, meaning you just have to press onto the person you want elected. Also when it comes to counting the votes, there are contraries. For one, critics say computers, as opposed to humans, count very reliably and don't fail. However the woman described how the computers are man-built and a mistake in the computer causes 1000s of votes being wrong or not counted at all. Furthermore the votes on computers aren't recollectable as they're electronic and not physical. At the moment, if an election is close, the ballot system has flaws regarding humans missing a few sheets of paper. Even if they haven't, if a recount is wanted, it can take a long time and cost a lot of money to finish the process.
