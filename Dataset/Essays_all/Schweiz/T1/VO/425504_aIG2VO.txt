Many people want that the traditional voting systems get improved by using computers which count the votes automatically. It seems like a great idea since people nowadays have to go through long lists with names of candidates and put a cross next to the name which can be missed easily. But there are many critical points about voting by computer. First of all not everyone is used to work or deal with computers and not everyone has even got a computer at home. This could cause many problems especially for older people. The second criticism talks about the reliability of computers. We all know that mistakes in counting can appear if some people have to count the votes but we don't know if computers ar more reliable than humans. an error in a computer could result in a loss of hundre thousands of votes what would lead to another problem. since national elections only occur once or twice a year it would take us a long time to get confident with the computer voting system. what we don't know either is if these computers, containing highly sensitive and secret information, can't be manipulated or taken over by professional hackers or other technical problems. so actually the texts are criticising both systems of voting but the lecture had a critising view about the computer votings. The points mentioned above are mentioned in the video.
