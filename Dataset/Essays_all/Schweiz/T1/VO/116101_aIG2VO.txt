This text is about the current voting systems in the United States. Most of the people make mistakes when they count the votes. The voters just have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper, the ballot, and make a mark next to name. 
In the old/ traditional times, there were counters who count the votes. But that was a problem because there are 1000 of ballots anf it's normal tha humains make mistakes. Then the computers were invented and than it was easier to count the votes because the computer doesn't make that much mistakes. You can also count the votes much faster. It is a risk to implement complicated voting technologys. But they have to giving it a throught. we have a lot of other computer systems and we have to do that step for de evolution.
This computer systems are used every day. some states have every second year a vote and some states do it twise a year.
