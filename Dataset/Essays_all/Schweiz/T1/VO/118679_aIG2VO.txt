In traditional voting system people fill out the ballot by hand. Afterwards other people count the votes. But should they get replaced by computer voting systems?
The criticer say no. This system may is useful for people who are familiar with computers, for people who doesn't know much about computer, it's really difficult. They can make a lot of mistakes. For exaple they could vote the false candidate or they could vote for all candidates by mistake. In addition computers also make errors, because they are programmed by humans. And if they make a mistake, it's even more serious because there is no physical record of them and it will cause much more false votes. Further the system is used just few times and therefore there is not enough experience to improve them.
On the other hand the counting by hand is caused by human faults. People with bad eyesight can easily vote the false candidate on the large ballot. The voting by computer systems would be easier. Furthermore it relies on the people counting votes because they often make mistakes. Computers wouldn't do errors and they would be quicker. In other areas people trust computers since a long time and there aren't many difficulties. So, why shouldn't we use computers for voting?
