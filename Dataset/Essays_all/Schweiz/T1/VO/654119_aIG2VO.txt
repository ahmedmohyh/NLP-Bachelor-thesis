The current voting system in the USA is inefficient. The officials often miscount the votes because they have to count the votes one by one. If they miscount, a long and expensive recount has to take place. Critics want a computerized voting system but a computer can also make errors since it is programmed by humans. This means that computers can even make more erros for example if they dont count tousands of votes. But computers dont just make errors they can make the voting easier. You don`t have a long list with lots of names where you have to mark the one you want vote for you can just touch the name of the candidate. So it is much more easier for older people or people who have a poor eyesight, according to the critics of the old system. Critics of the computer-based voting system say that errors made by computers are even worse than errors made by the counters because with computerized voting there is no physical record of the vote, so you are not sure if the vote`s result is correct and maybe the wrong candidate is elected. 
Both systems, the traditional and the computerized systems, have their problems like miscounting or an error in the code.
