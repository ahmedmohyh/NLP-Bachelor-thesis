The presentation of the women told us the better side of a technology vote and the worse. The new way of voting is more practicall, because you can make
less errors.The old way sometimes you can't read the names written on it. But it also is said that the people who have problems with computers can't use the new methode. They can easily touch the wrong name. Another argument is that in the traditional way of voting the errors aren't heavy.But human race make misstakes,so a misstake in a computer programm is worse than a misstake on a sheet of paper. This is a point which doesn't agree with the text. In the text it says that a computer has an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology, but the women also defended the people who have problems with computers.Also an contrast is that the text says that in the old traditional way , if you make an error, it is very long and difficult to correct it.The women said that if they is a problem with a computer voting programm,the misstake will be giant. So it is much more dangerous to use the new way of voting. The women also tells us that people who have problems with the new technology they won't understandt it and make a lot of misstakes.The text says that people with poor eyesight make faults.
