In the second text the system of computerized voing was introduced. In this system people can vote with the computer. Like that mistakes can be avoided. This voting system would be easy for people who are used to computers. But for people who aren't used to it, it would be more difficult and they might make mistake. So there wouldn't be no advantage. In addition, people build the computers and the voting system, so there could have been made a mistake. Another aspect is, that computers are used daily and they got proved over and over. Like that a mistake isn't hardly possible. 
The first text was concentrated more on the paragonation between the traditional and the computerized voting. For example they explained that the traditional voting is inefficient and may contain a lot mistakes, because the counters have to count the votes one by one. Another problem is, that the major part of the voters vote for the wrong person. But finally many people don't like to vote by computers.
The first text is in favour of the traditional vote while the second text explains the risks of mistakes in both voting systems.
