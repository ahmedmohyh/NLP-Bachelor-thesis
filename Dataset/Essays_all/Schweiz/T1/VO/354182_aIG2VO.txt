In the presentation it says that we could probably replace the "old" voting system by computer programms. Yet, this would lead to more mistakes because some people are not used to computers and the mistakes would be worse if the computer for example remove the results. Otherwise, in the presentation is also named that those votings are once in two years which is not very often so the technolocists have much time to create a good save programm. At the end, the woman say that we should trust in the human but the computer is also a product form human so it is very controversial. 

In the text, there are reasons why the computer system would be better because the otherwise the people for example are not able to read the ballots and also do mistakes by counting the votes. It says that with the computers and an easy-to-use touch screen they are able to provide many mistakes. At the end of the text it says that a couple of people think that is not safe enough to do this on computers but those are the same person who trust in many other complex computer systems for example banking transactions. 

So for me, the text is more for the computerized systems and against the old voting system and the presentation explains the problems and difficulties with that system but have also the opinion that we could solve those problems.
