Many humans say that voting systems are often inefficent and inaccurate, this is mainly the case if elections are closely contested. Traditional voting often leads to inaccurate numbres of votes, because of accidentally votes for the wrong candidates, caused by poor eyesight of people. And because in these old systems the votes are counted by human eyes and in this way it's very heavy to count the votes correctly. This is why in many governments computer systems are used to count the votes. Many people would say that counting it with computer sytems is a better way to get accurate results and to remove the errors. But if we take a deeper look into this topic we have to say that computer systems are nor always better that humans. We have to be aware that not every family can affort a computer and knows how to use a computer, it happens very easily that we type the wrong box for maybe an election. And another argument against computer counting the votes would be, that since we know that all humans make errors, and the computer is a product by humans an computer has also errors. This were beeing corrected over the years but we can't pedict that there aren't still errors in our computer systems. So if there's an error in a computer the mass of error it would make is by far bigger than a error by a human. But unfortunatly people often believe more in computers than in their own brains and in human, eventought computers are a human product and invention.
