In the lecture it was said that people who are not used to computers can easily vote for the wrong candidate. In the text it is said that people with poor eyesight have the same problem, when they have to vote on paper. Therefore this error can occure in both ways of voting. Also, not every person can afford a computer.
The lecture also mentiones that computer are programmed by people, so mistakes by humans are also in the system and those errors have far more consequences than vote counting mistakes. It can lead to thousands of votes that are not counted or worse, deleted from the system. That means single mistakes in counting are not so grave because they are only about a couple of votes and not thousands. 
Furthermore it says that e-banking and other complex cumputer technologies are used daily and more heavily. And even though that might have led to mistakes in the beginning, it was easier to fix those problems because it was used so much and not like the voting only once ore twice a year.
