The lecture was about the negative aspects of computerised voting inthe United Sates of America. Firstly, even though computerised voting might be easier for people who are used to computers, but for people who don't use computer technology on a regular bases a new online voting system might discourage them and they won't vote at all. An onther argument mentioned is that not everybody can afford to buy a computer, which would exclude them from the right of voting. In the written atricle it is mentioned that there is human error because the votes have to be counted one by one. Since there are tousands of votes is almost imposible not to make any mistakes. In the lecture is being opposed by showing that human error can not accure in the traditonal voting systm but also if computers would count the votes. Those voting programms would be set up by humans and if there would be a mistake in the programm it would be impossible to do a recount. The last argument in the lecure iwas that even though the traditional voting system hasn't been perfect from the first time it has been used, but it has been improved over and over again to make it as relyable as it is now. Since nationwide votings only accure every two years, the effort to completely change the system for that rare occasion is too big and unneccessairy.
