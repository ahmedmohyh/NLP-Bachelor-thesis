The two sources talk about the current voting system in the United States. Because it's said to be inefficient some americans want to computerize it.They say that by computerizing it, there won't be miscounts anymore and it will be much more trustworthy than if humans would do it. On the other hand the audio argued that the computer systems are made by humans so how can we tell that there aren't any errors in programs?. Only the mistakes a computer would make, would be far more damging, because a computer recount is impossible. With the current system it also happens very often, that people who can't see well accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, because the names on the sheet they have to put their vote on are too small and they mark the wrong name.But with the computerized system people who aren't used to computers or can't afford them will bediscouraged and they might won't vote.
