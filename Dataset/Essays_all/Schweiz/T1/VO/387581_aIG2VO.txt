The content ans arguments of the presentation are the following: Despite the fact that the traditional way of counting votes has some problems, the new computer technologie is not better. That is because of the technologie is not affordable for everyone and many people, especially older ones, are not used to computers and may therefore miss the elections because they have fear form the new technologie. In the artice, that is not mentionned. In the artice, the writers  don't think about any disadvantages of virtual vote. What would be even worse than  missing an election is that they can easily vote for the wrong candidate. In addition to that, a human error has less influence on the whole election than a computer error. In the article the authors even don't think about a computer doing a mistake. In the presentation mentionned is that the worst thing a human could do is to miss some votes, but a computer mistake could count many thousand votes wrong. And the virtual election is not recountable, what the article does not talk about aswell.
