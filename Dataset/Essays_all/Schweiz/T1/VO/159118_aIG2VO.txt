Voting

The woman said that the computerzied system would never be as good as the classic system. One of the reasons she mentioned was that some people are still not used to computers and they wouldn't be able to vote with a computer. In addition to that, she thinks that computer could make even bigger mistakes than people, because computers were created by humans. Another negative point she told the audience was that the banking system had to be improved several times before it was perfect. And because the votings are not more than twice a year, it would take forever to optimize the computerized voting-system.

On the other side, critics say that the current voting system is too inefficient and inaccurate. The critics are sure that the computers would do a better job and also think that it would be much easier to vote and people wouldn't vote for the wrong candidate accidentally. Another point is that with the computerized system, the votings would rely as much on people than with the classic system. 
But at the end of the text, the autor mentioned some people that have the same opinion as the people who talked about the votings earlier before.
