During the presentation there were many arguments against a new vote sytems with computers. Per example that many people can not afford a computer and a big amount of the population is not used to work with computers. But in the essay the writer thinks that it would be easyer to vote with the technology since a lot of people vote accidentally for the wrong candidate on the sheet of paper. In addition there is a big problem with errors. On the one hand the essay says that the people who count the ballots make many mistakes and through the computer the errors get less. On the other hand the opinion of the presenter is that human error can be also in programms because humans build them. These errors are a bigger problem since a recount is impossible. This computer system is also not used so often as a bankingsystem and thats a challenge because a voting system is used once every two years. In the beginning of a system there are always some errors. Finally We have to say that the opinion of these two things are different.
