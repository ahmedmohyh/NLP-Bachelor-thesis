The question is if the old voting system in the USA should be replaced by a new one in which computers do all the work. 
The person who held the presentation is clearly against it. She thinks that using computers would be a problem for people who are not used to them. People who can't afford one for example. They could acidentally vote for the wrong person or they wouldn't vote at all because they would be scared to use something they don't know. On the other hand the articel says that it would be easier to vote because you could read the names better and you would only have to touch the name of the person you want to vote for. This would be good for people with bad eyesight.
It also says that if humans count the votes mistakes can happen very easily and to correct them you waste a lot of time. They think that with computers you wouldn't have that problem. But computers are programmed by humans which means that there can also be mistakes. And if there is a mistake in a whole programm it would have much more serious consequences and you wouldn't have the data saved somewhere to re-do the voting.
Whilst we already use computers in banking transactions and communication we don't use them in the voting system which may sound weird but you also have to consider that we have used these things for a long time. That means we have already perfected it if it didn't work perfectly in the beginning. But the people in the USA only vote nationaly every 2 years which means that the programms can't be improved easily.
