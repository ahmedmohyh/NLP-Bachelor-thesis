Both sources said that the traditional voting systems are inefficinet and that many mistaks can be made. For both sources it's clear that humans make errors when they have to count the votes one by one. The text says people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong way on the ballot, where the names are listed. It thinks that on a computerized voting system these people wouldn't make this mismarks. Also for counting the votes the computerized system would be better, because a computer would count the votes and not a human. In this point the listening disagrees with the text. It says that even the computer could make errors, because the computerized voting system is programed by humans. When humans make errors then they can make them also while programing a computer program. When the voting program has an error, thausends of votes could be miscounted or los and because the votes aren't in a physical form, there would be no chance to recount the votes. There are computer programs which are used hardly and often, for example at wallstreet. But this programs are tested every day but votings in the USA are only every two years. The listening says also that people who can't afford a computer or don't know how to use a computer can't take part of the voting or they vote not for what they wanted.
