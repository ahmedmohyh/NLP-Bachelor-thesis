Voting is one of the most important actions because it regulates who's in power of a country and many other important things, which are effecting our daily life. That's why it is extremely important to count the votes properly and always know who vote for the right person.

The text sais that the voting papers, as they are used now, can't be used anymore because mistakes will always be made. People with a poor eyesight can't see who they are voting for and may vote for the wrong person. Also the counting of the papers can easily be affected by miscounts or corruption. If there are any counting mistakes a long and expensive process of recounting has to start. The text recommends a computerized system to count the votes but  belonging to the presentation a computer based counting process would not solve the problems. In the presentation it was said that the problems would still be the same because the computer programs are written by humans and they can also do mistakes there. A mistake in the programs would also e much heavier than a mistake in the regular counting process because it can't be recounted. The presentation also shows some other problems with computer voting for example that people who don't know how to handle a computer may be feared and don't vote. 

In conclusion it can be clearly said that both named ways to do an election are not completely safe and withpout problems. The perfect way has still to be found and that can last a long time.
