Many people think that they should use cumputerized voting in the USA, because they are shure that they are more efficient and trustworthy:

Most people today get on well with computers and for them a computerized voting would be much easier than making a small mark next to their favourite candidate's name, because there are so much candidates on one sheet. But what about older people or people in general who don't use computers so much and who aren't able to vote on the computer? For them it's not that easy and they could vote wrongly.

Another aspect is that computers can count the votes much faster than humans. They also won't do as many mistakes as humans do by counting thousands of sheets. Other people don't really trust in computers, becaus also their programms are made by humans. Why shouldn't there be mistakes in programms? Then of course there would be a much bigger problem: thousands of votes miscounted. And untill a programm is perfect, you have to see the mistakes and improve and improve it on and on. But voting doesn't happen as much as you could improve anytime.

Other people are afraid of computerized voting because computers and programms could be hacked, so there would be a terrible catastrophe.
