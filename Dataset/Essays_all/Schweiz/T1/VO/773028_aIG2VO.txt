Voting systems
In the presentation heard and in the text read, the main question was: which voting system can be trusted the most - the traditional way or the computerized way. But which system is more accurate and more efficient?
The presentation showed almost the complete opposite of the text. The auther of the text lets you feel at the end that he thinks that peopple are wrong daughthing a computerized voting system. On the other hand the presentator points out all the things that could go wrong by using a computer system. For example that computer are also programmed by humans so their would be no insurance that their wouldn't be an error there. Furthermore a human error would probably be less tragical then a computer error, because if the computer is programmed wrong their would be way more wrong counts in comparison to when a human would maby miscount afew lowsy votes. An other point of the text is that it is hard for people with bad eyesight to fill out the voting sheet but the presentation explaines the contrary; how the computer system would not be very useful for everyone either, for instance people who don't have the money or some who just don't know how to use one. 
To summarise their are good points given in the text for using the computerized system but in the presentation their are also a lot of reasons stay with the traditional way. So these to diffrent inputs didn't really solve the question which system would be more accurate and more efficient, becaus one argument killed the other.
