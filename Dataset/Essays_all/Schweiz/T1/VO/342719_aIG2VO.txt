The current voting system of the United States is criticised heavily. People claim it to be inefficient and inaccurate because voters get long lists, containig many names of whom they have to pick and tick one. Poor eyesighted people easily happen to tick the wrong person. Critics now suggested a new method of voting and counting votes: by using a computer. Voters would only have to click or tap on the name they want to vote for and that would be it. The computer would count it without mistakes and much time and trouble with miscounting could be preserved. It's no surprise that there are critics for that system either. They say people who don't work with computers on a daily basis or who can't afford a computer will either be afraid of voting or won't be able to vote. Furthermore are comupters programmed by humans and humans obviously make mistakes (otherwise no new counting system would be needed), so it's no secret the computer program won't be perfect. When computers were invented and first selled they were not even near being perfect so people worked on them and improved their technique. This would be happening with the new system too but because votings are only held once every two years it would take many years to make sure everything is perfect. Is this really more efficient and worth the trouble it will bring?
