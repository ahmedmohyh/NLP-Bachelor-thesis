The lecture states that while computerized voting may be easily understood by people used to computers, those who are not will certainly be forced to adapt to something they have never really practiced so far, this might result in a decrease in votes because those people who "fear technology" will be deterred from voting if it is only possible computertizedly. The lecture further brings up the issue of human error which was mentioned in the text as being an advantage of computerized voting, since it greatly reduces the risks of said human errors occuring during the voting process, for example in the process of counting the votes. The lecture turns this against the position presented by text by raising the question whether or not human error can also manifest in the programming of computers, and goes on to mention that such a programming error very well may be much more troublesome than simple human miscalculation. Finally, the lecture also shows doubt towards the argument that computer technology is already used and being trusted daily, a fact the text mentions as being beneficial for the implementation of computerized voting, by informing the audience of fact that these technologies which for instance are used in banking transactions, were implemented  some time ago, and, more importantly, are used daily. These two facts do not apply for computerized voting, a problem which might manifest itself as follows: Since voting by computer will be a new technology, it naturally will be prone to errors in the code, as were online banking transactions in their early days, but unlike them, voting is not an everyday action in the United States, which will greatly enhance the timespan necessary to eliminate all of these errors, only rendering computerized voting as safe and socially accepted as online banking is today after decades of failure and experimentation.
