It is doubtful that the computerized voting is better than the traditional voting. It's clear that the modern system of voting is better for people who use computer every day but what about the poor people who can't afford such a machine or old people who don't really understand technology and feel under pressure because they don't get along with the new world and his fast way to move? 
It's very difficult to say which way to vote is better. The traditional voting acquires the human mind and the computerized voting depends on programmes. As a human being it happens really quick that you make a mistake counting so many votes, that wouldn't make a big deal if it is just about a few votes but if a computer makes an error, this could be lead to thousands of votes being discounted and it is almost impossible to suspect an error even though such a programme was developed by humans.
What is more is that banks for instance use a computerized system daily and heavily. Errors were surely made but because of the frequent use of computers the system had to be improved. This isn't the case with voting. Elections take place once every two years in the US and twice in a year in smaller areas. That means that the chance of making mistakes by computers is much more bigger because they are not being used as much as other daily machines so that it is not easy to decrease the amount of errors.
