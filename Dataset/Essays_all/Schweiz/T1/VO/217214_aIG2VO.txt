There are many points that say we shouldn`t use computer as a way to count votes because of several reasons.One of those reasons is that there are people who dont have a computer and because of that they can`t vote.Another reason is that there are people who have a computer but they aren`t used to computers whereas the text says there are more people not beeing able to vote for the right candidate because of a poor eyesight.The third reason that could lead to people not voting is that there will be people that fear technology so they won`t even try to vote.A point where the text and the reading contradict themselves is the aspect with the error.The text says that there are alot of errors made by the officials that count the vote whereas the lady from the lecture says that there are maybe a few mistakes when counting the votes by officials but therer will be a much bigger problem if the computer program has a major error that could lead to thousends misscounted votes.The text says that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate whereas with computers it would be easier to vote for the right candidate.Another point is that with computers if an error happens it wont be able to recount the votes because the votes are not physical.
In the end there are both pros and cons for or against voting by computers.
We will see what the future brings us.
