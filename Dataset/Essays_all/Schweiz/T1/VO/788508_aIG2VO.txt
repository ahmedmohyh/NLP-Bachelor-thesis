The computerized voting system may bemore eddicient, but it doesn't have to be more trustworthy. If they got hacked or if there occures a problem with the computer thousend of votes would get lost, so the damage of the electronic errors are far more dramatic than the human errors.
Furthermore, electric voting might be easier for people who are used to computers or have poor eyesight, but there are a many people who aren't, for example people who can't afford a computer or the aldery.
It's true that it is long and expensive to make an recount if it's necessary, but if there'san electric problem, a recount isn't even possible.
Technology is trusted daily for banking transactions and communication, but these progrmmes have been improven for a very long time. Since election is only every two years in the united states, improvement would accelerate very slowly and therefore the voting technology would not be trustworthy.
