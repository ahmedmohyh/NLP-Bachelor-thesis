There are a lot of differenes between the text and the presentation. So the text say, that computers are better than human counters, because the counters can easily make mistakes, because they have to count thousands of ballots. They also say, that compuers make less mistakes. But the women from the presentation says, that computer make on the one hand less mistakes, on the other hand, when they make mistakes they're worse. Computer programmes are designed from people, an people make errors (computers less).But when there is an error in the programm the mistake rests and goes on in the whole voting range an it is impossible to recount it. An other problem they where talking about in the text were the mistakes, that the people, who vote are making. Theycan easily make the mark on the false possition, because the sheet is so large and has so many names on it, in the tecnical version touch the false candidate or because of bad eyesight cross the false one. In the presentation they don't talk about that problems, they talk about the old people who are afraid of the new tecnology and have trouble in modern voting systems. The last toppic the presentator talks about was, how much the programm is used, if it is used daily,there are less problems than when it's only used once a week. Because you'll find the problems easier when you use it more often.
