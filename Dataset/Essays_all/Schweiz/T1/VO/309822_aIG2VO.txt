Voting
On one hand the traditional votings have some problems but it could also be possible to make mistakes on the  laptop with computerrised voting.Only people who  are used of  computers are able to do it correctly.But those who don't could make mistake and vote for the wrong persons.On the other hand the text says that  the current votings are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting votes.
The text says that people can do allot of mistakes while counting the votes because they have to count the votes one by one. And computerized systems remove the possibility of human errror, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers. The people in the presentation said that computers could do as well mistakes as humans.They are maid by people so it also has errors: And when it has en error it would be far more big: Because it could mean that thousands of counts could be miscounted. And then you have a problem because it isn't possible to recaunt the voting.
And they say that a computersystems have to be improved and improved and improved.And thats difficult when you only vote once in two years.
The text says that the government and nearly everyone use and trust the computer technology. They make banking transactions ann even communicate with highly sensitive information.In the presentation the people ask if you can fully trust the system.
They both agreed with some points the other side had.
