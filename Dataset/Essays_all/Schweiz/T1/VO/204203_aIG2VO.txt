Both texts were about voting systems and how they can be inaccurate and damaging to the results of an election.They both agree that mistakes easily happen. Human mistakes in the counting of the votes, people which accidentally vote for the wrong person because of reasons like poor eyesight and to many names on the sheet. 
With this in mind, the text would like to computerize all the voting in the US. The reasons being easier to use and the possibility of human errors decreased. That is the point, were the speaker thinks different. 
She says, that to computerize the whole voting system wouldnt work to get rid of the unaccuracy of the traditional system, because of two things.
The first one is, that there may be some people which aren't used to computers yet and maybe they are frightened by the computers. And second, she doesn't trust the people which are writing programmes. She thinks that there could be errors in the programmes as well, not only in manual counting. And with a computerbased voting, doing a recount would be impossible after her. 
But the rext too mentioned at the very end that there are people who don't trust complex computer technology and that they are doing this in other times of live.
