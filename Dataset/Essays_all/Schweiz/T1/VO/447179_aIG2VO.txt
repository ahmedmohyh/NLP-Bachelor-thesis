Generally, the text wants a new, computerized system, whereas the creators of the presentation do not want any change to take place.

One reason for computerizing  the voting system is that there would be less people who somehow vote for the wrong candidate(s). But the opponent say that people who do not have access to computers, because they cannot afford them or are not used to them would have troubles voting.

Another aspect the opponents disagree is the inefficientcy of people counting the votes by hand. In the text it is said that a computer is way faster and more efficient than a human whenit comes to counting. In addition, there would be made fewer mistakes with computers since humans cannot count millions of votes without making some mistakes. However, in the presentation it is argued that, technically, computer programs are also made by humans and therefore there would still be errors. Additinally, they say that such an error in the computer program could lead to much more severe mistakes than in the currentsystem.

Lastly, in the text it is said that technology plays an important roll in many parts of our, such as banks. So why not in voting? But their opponents say that we should consider the fact that credit cards, for example, are quite reliable, because we use them on a daily basis. Voting, however, takes place only once every two years in the US (nationally).
