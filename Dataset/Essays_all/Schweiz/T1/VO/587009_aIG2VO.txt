(Because of a technical error I only heard the last third of the presentation)

The main theme of the two texts is the voting system in the United States and if this should be changed. There is a traditionall and a modern way to count the votes. The traditional voting uses a large sheet of paper, called the ballot, and is evaluated from people while the modern system would eradicate humans of the process and replace them with computers. 

The text I've read has a oppinion against the traditional voting. It proclames that the traditional voting system is inefficicent and leads to an inaccurate counting of votes. The mistakes are made by people with poor eysight or by people who misscount the votes. Its says that all this would'nt be a thing if the voting would be computerized.

On the other hand the text we heard said  that a computerized system would not erase mistakes, because the programm would still be written by a human. And while a human would only miscount a few ballots and it can easily be redone, a computer would make a recount impossible. On top of that they say that it would'nt be rentable to change the whole system for votings who are only once in 2 years on a national base.
