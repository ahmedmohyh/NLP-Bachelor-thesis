The critics from the text say the old voting system is unefficent. Their reason is that people make mistakes to easily, some just accidently vote wrong caused through their poor eyesight and then some through those that have to count all the ballets.Of course they will make mistakes it`s almost impossible to count thousands of ballets without any mistakes. They claim for a new voting system a computerized one. The problem they maybe didnt think of is that the computers must be programmed by humans. Basically both sides argue with the same point, humans make mistakes. Possible mistakes on the computer might be made through incorrect programming which is more devastating and fatal for the election because there thousands of ballets can be lost or deleted. Not alike the current voting system where people might miss a few ballets. And surely on the computer the voters will also make mistakes. For example people that never used a computer before maybe because they`re too poor to afford one or maybe because they`re too old and dont know how to handle it an ddont understand the new technology and in the stress after being unable to figure out what to do they might just press a name and leave without knowing for whom they voted.
