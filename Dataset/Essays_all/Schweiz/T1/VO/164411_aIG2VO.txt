There are two ways to vote for elections, One way is with the traditional way with ballot an the other way is per computer. Both of them have their advantages and disadvantages. 
Computer using is very doubtful because there are people that can't afford any computer and for example old people don't have enough experience with the net and maybe they even have fear of technology. A long time ago computers didn't work flawless, human beings invented them and it's normal that there are also errors sometimes. And if there are any errors about 1000 ballets can also be lost in the nowhere. But it's also a good idea because it works very quick and you can also do this at home.
The second way to vote is by hand. There is also a chance to accidently vote wrong because there is a large sheet of paper and alot of names from the different  candidats. So it's easy to mark the wrong candidate or people with poor eyesight have it even harder. But to count the votes, it's better that people do it and not the technology. It's possible that people make some errors but at least it is nearly impossible for them to make so many errors like the computers when they have a system error. But a real problem is when an error is detected and the people have to recount all the ballets.
At least there is only one eletion in two years. And in smaller states only one.
