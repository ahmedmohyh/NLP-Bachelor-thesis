There are a lot of people who can't afford a computer so and this number is likely to be higher than the ones who just tick the wrong name. People with low eyesight could also use a magnify on a paper. There are also these people who fear technology. If the programmer of the voting system makes a mistake it is even worse than an official who makes a counting mistake, the computer systems don't remove the possibility of a human error the voters could still make one and also the programmer and if such a mistake is made it is also impossible to make a recount, because the data could be lost or incorrect because of this mistake. The other computer technologies are used every day and because of this people surly know how to deal with them. Tey were also improved every year, the voting system would only be used this rarely that it would need a long time to optimize it and getting the people used to it.
