All humans can make mistakes and so also the people who work on the programs for a new voting system. If they make a failure somewhere in their new program over a thousand votes can be wrong, and there would be not time to vote again. And it would also be very expensive to recount this vote.  
The woman in the speech also said that many computer programs has to be improved for along time over and over again. But the votes are only every four years. So it can cause many problems if the new technologie doesn't work as well as it should. It's also possible that there could be people who have no knowledge in using computers. For them it won't be that easy to vote for their candidate.
So, in contrast to the text, which says that coputerized systems would remove the possibility for human error and that the counting for the votes would be done quickly, the speech has another opinion. Also the new voting systems can have mistakes! So it would be very risk to try a vote with didn't improved technologie. But without trying it out, we have no chance to make life easier!
