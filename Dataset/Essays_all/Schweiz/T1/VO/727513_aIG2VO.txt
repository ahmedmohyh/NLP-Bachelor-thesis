Computers are programmed by humans that is why human errors are not completely gone. Furthermore if there is a mistake in the voting programm on the computer much bigger troubles will follow than if only a single ballot is miscounted. It could result in a couple thousands votes that cannot be counted. That is obviously much worse. Moreover we have to consider the ones who cannot afford a computer and the ones who do not understand todays technology. They would all not be able to vote anymore. 

In contrast to that there are also a lot of possible mistakes in the ballots. It is a large sheet of paper conataining many names with a tiny mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. On the computer it would be much easier for them because they only have to touch the candidate's name and even magnify the name for better viewing. In addition to that it does rely heavily on people to count the votes it is inevitable that they will make a mistake.
