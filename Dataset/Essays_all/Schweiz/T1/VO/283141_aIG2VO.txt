It seems like the voting system in the United States is questioned by critics for inaccurate counting votes. Some people argue about make a change from the old system with the ballots to a new, more efficient one with computer machines. But make those computers really less mistakes than humans?

A big plus point is that computers are really much faster with conting and tend to make no mistakes. A voting could be made in such a short time and it would save lots of sweat drops for those, who have to count all the votes. 

Nevertheless, computer are made by humans and humans can make mistakes. So imagine if the software is installed incorrectly or an error would pop up out of nowhere. This would be much worse than just a few wrong counted votes, because the whole voting would have to be retaken. And this would take days and much effort to bring all the voters back to the computer, to vote again.

Additionally for the elder people ot those who are not used to a computer or voting machine might have big problems to handle the new computerized system.

In my opinion, a newer system would resultt a better and more efficient voting. And there can also be assistants for those who are not used to the machine to help them how to choice their candidate. At the end it would be much  faster and more fair.
