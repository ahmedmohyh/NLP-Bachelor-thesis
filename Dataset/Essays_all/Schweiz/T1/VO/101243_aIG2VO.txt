Computerized voting may seem a good idea to some people. Those who are used to use computers may think that it's far more efficient and trustworthy to use computerized voting systems. But what about all the people that are not used to use technology like old people or what about those who can't affort to have a computer. Should they just be excluded from voting? It may be easier to find the person you want to vote for on a computer with the easy-to-use touch-screen but that's not helping you in any way if you don't understand how it works. 
Furthermore, a computerized counting system could contain an error too. It was designed by humans too and if there should be an error in the system the effort it takes to get all of these votes back is way bigger than with the traditional system. The fact that it's nowehere physically written down who voted for who and who didn't is not helping in any way.
