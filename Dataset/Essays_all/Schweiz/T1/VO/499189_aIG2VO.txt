When it comes to the procedure of how to vote with a computer or traditionally, the opinions are extremly different. The problem is, that not everyone is used to handle a computer. Like many old people aren't able to use a voting programm. A computer isn't affordable for everyone so they wouldn't have the opportunity to  vote for their prefered representer and not everyone has a computer at home. Furthermore, they expect, that with the use of modern technology to vote, some people aren't going to vote at all because of the reasons mentioned before. Human errors can be made in the process of programming and could lead to a misscount of thousends of votes.With the traditional method, a human error would cause a smaller amount. On the other side the perk of a computerprogramm is that they are very efficent compared to the old one. This efficeny can be seen in the voting proces and the counting of votes. The touch-screen technology is goood for people with bad eyesight and easier to use compared to the current voting system, where the voter has to find one single name in the ballot. Officals must count vote by vote (it's very easy to make a mistake) while a programm can do this autmatically and reliable.
