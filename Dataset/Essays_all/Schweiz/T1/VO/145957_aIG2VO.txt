According to the critics voting would be better if it were computerized. Why? Because while counting there happens mistakes made by humans. That makes the voting system inefficient. And the recouning is long and expensive.
 Also are there people with poor eyesight and they would probably mark the wrong name, because there is a long list with names and written to small.
On computer they could use the-easy- to -use touch-screen.

But on the oppisite are some studys. According to them a fully computerized voting would not be better, it may even be worse. On the one hand there are people who haven't a computer at home and are not used to deal with a computer. It might be difficult for them to vote and they may accidentally vote the wrong person. Also could they be afraid using a computer at all and may decide not to go for a voting.
On the other hand could also happen some mistakes with a computer: Computer programming is a long process and the votings are only once every two years. And the computers are programmed by humans. So there could also happens some mistakes.
And while a recounting by humans will take a few days or a week a recounting by computers are impossible. Probably they wouldn't even realize the mistakes. So there would not be any improve. This possibility is even worse than mistakes made by humans.

All in all the effort and the possible of still making worse mistakes wouldn't be any better.
