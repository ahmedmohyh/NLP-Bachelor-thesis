A huge problem in the United States is that the current voting system for, par example the election of the new president, often is inaccurate because the votes are counted by humans so it is highly possible that mistakes will be made. The proposed solution in the text is to completely computerize the whole procedure and remove human error. It is believed that because all the candidates are stacked on a sheet, people with poor eyesight perhaps miss the actual person they wanted to vote for and if you vote on a computer, marking your prefered candidate is way more easy. The counterargument in the audial presentation is that there are more people who are not used to work with computers that will get discouraged to even go vote and that would be worse than a relativly few wrong marks. The writer of the text believes that if you computerize the whole election, no error can be made and that there won't be any expensive and long recounts anymore but the audio tells us that these computerprogrammes used for the voting are also designed by humans and a mistake in the code of a programm can be way more devastating than a few missed ballots. The last argument in the text says that we use way more complex and risky computer technology every day like banking transactions but these programmes are used daily by us and when they were released they were not flawless at all. The programms for elections would be used way less and the risk of being flawed in the beginning is already too high.
