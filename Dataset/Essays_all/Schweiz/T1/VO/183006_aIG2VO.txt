Soon it's voting time again in the USA. Some people start to think about who they are going to vote, but others are more concerned about the whole voting systems. The opinions on this one are very different from each other. 
It is said that votings in the USA are poorly organized. In the traditional voting systems, people have to find the name of their preferred candidate in a very big paper, and it may happen that people accidentally vote for the wrong person out of bad eyesight or a hurry. Also, the papers and the votes have to be counted by people, and because it's so easy to make mistakes, there might have to be recounts, which are expensive and long. But would a computer-system do that better? They would detect a mistake easily, but what if they were programmed wrong in the first place? 
A mistake in programming is possible because the system would be set up by people, and it would be a lot more crucial than a mistake in counting. 
Since people in the USA are used to the long sheets with the names on it, it could be difficult for some to use a computer for the voting, especially if they rarely or never use computers in the first place because they can't afford one or just don't want to use one. These people could stop voting out of fear of technology. 
Computer systems are not perfect from the beginning, they have to be developed and improved permamently. But voting only takes place every two years, so that voting-system would not be used as much as other progammed systems. Is it nessessary to organise something new, which won't work perfeclty at the very point it is needed, when the traditional way has always worked so far?
