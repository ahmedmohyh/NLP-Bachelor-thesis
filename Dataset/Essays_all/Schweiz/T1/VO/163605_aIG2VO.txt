according to the presentation I've just heard, computerized voting has its downsides as well, opposing to what was written in the text, which promotes said form of voting. In the presentation the speaker clearly indicates her mistrust of computers instead of voting ballots by pointing out how they may scare away potential voters who don't know enough about computers, even though the text indicates that computers would make voting much easier by only having to click on the name of one's desired candidate. Another critcism is on the human error, which in the written text was responsible for a tremendous amount of misvotes, simply due to the fact that one may cast their cross on the wrong candidates name. Now the speaker's point was that computers as well are built and programmed by humans, meaning that there may be faults as well, which would be far more devastating if not just a few hundred votes were cast wrong, but maybe all of them. Also there would be no physical record of these votes, which would make a reevaluation impossible. In the text it also says that people are concerned about using computer programms for such an important event, even though people trust such programms each and every day making banking transactions etc. The speaker discredits these arguments by saying that in the beginning those programms didn't work flawlessly either, and that votes only happen once every two years, so having a mistake at such a rare occurance would be unthinkable.
