One problem of computer voting is that old people, who are not used to work on computers, don't know how to vote. It's the fear of computers, that leads them to vote all the candidates or vote the worng one. The text said, that the selection on a piece of paper is also not a good idea. Because the list with names for the selection is to big, so old people can't read the names that good. It leads to wrong votings. The problem with the aged people can not be defeated, beacuse selections starts tiwce a year. So the people can't learn to select right and with a computer. So the people can't fully trust the selection. This leads to wrong or missing votings. An other problem from the presentation is that the programs for the computer to count the votings is written by an human. Is there a problem in the program that counts the voting wrong. In this case the selection is more wrong than a human is counting the selections. The text said, that selections counted by humans is inefficiant and leads to inaccurate counting of votes. So both of these methodes aren't the best. Both can cause wrong counting by human error. The text is not the same opinion. It says that computer remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computer. And that in other govermment stuff they trust in computer programs too. So why not in selection counting.
