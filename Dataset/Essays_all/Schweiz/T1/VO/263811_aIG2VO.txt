First of all it is a problem that many people vote for the wrong candidate, for example if get the sheet and just can't read the name or misspick a name. But on the other side many people got a fear of technology, that means that many people won't be able to vote on the computer because they don't understand how to use them or they don't even have a computer. The text says, that people do more mistakes than computers and that we can trust computers more than people, for example the E-banking accounts. That's true, a computer just does what you say him to do but on the other side computers are just programmed by people, so you can't be 100% sure that there is no mistake in the program. Onlinebanking-accounts are in use everyday of millions of people and it needed a long test phase to trust them. A voting program you would just use twice a year in some states oder all two years for the national votes and if there are any mistakes in the program, there is no option to control it.

[I got too much time] 

At the end we got two different kind of people: those who trust the new computertechnology and those who don't. I think in future, with the new "smartphone-generation" it will change to a computervotingsystem anyways, I imagine you can download an app. There you see the pictures of the different candidates with a name and you just have to click the picture and access your choice and your idendity. I think at the end trust a computerprogram is less risky then trust corrupt people...
