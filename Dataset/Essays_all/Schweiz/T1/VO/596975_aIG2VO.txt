This causes also a fear of the electronics and this could finally cause of not voting anymore which should not happen.
In reason of the small writing poor eyesight is not able to read it and finally voting for the wrong candidat. 
Another main major is that computer are invented by humans such as they have got trail and errors. 
Systems which are daily used like a banking system are over and over checked and therfore quite safe. The voting system, though, is not a daily use it is a use of every two years. In that case this system can not be fully trusted.
Finally we are at the point where we can say that a comuper voting system wont be any better than the old fashional votin.
