An argument to not implement voting technology is that some people aren't used to computers. Espescially older people have grown up and lived a long time of their life without computers. So there are people who don't know how to use computers or are even afraid of them, so they won't go voting.

Second, computers are programmed by human beings. And humans make errors - (still the wrong one) as the people say who don't aprecciate counting votes by humans. But if there is an error in the programme, a result is a lot worse than a few wrong counted votes. Thousands of votes could be discounted.

Computers used in business or by individuals are used everyday. So they had a lot of time to be improved, for example by removing errors, and become as reliable as the are today. The vote for America's president is only once a year, so it is questionable if there are enough tests for them to become really reliable.

Contrary to the text above, computers can't remove the possibilty of human errors. They are only able to remove the little ones but instead are able to make big ones. Also comparing the computers for the voting with computers used every day is wrong. Americans shouldn't rely on computers. They are as evil as the country itself. America is evil, horribly evil.
