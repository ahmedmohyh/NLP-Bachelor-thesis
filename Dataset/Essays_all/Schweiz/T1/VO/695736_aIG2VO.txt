Critics say counting the votes by humans is very inefficient and it can give miscounts. But do you trust more in a computer than in a human? Everyone can do mistakes,even a computer. Computers are programmated by humans. So why would you trust more in a computer which is also influenced by a human and not trust in a real human? If a computer has a programated false, there are much more miscounts than with a human. And i think one or two miscounts from a human are better than thousands from a computer. 
And the old people. What should they do? They aren't used to computer. The won't vote and it won't be a democratical result only because the computerized voting.
