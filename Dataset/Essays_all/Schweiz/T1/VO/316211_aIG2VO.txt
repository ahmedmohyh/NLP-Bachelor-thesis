So the text is for computerised voting and the woman, who held the lecture is against computerised voting. There are two arguments that are for the new computer technology. The first argument is that people make mistakes when they vote for their candidate. The ballot contains to many names for people with poor eyesight. They say that people would make less mistakes on computers. The second argument is that the old voting system relys heavily on people to count the votes and because officials have to count thousands of ballots they easily make mistakes. The computer in contrast removes the possibility of human error and the chance that computers would make mistakes is practically zero.
The woman used the same arguments against the coputerised voting. She said that it's true, that humans make a couple of mistakes but if a computer makes a mistakte it could be devastating, because it could count thousands of votes the wrong way. After all computers are programmed by humans and as we know humans make mistakes. 
The woman said that people who are not used to coputers would have problems using it and are more likely to make mistakes then using a traditional ballot. For elderly people it would be harder to vote on coputers.
