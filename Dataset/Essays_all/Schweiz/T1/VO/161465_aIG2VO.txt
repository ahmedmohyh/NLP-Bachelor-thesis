My following text is about voting and the mistakes that can happen while counting the votes.
I learned that it's not such a brilliant idea to make the people vote just by their computers because some people can't afford them or they don't know how to use them. This can cause problems. 
If computers count the votes it can be that there is an error in the computerprogram, caused by a human, and that's why it can be that there's a fatal mistake in the end of voting. Despite tecnology we can't then see the error and so can't solve the problem. If humans have to count the ballots it can happen that they don't see some votes, but if a computer has a mistake in the program the mistake is anyway big.
I don't think that the film sequence agreed with the part of the text wich says that if an error is detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place. I reckon they don't recount everything but rather leave the mistakes, because maiking mistakes is humanous.
Just after that the text says that computerized systemes remove the possibility of human error, and this isn't true either. It's possible that computers make mistakes because firstly, they were made by humans.
