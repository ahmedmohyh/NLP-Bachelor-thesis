The current voting system is inefficient, because it leads to inaccurate counting votes. Officials have to count up the votes one by one. It is easily to miss some votes or to count wrong. And the ballot is not very efficient either, because the paper contains a lot of names with a small mark next to the names and people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. 

The computerized voting is more efficient. They have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. To cast a vote, one needs to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate. Computerized systems remove the possibility of human error. The problem is that not everyone uses a computer on a daily basis. Some people do not even know how to use a computer. And not everyone can afford a computer. After all a computer is made by humans and humans make mistakes. So it might be possible that the computerized system may have some errors. There are a lot of computerized systems like banking transaction that work perfectly. But at the beginning none of them worked perfectly. And if a computer makes a mistake whilst countig the votes, the mistake might be huge. It is also very risky to implement complicated voting technology nationalwide.
