Whilst in the text passage and the speech was mentioned that human make mistakes, the oppinions seperated about the trustwrothiness of a computer. The speaker made clear that if we state, humans are not perfect, how can we be sure about the accuracy of a computer program, which has been created by a person? 

Also does she mention that if there occurs an error in the program, there is going to be an immense problem, since there is no physical record of the votes and a recount will not be possible. The critics on the other hand side say that if people make a mistake by counting the votes mannualy, which happens more often then it is noticed, even though a recount is possible, it costs a lot of money. Computers have shown us their potential in the daily life where we trust them with our money and personal information. This might be a reason why to change the voting system. But if wetake a look at how it was the time banks got introduced to computers, it will show that during the first period there were lots of problems coming with it and only due to professionals that improved the programs over a long time we can now rely on them. If it wasn't for our daily contact wit it, it is not secure if we would be confident by using it. 

Clear is that both systems - the traditional and the modern one - do have their faults and it can always be possible for mistakes to happen. Only that we are used to the old one and nevertheless everybody is able to afford it. The question is, is it better to stick to what we know, or should we put our faith into progress and trust today's knowledge of computers?
