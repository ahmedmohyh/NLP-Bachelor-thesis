In the text and also in the before heared presentation the subject about the voting system in the USA and the whole America. They are quite similar. In both texts you hear/read about the pros and cons of the voting, expectually they said the pros and cons of computer voting verses the traditional hand voting . The negative thing about the computer voting is that you have a lot of older people, which don't have the knowledge of computers and so the often make mistakes in their votes. An other big problem with the computers are that they thousends of counts can be hacked and you can't make a recount like in the handed votes. But the pros are that its very hard for an counter to count all the votes. And every counter can makes mistakes, because they are humans and make mistakes like every human. It's quite normaly to make mistakes and it aslo not depends a lot, if you dont count a less of votes. An other problem, which is only founded in the written text ist some guys can't read the writing of the vote on the votepaper. 

At the end the say in both situations, that for some people it's better to vote on the computer and some want still to vote traditionally. A voting is also not very often. I think the speaker said, it is once in two years nationaly.
