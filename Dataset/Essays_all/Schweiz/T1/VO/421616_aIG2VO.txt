It may seem easy to give your vote on a computer, but it isn't if you're not used to work with computers. There are many people in the United States that can't afford a computer or simply aren't in the need of a computer. For those people the new voting system would be very difficult and confusing. 
A problem in the voting system today is that there are too many mistakes made in the process of counting the ballots. But would this problem dissappear in the computerized voting system? Because after all the new system would be programmed by humans.If a mistake happens there is no option such as recounting all the ballots as it is possible in todays system. 
The other big problem that goes with the new computerized voting system is that there is nearly no improvement allowed, due to the few times this systems is actually used. Banking programms are used on a daily basis what allows them to improve regularly, which is not the case with the voting system since this is only used every 2 years.
