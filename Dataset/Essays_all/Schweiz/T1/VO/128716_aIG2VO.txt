It is a problem to count the votes in the USA accurate, because it's natural that human make mistakes. But would it be better to replace humans by computers? No, because even computers make mistakes and they can be even more heavy than a misscount of just a few votes made by humans. Furthermore computers are produced by humans and if they make mistankes, the computer will do it as well. Using a computer might be easy for people who are used to computers, but of course there are also these people who have problems by using a computer. Basically they say that if humans misscount the votes you can just recount them or it's not heavy because it would be just a small misscount, but if a computer has a problem and misscounts the votes it's more difficult to find it out and to correct the voting. 

In the text is mentioned that the main reason of inaccurate voting is that the people who vote, mark the wrong name because the maybe don't see well enough. It also says that the traditional systems should be replaced by a new and better voting system on a computer.

The main difference between the text and the listening is that in the text the writer prefers a computerized voting system and in the listenting they say that even computers make mistakes which can eventually be more heavily than those which are made by humans.
