Voting is a very important topic in a our modern democratic world. As voting can lead to a change of the whole governement, there should be no mistakes. 

As we heard, computer aren't the easiest thing to operate, especially for older people and for people not used to the technology. Some voters might even be completely turned away from voting on a computer. This counters the argument being made that people with poor eyesight are being confused by the amount of names and the tiny writing of the ballot, which can lead to people making a mark at the wrong spot. 
Secondly, we heard that the possibility of human error can not totally be avoided as computers are programmed by humans. This might even lead to bigger mistakes than just miscounting one or two ballots and might cause the people to vote twice. This is entirely different from what's being said in the text above, as they do not think a prgramming mistake would take place. 
Finally, we heard that the technology we rely on on a daily basis are being used so often and for such a long time that they are almost certainly working without mistake. But they weren't perfect when they initially came out. As voting systems are barely used every second year, they wouldn't be without error.
