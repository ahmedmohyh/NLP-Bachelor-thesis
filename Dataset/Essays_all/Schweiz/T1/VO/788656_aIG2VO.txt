The main difference between the speech and the text is that the arguments of the speech are against voting on computers, while the text wants the old voting system to be replaced by an electronical voting system. The main argument of the speech is that there are people that are not used to computers and an electronical voting system could lead to wrong votes or it could even discourage these people to vote at all. In the text an argument says quite the opposite, because there are also people who don't see very well and on the ballot (the votingsheet) the names of the candidates are written quite small, so there are good chances that these people will mark the wrong candidate. So the arguments are both times about if the voting systems are reliable or not.
A further argument in the text is that the couting of the votes in the old system is very likely to have meany mistakes in it, because officials have to count the votes one by one. On the other hand theres the argument in the speech that computers can make mistakes aswell, and if they do mistakes they can be way more fatal then the ones in the old voting system. And in addition the votingprogram on the computer would be created by humans aswell. So if they do make mistakes already in the programming part the voting will be counted all wrong. 
The last point that is brought up in the speech is the one that all these computerprograms for banking things for example weren't very well at first. They improved over the time and as they are used everyday mistakes can be found easily, but the voting only happens every two years, so it would take to long tohave a reliable program. In the text the banking argument was used for the new voting system, because we all trust these programs so why shouldn't we trust an electronical votig system?
