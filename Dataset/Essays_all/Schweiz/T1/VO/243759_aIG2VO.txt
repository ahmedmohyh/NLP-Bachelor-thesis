In the text we read that the current voting system in the United States lacks on security and efficency. They suggest that the voting system is improved by new technology and less people's help. But in the presentation we just heard there are many arguments against the whole technology thing. 

The first argument that was mentioned was that people who aren't used to computers would have big problems with the new voting system. These people don't know how they work or can't effort computers. This leads to that people can't vote or even are affraid to vote because of the new technology. People from the opposite side, argue that the paper for voting contains to many names, what leads to voting for the wrong person.
Computers should replace the people that count the votes, because people often make mistakes. But people against the Computers say that computers can
break down and make much bigger mistakes than humans. Also they say that the argument that computers are also used in banking transaction or as communication of highly sensitive information. An argument against it is that these programms are used on a daily basis and had to be improved many times. Elections that take place every two years or so are to rarely for seeing how good these programms are.

In the end we can say that a good mix between technology and human help are perfect for the voting system. Because then both sides computers but also humans can controll each other and so eliminate mistakes in such a important matter.
