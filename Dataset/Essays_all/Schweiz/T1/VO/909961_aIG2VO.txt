The current voting system in the United States has been citised for being inefficient and offen inaccurate due to human error in voting and in vote counting. One of the main problems is voters accidentaly voting for the wrong candidate. This is probably due to the difficulty of finding the write name on a large voting ballot containing many names. That is why it has been proposed to computerise the voting system. Computerised voting could not rule out the possibility of error, as computer programs are written by people. If such an error slipped throug, the consequences would be of significantly larger scale. Furthermore, the lack of physical voting ballots would make a recount impossible. Computer technology has been used successfully for other purposes, such as banking transactions, however, these systems were not perfect the first time they were implemented. It took years of trial and error to improve and perfect these systems over time. Voting on a national scale in the United States only occurs once in every four years. There wouldn't be many possibilities to detect erros and improve the system. It would have to work the first time round.
