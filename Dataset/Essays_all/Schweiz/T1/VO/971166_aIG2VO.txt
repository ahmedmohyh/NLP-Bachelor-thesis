In the record they said that the problem with the traditional system is the counting of the votes. The people who count them have to go through thousands of ballots and write the votes down. It's clear that there will happen a lot of mistakes. But they also said that if a program is set up there are as well many small mistakes in the program and these mistakes show up with every single vote. That the technology didn't work properly happened also in the past when they've come up with online banking and stuff like that. But the difference between the electrical banking and the electrical voting is that the voting program is only needed once in two years nation wide and the banking program daily. This is the reason why the mistake in the banking program can be detected and corrected very fast and the voting program can be improved very slowly.
