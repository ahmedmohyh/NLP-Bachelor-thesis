Voting
In the written text there is written, that many people thinks it's better to vote with the computer, because when we will wirite it on sheets which is the old tradition, there is a big chance that it will happen a human error. But on the other hand, in the speech the oppinion is that people who aren't so good with handle a computer, they have a big problem and it's easy for them to click on the wrong button. Also there is a big problem when something is wrong with the programme on the computer, there can be thousands of wrong votes, but as we know when you can handle a computer it is very trusworthy. In a big land like USA it is also very difficult and inefficient with sheets, that everyone gets, you have to write on these ballots and to give them back in your city and the gouvernmant and some other big politicans will count these votes. In this case it is more easy to click, vote your favourite on the computer and send it directly to the voteoffice. In both, text and presentation the oppinion is, that it will be more easy with the computer but in the speech there is written, there are many people who can not handle with computers and thats a bad point, because so it's not possible for everyone to vote at home and on free oppinion. In some case the system on the computer is unluckely not that good, it can be hacked and the informations can be splitted all over the world, but nearly all the time it is very trustfully.
