As the opinion in the text is, that comuterized voting would be better, the listening part says the exactly different thing. In the text it says, that the problem of traditional voting is, that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because of bad eyesight for example. Computerized voting would have an easy-to-use touch-screen, so less mistakes should be made. But in the listening part it says that people make maybe even more mistakes on computers, because they don't use the computer daily and aren't used to or don't even have the money to afford a computer. Another probelm the compurized voting supporters mention is that people who count the ballots make a lot of mistakes because there are so many. But others say, that the computer can make even more massive problems than people. The things we use daily on our computer weren't flawless from the beginning on, but they improved from time to time. A programm for comuterized voting would be used only every second year
