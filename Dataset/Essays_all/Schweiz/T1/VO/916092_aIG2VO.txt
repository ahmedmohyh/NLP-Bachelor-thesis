The woman, which is holding a speech, is against the computerized voting. She explains that it would be good and easier for people who are used to computers, but not for people who don't understand them. It is imaginable that those people would easily vote wrong. It is not proofed that computers would count the votes better than humans, such as computer programs are made by humans. If anybody would made a mistake in programming a voting system, it would have a much worse effect than if anybody would miscount some marked names, specially because the people only vote once every two years.
Critics say that the traditional voting systems which are used in the United States are inefficient and they lead to an inaccurate result. Many citizens accidentally vote for a wrong candidate because they receive a large sheet containing many names. They easily mark a wrong name, specially people with poor eyesight. Another problem is that you have to count the votes one by one, what leads to human mistakes. To detect and correct those it needs a lot of time.
