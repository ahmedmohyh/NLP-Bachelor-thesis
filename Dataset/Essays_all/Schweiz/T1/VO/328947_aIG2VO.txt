When you want to vote you have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper. The problem of computerized voting is that the people who don't use computers every day don't know how to use it. There are some old people who have fear of technology. But for the young generation is way much easier to handle a computer. The next thing is that we human make some mistakes and that is normal. But the problem could be when you use a computer program that counts the voting can have a mistake. Probably the person who made the program could make an mistake accidentally. The result would be that the program miscount 1000 votes or delete them. So therefore we never can be hundred per-cent sure if the computers count the voting correctly. And the people wouldn't have any trust to computerized voting. In bank they also use a computer program to count the amount of the money. But here the advantage is that they use it every day and there is a low risk that there are some mistakes. Because they have to improve the program. But the program that you use during the election time is not used very often. Only once in 2 years. Therefore the risk is high of having mistakes. In the text is said that a voter need only to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate but not every touches rightly.
