The thema is the voting system in de USA. Ther are two diffrent oppinions about the system. The text has a positiv mind to change it and the 'Vortrag' want to stay with this traditional system.

For those how use technologie it will be much easyer but there are also persons in the USA how don't use computers. So the woman says that because of that many persons would stop voting oder would vote for the wrong person. In contrast the text says that the computer is much easyer to use 'cause of his easy-to-use-touch-screen technology. Also says the text that is very difficult to count the votes. 
In oppostit of that quote the woman is asking us: So are we sure that the computer is working? Normaly we use bank machines etc. each day but they had to be improve until they were as good as tehy are now. The voting machine will be only used once in 2 years. 100000 votes could get lose. In computer can't be fully trusted.
