The most people are not convinced with the system how to vote in the United States. 
It happens fast that somebody is voting for the wrong person. For the people who do not see very well is the traditional voting difficult. Then with this system you have all the name on the list and the letters are not very big so it can happen fast that people with poor eyesight mark the wrong name. After that they had the idea to vote on the  computer. Then you can make a better viewing  and for people who often use the compuer is it easy to vote by that. You just have to touch the name on the computer and then you have vote for the candidate. Bu for people who are not often use the computer is this very difficult. And just because this is a computer is this not a reason that the computer do not make any mistakes. 
Human make mistakes. This is normally but a computer is made by a human so a computer can also make mistakes. It has not a garantie. But you have to say with the computer has the result from the voting faster then when humans are counting. Then a computer can count automaticcaly.
But even if the computer count right the problem that people touch the wrong name because they are under pressure or just not comfortabe with this system are here. They need a system with them they are comfortable and is easy.
