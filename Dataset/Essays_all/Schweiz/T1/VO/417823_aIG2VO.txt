During the lecture the main topic was, how would a computer based election in the United States of America compare to the traditional voting system. With computers, on which the voting system would bedone on , would  only be easier for the people that actually have a computer at home or are used to use an computer. But form the text, a point that was mentient that older people could magnify the list with the votings on it, but can elderly people actually all use a computer? Also a big part of the discussion was that a human error in the traditional form of voting would be far less of a tragedy , because they would only miss some of the votes under thousands, and a human error in a programm that would count all the votes would be far more severe than an actual count by a human. Also in the case of a problem the votes on a computer wouldn't be able to be brought back and a whole election state could be affected and they would have to redo the election. In the occurance of an error by a human during the traditional way, the redo of a count by hand could be done easier because all the votes are on paper and stored.  But the most important point in the discussion was that the tradiitonal way of an election was developed a long time ago and improved over years and years. With a new type of electronic election this kind of election has to be improved year by year because seen in every day life that technology has to be improved in order to function properly. But we already rely heavily on technology in example the whole banking system is technologic advanced and the communication of highly sensitive information was also tested and improved over the years of excistense.
