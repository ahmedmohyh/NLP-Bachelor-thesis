In the audio extract is said that we shouldn't trust computers, even if they facilitate our lives. It would be a mistake to replace the traditional voting system with a new, computerized system. In the text is mentioned that we should replace the traditional system, because the traditional one is to complicated. 

A major point in the speech heard is that computers aren't safe. Even if a program can be really safe and trustworthy, it is made by humans, and one single mistake could easily give many wrong votes. On the other hand it is mentioned in the text, that the traditional system is really inefficient, because all votes need to be count by hand, and because there are so many of them, there are surely many mistakes made by the vote counter. It is also said that the ballot is a huge sheet with many small names on it. It could easily happen to someone with weak eyes to put a cross in front of the wrong name. 

In the speech was also said that many people will be confused by the computer programm. There are many people who can't afford a computer or don't own one and don't know how to use a computer. But the text says that the computer programm will be easy and safe to use, there would even be the possibility to zoom for people who don't see very well or so. It just needs one click to give a vote to the person you want to vote for.

Another point mentioned in the speech was the comparison with e-banking systems and stuff like that. It was said thatwe trust them now because they run at a daily base and are improved every day. In the beginning there were many problems with the e-banking, but it got goot within many years. The program for voting woud run two times a year and wouldn't get the chance to be improved. The text asks why we wouldn't trust a computerized voting system. E-Banking and other things are working perfectly and we trust in them.

To sum up all points we should trust in computerized systems because they are safer.
