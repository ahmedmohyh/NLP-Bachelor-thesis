In the text they say that it is easyier to use a computer to vote for your candidate because you don't need to find the name of the candidate on a large sheet of paper. But the women mentioned that there are also people who haven't a computer or who can't handle them because they are not familiar with computers and this could be much more dangerous because those people could not use computers to vote for their candidates. She said that there are also people who have fear from technology, so those people doesn't want to vote with a computer. In the text they also said that it is much better to trust a computer by counting the results than to trust a human because computers doesn't make mistakes by counting the votes. But the women disagreed and said that computers are programmed by humans and that they can also make mistakes. She also said that a mistake which is made by a computer (an error) is much more dangerous than a mistake which is made by humans because if an human makes a mistake you can easely count the votes again but if a computer makes a mistake you can not count the votes again because you lost the votes. In the text they said that we use computers every day for banking transactions and to communicate sensitve informations so why should't we use them for voting? The women said that there is a difference between using computers for banking transactions and use them to vote because it was an long process to use computers for banking transactions and now they can use it every day. But with voting it is different because you can only vote once every two year so it is much more difficult to see problems because you don't make it every day.
