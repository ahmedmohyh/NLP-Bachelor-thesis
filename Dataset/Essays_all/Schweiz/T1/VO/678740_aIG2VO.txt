The United State would like to replace the new voting system on technology base with the old traditional voting.The technology voting should be more efficient and should make few mistakes than the traditional couting of the ballots. One disadvantage of the tradtional voting sytem is that the when you count the ballots by hand they could miss few ballots or make mistakes when they count it. On the other side, using the computer for a vote could be difficult for people, who didn't use the computer often, so the people would have technology trouble and click on the wrong thing. 
Contrary to the person who has presented the textpassage didn't show us the importance of the voting system in the USA. That one person can only vote one time in two years. So it's important that the person vote for the right person. 
In the presentation they diddn't mention that the computer technology voting could be risky. They hide the fact that someonce could cheating or something like this.
