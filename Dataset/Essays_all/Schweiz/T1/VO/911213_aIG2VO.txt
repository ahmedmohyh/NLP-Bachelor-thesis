Sympathisants of the computer voting system think, that the current voting system in the United States is inefficient and inaccurate in counting. People with bad eyesight could mark the wrong name on the list, which could be made easier by touch-screen technology. The problem is that there are people who aren't familiar with computers and could have issues with this voting system too.
Counting is obviously also very important when it comes to voting. Since there are still humans making the countings, it's possible that they make a mistake while counting the thousands of votes. This problem should be improved by computers, which shouldn't have any problems with counting all the votes. Computers can also count faster than humans. In contrast computers are programmed by humans, so it's possible that someone made a mistake by programming the computer. If a computer causes an error, there's much more damage done, than a human making a mistake.
Computer systems today are save enough, for example all banking transactions can be done with computers. This system developed over years and is used every day. Votings are only twice a year, so the system would need a long time to be perfectly developed.
