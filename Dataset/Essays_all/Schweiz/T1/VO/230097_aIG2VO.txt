In contrast to the text, the lecturer heavily speaks out against a computerized voting. The lecturer suggest that it's doubtful if computerized voting really is easier. While the text thinks it is easier because on computers you can zoom in and search for the ballot more properly, the lecturer says that for people who are not familiar with modern technology, it can cause confusion and may lead to more mistakes being made.
The lecturer agrees with the text that people can make mistakes, but tells that in such cases a recount can be done. When there are problems caused by the computer system recounts can't be redone and the mistakes are often much bigger.
Computerized voting is said to be too risky, and so thinks the lecturer. It's true that computer technology is used everyday also in really trustworhy actions as the text implements, but the lecturer arguments that it took a long time for it to develop to a point where it can be considered safe and voting must be safe and it should not be experimented with it.
