The people, who want to introduce a new voting system in the USA, say that the traditional system isn't trustworthy and many errors can occur. People with poor eyesight might not see for which canditate they're voting. But if people vote with help of new technology, users with disabilities can e.g. magnify the text on the computer screen. But the critisists think that there are way more US-Americans, that have never really used a computer and it will be hard for them to learn how this new voting sytem works. On the other hand one could also say that with an electronic voting system human errors will be gone and there will no longer be unnecessary recounts and the result would be faster calculated than humans have ever done. But a computer system is programmed by humans and there may occur errors in the process of programming and the impact of these errors could be way worse than when an error occurs in the traditional system. Because in the new voting system the votes of all the people are stores electronically and can't be restored in case of a system shutdown. Finally one could say that voting on computers will be the future, but we should adopt this system when it's perfect and no errors can occur anymore. But will this ever happen? We will see.
