In the lecture it is said that the computerized voting system is not better than the traditional voting system. Firstly, a lot of people cannot afford a computer and doesnt know how to handle it. So they may choose the wrong name or they even do not elect because their fear of technology hold them back. The text contradicts: It should be easier on the computer because people just have to touch the candidates name on the screen.
In the traditional voting system people have to find the name on a long list and mark it.
Secondly, computers are machines which are made by humans. Therefore they contain human errors. If a programme contains an error it is much worse, than if some official misscount the votes, because this error leads to a miscounting of thousands of votes.
Thirdly, nowadays people trust technology in their daily life. For example they use it for banking transactions. It must be said that they did not worked flawlessly at the beginning but they were developped step by step. It is much more difficult to improve the computerized voting system because elections do not take place that often.
