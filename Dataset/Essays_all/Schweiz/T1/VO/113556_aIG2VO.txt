People who aren't comfortable with computers have problems with the computerised voting, for especcialy older ones. Sure for people like us it is easy because we know how to handle it. But if there is any failure in the programm it can manipulate the voting and because of that it is risky. In the USA are they only voting once in two years so it has a value and can chance the governement system. The internet is used dayly so they are better in working out programms but that doesn't mean it could have an error in it. On the internet it is easier to vote because you can only click the candidate you vote for. On the ballot it is more difficult or you can do something wrong because of the many names and the structure. The reading and the listenig are like opposite opinions. 

The most important thing of voting is the count of it. On the computer it does that by itself and if you're doing it with thousands of ballots and counting them through. You need much more time to do it and it also coulg go something wrong. The somputer system is removing human errors but we can't really remove coputer error. Maybe you have to do the voting again and I'm sure not everyone would vote again. 
So in the end both have it's good and bad sides and you have to be selfconfident in wich way you want to vote. So be attentif and in the end on both ways anything could have gone wrong. And note this: You're only voting for yourself und you need to be sure how you want to handle it.
