Bruh.... I forgot everything that I heard and I am to lazy to read the article again... BUT I'll try

It's about voting. In the past if there was a voting they had to do it manually.That was very difficult and very hard. Today it is much easier than the pass bacause we have the technologie.  With computer programms we can result the votings much faster and more exactly. In the pass there was also many mistakes of resulting the votes. It was easy to skip one voter or more than that. But there are also negative points like mistakes in the programm. We are human our task is to make mistakes. But we have to learn from the mistakes. (Then a mistake ist just then a mistake if you don't correct the mistake). And when human do mistakes than it is normal when the computer it also do because computer are human made.
Finally I think the callculation with compter programms ist much better then manually. Because we are faster and better.
