The presentation opposed pretty much every point made by the written text.

First off it mentiones that while computers are better for people that are used to them, they are worse for those who aren't. People who are not used to technology will easily be able to make mistakes or not show up to the ellection at all out of fear of technology.

The second point was made against the argument that humans can make mistakes. The woman sugests that it's true that humans make mistakes, but computers can still make them. They're programed by humans after all. And not only that, but a mistake in the program would lead to much bigger problems. A human will only miss one or two votes, but a computer can give thousands of votes to the wrong candidate or delete them alltogether. Since many computerized voting systems don't use physical documents those votes would be completely lost and the whole vote would have to be repeated.

The third and last point opposed the idea that we use the same kind of modern technology every day, thus the trust towards these technologies should already ben given. The things mentioned in the written text, namely banking transactions and communication, we use every day. When they were first introduced they didn't really work and had to be improved upon and improved upon. But that won't be possible with a program written for ellections since they only happen every two years in America.
