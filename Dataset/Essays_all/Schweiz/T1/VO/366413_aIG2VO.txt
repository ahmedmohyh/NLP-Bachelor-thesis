Can we trust the computersystems for counting by the elections? There are many critics who say that currentvoting system used in the United States are inefficient and often not true because of the mistakes of counting.
The biggest problem by the election is that many people accidentally vote for the wrong persons. The critics likes to have the older system with the sheet of contaning many names.  But also this systems has the same troubles. People with poor eyesight can mark the wrong name.
The new computer system is very easy to use by people who are used to computer. The people who can not use computer has much troubles with the new system and mostly are fearof tecnology. You can easilly clik on the wrong name. 
This is a computer programm made by humans. If the programm gets an error thy could lose many votings and it gives a dfalsresult. The problem is that they do not have any physical results and so they can not get the lost votings back. This program is not as profed as the program used by the bank or in other business because they use their program daily and correct it all the time. the program of the voting is used twice a year.
