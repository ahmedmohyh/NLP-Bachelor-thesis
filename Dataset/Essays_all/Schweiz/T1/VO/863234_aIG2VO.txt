In the lecture they where talking about the problems of the new election-system. They think that people who don't have a knowledge of computers or even have a fear of tehnology may have troubles for giving their vote. But what's about the people who have trouble with the traditionally voting sheet? People who have problem with their eyes? These people would now have a chance to give their correct vote.  The other point was human-error. It's something that also happened in the traditionally way of voting, but with the new technology, human error would be far more bad. Cause just a wrong line in the programm could end up with thousands of wrong votes. Cause computer-programms are often improved after some time, but the elections are just once in 4 years, so there isn't no time to improve errors or bugs.
