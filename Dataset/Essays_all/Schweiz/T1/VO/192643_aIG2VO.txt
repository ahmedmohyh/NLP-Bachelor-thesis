Computerized voting sounds like a very good idea if you only read the text. In the text it says, that computerized voting would be more save, because its more unlikely, that a program makes a mistake. The voting is inefficiant they say. The are human errors in each voting based on voting for the wrong canditad to those counting the votes. Both the text and lecture say this sentence: We use computerized stuff every day and no person makes a deal about it. But the lecture shows some of the other sides. The are many people not used to technology. That can be because they cannot afford a computer or they simply do not use it. There are even people affraid of it. Would it really be better to vote on a computer to remove the human errror? The women that gave the lecture said no, because computers are programed by humans as well, so you could never miss the human error and the human impact on it. She also says, that those other computerized things like bank transactions did not started flawless. But they were used heavily so that errors could be found and removed. It would be much harder to remove failures from a programm that would be used once in two years.
