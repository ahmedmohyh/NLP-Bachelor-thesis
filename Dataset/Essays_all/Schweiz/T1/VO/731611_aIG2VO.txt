There are critics saying that the current voting system in the United States is inefficient and often leads to inaccurate counting of the votes. They argue that one of the major causes of inaccuracy is people accidently voting for a wrong candidate. The other Problem they mention is that the votes are counted by humans and since these humans have to deal with thousends of ballots it's not surprising that they make mistakes. They say that these two problems could easily be solved by replacing the traditional voting system with a new computerized one. This new system would be much more efficient and more trustworthy. 

In the presentation they say that computers replacing the traditional voting system would'nt be better. Infact they could make much bigger mistakes. They argue that computerized voting systems would have to be programmed by humans and because of that the chance that there's a mistake in the program is not little.
In addition the nationwide votings aren't but once a year. 

The people who want the current voting system to be replaced say that everyone is trusting computer technology for many things such as banking transactions. Why wouldn't they trust a computerized voting system?
