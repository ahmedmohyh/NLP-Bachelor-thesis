Voting system

People are trying to chance the voting system from the old way to a computerized version, saying that it would be way more efficient, trustworthy and accurate. But there are a few points who speak against that. People who are  not used to computers or can't afford one would be in a worse situation than before. But the text says, that the computers are easy to use but still the problem with not being able to afford one is still there. Another critical point is that a recount wouldn't be possible because there is no physical version of the vote. If something goes wrong, all the votes would probably be lost. On that note the text says the all the work is done automatically and there is no chance of human error which is also critisized again: The computers are programmed by peolpe and peolpe are not flawless. Computer programmers can make mistakes just like the peolpe who are counting the votes. Even a tiny error can damage the whole voting. But regarding the trust on computers in many other areas is showing that it would work perfectly with the voting too.
