The by far biggest argument against the computerized voting is that the counting of votes could be inaccurate.Those against the current voting system argue, that the votes have to be counted by hand, from a lot of ballots with many names on it. The people how count these votes could easily make a mistake, and forget or misplace some votes. But not only the people who count these votes, also the people who vote could make mistakes. They may pick the wrong name from the ballot, because they don't have a good eyesight, or they lose their ballot. It might be easier to give them a computer, so theycan just pick the name of their candidat, and they couldn't make any mistake by chosing the wrong one. 

Those people are for a computerized vote, so that all the votes are counted by a system without any mistakes. The people for the curring voting system have another opinion on that. Computers are also made by human hand, and there mistakes can also happen. Only a few missed votes from a hand counted system aren't that bad, but what if a whole computerized system fails? If there is a issue with a computerized system, thousands of votes could be misplaced, and there is no recount possible.

They also argue with the fact that we use computers on a daily basis, for pleasure, or to do more serious things as bank transactions. We have faith in those computerized system, so why shouldn't we believe in the new voting system? The problem here is, that those daily things have been improved over many years, and they are used daily, so very often. Voting happens only all two years on national bases, and local votings only as much as twice a year. 

The side against the actual voting systems also thinks that everybody knows how computers work and are familiare with them.But what happens with people who don't know how a computer works, such as old or technical not so found people?They are discouraged to vote, and those votes get lost.
