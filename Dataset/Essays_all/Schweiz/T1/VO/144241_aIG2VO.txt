In the presentation just heard, there was being talked about the arguments why a computer should or should not be used for counting votes.
One argument is saying that computers make it a lot easier to vote. Especially for elderly people or people with bad eyesight that may put their mark on the wrong candidate. Computers could help with their better quality and making it in that way easier to read. Another argument was saying that contrary to humans, computers do not make mistakes. Although this argument could be unimportant. Because if there is an error in the computer counting votes, thousands of votes could mistakenly being counted to the wrong candidate. What brings us to the arguments contra using computers for counting votes. Another argument contra using computers for counting votes beneath that there could be an error on the computer, would be that it may seem simple for people to use computers to vote for a candidate, but it isn't for people that never use a computer. Also that they may not afford the internet or even having a computer speaks against using computers for counting votes. This might be a good idea but it is too futiristic to put it in practice and actually only use computers for national votings.
