 In the United States they use easy-to-use touch-screen voting with computers but it's not proved that this is the best idea to vote.

Firstly voting with the compunter is more easy for people who have to count up the votes. They don't have to count one by one because there is a computerzied voting machine. It's not possible that you must to count twice. People with poor eyesight can find the name of the candidate of their choice much faster and there are less problems with voting for the wrong candidate.

On the other hand the current voting systems encloude other troubles. If there are humans who didn't grow up with modern technology, they don't know how to use it. Or if there isn't enough money to buy a computer, you can't vote. An other problem is that computers are made by humans and you can't be sure that they are always working without an error and if there is one, it becomes very expensive to recount. 

In conclusion there are some points pro and some against the computer voting. So it's the choice of the people to decide which idea of voting is better.
