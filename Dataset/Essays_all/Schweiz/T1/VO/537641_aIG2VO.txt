The presentation was openly against replacing the traditional voting systems with computerized systems. They talked about the fact that computers may cause problems as well, since persons that are not used to them might be afraid of the technology that is new to them. Additionally, they mentioned that programs are created by humans, too, so human mistakes can not be evited. On top of that, a mistake made by a program can be far worse than a mistake made by humans, since technology is often relied on without controlling it, and it may cause thousands of votes being counted wrong. They also admitted that in banking, computerized systems are used daily and work well, however they said that because banking comuters are used that often, there is a reassurance that they will work. Also, banking systems did not work very well when they were first introduced, they had to be improved over a long period of time to achieve the functionality they have today. However, they said, voting only happens every other year nationally, so the programs can't be improved as easily and often as banking systems, and there would be errors everytime they were used.
