The first argument from the lecturer is, that many people aren't used to technology. In the text is written, technology is today everywhere and the goverment and workers in every economic dicipline uses it too. People, who can't really use a computer, are mostly elderly. This people have also not always a good eye sight, this makes it hard to read the names on the voting sheet. The fact that not everyone could effort a computer is real, but the writer of the text doesen't mean that everyone should buy one. He thinks the computers are central placed by the goverment, where you can go and give in your vote, as we have it today. 
In the presentation is also an remark to the errors of the computers. The humans who programmed the computer could also do an error. In the text is this case not counted. It is written that the counters makes many mistakes. So there is not really an answer to this problem, but error are no tragedy. You can count again or vote again. The matter is in which system it is easier to correct the error.
