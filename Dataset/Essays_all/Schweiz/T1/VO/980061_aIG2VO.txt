The content of the presentation explains, why it is not better to vote on a computer instead the traditional way with a sheet of paper, where you can cross on your candidate. The person in the presentation says that if you made elections by computer, there may be some people that could not vote because they can not afford a computer or they can not handle one. She also says that it is not sure that a computer would make less mistakes than a human because computers are made by human. And if there were mistakes they would be more horrible than mistakes that were made by human. Also a recount would be impossible because they do not have the votes in a physical way. In the text are the pro arguments for the computer election. They say the traditional system is inefficient and there are more mistakes than there would be if we voted by computer. They also say that persons with bad eye-sight often vote for the wrong person because they do not see it. They also say that the argument that the computer way is unsafe is not right because its also possible to do online banking and that is safe.
