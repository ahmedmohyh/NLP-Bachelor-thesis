Because technology is increasingly taking over those days, it also a question if we don`t want to rely on it in jobs where high accuracy and clarity is demanded.
Lot of people want to replace the traditional voting system trough a technological one, as it will provide a clearer vidion to the voter. Specially people with poor eyesight make lot of mistakes voting, the most common is voting for the wrong candidate because of the big sheet they get with all the names on it. Technological voting system can be magnified to a people`s needs. Also the procedure is easier as the only thing you`ll need to do, is to touch the candidate of the candidate you will be voting for. The next task is counting the votes. While in the traditional system votes must be counted one by one, a computer could do that job just in seconds. This would prevent inevitable problems like a misscount, what has to be corrected by a recount what is very expensive an takes a lot of time.
Errors in a computarized system can easily be corrected in a short period of time and are less expensive.
But some people see more dangers and disadvantages in the computarized system. Though they might be good for our technological youth, old people could feel pressurized and get nervous when not understanding the system. Also computer failings can have dramatic consequences as the mistakes they do can disappear or be deleted. The main problem would be the system deleting a major amount of votes. And like every computarized program is enginered by a huamn, there are also those who can hack themselves into a system.
