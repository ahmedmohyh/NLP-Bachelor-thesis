The voting systems in the USA are criticized because of inefficient and not correct answers. Nevertheless there are different opinions how it is possible to improve the counting of votes and to make it more precisly. The problems are followed:
In the United States, ballots which are large sheets of paper with many, very small written names on it are handed out to the people. They have to make a mark next to their candidate which they want to vote for. It always happends, that people with a lack of eyesight make mistakes on their sheet because they put the small mark next to the wrong name since they can't see it well. Another problem which let the critic rise is the fact that the thousands of ballots are counting one by one by humans hand and so it is obvious that there is a big possibility to make mistakes in counting. A solution would be to replace the billots with online vouting programs which are easy to use. Another idea is to improve the counting system also with the help of computer programs which counts the votes in really short time. But many people think that it is to risky to rely on the technology since it is would have horrible consequences if there is a mistake in the program which is also written by humans. Sure, online banking programs for example are also written by humans hand but they are used heavily day by day and .it's well-known that they work. Voting programs would come up just exery 2 yeaars in the USA
