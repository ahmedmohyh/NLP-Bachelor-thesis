The voting systems in the U.S often gets critisised. People think that the current voting systems lead to inaccurate counting of votes and that because of diffrent reason. One reason is that people who want to vote have to find the name of their candidate on a list. The problem is that this leads to mistakes and so people are voting for the wrong person. 
As a solution for this problem many people think that doing the voting with a computer program is the improvment that the U.S needs. Indeed this isn't a perfect solution. Computer programs can't be used by many people because of diffrent reasons. One reason is that many people in the U.S simply can't afford a Computer. Another reason is that some people, mostly old people, can't handle computers because this technology is far to new for them. 
Another point which people critisise about the U.S voting systems is that the counting of the votes is done by humans. Many people think that this leads to far to much mistakes and does lead to a recount which has to be done. Again people think that computers are the solution. The reason behind this thinking is simple. Computerize systems remove the possibility of human error. But do they? Because a program always counts the votes in  the exact same way it's not possible that they do mistakes while counting the votes. But the problem is that they still can fail. The computerized systems get programmed by humans and as we know humans make mistakes. So there is still the chance that there are errors in the system. The thing is that counting by humans without a question will lead to mistakes. But if a program contains errors the problem is much bigger because every single vote which was counted by the system is affected.
