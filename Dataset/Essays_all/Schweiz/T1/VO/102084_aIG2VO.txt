The voting on computers should be better than the traditional ones on a paper because it is easyer to use. But it is only easy for those people which are good in technology and understand how the system works. Those people which don't use technology often don't unsterstand how the computer works and how they have to do their voting. But in the traditional voting there is also a problem because they often vote for the wrong canditate. This happens because they have to find their canditats on a large sheet of paper so it is possible that the voters doesn't take the right canditat. This problem can happen on people who have a bad eyesight so they go one line up or one line down. The computer voting is a programme which is developped by humans.It is possible that there are mistakes in it. This means that thousands of votes are misscounted. The computer system is not fully trusted.
