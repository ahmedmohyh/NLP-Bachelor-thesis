The speaker says that computer voting maybe seems easier for people who deal with computers every day but not for those who can't handel them that good. Some people won't vote when everything is on computer because they have fear to klick somewehre wrong and do some faults. Also, a fault which has been made by human can be showed up more easy as on computer. A fault in a computer stystem is very hard to find and at the end there is a very big mess.
On the other side the text says that the voting on paper is very inefficient because many faults can be done. For example an old man who can't see good anymore make his sign behinde the name of a canditat who he doesn't want to vote because he switchs between the two names. On computer it's a very easy touch voting system that can be handeld from all people and it's more easy to read the names and make the signs as on paper.
 And also the cauting of the results is very difficult by hand. There can be done so many faults which can be excluded when the voting is on computer. 
Finally some people think the voting on paper is "the old voting"and must be changed in a "new voting" for an easier voting. On the other side there are people who see in this complex computer technology a very bad thing which has to be stopped.
