Many people say, that the voting systems in the United States have to be changend. The reason for this opinion is, that there are many problems with the current one. 
First of all, there are voters, who vote for the wrong candidates. The cause for that may be, that the voters must have a good eyeside, because they have to 
make little mark next to name on the sheet of paper. If the voting would be computerized, it would be much more easier for the voters, because of the touch-screen technology.
But there is another major problem: there isn't any computer, which counts the votes, there are people who do this job. But we can't relie on people, counting thousands of votes, because there are very often errors detected. Now if the U:S. would have a computer who counts the votes, it would be much more save.
On the other hand, they have to think about the problems of computerized voting. What about the people who can't afford a computer? Or people who have fear from technology? Well they can't make them buy a technical item, if they don't want to.
