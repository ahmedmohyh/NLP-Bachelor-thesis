In the text they`re speaking about, that the computer voting is inefficient and that this system often lead to teh inaccurate counting of votes. In the speaking part they`ve spoke about that the system will make the voting much easier and that the people won`t have a lot of problems with. They mention also that the people without a computer/ without a good knowledge about computers will have some problems. 
They also questionned if computers will make really the better jobs than humans. Computers are some projecs of humans and if there are some errors then it`s the problem because the humans haven`t worked good or correct. In the USA they vote every 2 years and so the programm will be used not enough.
And there is another question: Why do we automaticly all things we can? Why we don`t let it be like it`s now?
