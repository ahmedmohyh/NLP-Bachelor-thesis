For some critics is the voting system in the United States inefficient. Some of them prefers to have an electronical voting system. They suspect that the paper lists are to long for the voters and some of them could make some mistakes by crossing the wrong name. The solution is introducing an electronical voting system. With the new voting system the elections should be simpler and they should be also faster because it gives less work for the counter. But not every human is according to this new system. Some of them says that the online votings are simpler only for them who use computers every day. For those whose have fear of technology they could make more mistake with the online voting than with the normal manual voting. We have just to remember that the system is made by human and human can also make mistakes during programming a software. We can't forget that the e-voting system should transmit highly sensitive information and should be protected from hackers.  

 Is it rentable to generate a programm which is used every two year? How many years does it take until the software is fully programmed and protected by hackers?
