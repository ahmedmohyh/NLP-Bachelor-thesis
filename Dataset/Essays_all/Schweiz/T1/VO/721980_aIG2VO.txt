The voting time comes and nearly everybody wants to vote the best candidate. There are votings by hand and votings by a computer (in a electric way). But which of them is better? Let's have a look at both. 
At first it is sure that mistakes happens. In the text and in the listening part they were counted a few kinds of mistakes. There are mistakes for example because people cannot see quite good and select the wrong candidate. They have a large sheet of paper in front of them with all the names of the candidates and there can be a mistake on following the name of a candidate.
Secondly the text and the listening part claim that there are mistakes by the electronic. A person who is counting the ballots can make mistakes but the are not as big. In case a programme is not as good or has a mistake on it there can be a big deal of mistakes in the counting of the votes. 
In summary there are mistakes everywhere. The electric way may be faster and comfortable but there can be big mistakes. In the voting by hand too. You can select the wrong candidate or the person who counts the ballots can make a mistake in the counting. There is not a perfect way to vote.
