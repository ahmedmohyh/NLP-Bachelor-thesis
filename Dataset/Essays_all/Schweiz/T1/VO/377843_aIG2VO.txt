Critics say that the current voting system in the Unites States are ineffcient and lead often to the inaccurate counting of votes but there are also many people that think otherwise. These people say that there will be americans that will not be able to afford this kind of technology and that eldery people may have problems to understand this kind of voting. 
In tradtional voting, the voters find a relatively large sheet of paper in front of them with the candidate's names and they need to make a small mark next to the belonging candidate. With the computer eye vote, this system would be completely different. The voters would be in a computerized voting machine, which would be made as easy as possible for the eldery. It would also be more trustworthy for the people with poor eyesight because the viewing would be a lot easier and also the marking of the names therefore they would not vote for the wrong candidate. 
There is also this argument that officials could count up the votes wrongly and if an error would be found, they would have to count all over again and that this would not happen with the new technology. Even though all of this is right, we still need to accept the fact that we programme these computers as well and if there would be an error, the consequences would be way higher than with normal voting. A recount would be impossible!
We also need to see that no technology has worked flawlessy in the beginning and had to be improvised but the votings in the Unites States are not held that much that it would even have a chance to improve.
