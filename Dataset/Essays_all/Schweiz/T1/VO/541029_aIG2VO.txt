In the presentation we hear about computers. The main topic was the use of computers in voting systems. They said that computers can make the situation better for people who are used to computers. People who aren`t used to them will not have a change to vote or they make many mistakes, such as casing the wrong vote/candidate. 
It`s wrong that computers can`t make any mistakes. They are programmed by humans and as we all know, humans make mistakes. The difference is that a mistake caused by a human is not as worse as a mistake caused by a computer. A human could forget to count one ballot but a computer can miscount thousands of results. We trust in computer technology every day but they didn`t work since they were invented. Every computer system has to bee developed over years. Therefor it`s not useful to use a computer based voting system in votings which just take place every second year.

The big difference about the text and the listening is that the text sees more advantages in computerized votings. It says that computers would do less faults than humans and that governments and individuals trust other complex copmuter technology every day. The author didn`t write about disadvantages of computers. In the presentation there is mentioned that every technology has to be developed over years. The listening describes some disadvantages.
