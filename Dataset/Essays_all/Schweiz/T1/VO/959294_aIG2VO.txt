The lecture was totally against any computer based voting system and I am going to recap the reasons that it gave us. On of the main reasons was that maybe older people that are not used to computers or people that have a fear of technology might not be able to correctly vote or even vote at all with a computer system so the same problems would occure that occured with the traditional voting system with people picking the wrong names on the ballots because they can not see right. The second reasoning was that we can not be sure that the computer would make none of the mistakes that the officicals do because computers are programmed by humans. Also if the computer would make any mistakes they would probably be far more difficult to solve than a miscount from an official. So this is the complete opposite of what the text told us because there this was one of the biggest reasons why computers would be better to count the votes.
