Pros and cons about computer-voting

It is known, that people accidentally vote for the worng candidate, bacause the names on the votingsheet are too small and too much. They cross the wrong name by accidente. An other disadvantage of voting in the old way is, that you have to count them one by one, that is hard work an humans often make mistakes. And if they find a mistake you have to recount them. That is hard work and expensive. So why do not use new computer technology? It is easyer to count, because that makes the computer, you can zoom, so you can read the names easily. This are all advantages. But you have to know how to use a computer and for example old aged people often do not know that. So the will not vote anymore? Furthermore; how already mentioned; humans make mistakes. And if they make a oder several mistakes by programming the computersoftware, America has a huge promlem. You can not count the votes anymore one by one, They are all on the computer. Yes, sure, e-banking for e.g. works very well, nowadays. But we use that every single day and so we have much experiance. But compter-voting would be used just one time per year. So we do not have any experiance if it really works or not. Thats a big risk!
