The text and the audio inform people about the positive and negative aspects of an computerized voting. The authors bring up important informations about the voting people but also about the electric voting system.
First of all, people are likely to make mistakes. It starts with the marking the right box in the ballot. It is a long paper with a lot of names on it. There is no overview therefore it is difficult to find the name. Especially old people might have problems with their eyes which means that they won't find the names easily as well. 
There also can be errors in the counting of the votes by humans. Every vote has to be counted one by one. Here also, people are likely to make mistakes. It requires a lot of concentration and focus. 
And now computerized voting seems to be very easy for those who are used to computers. But there are old people or still people who are not used to the machines and mainly to the computers. Of course there are people who can not afford a computer or people who fear technology. These people do not have a possibility to vote at all. 
And we should keep in mind that computers are programized by humans. As we know, people make mistakes therefore they make mistakes in programming. Well seems not very harmful but once the program is common, the mass of error is huge when we count every wrongly counted vote.

According to these problems, there are also many positive aspects.

Although there are mistakes in the computer program the percentage of correctly counted votes are even bigger than the wrongly counted. It means that there is a big security of the datas and a very clear solution.
It is easier to handle with the huge amount of informations. 
And at last we do have to improve the electric computer system what supports the researches and innovations in the technology. 
Finally, there are a lot of positive and negative aspects.
