In the presentation they showed and discussed about the positiv and negativ aspects about the online voting.

The first critic point is, that not all people are used to computers every day. Possible reasons are that they can not afford any computer or that their generation does not used technology in former years. So it happensquickly that these people give a wrong vote or that they are scared of voting because they are not used to technology.In case of that the nation loses unfortunately many important votes. Additionally, like every programme this voting programme ist made of humans too. Thechance that there are some errors is still there and a recount is not possible. There also was mentionned, that the wort that can happen is that there are some ballots missing. Not as worse as the piont below is that miscount possibly appear and the vote results are not 100 percent true. 

Summerisingly because of the technically challenge online voting systems are something for young people who are used to the functions of a computer and their difficulties especially because in the United States you have the possibility to vote only all two years, so miscounts, technical problems and stuff like this should be avoided.
