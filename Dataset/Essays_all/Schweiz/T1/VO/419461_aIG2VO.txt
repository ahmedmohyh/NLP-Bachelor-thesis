Some critics of voting systems in the United States of America say that the systems are inefficient and in the end give an inaccurate counting. The invention of a computer system that is easy and handy to use would be the best solution for such a problem. Especially people with poor eyesight could be most likely the ones that cross the wrong candidate on the neverending ballots. While in the computer system they could only click on the name and then vote for the candidate they wanted to in the first place. Also a problem of still using ballots for every vote once a year is that the officials going through them and count the votes can make a lot of mistakes by overseeing crosses or counting them twice.
Other critics say that a computer system is the worst idea being made by habitants of the USA. They are very doubtful hense a lot of reasons. What do we do with the ones that can not afford a computer? What if the system breaks down while the votes have to be set. A lot of people also do not own the ability to use tecnology. So they would be discouraged because of the fear of the new electronic voting system. Another statement  was that can we really trust a computer? In the end computers are made by humans, so they could easily also make mistakes in the programming of the system. So that would lead us to even worse mistakes of voting results. For example in the fincances and bank districts computer systems are a must. But they have been improved over a lot of years every day. 
The main question critics against computer systems ask themselves is that if it really is necessary to invent a whole new computer system only to make it easier for people to vote once a year.
