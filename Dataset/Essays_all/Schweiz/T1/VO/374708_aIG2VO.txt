Voting: human voting or computerized voting ?

They say (audio speech) that the computer voting isn`t very much trustful then the current voting, the human voting. On of the main problem, wich the text doesn`t refer to, is that people, how don`t use often the computer, that they have problems with the computeized voting. For example older people. And maybe they don`t now how to use the computer. They can become so insure, that they don`t want to go voting anymore. 
They both say that the current voting, the human voting, can lead to inaccurate counting of votes. For example can people with poor eyesight easly mark the false person, because teh ballot is quiet large. Because the voting is an human counting vote it can lead to human errors. The text however, doesn`t tell us, that computer also can make errors. Because the computer program wich counts the votes is made by human. So the humans who have made the program can also make a mystake. And it isn`t worth to program a computerized voting program, because in the USA are the votings only every two years. 

We can baisicly say that the speech is against the computerized voting and the text is for the computerized voting in the USA.
