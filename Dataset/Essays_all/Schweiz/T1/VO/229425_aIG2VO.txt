"Voting in the US today is very complicated" this is what the text and the presentation has as the main statement. 

First of all today in the US the whole system in analogical, what means you have to find the name of the candidate you want to vote for on a big paper where all the names of the cadidates are written. In this case there exist problems like to have wrong votes because you can not find the name of the person you want. In contrast to this, the text says it would not get such problems by a computer-based voting system. There would not be some misscalculations anymore. It also declairs it as a risky thing to use it nationwide because it is expensive and not in use today which the woman presentating took as one of her most important statements. But it says after computers are already used in banking and have to do with "higly sensitive information" it would work for a counting of votes too.

The presentations argues with the text, the woman said it would not eliminate the problems existing at counting they have today with people because it is also a programm made by humans. She meant exactly there would be bigger problems because it is not just one thing counted wrong or not counted because it is a generalising computer there would nothing be counted or at least all would be wrong counted if it was programmed this way.
