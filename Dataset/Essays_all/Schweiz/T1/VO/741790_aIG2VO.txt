The traditional system often results in error, because people vote for the wrong candidate by mistake. This is due to poor eyesight or other health issues. Yet the new computer voting system would have touchscreens and would be able to magnify the names of the candidates. Another issue with the traditional system is that it relies on humans to count the votes and on such a big scale it is almost inevitable to make an error. Humans aren't flawless like machines. The computer would be able to do this task in seconds without any miscounts. This would save the state a lot of money and time and prevent the errors made in the past. 
Yet there is still a big amount of people in America that do not have a computer at home and would have to learn to use it. This could overcomplicate things and only lead to more difficulties. It would take a long process to introduce this system. And speaking of difficulties, computers are programmed by humans. They are going to be errors in the operating system. It is inevitable. One of these errors could lead into thousands of miscounts.
To spread and make this new voting system nationwide seems more like a fantasy than a reality. Only a small group of individuals actually trust this system, because we use a similar system in our e-banking. Yet these system are used everyday and have gone a long way to be as reliable as they are today.
