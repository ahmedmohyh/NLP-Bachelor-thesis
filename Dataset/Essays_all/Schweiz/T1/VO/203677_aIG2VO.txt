Vorting

Voting just happens once every second year in the USA so it is important that the voting happens corectly. The old way to vote was with a ballot where yo have got a peace of paper with many names on it and you have just to set a mark behinde the name you want to vote. The new way of voting is with a tuch-screen where you just have to tap the name you want to vote. We should think tath the new way of voting is saver but it just seames so. If an compute has a tecnical problem it can cange the whole voting it can even just ignore whole voting districts. The old way of voting has alsow got some problems that are mistakes witch humans make. Normaly computers dont make mistakes but it could be that the people witch programed it made some ant that the computer now always just counts the votes vor one person and simpy ignores the authers ant that would detect a long and expensive recount ore even a revoting in case of a big mistake.
People witch arnt used to computers can alsow easy make mistakes like if they just tap something that they dont realy want. They cant just delet ther wrong voting so it counts.
