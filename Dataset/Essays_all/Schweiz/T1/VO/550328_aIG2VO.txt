In the lecture, that lady strongly opposes the use of computers at voting. She is against computerized voting because many people who do not use the computer on a daily basis, cannot work with it. Others fear the technology and will stop voting because of that. 
She also asks if the computer really does a better job? There, the question uprises, if a computer does not make any faults, and the lady says that these faults can even be more dramatic than if a human counter forgets a few ballots. She argues that also the computer is constructed by human beings, so it cannot be perfect, it contains errors, which can occur when counting the votes or by electing a candidate.
The difference between the text and the speech is really big. The text arguments for the computerized voting because it is faster, easier and as the text says, contains no errors. The exact opposite is being told in the speech.
Text and speech bring up the arguments for and against this computerized voting, and with that, they erase each other. At the end, both options are not good enough, with both options there is a part of the population which will not be ablt to vote anymore, or which simply does not want to vote with this system.
The elder people may like the personalized, by human corrected, system, while younger people prefer the easy and quick computerized version. With that, this leads to a spread in population, which eventually leads to different parts of the population voting fot the different candidate, just because they prefer a voting system to another.The text and the lecture clearly show how difficult is, to pick one system, and at the end, both of them contain advantages and disadvantages.
