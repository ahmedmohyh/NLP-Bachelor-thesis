The lady in the presentation explains how the success of computerized voting is doubtful. Contradictory to the article she reasons that there are many people having trouble using computers, due to their lack of knowledge, lack of use or fear of technology. The article insists on easy usage of computerized voting machines resulting in fewer errors. Another argument in the listening section was that people make mistakes counting the votes, but computer errors are heavier and can hardly be noticed since there is no physical record of votes. The text on the other hand makes a point that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error and are remarkably faster in keeping track of the votes. It also explains an irony created by people who believe computerized voting isn't trustworthy, but trust computers with banking and information, whereas the argument in the presentation repels this idea based on the fact that computerized banking is often used and perfectionized in contrast to the new voting system. All in all, the presentation supports the current voting system and the article is in favor of a new, computerized voting system.
