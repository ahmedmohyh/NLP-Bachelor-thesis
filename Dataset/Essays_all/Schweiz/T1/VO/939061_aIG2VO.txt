computer voting system
The voting system of the United States is computer voting . For those people who know how to work with a computer it is a good thing. The voting can be done in a view minutes with the computer and so they have more time for their busy things. But computer voting has also his disatvantages.People like our grandmothers who weren't grew up with computers have a lot of problems. They don't know how to work with computers and that leads to wrong votings. Often the voting isn't correct. There were votings where 1000 votes were misscounted. Computer voting isn't just for older people a problem. The people with a poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. So an other way who leads to wrong votings. But the old system isn't that good as well. It is also a problem for those people with a poor eyesight because there is a large sheet where they have to mark the person they would like to vote for  and so it happens really fast that they crosse the wrong name. Another disadvantage for the old system is that people have to count all the votes. In conclusion both systems have their advantages and disadvantages but for the futuer the computer voting system is probably the better system because the most people know now how to work with computers and there is a lot of work you don't have to do with the computers.
