In the spoken text they talk about how computerized voting is easy for people that are used to computers but not for all the others that don't really know how to use it. Furthermore they argue that computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. So if there happens to be an error by computerized voting it will have a huge impact on the vote's result because it is not only a small error but a very big one. In the written text it is the other way around. The text argues that people who have to count the votes one by one are more likely to make a mistake than the copmuter because the computer counts very fast and makes no errors. If there is a mistake detected by ballot counting made by humans it costs a lot of money, so with computers they would save money and time.
Furthermore the spoken text talks about people having poor eyesight who easily choose the wrong name accidently, whereas the written text argues that the poor eyesight would be a problem on the paper because there are many names written small. On computerized voting people can magnify the names and only have to cast the candidate's name by using the easy-to-use touch-technology.
