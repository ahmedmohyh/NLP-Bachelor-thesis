Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. Those critics would like to replace the traditional system with a computerized voting system. Critics say that the computer system is far more efficient. On the other side people think the computerized system won't make it better than the traditional system.

Critics say that in traditional voting one major source of inaccuracy is that people accidentaly vote for the wrong candidate. The voters have to find the name of their candidate on a sheet of paper cantaning many name, and make a small mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. Computerized system should be easy to handle say the critics. Voters needs only to touch the candidates name. 
On the other side people say that voters who can't afford computers or are not used to computers will have problems with the voting because they cant handle the computer.

Critics say that people make mistakes in counting the thousand of votes. And if an error is detected it can cause a long and expensive recount. Computer systems should make this better.
On the other side people say that it takes much time to improve a computerized voting system. The computer programm is programmed ny humans and they make mistakes and so it's possible that the computer system has an error. This can cause thousands of misscounts.
