Critics of the current voting system in the U.S. say it is often innefficient and often inaccurate. They mention a computerized voting system as a solution. However it is doubtful, wether such a system would actually be better than the current one. As a first point, critics bring up the problem of accidentally voting for the wrong candidate, which they put down to people with poor eyesight misreading the cadidate's name. According to them, a computerized system would be easier to use and would allow for magnifying the name if needed. However, critics should remember that some people do not actually use computers or similar digital technology on a daily basis and therefore might not know how to use them properly, some people might even decide not to vote, out of fear of technology. As a following point, the critics mention the possibility of human error leading to innaccurate counting of votes, also bringing up the expenses of doing a recount, computers, they say, wouldn't have that problem. However, computers aren't flawless and free from human error either. Computers are programmed by humans, thus not eliminating the possibility of flaws and errors in the system. These errors would also be much severe, possibly removing or deleting votes and in that instance I recount wouldn't be possible. Lastly, critics mention the fact, that we rely on similar computerized systems on a daily basis and don't mind using them. However, one should remember, that these systems are used on a daily basis and have had several years time to be improved, since they did't work flawlessly when introduced. Additionally, voting only takes place every two years in the U.S. which would't give developers enough opportunities to improve the systems, meaning that large scale errors would be lot more likely.
