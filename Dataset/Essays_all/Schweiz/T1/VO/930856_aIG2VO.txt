The woman talking in the lecture is against the modernisation of the current voting system. According to what she says more people will have a problem with using a computer, caused by poverty or just the difference between the generations, than they have with using the traditional voting. She also mentiones that an error in the computer system will be much more disastrous than miscounting a view of the bills because all the votes will be lost.
The lecture opposeses the essay. While the woman holidng the lecture is against changing the way to vote the essay states that a computerized voting system will make a lot of things easyer. People who have problems with eyesight will have a chance to magnify the text so they don't accidentaly vote for someone else. The essay also states that electric voting will clear out all of the human errors that accure during the counting of votes and that this system is stable inough because banks use a simmilar system and don't seem to have a problem with those erros.
