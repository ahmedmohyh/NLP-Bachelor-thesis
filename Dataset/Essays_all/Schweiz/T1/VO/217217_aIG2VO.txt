When critics say that current voting systems are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes, then there has to be something behind this. When an election is very closely then there can´t be made any mistakes, there have to be everything okay and correct. When humans counts the ballots then there may can be made some mistakes but with computers there should be everything alright. There´s only one another possible case for a wrong and failed election: the computers with worng programes. When people are always doing some things with computers, that shouldn´t be a problem because we use it all the time in our social world and that not less. But what about old people who aren´t used with computers everyday or people who are afraid of high tecnology?
Mostly it´s because of the eyesight. The people vote just for the wrong candidate and that belongs also to the part of the `failed election`. Humans would count everx ballot and that with a very fast tempo, while computers count even faster but with a higher misscount rate, because they were false programed. But at least some people give them a try, because we use computers daily. 
It´s still a little bit wirred to trust a computer more than a human being.
