The new way to vote: computerized
We know two different ways to vote: the traditional one, in relation to we know sertain problems and the computerized one. The new one seems to be better on the first look, especially for people who are used to computers and technology. But also with that way of voting problems are well known, for example if a person is not used to technolgy or maybe that person is even afraid to use it. These situations can biuld real troubles. When you use the new way of voting, there is the fear of easily cast the wrong vote. But other people say, like in the text above, that on a large sheet you will have the exact same problem: to find the right name and don't cast the wrong vote.
It's true, that when people vote using the traditional way with sheets of paper, than someone has to count all the votes. People make mistakes, and so there are made a lot of mistakes by counting them. But in difference to the text, it's even worse to make mistakes in a computer programme than in missing a few ballots by counting the votes. Computer programms are made by people, and as we know, people make mistakes. But when there are wrong counted sheets, you just have to count it another time and that's it. It's even worse when there's a mistake in the electronic programm. Sadly it's possible that one candidate was forgotten to put in the voting programm to vote for, and he won't have any votes for sure, because people can't vote for that candidate.
For banking transactions, also computer programms are used, and that daily, but votings in the USA are just every two years. These programmes, which are used daily for example for transactions are improoved well. So you could create programms for voting which are improoved, but the chance to fail is still there, because people make mistakes.
