The discussion is about the current voting system in the U.S.A.. Is is better to replace the current system which contains hand writing and counting humand or a new one where computers count the votes and the people have to vote online.

The critis of the current voting system say that it often leads to wrong counting of the votes. Also there a people who vote for the worng candidate because they accidentally mark the wrong name. Another point is that it is really heavy to count the votes for the people that have to. They like to replace it with a new computuriedz system. Because is more easy to handle and it counts the votes faster and correct without any human errors. Because if a error is detacted a expenisve and long recount has to be made. Some peopple say it is to risky to implement complicated voting technology all over the national. But without worrying people are already used to make serious things on the computer like e-banking or the communication from sensitive informations.

The people who disagree with this new idea say that computurized voting is just more easy for people who are used to this technology. If a family can not afford a computer there are unable to vote. If in the voting programm was a error this leads to a error with way more serious cosequences. So the programm has to be tested and improved many times. This is to much effort for something that only takes place once every two years.
