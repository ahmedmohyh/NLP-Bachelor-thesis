The woman in the record says that she is against computerized voting machines. She says that it is not fair to use computers in voting because there are a lot of people that have problems with working on them. Especially for poor and older people who don't use computers on a daily basis it is unfair to use them in voting. 
The text says that it is way more fair to use computers in voting especially for people with poor eyesight who could easily mark the wrong name inthe ballot. And, as we know, poeple with poor eyesight are often old people. 
The text also says that the people who count the votes can easily make mistakes. It takes a long and expensive effort to correct flaws.
The woman in the video agrees with this statement but she says the computers can make flaws as well and these flaws would be way worse. She says that people who count votes can make flaws on a few ballots but computers can change thousands of votings.
