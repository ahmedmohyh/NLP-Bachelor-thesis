Moreover, this kind of voting take more negative aspects because it could be possible that the programme has an error. This would fake thousands of votings.
On the other hand, the computer programmes have been tested regurarly and are very save. It's nearly impossible that a fault like this could happen. This is what the text and the audio is telling us. Furthermore, the eldery needs to learn how to use digital devices.
