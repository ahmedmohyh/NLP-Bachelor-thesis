In the text on the other hand, they claim it is easier to see things on a screen, as the names of candidates can be magnified.
So the text claims the computer based voting system to be more userfriendly whilst the speeker thought it would be repulsuve to certain groups,

Another point mentionend in the speech is, that the errors possibly caused by computers are much graver than those of traditional vote counters.
The text states, that the old way is very likely to cause more problems due to human failure, but completly ignores the fact, that programms aren't 100% accuarate either, as stated by the woman in the audiofile. So this is another point, where the two contradicts themselfs.

The text author thinks it to be contradicting to betrust such an important thing as ones wealth to programms and computers but not voting.
The speeker on the other hand argue that banking transactions are done on a daily base and can thus be better analysed and improved.
But the people only vote all two years where this process is thus not possible. Again, on this last point the two are contradic
