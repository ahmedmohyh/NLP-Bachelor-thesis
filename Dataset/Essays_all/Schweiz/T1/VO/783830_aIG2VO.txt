We have here two opinions about the machines for the elections. On one hand they say its much easier do deal with the machines and on the other hand have we the problem that it is also possible that machines are wrong.

With the machines its much easier to vote. You have only to touch the name of you favorite. Before this you had a large sheet with a lot of names on it. And the people were often confused and didnt now what they are doing or who the vote for. Now is the question: What is with these people who dont work every day with a computer? They have more problems with the machines then the other ones. So here is it also possible that they touch the wrong name, but the chance that this happend is smaller than with the large sheet.

Another point for the computers is that it is easier to count out the votes. Without the machines it was the job from the people to count out this votes, but there were often a lot of mistakes and this was the reason for the wrong elections. There are a lot of people who say that the computers also can make mistakes because they are made from humain beings. Its normal that people make mistakes, so why should there not be the possibilty that they have made one while they made the computer? Other machines for example in the bank industrie had also problems at the begining but after a long time every thing is ok. the people know how to deal with these computers. Why shouldnt the same happen with the election machines?
