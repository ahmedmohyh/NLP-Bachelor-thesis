Critics would like the traditional systems to be replaced with far more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems. They would like transform this because they think that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. They say that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. But there are some problems! The new computerized voting system may seem easy for people which use the Computer every day. But for humans which have difficults with technology it may be very difficult and complicated. A second problem is, that computer programms are made by humans. And humans make mistakes. So it could be, that there is a mistake in the programm. And if there is a error in the programm it would be terribel! Critics say that the counting of votes in the traditional system is full of mistakes. But if there is a problem in the new system a recount wold be impossible
