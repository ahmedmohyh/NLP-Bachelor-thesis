When there are votings often people complain about mistakes the voting itself or the counting. Critics of the traditional vote system want to replace it by a computerized one. But can we trust computers when we have to make important decisions?

Traditionally, people have to make a tick to vote for their favourite candidate, but it happens often that people with bad eye-sight tick the wrong one. People now say that we should use computers instead of a large sheet of paper that by the way would be better for the environment. But as computers are programmed by human beings if a mistake happens it would be even worse because there is an error in the server.

It is true that there are a few mistakes when people count votes, but that does not change the outcoming of the voting. As computers are programmed by human beings, not only a few balloots would be skipped.

To summarize, I am sure that it is hard to get used to computerized voting for people who are not used to computers, but from my point of view from time to time we have to get used to computers everywhere in our lives. It wouldbe good if there would be the chance to choose between the two systems so from time to time you can vote with the efficient computer system.
