The first thing, the woman mentioned, was the unability of some people to use computers. Some people may not have any problems with using computers, but others would have troubles. That`s the opposite of what has been written in the text. In the text it said, that the computers have an easy-to-touch-screen so it would be possible for all people to vote for the person they want, even if they aren`t that skilled in using computers.  Furthermore, the woman asked if computers really would be better than humans to manage the voting systems. Of course there could be some mistakes in the programs made by humans. But the difference is, that a mistake in the software would produce thousands of wrong votes. One or two mistakes of an human wouldn`t be that horrible instead. On the other hand there are thousands of ballots needed to be controlled. That`s a lot of work for some humans. They couldn`t count those ballots efficiently like the computers do. But the woman`s voice mentioned something else. The national votes have to be counted just once every two years. That isn`t very often and the computers can`t be fully trusted.
