The first point made in the lecture was that although computerized voting might seem easier to people used to technology, not everyone would feel secure voting with a machine. People who do not use computers that often or the ones who can not afford a computer may be scared of by the idea of voting with one which could resolve in people not voting altogether. The woman giving the lecture also stated that accidentally choosing the wrong candidate could also happen on your computer, not just on paper. 
The next point was that computers are constructed by humans and humans are flawed so we do not know what kind of errors could occur when voting with computers.It is true that counting out the votes one by one can lead to mistakes, but with computerized voting the mistakes could be a lot more severe. With humans counting the ballots you can at least recount but on a computer once the damage is done there is no going back. 
Last but not least she talked about possible complications when developing a complex program for computerized voting. It took us a long time to trust computers as much as we do today and it would deffinitly take a while to construct a program that was trustworthy enough for everyone to vote with it. She said it just wasn't worth it since in the USA there are only two major votings per year. In the text they make a valid point hence saying that we also trust them with highly sensitive inofrmation.
