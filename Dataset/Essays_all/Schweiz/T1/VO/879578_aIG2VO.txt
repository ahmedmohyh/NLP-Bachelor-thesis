In the article it is said that the computerized voting system is far more efficient and trustworthy than the current one. Critics believe that there is no trustwortyness in such a programm. "It is right, people make failures every day but the biggest problem that can accure is that the people count wrong but a failure in the programmed script of the computerized system is way bigger problem" is what was said during the presentation.
It ought to be easier to set a tick next to a candidates name on a big touch-screen than on the ballot with so many names on it, was a statement mady by the autors of the article. But we still live in a changing world we have computers for forty years now an touch-screens for approximatly ten years. Nowadays there are still too many people whose can't properly use a computer or don't even have acces to one. Those people wouldn't be able to vote if the government settled down to a computerized voting system, would they?

"It is too risky to implement a complicated technologie nationwide" was the argument the autors tried to reply to. They said we use complex banking systems every day and we have no problems with them but even those programms had some major problems at their beginning.
