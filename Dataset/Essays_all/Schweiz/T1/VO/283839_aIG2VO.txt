The text and the speech is about voting systems in America. And a new efficient way to count the votings is computarized votings. In the speech she talks about that people can easily make mistakes. And if humans make those counting machines they can make mistakes too with a lot worse outcome. But the text is about the traditional voting that is very inefficient because voters usually have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names(the ballot) and make a small mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. In the text the computerized voting machines are explained very efficient and reliable unlike in the speech. Another major problem with old voting systems in the text is that they rely heavily on people to count the votes. Officials must often count up the votes one by one, going through every ballot and recording the vote. Since they have thousands of ballots, it is almos inevitable that they will make mistakes. If an error is detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place. In contrast, computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers. In the speech its the same problem in old and new votings but in the end they say that today its very relyable.
