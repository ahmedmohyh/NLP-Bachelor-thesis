The text and the listening are both about the american voting system. The problem is the counting system, which is inaccurate and leads to a misselection. the manual counting of votes has been detected as one of the two reasons of this inaccuracy. 
As there are thousands of ballots, it's inevitable for a human not to make mistakes. the solution could be a computerized voting. On the one hand the counting would be much more efficient, as the official in charge would only have to communicate the results showing up on the computer. On the other hand the matter is the human mistake and because computer systems are programmed by humans, there could occur a mistake as well. But if the computer system fails the effect would have a larger and more devastating range.
The second reason why many people would like to change the system is because of the bullets. There you have many names and firstly, you have to find the right one among them. Secondly, you have to mark the right name. Which is quite difficoult for older people with sight problems. Whereas you could simply vote on the computer and zoom onto the name you'd like to choose. But also here there are some difficoulties. older people who struggle with the bullets, might have even more problems with the computer, as they're not used to it.
