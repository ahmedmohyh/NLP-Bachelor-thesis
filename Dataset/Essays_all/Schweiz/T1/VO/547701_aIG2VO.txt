Should the voting system be changed?

Many people have the belong to change the voting system in the United States of America. They would like to change to an computerized voting system and they don't want to continue with the old fashioned, hand counted system. One of their arguments is, that every vote has to be counted one by one and that it is likely that errors are made, because we are all humans. It is difficult to read and the wrong box is quickly marked. They think that this system is inefficient and that if there once is an error detected, it would be quite expensive to range that error away.

On the other hand there are people who think that this idea would be a disaster. They share the opinion that it is doubtful that the new system would be better. One big problem they see in the elderly people. For younger people it won't be a problem, because they are used to work with computers, but the elderly could easily get panic or press the wrong button. If there would be an error in the computer system that would have a great impact and could not so easily be cleared. They say that this system would not be used enough, only once every two years and compared to the bank systems (they are used every day) they would need new investment every time.
