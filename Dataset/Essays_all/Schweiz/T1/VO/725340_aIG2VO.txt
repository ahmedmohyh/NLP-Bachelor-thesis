The lecturer begins by admitting that traditional voting systems in the United States are not flawless, as the text suggests. She goes on to counter that she is very doubtful that replacing it by computer votes is going to work better. The first problem lies in the cost and, to some people, difficult usage of computers. Many people either can't afford one or don't know how to use one and would be repelled from voting because of this.
A big argument against traditional voting that is stated in the text is that the traditional system relies heavily on people counting the votes, which leads to inevitable counting errors that wouldn't happen with efficient and trustworthy computerized voting. The lecture doesn't deny this fact but goes against the argument by saying that comptures could lead to way worse errors, where thousands of votes could go missing and a recount would not be possible since there are no physical documents of the computer votes. 
The last point that is made in the text is not completely rebutted by the lecture. All it says is that the complex computer technology in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information wasn't perfect in the beginning and that it took time to develop a system that worked. 
Although the lecture argues well against the text, there is one major part it ignores completely. The fact stated in the text that there are many people who accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because of the large voting sheets containing many names with ballots.
