The text says that the traditional voteings aren't as efficient as the computers are. It says that people who do not see very well can have problems with the choosing. Because the ballots are so small it can be easily done wrong. But the presentator said as an contra argument that people who don't use it daily or very often can't handle it very well or people who can't even afford it can't even do the elction. 
In the text it's mentioned that people count the votes and that they can make mistake because they have to go through every ballot and look where the votes are  done. The record says that the computer program is also creeated by humans and that they could have done a mistake too. And that would have bigger and more tragical problems. The votes could be deleted totally so that it would have to be redone .
The text also says that they are complex computer technology  with sensitive information in use for example banking transactions and its works very well so that it isn't as risky as it seems. 
Against this argument is in the audio mentioned that these programs are often used and were improved so that they weren't from the begining working so well as they do now. And an election is all two years once so that the risk stays that it probably will not work.
