Voting is not always as easy as it seems.So what is the best way to vote correct and without any mistake made by humans or computers?

Well one thing one big treasure in the voting system would be the computers. Aren't they flawless? They make no mistake and in counting they're by far more accurate than a human.
Well it's not always as good as it seems. While voting with technology seems good and easy for us it may be hard for other people. Especially the ones who don't come in contact with technology that often.
A fear of not knowing how to use the voting system on a computer may draw people away from the actual voting. So the whole point of an easy voting system would break down. Also it's not like you vote everyday. Sometimes you vote twice in a year so it's easy to forget how to use the computersystem right.
Also what about errors that may happen? Thousands of votes could be deleted without us even noticing.
But otherwise humans are as well not flawless in counting. We all make mistakes and that involves counting. But apart from the counting of the so called "ballots", we also make the wrong choices. It's not like we want to but sometimes we mark the wrong box next to the name. So it may be possible for us to vote somebody we didn't chose in the first place. So this is a mistake made even before the actual counting even is a thing. 
So how could we prevent from people marking the wrong boxes? Well as bad as we talked about the computers earlier they also help us alot with just simple clicking and big screens. So we can prevent these things.
In the end it's the choice everyone has to make for himself.
