These two statements are very different. In the listening exercise the woman doesn't trust in the new computer voting system. She says that all these online banking trasactions had to devevelop, befor they were like that. At the beginning they made a lot of fauts. But these online voting system we only use one time per year. And it isn't  developed so well. The written statement says that the big problem is not the computer but the people who choose the wrong people. They have to find the names of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names. In these text it is also written that because the humans can't cout correctly they want to replace the people with a computerized voting system. The author of the written statement has the opinion that these computerized voting system is much better than the old one. It's also simple to use because it has an easy-to-touch-screen technology. He also thinks that at a certain time the whole world will use it. To day we already trust in online banking transactions and communivation of highly sensitive information.
