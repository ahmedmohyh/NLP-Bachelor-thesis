While the women who made a speech was strongly against a computerized voting system the text praises this option and sees no mistakes in it at all. She proclaimed that many people had a fear of technology and that they would therefor be very discouraged to vote. In the text it is written that there won't be any problems because of the easyness. In other words: It would'nt be necessary for the voters to have a big knowledge for computers. The women also said that there could be huge errors such as having every data adeleted or even bigger miscounts than by human hand. And therefor that it's impossible for a human being to make mistakes a computer could do. About this the text says that mistakes and miscounts caused by human hand are extremely expensive and afford lots ot time. The text tells about the security of our technology by comparing the system with the perfectly accurate system for banking transactions. Last but not least she mentioned that it would cost a lot of time to creat such a system and that it would'nt be worth it because there are'nt many elections. The text does not speak of this progress of creation. It kind of gives the impression as if it was very simple and that might not be true.
