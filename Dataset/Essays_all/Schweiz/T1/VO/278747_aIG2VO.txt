The current voting system used in the United Srates are inefficient and people make more mistakes. But is this true? 

People's arguements are that the current voting system is more difficult to count. They have to count the votes one by one and if anyone makes a mistake the whole ballot is going to be counted wrong.
A ballot is a large piece of paper containing a huge list of candidates. So it is a fact that the people who count the votes are making mistakes.
You also use daily banking transactions so why not try a computerized voting machine which has an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology. You only have to touch the name of your favourite candidate. That kind of machine is also better for people who have a poor eyesight. With a poor eyesight you could make mistakes and with a voting machine the name of your candidate is easier to view. But like in every discussion there is a downside.

Many people also think that the new technology is doubtful. Yes, it is easier for people who are used to computers but what is about the people who can not even afford a computer? Nevertheless who says that computers are better? A computer's programm is programmed by a human, too. If that person who programmed the computer makes an error, the computer will miscount thousands of votes. With no doubt we are using banking transaction every day but this had to improve, too. It is not that bad because we are using this daily even tough a voting is only once in two years.
