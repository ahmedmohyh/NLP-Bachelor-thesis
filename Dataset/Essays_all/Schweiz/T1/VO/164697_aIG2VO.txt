The lecture and the text are both about inaccuracy in the US voting system. The text states that the current voting system is old fashioned and needs to be replaced with a more accurate and efficient computerized voting system, as the current one results in a lot of miscounts. It argues that many people accidentally vote for the wrong person because of bad eyesight, which is the biggest cause for inaccuracy. Not only that, but they rely on people to manually count the votes, where small mistakes are inevitable. A computerized system would make it easier to enlarge the text on the ballots and would probably reduce inaccuracy in counting. Officials also use technology all the time for similar tasks every day, so it must be reliable. The lecture however is doubtful, and argues that this would only cause trouble, since some people aren`t used to computers and might be discouraged from voting because they aren`t familliar with the technology. It also says that computers are still only programmed by humans, and any human msitake would also show up in the final result. If something goes wrong at this stage, it can result in thousands of miscounted votes, and a physical recounting would be impossible. To counter the previous text they also state that voting doesn`t happen very often and is therefore less used and reliable.
