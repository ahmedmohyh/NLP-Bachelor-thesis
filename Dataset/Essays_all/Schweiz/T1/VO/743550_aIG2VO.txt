Nowadays an important issue is how we should handle the voting systems. One part says that we should count it vote for vote like we did in the past. Others say that we should make an imporvement and change the progress to an automatic system. This would mean that all the voices would be count by computers. I, however, disagree with the fact that we should make a change.

For the beginning, I want to say that not just the humans make faults. Even the computers are able to fail. Imagine there would be a big ERROR by counting the votings for example the presindents voting for the USA in 2017. That would be worse than it would be when just a few voices would be missed.

Secondly, there would be a traditional problem. The system that we all know was been handling over an extrem long time so the humans are used to this situation. So is it right that we just change the whole way of counting even tough the old system has been working so well in the past? I don't think so.

As a conclusion, I think that we would make a big mistake if we would change the system. I think that the risk of an ERROR during an important counting would be too high. This would be unresponsible.
