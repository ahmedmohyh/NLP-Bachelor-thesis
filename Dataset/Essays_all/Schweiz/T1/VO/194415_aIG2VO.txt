Both the presentation and the text agree, that the current vote counting system has its flaws. Since people are voting on a piece of paper and the votes are counted by gouvernment workers. There is not much of a chance to oversee all of the counting, because there are too many ballots, Therefore it could be easy for one vote, or multiple ones to go missing. But aren't all votes supposed to count? They do count, but on the other hand, the computerized voting system is also rather easy to miscount. Technology is after all made by men and has men's flaws. 
Currently in the united states are a lot of elderly men and women. Quite a few of them can't see as well and they give their vote to another president canditate, simply because of their eyesight. This problem might be easy to solve, since technology could enlarge all these lists. But not all people are as comfortable with technology. This might stop them from voting. Many people in the US also don't have acces to such technogoly. Laptops, Tablets and Compuers are expensive after all. The presentation argues also, that it is too risky to start up a voting system online, since it is easy to have errors. Programs are likely to fail a few times, before newer versions are developped. But there are only about two votes in four years and there is no time for failure. Votings online are not compareable to everyday internet banking.
