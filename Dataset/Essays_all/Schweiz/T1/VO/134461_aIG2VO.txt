This presentation was about a voting system using computers. It showed all the risks that kind of system contains.
First of all, not everybody is used to coputers. Of course loads of students and business people these days work with computers everyday, but still a lot of people don't own a computer and don't know how to handle it.
There is also the fact that computers aren't just machines with their own, always-functioning brains. They are programmed by humans and humans make mistakes. It is therefore still risky to trust computers not to miscount. On the countrary is, what the text passage said. Namely that we can't trust humans and therefore have to replace them by computers for they are more sufficient: "computerized systems remove the possibility of human errors.". 
Another difference is that the text says that the everyone trusts computer technology because we do it every day with banking and communication. But in the presentation the women made clear that this isn't right: The systems of the banks and communications are used daily and heavily and therefore are improved over and over again. But voting only happenes once or twice a year!
