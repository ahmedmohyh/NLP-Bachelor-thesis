One of the pros of the modern voting systems is the easy touch screen so the governement doesn't have to count every single vote one by one but on the other hand people who can't use a computer have problems to select. They're discouraged or maybe a false vote will be chosen.
Some people have doubts of human error, like their elections are getting lost, miscounted or removed because they don't trust human. But the computer's program can count everything and for once, not like human if they're making a mistake they have to count again. But there are also some people who have doubts in electronics their vote's hacked or manipulated but this technology's used nationwide. Other complex computer technology daily using perfectly accurate in banking transaction as well as highly sensitive information.There are some mistakes but once a year there's a minimum chance of a second mistake and the technology's improved one by one. People have to develope more confident for modern technology.
