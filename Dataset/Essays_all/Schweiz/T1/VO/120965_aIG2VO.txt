In the text it is questionized if voting with computers is safer than by human beeing.
They say that the technology system will cause error because older people are not used to work with computers, they may click the wrong name or vote for both of the candidats. Another contra argument wich is mentioned is that the computers may cause thousands of error. Quite few are suspicious because they do not trust the computers, wich is absulotely understandable. But after all was a human hand wich installed the system. 
Defending the computers people  say, that we have to move on and evolve with the technology, plus one persons brain will shurly make mistakes from time to time. It is also mentioned, that we are nowerdays using computers in banking systems and they work perfectly accurate. After all it is a tricky questions why do not we leave it the way it is, it worked all the years before? Can we trust the voters, are they payed to count wrong?
The arguments are battling each other and there will have to be much more time invested to this in the future
