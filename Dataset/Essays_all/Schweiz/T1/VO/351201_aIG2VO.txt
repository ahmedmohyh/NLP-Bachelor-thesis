In the traditional voting system, there is always the possibility that people vote accidentally for the wrong candidat. Between many names you have to find the one, you actually want to vote for and make a small mark next to it. If you have a bad eyesight, that can be pretty hard.This might be prevented in a computerized voting sysem, but what if the people cant even use a computer. If the people never had one and are afraid of technology, there is no point in letting them vote on one. Another reason for a computerized voting system would be, to prevent human error. People have to count the votes one by one. It is easy to miss some. A computer programm would do that much more quickly and automatically. But what is not considered in that argumentis, that a computerprogramm is also made by humans. And if there happens a mistake in programming the computer not one or two votes get lost but thousands. And the last point is that the governments trust computer systems every day to be accurate in banking transactions and communication of highly sensitive informations. That is true but those programms are used every day. A voting system would only be used maybe twice a year. And these programms for the bank had to be improved over the years, they didn't work right from the beginning. And like I mentionned before. If a computer system fails, there is a much geater loss, than if a human misses one vote.
