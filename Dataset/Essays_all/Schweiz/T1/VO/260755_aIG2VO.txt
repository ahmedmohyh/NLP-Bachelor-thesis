In the presentation, they say that computerized programs in the United states aren't good, because the people, who don't use computers or can't afford them could have trouble with  this computerized programs. they could vote for the wrong candidat for example. Then, she says that the computer program could make errors, because it's made by humans. So it could habe thousands of votes wrong, because of a small mistake. in the traditional voting it could only have a few mistakes. The next thing, she says is, that we can't trust this program, because a computer program has to improve before it's good and they just vote once every two years and not every day, so its hard to improve the system fast.

In the text passage they say that the current voting system is inefficient and can lead to miscounting, because humans count the votes.
The candidates names are on a large sheet of paper and this is containing many names and you have to make a small mark to vote. people with a poor eyesight could accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. With a computer program, you could magnify the names, so that you vote correctly. 

In the presentation the woman says, that the computerized program should improve before it's used. But you can't improve a system if you never give it a try. She also says, that it could be hard for people, who aren't used to technology, to vote. But programs like this are always easy to understand.
