The speaker had a speach about voting systems and why e-voting is not the right thing, compared to a phyical voting system with sheets. She first mentioned the point, that not everybody is able to use a computer. There are many people  who do not know how to handle with electronic devices. Then she spoke aboutthe problems of modern tecnology itself. She beliefs, that also computers can break the system by human errors. In fact, computers are developed by humans. So the errors are made in the programing process. But the errors are even worse than only missing one or two ballots. Computer can make mistakes loosing thousands of votes. An other problem is that if there is an error, the votes can not be recounted because if the system is wrong, it simply is. But she also said, that the systems can be improved. As the e-bank systems for example. It also took a while until they were completly developed. This can be done in the United States, because they have votings every two years. 

The text sais that e-voting is much better than physical voting. The text also does not mention the case of a error caused by the computer system. The argument is, that nowerdays the bankdata with sensitive information is made by computers. The text sayst thst e-voting is the right thing, the speaker rather sais it will tae some time unitl it is safe.
