Some people doubt that computerized systems are going to solve the problems which occur in traditional voting. One of the disadvantages of computers is that not all people can afford one, thus participate in an online voting. Furthermore, there are still people that do not really know how a computer works, so they would definitely have some difficulties. Thirdly, computer programmes are developped by humans, and they had to be improved over many years, so it is only logical that computers do not work flawlessly and are able to break down too. If that happens, all of the results of the voting would be gone. The voting also can have an error and then the counts of the votings would be false. If a human makes a mistake, it would only cause small damage, because he still has the information, or oversees only two votes. Votings also happen only once or twice a year, so digitalizing the whole thing is unnecessary.
On the other hand, some think if the whole system is computerized, some people do not have to do the counting job. Also, if a programme works well and is being controlled on a regular basis, it does not make any mistake and there will also be no error. This opinion stands in contrast with the other one which claims that computers would cause greater damage. Another argument is that people with poor eyesight would have trouble marking the right candidate`s name on the ballot but computerized voting machines would have a touch-screen technology that is easy to use, and then there would not be wrong votings anymore. The people that have this point of view, think that using technology rather than humans is far better and faster.
