Critics want to have a voting system based on computers. They say that people today trust the technical devices. So why you don't use them to count the votes? There wont be any counting errors as if a human can make them. If there's an error made by counting by hand it takes a lot of time to recount every single vote and it would be much easier if a computer would do the same work quicklier and automatically. And the people with poor eyesight can put easier the mark on the right place, what seems to be quiete difficult with all these sheets of paper.
But on the other side there are problems too if everybody should vote be a computerized system. What will the older people do? They aren't used to work on a computer. What's no problem for teenies will be quite a difficult step for older man and women. And there won't be so many votings a year. May twice a your for the own country. So it don't seems that it would be worth to change the whole system. Computers have been improved by daily using, voting systems aren't used so often, so they may have more errors in it.  And the programms are made by humans, so human errors is still a topic - if there is one there could be even a bigger problem if the datas are removed or doubled or what else could happen.
