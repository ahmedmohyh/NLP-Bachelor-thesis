The text and also the heared presentation are about the current voting system in the United Kingdom. In the presentaition the presenter criticises that even nowadays we could not be sure, that everyone can work with a computer. An other effect is, that coputers are quite expensive. So there are also people who can't afford to buy one.
The text compares the old but improved traditional voting system with the new on the computer. One big advantage is, that the computer also knew, what you should do. That means: on a traditional ballot, you have to make ticks next to the name of the person, who do you want to vote for. It sounds easy but there are many ballots wich you can't count. Because the voter had voted for to many peoples or he had done it not that clear. On the computer you can only vote for one person and see the name really clear or even bigger than on the ballot sheet.
Another problem is that the officials must count the ballots very often, to be sure the result is treu. In a modern way of vote by computer, the computers can count the votes. There is the other problem. Can we trust our computers that much. the computer technology isn't that old and it gets improved every day. So is the computer ready to to that important thing for us? If you look at the things we make on it, like banking transaktions, we can say yes.
