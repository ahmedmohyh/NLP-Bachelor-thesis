Pro: People with bad eyesight and especially old people  may have problems marking at the right place on the big piece of paper. Computer technology would solve the problem with the integrated touchscreen technology. It is said that computers don't make mistakes. Humans on the other hand make a lot of mistakes wich in the worst case leads to a expensive recount. As well computerwork saves a lot of effort humans would have to give by counting each and every single vote by hand. That would as well save a lot of time and money once the whole system is running. Systems for communicating private information such as banking transactions have worked for quit a while now and we totally trust it, so why not trust the new voting system?

Contra: Technology might not be as trustworthy as we thought it was. Elections are only all two years and such a technology would need years to develop. Also mistakes made by humans are only a few, but a computer error could have a lot more serious consequences.Votes could be deleted or even manipulated. Another thing is that old peoplee may have problems using the new technologies. And what if there are people who can't afford a computer?
