Voting, which takes only place twice a wtice ayear in the United states affects the future of the USA because the president has to lead and take care of a hole country. In cause of that it is very importent that there aren`t going to be any fauts by counting the votes or or even vote for the false person. The courrent system critics say is inefficient and it has to change something. They want to change it to the digital way becaus they count the votes more efficient, faster and doesn't make human errors. But what would happen if the computer has a breakdown or something? All votes would'nt be able to count out, it would be a desaster and every voter would have to revote. The woman in the presentation it is wright, that there could be an error in programming the computer, because it has to be a person who program it and people aren't perfect. This faut would affect the whole voting and wouldn'd be a small counting faut. But we have proof after all this years working with computers epecially in bankinystems, that they work.
