The presentation about voting is comparing the ballot to a computerized system of voting. The presentation claims that the introduction of the computerized system could be difficult as not everybody undestands computers or can afford them. Opposed to this statement the article says that nowadays, in a world full of technology, everyone should be able to vote on a computer. A person could accidentally vote for a candidate not intended by clicking on the wrong name.
Altough the presentation questions if the computers actually are better than the ballots counted by humans, the article tries to explain that humans can make mistakes while counting and a big expensive recount has to take place. The presentation criticies this argument by stating that computer programs are written by humans and mistakes could also occur there. They say it would be a massive loss since there isn't be any physical data of the votes and a recount would not be possible.
Finally, the presentation states that we can't trust computers because they are a new invention and they aren't good enoug yet. In contrast the article explains this point by relating to banks and governments who are using the same technology.
