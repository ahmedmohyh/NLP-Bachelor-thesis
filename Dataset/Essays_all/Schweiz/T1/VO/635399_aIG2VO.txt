From time to time we do votings to vote diffrent things. Often we vote a person in a special job. But how we vote? It has diffrent typs of voting: One is the normal, that we have here in Switzerland, with votingpapers. But with this papers we have the problem that old people can't read sometimes the name of the candidate. Then they make a mark behind the wrong name. The speaker doesn't say anthing to the normal voting. Only that after the voting people count the votes and people make mistake. The text and the speaker are agree in this point.
The second type of voting is with computers. The advantage of computers is that we have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. People with poor eyesight can make the words bigger and so they make the mark next to the wright name. The text says that computer can count the votes better then people. The speaker aren't agree with this. She says that computerprogramms are made by people and people do mistaks. Another point is that when the computersystem has an error that whole voting is away. 
The text prefer a voting with computers and the speaker a traditional. Both have advantage and disadvantage.
