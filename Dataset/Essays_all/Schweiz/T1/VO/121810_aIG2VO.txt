First of all there are two main voting systems in the United States. There is the traditional one wich you can write your vote down on a paper or make a small mark on a large sheet of paper. The second system is the one on the computer. You can easily vote just by one click. Both systems have some pros and cons. In the text the they have many advantages for the computer voting and are against the traditional one. In contrary to the text the woman from the presentation  wants that the traditional one stays. She gave many disadvantages for the computer system. So she says for example if there is an error in the computersystem thousands of votes are away and there is much more work to bring them all back. In the text they describe that one man goes through all ballots and count the votes. So the risk that he makes a mistake is really high. A computer could easily count them itself and it would be much quicklier. This is a good argument for the computer voting but otherwise there are a lot of people who can't even handle with a computer. Usually old people don't have a computer and don't know how to vote with it. They can give the wrong vote or not that one wich they wanted to give. In conclusion there are many pros for the computer voting and some for the traditional one. It's not easy or even fair to say wich one of them is better.
