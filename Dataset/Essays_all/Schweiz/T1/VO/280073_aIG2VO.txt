In the presentation was said, that with computerised voting less people would go voting. First, because maxbe they can't handle a computer and so they don't go voting, because they fear that they can easily make a mistake. Second, because they don't trust in technology because the voting is only all 2 years. Maybe there can also be miscounts, same as if a person would do it. Also you can ask yourself if it's trustworthy or not, because the programs on the computers are made by humans.
In the text is written, that it would be easier with an computer because people who can't see that good can zoom in and so they can't mark the wrong name by mistake. It's also written, that a computer is more efficant and more correct at counting the votes because a person can easily make mistakes with so many ballots. The text sais, why don't trust in such programms when we are using it daily for banking transactions etc.
So the text sais the opposite to that what was said in the presentation.
