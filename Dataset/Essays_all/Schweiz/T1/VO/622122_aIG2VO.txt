There are huge problems which could appear if a computerized voting would be replacing the traditional voting system. Older peolpe aren`t used to work with a computer and like this there would appear some faults as well. They have a fear of technology. Another problem is that the programms aren`t safe either. If there would be any error in the programm it would have much worse consequences. Like this every person using the programm could be voting for the wrong candidate for example. Also the computerized voting system wouldn`t be used that much. Just twice a year. Other systems are used every day and the company can do improve the system every day. It would be necessary do check every detail of the voting system so tehre wouldn`t appear any faults.

They think that a computerized system would efficient without the people doing some faults. In traditional votings voters have to find their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names. People with pooreyesight can easily do some wron marks next to the name of their candidate. It`s sure that in both systems do appear faults.
