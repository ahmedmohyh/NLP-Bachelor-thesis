Officials must count the votes that means it's done by a human being, it's almost unavoidable that they will make mistakes. If a mistake is discovered, a really expensive recount has to take place. Maybe with the new computerized systems there would be less mistakes but that's not totally proved. Humans make mistakes and so can computers and if a technology mistake happens it would be a huge mistake. Officials can miscount one or two but computers can miscount thousands. It could also be a problem for people who can't afford computers.The positive of computerized systems is that it would be faster and in traditional voting it could be that they accidently vote for the wrong candidate because they have to find the name of their candidates on a large sheet of paper with plenty of names. It could be difficult to always mark the right one.
