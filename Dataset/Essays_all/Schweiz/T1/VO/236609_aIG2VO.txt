The Question is, if the traditional or a new tecnological voting system is better.
In the traditional voting system people get a list where they make a small mark next to that name they vote for. You cold easy marke the wrong one. By the computerized voting you cold touch on the name you vote for. But probablyit isnot much better because people who don't need computers constantly, who don't understand them or wors have a fear of tecnology can't or want not any longer go voting.
In the traditional system people count the results. Probably they misscount any votes so there have to be a second one, costing again more money. But if we replace it with a system, we are not sure there are no longer mistakes. The computerprogramm whitch would count the votes is programmed by people. There cold be mistakes. Even if the tecnology is used in manybanks andcommunication systems we are not shure. They are used daily and could be improved over a long time. Votings are just once every two years.
Both have advantages but you cant say that one is better than the other one. Perhaps it is the best thing if you cold combine both. So mor young people vold go voting,
