Some people say that voting by computers isn't a good idea, because many people don't have a computer or they don't use them often, so they don't know how to use them correctly. An other problem is that also computers sometimes have problems. But if they have an error not just some votes are counted false there would be thousands of false counted votes. The next problem is that you always have to improve the technology but you can't improve it good if you just use it all two years. 

In the article they think about the theme in another way. They say that it is easier also for old people, espacially for the ones with poor eyesight which have problems to mark the correct name on the large ballot which is normally used, because they just could touch the picture of the persone they want to vote for. They also say that Computer Systems count more exactly and that they are much quicker than humans. So if they have to recount because of an error the computers are much quicker than the humans who are counting every single vote.
