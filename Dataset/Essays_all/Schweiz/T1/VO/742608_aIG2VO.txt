computerized voting system

The person who wrote the text is for a computerized voting system. The people who apreciate this text have the opinion that the US voting system is inefficient. They say that computers are more trustworthy and far more efficient than humans because humans make mistakes. Especially the counting is a big problem. If they find a mistake the expensive solving will take place.
Another problem is the voting. The inhabitans get a big sheet of paper containing many names and they have to find their candidate. This is very dificult because it is a long list and the letters are very small. Especially for people who have problems with their eyes it is a challange to make the cross correctly. But a computerized voting system could solve these problems. As an example we make our daily buisnesses with the computer (banking) and we trust in computers. We should trust in computers and vote with them.

The person who spoke had another opinion. She thinks that the people who are not used to computers will have problems with an computerized voting system. There exist also many persons who are scared of technologies. 
She says that computers are programmed by humans and because of that computers will not make less errors. But the errors made by computers (humans) are much more serious than just a counting error made by a human being. She believes that for example the e-banking is just as good as it is today because it had many faults in the past. But because we use it in our daily life the problems were solved very fast. Because we do not vote that often she believes that we would have much more mistakes with voting than with banking. 

We see there are many arguments for and against a computerized voting system.
