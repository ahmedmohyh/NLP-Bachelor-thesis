It's discussed to change the voting system of the United States. Until now every ballot has to be count one by one and there are often mistakes in the counting. Now they want to computerize the whole system so it becomes easier to vote.
If the votings be on computer ît will be much easier to count the votes and computers wont count false. It also will be easier for people with a poor eyesight, because if the had to find the name on a large paper an mark it, like they had to in the old system, they can mark the false name. If they can vote on a computer they could touch it on a easy-to-use touch-screen and there will be less mistakes. The voting will be done quickly and without any count mistakes.
On the other hand if there are peple who are afraid of technology or don't use computers regulary they will have problems to vote on them. There's also the problem if the computer is programmed false the result will be completly false. Because computers are programmed by humans the chance that one computer has a mistake in his programm isn't that small.
