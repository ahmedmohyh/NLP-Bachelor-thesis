The presentation is against voting over a computer. It is easy for people, who use a computer every day, but poor people, who can't afford a computer or especially old people, who have a fear of technology would have many problems. Perhaps it's easy and quickly but how can we prove that the computersystem counts and works alright? Its programme is created by a human and humans make mistakes. In the text they say, that long and expensive recounts could be avoid, but what if 1000 votes are miscounted? And we don't realise and the resultat is not true? In the traditional system human also make mistakes but the errors of the computer we have to take very serious. In addition in the text is written, that today the banking transactions and the communication works flawless, but it was a hard way to get there where we are today. The banking and communication systems had to be improved various times and there aren't without mistakes today, sometimes they still have defects or errors. And in comparison to the elections, we use social medias every day, the regional election are only twice a year, the national elections every fourth year. We need to revise it various times to have it on the level that we can prove that it doesn't make serious faults and we don't vote that often to be sure that it works.
