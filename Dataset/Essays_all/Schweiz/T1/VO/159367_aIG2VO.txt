The united states' voting system relies strongly on human forces. Which means that the ballots are counted by real people. And these people are not perfect. In every counting there are for sure some mistakes which can not be avoided. Thats why some critics support the idea of technical voting systems. But as heard in the presentation before, it is likely that those voting systems on computers could fail too. If this were the case, it would have way more significant influences on the outcome of the whole voting. 
One of the mentioned examples and probably the most important would be the complete failure of a computerized voting system by mixing up votes of different candidates. Since the whole data would be stored only on computers and there would be no physical evidence for each personal vote this could lead to chaos. It wouldn't be possible to recount the ballots like in the traditional counting. 
If there were only electrical voting systems elderly people could be unable to vote and thus not even go to the votings. On the other hand people with visual disabilities could profit from a magnification of the candidates name to not vote for the wrong candidate. 
As a final interpretation I'd say that both systems do have their advantages, but if you never try something new, you can't improve the way it is today.
