Both, text and listening, include the voting and the problems of voting in the USA. It have been many troubles with the voting with sheet papers, because there were so many names and to many sheets to go through them. In taht way voters could easily tick or mark the wrong name. Now they tried to find a solution and wrote respectively told about pros and cons. One of this solutions is the usage of computers for the voting.

The text says, computers and more efficient and trustfully than human. And of course quicker with counting. They are obviously for computerized votes. In a screen you can find easier the name of the candidate you want. They say if the counting is made by humans, there could be miscounts and other mistakes. And if they make any mistakes they have to start over again. This would go to long. So solution is computer voting.

Nevertheless there are also problems with computerized voting. In the listening it was said that computers might be better for people who are used to. But the problem is how people who are afraid of every Technology gadget should vote if they even don't konw how to use the programm respectively the computer. Another Problem would be, if the computer should made a mistake but the counters wouldn't remark it. Although counting the ballots is very longlasting and durable, but if a mistake has been made, counters can easily correct it.
