Critics say in the text that it is better to use computer systems as voting systems because the current voting systems are inefficient and they lead often to the inaccurate counting of votes. They would like to replace our current counting systems with more efficient computerized voting systems. They say that these computerized voting systems have an easy-to-use touch-screen. 
But in the listening they said that these computerized voting systems could be very problematic for those people who do not use computers every day. It could be difficult for them even if the programm is easy-to-use. For example old people miss the right button and vote for another person than they wanted.
The critics in the text claim that the problem of our current voting systems is that they rely on the people who were counting the votes. They need to count every vote one by one. They have to deal with thousands of ballots. If someone finds an error a recount has to take place. 
The listening mentioned that the people who program a computerized voting system can also program errors. That means that thousands of votes get miscountet. And these systems get used once in a year they need to get developed. And if very much people use this computerized voting system it could be very slow.
