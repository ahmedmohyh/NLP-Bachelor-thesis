Should we change the way of how people vote? in the Text and also in the record I heard a few upsides and downsides wether or not to pass from the classic way of voting, with ballots, to a newer one, the computers. 

One big problem of the ballot is that people often vote the wrong candidate. The source of this problem could be  for example bad eyesight or just a lag of concentration. The Governament wants to pass from ballots to computers, better said they want everybody to vote from their own computers at home. But will this effect the solving of existing human errors in a positive way? Well this is not sure at all because what will we do with the older people that might not know how to use a computer? Or what do we do with the ones that can not afford one? It is way easier to tap the wrong candidate on the screen or to just not know how to vote properly. The other downside of having computers is that they can also make some mistakes in countig the results but this would be even worse the a human mistake because it would be impossible to recount all the votes again with accuracy.

Are we really sure that computers are better than ballots? Well we have seen some positive and some negative aspects of this evolution. Reporting to the record i have heard it would not be the best decision we could take.
