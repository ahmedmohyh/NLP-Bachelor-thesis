In the text they say, that for people it's much easier to vote with the computer, because you only need to touch the candidate's name on the screen and vote for him. But on the other hand, for people who never work with technology and computers, it's not that easy to vote like this. 

In the text they are really into the idea of doing the vote with the computer, because the vote counting is done quickly and it would hide the errors of humans.

At the presentation they say barely the same, but they're a bit more scaried because they think it's a long way until the technology is that reliable and able to count the votes without doing mistakes. Because the computers today had to be improved many many times, to be that good as they are now. They think it's not really necessary to do this with the computer, because in the US they just vote once every two years, so it's not important to do that with the computer.
