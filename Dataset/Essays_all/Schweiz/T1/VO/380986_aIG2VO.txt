The computer voting system seems to be easier than the old voting system, because of the precision on the couting of the votes that humans cannot have. But for people who dont't really like using computers and who do not use them really well, it can be really easy to make a mistake on the vote and to select the false candidate as what they wanted. 
That's not the only bad thing on computer voting, we know that people can easily hack the system and fake the votes in favor of one candidate for example. Some of the voters find it not really reliable.
But the USA is an huge nation, and it's really hard to make handwriting votes, there's so much voters and so much votes to count and it's really simple to make mistakes. 
Each two years, the nation vote for new candidates and that's more simple to use the computer voting system.
