The topic is about to compare the old and the modern type of voting especially in the United States. There are advantages and disadvantages for both sides. First we can say, that the text is against the old voting while the presentation is against the modern type of voting. In the text they talk about the human faults during the count of the ballots. But they voice part of this exercise talk about the computer faults during the count of the ballots. The argument is, that the voting programmes are also made from human. In the old voting system they both see problems with people, who have healvy problems maybe because of their age (they are not able to see 100 pro cent anymore) or also with guys, who can not afford a computer so they are not up to date and become problems with the new technologys during the voting. The consequences of this problems are, that they maybe vote for the opposite site of their wish candidate. We also have to say, that the both types can be manipulated through online hackers or even the vote-counters.
Finally we can say it would be the best to give the voters the choose between both systems. So they can go for the system, which is more familiar for them.
