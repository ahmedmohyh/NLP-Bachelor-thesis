In the US it's every election the same old thing: counting thousands of votes. Now there is a new computersystem which will do the work for those who count the votes.
There are a lot of misscountings if you count one by one, if a computersystem is programmed well, there wan't be such miss countings. In addition to that, the voter must reed a huge list of names for who they can vote and make a mark next to their favorite choice. But the names are very small, and people with poor eyesight can easily make mistakes. The computersystem will help those people to find their candidate and vote for they who they think are the best
A copmutersystem for voting may seem easy for some people, because, they use computers every day, but what about the other people. Some people don't use a computer and are afraid to use one, when they're voting. Furthermore a copmutersystem may be faster, and makes fewer mistakes, but didn't a human programmed a computer? If a human makes a mistake it may be some votes count or not count, but if a coupmutersystem makes a mistake, it will be thousands of votes vanished. In addition to that it will take to long to developpe the the domputersystem and make it comfortablefor everybody.
