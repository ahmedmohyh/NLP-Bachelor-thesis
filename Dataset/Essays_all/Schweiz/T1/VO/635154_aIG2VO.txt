Computers are daily used by millions of people, but would you let them count the votes from a whole country? That's the question, that's now discussed in the United States. The ballon, wich is used now, is very inefficient and can imporve many mistakes, like misvotes. Now they think about a better way to solve that problem: Computers. We trust them and they just very rarely do mistakes. But what if one of those mistake happens, when they vote for the new president? Then there are thousands of people, who couldn't vote, because the system wasn't working. For many people it's surely a good idea to change to the humans best electronic friend, but what about the people wich can't afford one of those or people, who don't know how to use them? This can get them into big troubles. Of course computers do most of the time a better job than humans,but they are also programmed by humans so if they aren't perfect, even if we believe that. Maybe they are way more efficient and faster, but for most of the humans it's a to big risk and the have a big fear, that it won't work.
