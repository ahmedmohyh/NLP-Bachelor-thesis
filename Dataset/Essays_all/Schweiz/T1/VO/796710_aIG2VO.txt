Some people say that the current voting sytem used in the United States are inefficient. This means that the final result of votes can be inaccurate.They want thatthe traditional voting system will be replaced by a new far more efficient computerized voting. Beacause misscounts are a big problem. 

But computerized voting systems aren`t perfect. Thats the meaning of the expose. They are easy to use for mostly young people who dont`t have any problems with seeing and are using the new technologie quite often. But for those who dont`t have any experiance with computers it`s hard to vote correctly. Also computers are made by humans which means that they can`t be perfect. Votings are rarely so they can`t test the computericed voting system very often. In the traditional voting system are humens which count the votes by them selves. Sure they can make mistakes but if ther is a problem with a computerized system it could be possible that thousands of votes are being deleted. Only when computers are fully trusted we should use them. 

The text also says that it`s risky to yous the computerized voting system but they also say that the traditional version does also has mistakes. Because of there is a big list with little written names of candidats which can easy be missread.
