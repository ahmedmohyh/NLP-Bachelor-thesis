In the USA the voting system has became a hot topic of discussion. A lot of people fume at the fact of how outdated their counting system is whilst others fear change and would prefer to keep the same system. In this essay I will write about the points made by each side and compare them. 

One argument for change is that computers are more efficient than human beings. The other side believe that computers are as prone to mistakes as humans and that they can wreak havoc if there is a mistake, because if a computer crashes you lose thousands of votes and cannot recount them. People who want more technology believe there is less human involvement which would mean less recounts and scepticism amongst voters. People who are against change believe that computers may scare off older voters as they would struggle with this modern technology. 

technology would of course benefit these voters massively. At first it may seem like a bad idea but our society has to progress and make changes to improve.
