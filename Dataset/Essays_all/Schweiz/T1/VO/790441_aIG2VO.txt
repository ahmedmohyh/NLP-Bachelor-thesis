The text says that the old voting system isn't still good enough. There are many problem it says, for example that the people accidentally vote for the wrong person or that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name when they have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names. Another problem is also, that counters make mistake. So in the text they say it would be much better if we would computerize the votings, so the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers and the humans don't have to deal with thousands of ballots. 

But in the audio they say it wouldn't be better with a computerised system. Because also the computers are programmed by humans. So also a computer can make mistakes. And they think that the mistakes of the computers are worse than the ones of the humans. Because the humans only can make some counting mistakes. But the computers they could also maybe delete all the votings if the computer get destroys. So in their opinion we can't trust the computers.
