In the listening text was the theme the critic about the new voting system. They are saying, that this is easy for the people which are using computers normaly every day, but it is not that easy for the people who are not using computers. It has a high chance, that these people are case the wrong vote, because they have no idea how to use a computer. Otherwise the text says that in traditional voting people are accidentaly mark the wrong candidate on the ballot because they can't see very well. 
Another argument in the listening was, that the computers are made by humans and so the computers have also mistakes in it. They can die and all the votes, they were counting are lost, or they can have a informatic problem and it counted it wrong. In front of that the text is saying, that the ballot can be get lost and it needs a lot of time to count all of these ballots. The computer just counts them in a few seconds.
Both texts are vergleichen the count system with the banking system on the computer. The listening text tells us, that the banking system is used every day and because of this most people are knowing how to use it, but the voting system is just used every two years in the USA and this could become problems. But the text is saing that we trust the banking system and so we can also trust the voting system.
