The purpose pf this essay is to compare the lecture and thoe text written above. As it is mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, computers may not make voting become easier. Computer might be a good tool for people who are used to them and to people who can afford to have one. People with less experience and knowhow have little to no relation to the computer technology. It is said that humans make mestakes, but wouldn't this mean that computers have errors too,since they are programmed my human? So, if for example one voting programm has a lack of efficency, thousands of other computers with the same programm would be mistaken in the couting of votes. The lecturer said that human couting systems have developed since they first got used, but if you copmare these words to what the written text saiys, it can be looked at as being wrong. It is said that current voting systems in the USA are infficent and often lead to inaccurate couting of votes, Critics say that the system has to be replaced by computers, since more and more people accidentally vote for the wrong canditate. As a last point, that the biggest fault of the bad voting system is the human error of miscounting, is this really true?
