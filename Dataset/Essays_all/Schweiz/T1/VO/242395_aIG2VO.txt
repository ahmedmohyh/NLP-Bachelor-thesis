In the text it says that computerized voting is more efficient and trustworthy than counting of votes, because when human count the votes they miscount often. But, in the audio they say that computer doesn't have to be better. Not everyone uses a computer and knows how to use it. Some of the people have also a fear of the technologie or aren't sure about the technologie. The computerized voting program is also made by humans. What if they make a mistake during the programation? As you can see the possibility to remove the human error isn't solved. Humans miscount about ten counts, but when the program is damaged the computeried voting will miscoult about tousends of counts. In the text they also write about the banking trasactions which we use every day and how perfect they are, but in the audio they say there is the problem. Voting can't be accurate as banking transactions because we transactions we do every day and computerized voting only twice in a year or something.
