Both of these articles talk about the problem of changing the voting system. Even though they mainly focus on the US, these theories can be applied to pretty much every democratic country. There are definitely multiple valid arguments for both oppositions. 
Firstly, the text mentions that votes counted by people are often inaccurate and can lead to huge differences in the outcome of the vote. The audio-based article follows up with talking about the programs that would be used to count the votes. It mentions that these applications are programmed by humans and an error in a program would have a way worse effect in the end. After all, human error occurs everywhere but if a computer makes these mistakes automatically without realising, the final product is completely ruined. 
A second argument in the text is that computer-based voting allows people to just click on the candidates name rather than having to cross out different tiny squares that are barely visible to people with poor vision. Furthermore, the websites would include a zoom-feature. This point is conquered by the fact that not everyone in today's society can afford a computer. Even if they're in the financial position of buying such a device, they might not be fully used to online voting and they could be discouraged if they're not quite familiar with their PC. 
Another thing the audio-track mentions is that there's no physical evidence of the votes. Once a miscount takes place, there's no going back to check who people voted for. 
Since the elections in America take place every two years, it would be extremely stressful to fix bugs in the system in a reasonable amount of time. These programs might not work flawlessly and that could lead to a fatal error once the elections are due again.
