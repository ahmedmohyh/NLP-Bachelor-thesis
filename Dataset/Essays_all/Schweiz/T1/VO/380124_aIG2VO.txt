The woman said, that a computerized voting would cause problems, because it would just be easy for the people, who are used to computers. She said, that a lot of people have trouble with computers and this people may have problems to vote the way they want to vote. And that would cause even more wrong votes as with the traditional voting system. Another problem would be, that if a mistake happens it probably will be a huge one and that will cause huge problems, because there is a possiblity, that a lot of votes may have been for the wrong canditate and maybe some votes are even deleted. Her last point was, that in comparison with the banks and other companys, who use the computer the whole time, can fix the mistakes easy, because they have enough experience with the computer,but the voting is just every two years, so they can't have enough experience ,so they will eventually make mistakes. I think her first point doesn't really make sense, because the people who are not that good with computers can ask someone they trust, who is used to computers, to do the vote for them just like they do in the traditional voting. As for the experience part of her speech i think that if yu have the votes only very two years, you should be able to not make any mistakes, because you have two years of preparation. And if they programm everything the way it should then the computer will do the rest and that would be a help for everyone.
