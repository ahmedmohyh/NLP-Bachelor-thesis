The lecture takes the exact opposite opinion than the text. It takes every point mentioned in the text and weakens the argument with its own statement against a technological voting system. So it starts arguing with the fact, that not all people are used to computers or voting with computers. This specific inconvenience may cause both, either accidently wrong votes, or no votes at all due to fear of technology. Furthermore a computerprogramm has been programmed by a human, so it can also be affected by human errors during the programming process. If such a case occurs, the error makes damage on a much larger scale than if everybody votes manually and it can lead to up to 1000 or more uncounted or miscounted votes. On top of that it wouldn't even be possible to make an easy recount on computer basis, which would lead to the necessity of all people voting again. Last but not least they mention the argument that society can only trust heavily on modern technology because of its use on a daily basis. At the beginning the system was full of errors and only due to its frequent usage, it was able to improve. Votings in America are only held once every two years or twice every month on a regional basis, which would never be sufficent to improve the system as quick as neccesary.
