Voting problems

The traditional voting with the long sheet of paper has the problem that there are missvotings, because of the older people, who have poor eyesight.In the reason they don't see so good the chance would be high enough to tick a wrong person. 
The voting on a computer voting is very good for modern people, because they know how to use the computer. For older people or don't have use any electronic devices it would be difficult to vote with the computer. There are about thousents of missvotings. The positive aspects on computers are that the counting of the votes would be easily, because the eectronic device would do that for one. In contrast the sheet votes has to be count one by one and the risk to count a vote wrong is big enough.
The votes would be count again if there would be a misscount but in the text they say that there is a misscountig of a human being the computer will count the votes easily and correct.
