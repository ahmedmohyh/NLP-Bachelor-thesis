The presetation and the text represent two opinions on the voting system.
The presentation says that it would be much of a problem if the people had to vote on computers in the future votes. It says that people who never use computers would have trouble understaning how to vote.
Also computers would not work flawlessly. The computers that people rely on banking for example have been updatet and improved over the years. They did not work as good as now when they were first used. They were improved because they are used on a daily basis. The voting computers on the other hand are only used every two years. This is not sufficient to improve them to work flawlessly. The comuters could misscount thousands of votes or even discard them because there is a problem in the programm, which is writte by a human who could have made mistakes in the process of writing it.
It would be less of a problem if only few votes are misscounters by the people who count the ballots than thousands of misscounted votes by the computer.
The presentation is stating the opposite of what the text says.
The text supports the comouters and the presentation criticises them.
