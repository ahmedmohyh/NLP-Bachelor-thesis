The current voting system has its pro's and con's but how can we proceed an election without making any mistakes? 

The traditional voting system has made its job for a long time now. The main problem is that people can easily mark the worng name and if that happens to often we will get the situation which we are having now in the US. Two candidates for the White House but actually none of them are completly wanted from the habitants of the United States. 

The question is will comouterized election be more usefull? As in the audio explained PC's are also made from humans and who can make sure that mistakes won't occur with computerized election? Of course we use them daily in the economy or as a working instrument but there is a difference in relation with the election. Banking transactions are made every day, whereas elections are proceeded every two to four years. The computer has been improved during the last year's in order to make them reliable. 

As the system of election has brought up president's which have made the USA the strongest country in the world, I don' t think a change is needed.
