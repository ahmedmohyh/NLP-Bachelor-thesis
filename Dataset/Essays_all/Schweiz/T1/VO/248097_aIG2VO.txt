As the text says, people make mistakes when they want to vote for their candidates, because of the number of listed candidates on the ballot. Afterwards, the officials make mistakes by counting a wrong number of votes. These are inevitable mistakes. That's why the text proposes computerized voting. Computers are programmed to count the exact number of votes for each canditate by immediately record a vote after someone has touched the screen. They are also easier for people to handle, for example by magnifying the candidates' names if someone has poor eyesight. 
The presentation expressed a totally different opinion. It was said that the idea is doubtful, since computers are also programmed by humans. So if the critics don't trust humans, they can't trust computers either. People who do not have computers at home, or who don't know how to use a computer, such as older people, would not be able to vote on computers because of their fear of technology. If unluckily, an error is programmed in the computer, this will lead to thousands of following problems within the years, and maybe noone will find out. As people only have to vote once every two years, it is not necessary to change the usual voting system to a new one.
