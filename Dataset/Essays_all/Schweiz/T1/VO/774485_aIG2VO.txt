The speaker believes that computerized voting is hard for people who are not used to using computers. Because of this they can easily cast the wrong vote. The author of the text however believes the opposite ist true. He thinks that traditional voting leads to more people accidentally voting for the wrong person, as it is hard to find a small name on a long list and to make a mark next to it, which makes it especially hard for people with bad eyesight.

The speaker also believes that human error will still be a problem with computerized voting, as the computer programs used are still written by people. These people can still make mistakes and mistakes in these computer programs can have far more serious consequences than just miscounting a couple of votes. The author of the text however thinks that computer programs will lead to less human error, as it is very likely for people to miscount votes, which leads to expensive recounts. He thinks computerized voting removes the possibility of human error.

The speaker further does not agree with the authors argument that, as computer programs work without any problems in banking systems they should work well with voting.The speaker argues that banking programs were not perfect in the beginning and the reason they work now is because they are used on a day to day basis so that problems can quickly be spotted and fixed. Voting programs would only be used every couple of years. This will make it hard to find mistakes in the program before it is too late.
