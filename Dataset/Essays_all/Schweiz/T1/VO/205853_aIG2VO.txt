There are quite different opinions about the voting methods in the US. Many blame the traditional methods for inaccuracies, while their opposition argues, that computerised voting would not be any better, if not more problematic. 

The first argument is that of accidental wrong voting. To vote, one must find the name of ones candidate on the ballot and make a small mark next to it. Except for the fact that one can mark the wrong name anyway, people with poor eyesight are almost certain to miss it. A computerised system, for example with touch-screens, would allow one to vote by just tapping the correct name, and since one can magnify the image on the screen, it could be easely seen. This argument is countered by the fact that many people, especially older people, are not very familiar with using a computer, or that they are doubtfull about it, so computers would not be the best solution for everyone.

The human error when counting could also be removed by using a computer to count the votes, and furthermore it would be much faster and easier. On the other hand, humans programm the computers that do the counting, so an error could slip in there as well, but its consequences would be of a much bigger and more fatal scale than when some votes are misscounted, and since the votes can't be found in an actuall, material form, thousands of votes could be lost.

Finally, computer systems used in everyday life, like e-banking, have been around for a wile and they are indeed used every day. Still, when they were first created and started being used, they were far from flawless. Just because of daily use the errors were noticed and the programms improved. Since elections in the US are not nearly as often, it could take years for errors to be noticed, but without even giving it a try, voting will stay complicated since the technology in that domain will rest undiscovered.
