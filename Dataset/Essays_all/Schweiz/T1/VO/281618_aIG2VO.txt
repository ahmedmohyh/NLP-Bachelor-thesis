Is the electronic voting system better than the classic one?

The main topic of the presentation and also the text, is the question about which voting system is better. The writer of this text has the oppinion, that the current voting system should replaced by a voting system controled by computers, because computers don't make faults as easily as humans do. The oppinion of the woman who is holding the presentation, the voting system should be the as it used to be. Her main argument is, that the programms, who should be used to count the votes, is also programmed by humans. She also said, that there are some people out there who are afraid uf using computers and technic, or who simply aren't used to use a touchscreen. With this kind of voting, there are some people who probably would like to vote, but don't visit the electionoffice, cause the aren't used to computers. A other thing she mentioned was, that if the programm makes a fault, then everybody has to vote again, but when a human makes faults, then there are just a fey votes missing. Critics of the idea of the new voting system say that it is much more difficult to vote when you do it by computer, while the ones who would do it say, that it is easier to vote with a computer than chosing a name from a very long list. The also mention, that people with bad eyesight can easily make their cross at the wrong name.
