The current voing systhem of the United States are often critisized so there's the new idea of only using computerized systems. The major problem in the current voting systhem appears to be that people "accidently vote for the wrogn candidate" as shown in the text above. But the question is if this problem coul be solved with the computerized voting system, then only people that are used to computers would understand the voting on a electrical dewice. Old people or people that can not afford a computer for example would have difficulties to use it correct and there for it can appear that a person accidently votes for the wrong candidate. There's also people with a fear of technology and those would most likely not give their vote  so the United States would lose soe importent votes. Also there as to be asked the question if we're sure if our computers would be better and more trustful in counting the votes then the todays system in which humen beeings count them. There's no doubt that the people counting the votes do not make any mistakes but wouldn't computers make mistakes too? A computerprogram is programed by a human beeing which can, as seen before, show some humen mistakes. In todays voting system a computer can recount all the votes and maybe improve the mistake a human could have done. If a computer counts those votes already fro start on there couldn't be a seound recount of a computer. Last but not least todays votin system has improved and developed since many years.
