The person in the audio file doesn't agree with the information given in the sort text above. To be more precised, she says the exact contrary of every point.
While the text tells us that it would be easier to vote with computers, because people wouldn't put the small mark on the wrong place, the person in the presentation says that this vote system wouldn't be fair, because not all people own a computer or even have internet access. When the text points at people's almost certain failure of counting and adding correctly and precisely thousands of votes, she says that a computer program could make an even bigger difference. This, according to her, is because the programs are still made by humans, and if the humans have errors, why should there be no risk that the program has an error?
Next, she says that she wouldn't trust the system. It could be manipulated or insecure too easily, and we see that in other systems, too. On the opposite, the text says that we also trust our banking systems or other complex computer technology that we use daily.
