In the presentation was said, that if the voting will be computerized it will be only better for people who are used to computers. Older people or people who don't want to use technology wouldn't be able to vote anymore. An other statement was that computer and computerprograms still are made by humans.And humans make faults.If something would be wrong with the program for counting the votes it would be worse than if a person will make a fault if she/he counts the votes. Because if the computer has an error it might be one thousand votes which aren't coutend right. If the U.S.A really wants to change their voting systems it will be very hard to test if the program and the computers will work. And votes in the United States are quiet rare so there wouldnt be many chances to test it.

The written text sais that a new, computerized voting system would be better or less difficult for everyone. It would help even old people because their eyes aren't that good anymore. In the little writing the names are written is it often difficult to find an cross the right names. Old people shouldn't give in a wrong vote by an accident with the new technology but most of the old people aren't used to computers and wouldn't be able to give in their vote this way. And in text is said that it will give less errors. But if the computer breaksdown oder isn't able to count right it will be worse because it will incloud much more votes.
