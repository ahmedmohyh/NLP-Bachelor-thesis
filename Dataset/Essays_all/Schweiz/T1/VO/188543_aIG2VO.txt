Many people critc the voting systems in the United States. The counter could make mistakes or he could forget to count every ballot. Why they aren't able to change their voting systems. A main aventage is if they changed their systems to computerized voting systems, the would have much problems as well. Today, the computers aren't reliable enough. Computers were programmed by humans and we know that humans are able to make mistakes as well. Furthermore, the elderly, who weren't use to grow up with computers, don't have enough experience with computers. It is very difficult to learn using the computer. Today the old voting systems are inefficient and insecure. On the other hand, the ballots couldn't be misscounted. It's annoying, when officials must count up every ballot one by one. So it's really easy to make mistakes. A other important problem is the people with bad eye sight couls mark the wrong person. 
In conclusion, the computerized voting systems aren't reliable enough but you just have to vote twice a year.
