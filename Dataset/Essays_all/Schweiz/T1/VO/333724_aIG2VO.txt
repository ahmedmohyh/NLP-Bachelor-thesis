Basically both texts start at the same situation, during elections there is much space for human mistakes. Voting papers get lost or people with bad eyes elect the wrong person by accident. The question is as simply as tricky, are computerbased systems a better solution? The argruments in the text say yes, then computers are programmed with processes which want make any mistakes, like voting accidentally for the wrong canidat and with computers there is the possibility to count all the votes in an easy and timesaving way. The position of the spoken part is completly different, it says that it's impossible to creat a voting programm for people who aren't good with computers. Furthermore thers no security that those human-written programms make no human mistakes. A       fact is, that if a mistake happens during a computer-based election the resulting problems are far more grave, it could be that a election has to be repeated completly if a mistake happens. Another point in the speech is, that we can't compare voting programms with other daily computer systems then they were tested an used over years and a voting system would only be used one time in two years.
