The first text highly recommends to use a computurized system. Some of the biggest flaws of the traditional voting system are the mistakes made by the people who count the votes and the efficiency. A computer can count the votings much faster. Also it states that computers are safer because there are thousands of institutions and even the government who trust the technology. With a computurized system it's easier for people to find their candidate of choice and it's less likely that they will accidentally vote for the wrong person. Finally, it's quite obvious that computers will do the job of counting the votes much faster than people will. The lecture takes a different look at this subject. The computurized system may be of good use to people who are working with computers on daily bases. But for people who have trouble working with technology or aren't used to it, it might cause trouble. This could lead to less people voting. Also if people can make mistakes, why can't a computer. Actually if a computer makes a mistake it's more likely to have worse consequences then a few miscounted votes. Because the voting system is only used once every two years nationally and a few times in the year regionally, they can't be sure if the system is trustworthy. People probably won't fully thrust the computurized system.
