In the United States, they have a problem with the inefficent and inaccurate counting of votes. So this can be very important when it is a close election. So critics say, that the traditional system is too old and should be replaced by a new more trust worthy election system. 
In the old system there you have a large sheet of paper with many names on it. So it's very complicated for some people to find there favourite candidate.
So with the new system it would be much more easier to vote with touch-screen your candidate. 
Another problem with the traditional voting system is, that the ballots will count by humans. So it would be better and more accurate when this would do a computer for us. 
Altough it's not too risky to change the voting technologie because the computer now a days are so safe that even bank transactions can be make with no problems.
