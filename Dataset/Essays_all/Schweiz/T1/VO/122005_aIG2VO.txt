In contradiction to the one in the text the opinion shown in the presentation is very critical about a computerized voting system. They doubt the system being more accurate. Preferedly they would like to keep the traditional voting technique, where the ballots are filled out and counted by hand. Of course human error could occur, but so can in a computerized vote. It is still humans who fill out the voting questionaire and humans also write the voting programm. That taken into account it is clear that people who are not used to a computer, because they might can not afford one or they rarely use them, might be a little overwhelmed  by it and tick the wrong window or name. This human errors are small compared to those an error in the programm itself would be. If this happened, the whole voting would be wrong. People, who are for a computerized vote, say that also e-banking can be efficiently and almost error free used, but those systems are in use for quite a long time. And in the beginning there were lots of troubles with those systems. And it took e-banking some years to develop and become actually useful. Furthermore is e-banking in daily use and voting will not be. So how can a programm be enhanced, if it is in use only once in a while?
