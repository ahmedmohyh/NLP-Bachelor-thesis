The voting systems used in the United States are critizised. Some people who don`t like the traditional system think it would be better, if there were computer systems who wouldn`t make mistakes like human. Also it would be easier for the voters and they won`t accidentally for the wrong candidate. In the presentation heard that also the computer system has problems. There are many arguments against the computer system. In the text they said the humans make mistakes and the computers wouldn`t make mistakes but computers are made by human and so they could have done a mistake or the programmasion of the computer has a mistake. We can`t trust the computers completly also because the elections are not often.  Another problem is, that the votings aren`t physically there if the computer crashes the votings are lost. Also for the voters it may be difficult because some people aren`t used to work with computers especially the older people could have problems and in the worst case the would`nt vote anymore.
