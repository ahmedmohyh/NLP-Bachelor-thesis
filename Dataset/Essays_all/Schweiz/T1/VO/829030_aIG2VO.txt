First I want to explain the arguments which are against a computer system for voting in the Usa. When the computer system makes a mistake
and this could be, because coumputer programs are made from human beings, the mistake would be very big, one wrong click and thousand of elections
would be  wrong. And like in handwriting not everybody can handle computers, maybe they dont know how to use it and make also mistakes.A big question is:
How can you be sure that computers make a better job then the traditional voting? Computer systems have to be improved over and over again this is a process in many years but this system would be used only once in four years! So these arguments are in many ways quite different to those in the text,
They say that computer systems cant make mistakes and theyre is no possibility that teyre wrond. Also that its much more difficult to vote by hand than with the computer. They also say that many people with poor eyesight chose the wronf candidate. They also say that it would be a very long process when you have 
to count all the votes. So know I want to summerise the diferences between the sides. One side says that the humans cant trust such a big computer system and that this system also could make mistakes, and the other side says that computers are kind of perfect, so that the cant make any mistakes and that its much more safe to vote with computers than by hand.
