In our days computers get more and more important. We use them for so many diffrents things, to look up facts, play games, chat, control finance issues and work. So it's not surprisingly that people discuss to use computers in voting too. Both texts discuss this topic but one is for computer voting system and other against it.
The spoken report is against technology for voting. One argument is that not every voter is used to computers so many people would have trouble in voting at the computer, but the other side in the written text promises that it's easy to use and every one will get along with the program.
Antother discussing point is how trustworthy these technological systems are. If the computer systems cause an error, many thousands votes will be count wrongly and the results can't be recount. Human errors aren't that heavy. In the essay it's said that computers make less errors.
So there are two parties with diffrent arguments. One side thinks it makes it easier and safer, the other say it doesn't. But who of them is right?
