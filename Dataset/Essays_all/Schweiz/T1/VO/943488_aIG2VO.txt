In the just heard voice memo the woman criticed computerized voting. She agreed with the fact that mistakes are being made in the current voting system but that the computerized version can not be completely reliable either. Her first doubt about this new system concerned the people who do not know how to use a computer properly. A major consequence of this could be a decrease of voters. What another major problem is, is that not veryone in the world owns a computer. What would these people do? Would they just not be able to vote because they do not own enough money to afford one? As I said already, she also considered the fact that humans make mistakes which influences the voting result. Though adding onto that, she argumented that computers are also made from humans and are just as able to make mistakes. But when a computer makes a mistake it can have way bigger consequences in comparison to when a human makes a mistake. In case an error develops the whole system could crash. Her last argument was based on the effiency of developing such a program. She compared it to the internet. The Internet is only as great as it is today beause we had years of developement and improvement. Though we only have elections every few years, meaning there are not as many chances and possibilities to improve and develop such a futuristic system.
