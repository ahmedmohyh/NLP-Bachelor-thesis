The traditional votings system in the United States today are ineffcient and often inaccurate because often the votes were counted wrong. In the traditional voting system voters have to find the name of their cadidate on a large paper. On this paper there are many other names and people with poor eyesight may vote for the wrong candidate. This voting system also depends on a lot of people who count the votes, throught this it mistakes are made easly, when such a error accure a long and expensive recount has to follow. Finally a advantage of a new system which depends on modern technology is that it would be less risky the the traditinal system and we already trust complex computer technology, so why not do have it in voting.
The disadventages of a new system would be that people who are afraid of new technologies or don`t know how to use a computer can easly cast a wrong vote. Also computers may have less errors but who writes the computer programms? Humans so it can come to errors too, but the would be much worse. When such a error accurse a recount would be nearly impossilble because the votes aren`t physical. Finally every new computer system needs improving, and at the beginning they would be a lot of errors, but because they aren`t a lot of voting happening it would be difficult to eliminate these errors.
