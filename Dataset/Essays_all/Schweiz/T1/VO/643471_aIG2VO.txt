According to the text the momentary voting system is outdated and needs to be replaced by a computerized voting system, in the lecture on the other hand it is mentioned that people should be doubtful about computerized voting, and that it may cause some troubles for people that do not get along or are frightened by computers, so non-digital people might not be voting at all, due to their lack of digital knowledge or their fear from computers. Another point the lecturer mentions which is facing against the argument of the text that computerized voting removes the possibility of human error, is that computers wouldn't be doing such a good job, since humans make errors and computers are programmed by humans also computers would be making errors themselves.
A big problem with digital votes is also that there is no physical record of the votes, which could lead to votes not being processed the right way or being deleted or not counted due to software issues, which is not mentioned in the text. On the argument of the text that computers are also used in governments, banks and individuals the lecturer says that these system weren't perfect from the beginning on, but had to be proofed first as well. But since votes are not a daily business, as banking or individual computer transactions are, the computers would make many mistakes and it would take years to be able to correct all the software errors, if they would even be found.
