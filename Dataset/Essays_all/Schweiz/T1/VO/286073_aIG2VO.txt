The text and the speech are both about the voting system in the US. It is a comparisation between the traditional voting system and the computerized voting system. Both of them are not that relieable but which one is better?

In the text they said that the computerized system is much better than the traditional system but in fact both of them have theire pros and cons. Other than in the text said the computerized voting system have many unrelieable things. First of all the systems are made from humans and if we can't trust them to count the ballots why should we relie onthe program they made? If the programm has a fault the damage is even bigger than just miscount some ballots. Another problem is that if an error is detected the computer can't recount the votes because it isn't safed in the system. Eventought we live in a computerized world many elder people can't use a computer so how should they be able to vote. Also there are many people who can't aford a computer so they can't vote as well. The last argument about the computer technology in banking transactions is quite incomparable because we use these systemes everyday and those systems are proved by every user. In everyday use the user will find errors and the system will be remade, but the voting machines are used only for voting. In the US a national vote is about once every two years and the machines won't be used more than twice a year so the error can't be detected that fast.
