Now I'll show some pros and cos of computer voting system. These arguments are based on a text and on a speach. The following arguments for the new system are mentioned in the text. An advantage of the new system is that it is more efficent because it doesn't need people to count the votes. The computer can do everything. Additionally there are less people who vote accidentally for the wrong candidat. On the paper people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wong name and on the copmuter they can click only on the name. So all in all the new system makes eyerythink faster and easyier. But is this system really useful and also safe?. A big disadvantae of the computers are that there are many people who can't afford computers. It can happen that they vote wrong because they don't know how a computer works. Other even don't vote, they are afraid of the technology. In addition to all this the copmuter system is daily and heavily used so a mistake can easily happen. The system can be overloaded or the votes wrong counted. This are the negative arguments based on the speach. So all in all we can see that the arguments of the text are for the new system and those of the speach are against. In my opinion the arguments of the text are stronger.
