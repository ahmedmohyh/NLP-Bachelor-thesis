Voting in the United States today is made by humans voting on paper and other people who count it and put it all together. Should we better develop computer systems to vote and count or not? The speaker sais yes, for a couple of reasons. 
The speaker's argues that computers don't necessarly make voting easier for all kind of people. For example people who are not used to working with computers can easily make mistakes with filling out the voting tallon. She argues that especially elderly people may have problems with that. for those people computer voting would be more complicated as opposed to the text.
In the text it says also that humans can make mistakes by counting. But computers can make mistakes too which would be far worse and bigger than those made by humans directly. Computer programs are developed by humans too so there could also be errors in the program. 
Another of her arguemnts is that computer can not make a recount where normal count as we have it today can do a recount. 
Finally the voting system as we have it today was improved over decades and always has worked so why would we change it now when it is so good and spend so much time and money with developing a new computer program!
