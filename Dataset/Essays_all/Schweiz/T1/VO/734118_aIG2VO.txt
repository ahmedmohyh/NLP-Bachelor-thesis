The text tells us about the incorrectnes of the traditional voting system. One point ist that in the traditional voting the people have to tick a small box right next to the chosen name on  long list with many names. The names are often written very small and close next to each other. So it can easly hapen that people, mostly old peolpe, mark by mistake the wrong name. With the new and computerized voting system this error would be decreased. Because the voters simply just have to click at the name and so can`t mark the wrong one.
With the traditional voting system there was also the problem with counting the votes. Officials have to count every singel vote on all the ballots. This leads automaticly to an inaccurate counting of votes, because of human errors. But with the new system this wouldnt be necessary because the computer takes over the counting of the vote. So it seems like there is no need to worry about the new system but there is acctually a point to consider. The programming of the new system was also done by humans and so isn`t totally out of human errors. And a error in the programm of this new system can lead to big miscountings, because with one error in this system it is easly possible to lose or miscount 1000 of votes. And its very hard or even impossible to restore them. 
Another problem with the new system ist also that not every one has access to a computer and so maybe can`t even vote.
So the new system first need to fully develope and this obviously takes some time.
