It's true that for most of the people a vote with the computerized voting system would be much easier. But not for everyone. What about these people who arn't used to technology. For them, the computerized voting system would make things much tougher. And also the argument, that computer would't make "human errors" isn't 100% correct. Computers are programed by humans, so there would still be a risk of human errors. And these errors might be much worse than the errors made with the old counting system. A really bad computer error could miss thousands of votes.

Why should we change a system, which always worked well for us. Never chance a wining system..
