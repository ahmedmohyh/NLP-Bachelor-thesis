The lecturer claims that it is doubtful, that computervoting will make it better. First there are many people who cant afford a computer or may have some troubles with it. this discourages the voters. In the text it is written, that the computers are an advantage for people with poor eyesight. The question is, which system is more reliable? the tradidional voting or the computerized voting. Do the computerized voting systems realy a better job? They are also made by humans.It is true that officials who have to count up the vontes will make mistakes. on the other hand, the counting by humans misses only a few ballots, but with a major error computerized systems could make the whole election far more inaccurate. It is to say that the current voting system got improved. It isnt flawless but it works and since the elections in america are only once every 2 years there is no reason to change. In contrast you can read in the text that there are already some computers who are perfectly accurate.
