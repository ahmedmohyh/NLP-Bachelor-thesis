Technology is used on a lot of different occasions. Even the in voting system of the United states technology is being used. But there are mixed feelings about that certain use of technology. The critics that think technology offers a more accurate and efficent way of voting believe, that voting is being made more inexpensive, efficent and safe. They think that human error can cause an inaccurate voting result. Also do they think that the voting sheets can lead to people accidentaly choose the wrong cadidate.
The critics that are not fond of the technology believe, that the technology hasn't emproved enough to be as safe as the traditional way of counting the votes. They are afraid that people who don't use computers that often or at all don't get how to vote or get discouraged by the techology. They also believe that human errors can show in the software, because it is programmed by humans. If there would be a error in the software, , that would affect thousands of votes, here instead it just would be some few with humans that count the votes.
