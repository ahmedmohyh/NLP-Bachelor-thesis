The text is about different voiting systems. They speak about the traditional voiting system and the the computerized voiting. What are the advantages and disadvantages about these voiting systems? 
At the beginning of the text they spoke about the traditional voiting. By the traditional voiting the people have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper and many people, especialle theses who can't read very well, make the mark on the wrong name. Because of theses the result of the voting can be influence, it can be wrong. Also by counting the votes mistake can happen.
But is the computerized voiting really better? Sure the computer make less mistake by counting votes, but what is with people who don't use a copmuter often? Maybe they don't understand the task how to vote on the computer. 
The main question about these two voiting systems and the text is, what's the better way, a system which can be used wrong by humans because of technology knowledge or a system which can be used wrong because of human mistakes?
