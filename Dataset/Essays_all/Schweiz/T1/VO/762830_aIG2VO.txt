In the text and also in the listening exercise traditional voting was compared to the new idea of computer voting. The traditional way is very difficult to count, because humans have to count every single vote one by one without the help of a machine or a computer. People with poor eyeslight can easily mark the wrong name. Computers could count the votes much fasterand they are automatically. But there's the risk of errors. Computers are made by humans so it's possible that they have faults. With computers it's much more complicate to recognize counting mistakes and they could get hacked. For people who don't usually work with computers the computerized voting systems could be a problem too. Some people also say that computer technology has to be used every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information and the computerized voting system is only used once in two years.
