The lecture stated that we should not trust computers too much since they are programmed by humans. While the text states that computers are far more accurate than humans who have to count every single voting form, the lecture wants to make clear that the impact of a programm error would be enormous and they fear that those who are not working with a computer on a regular bases won't be voting anymore since they wouldn't understand it or have too much fear of technology to trust them. While the author of the text is convinced that a comuterized voting system would me more accurate and help to prevent mistakes of voters with a bad eyesight to accidently fill in the wrong ballot due to the magnifing option a computer has. The author also thinks that the slight miscounts could be avoided by a computerized voting system. Because if one of these miscounts is detected there will be a very expensive recounting. 
The woman holding the lecture thinks that the computerizing won't make the votes easier at all. She has the same opinion as the author that humans make mistakes. But she thinks that a mistake in programming the voting system has a worse impact than two or three miscounts of someone counting the votes. there could be thousands of votes wrongly counted and nobody would know it since there won't be any physical evidence that the people voted for someone else.
