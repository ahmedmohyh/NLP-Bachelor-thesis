Voting is a big part of our life. In Switzerland we have to vote about many diffrent things. In America the probably most important election is the election of the president. 

As we heard in the presentation people are not sure whether the traditional system or the potencial computer system is more efficient. The woman doubts that the election made with computers would be that easier especially for those people which are not used to using such kind of devices. 
Another argument she mentioned is that the comupter persumabely will not be better at all owing to them made by humans. 
She also mentioned that computers could break down and consequently all the votes would be gone. With the tradiitonal voting this would never happen. 

The writer of the text has not quite the same opinion as the woman who made the presentation. The text says that the current voting system in America should be replaced with modern computers due to their developpement and efficiency. 
He explains that the election with computer would be very faster because you would not have to search the name in the list.
