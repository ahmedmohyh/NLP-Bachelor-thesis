In general the audio version was far more critical than the text. There were only counter arguments: First of all there might be a problem with computer voting for those people who aren't used to technology, or the ones who can't afford a computer. Those people wouldn't be able to vote. Another point is that many people have a certain fear of technology and it isn't given that the computer doesn't make ans mistakes at all. In fact their mistakes might even be bigger than the mistakes humans make. Computers are programmd by humans, so human error is still an issue and a mistake in a programm could lead to severel thousand wrong votings. Another problem is that a recount with the computer isn't possible. And lastly, as votings are very rare there is no time do develope the computer programms until they're completley trustworthy. 
Now the text is far more positive about computerized voting. The text says that human error îsn't possible when the counting is made by computers.The audio doesn't agree as it says that computers might even make bigger mistakes than humans. In the text it's written that a recount ist very expensive, yet possible, which according to the autio isn't even possible with computers.  
Due to the touchscreen system, errors in voting for the worng people can be avoided. 
About the distrust in technology, that is mentioned in the audio, the text says that, as we trust technology in almost every other daily task, it wouldn't make any sense at all to distrust technology about voting.
