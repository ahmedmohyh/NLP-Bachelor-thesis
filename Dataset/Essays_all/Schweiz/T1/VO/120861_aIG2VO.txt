Some people in the United States want to switch from the traditional voting system to a voting system, that's based on computers. But is it really more trustworthy and efficient?. In the current voting system the mistakes come from two sources. The first problem is, that some people often accidentally vote for the wrong person, because they have to find their candidate out of dozens of names. People who don't see as good as they used to, can easily mark the wrong name. Another purpose for the inaccuracy is, that the votes have to be counted by hand. You can surely say that some ballots are missed, while they're getting counted. Therefore, a an uncomfortable recount has to happen. But would a computerized voting system make it better?. Critics say that a considerable amount of people are not used to handle a computer or don't even have a computer, so they might vote for the wrong candidate or aren't even able to vote. Bank systems work very well and are used every day, but they went through a long process of errors and improvement. And a computer based voting system is likely to have an error, when it's used the first time. When humans count the ballots they miss a few, but when the cumputerized voting system has an error, the consequences are worse. Would it really be worth to take the risc of a computer error or is the traditional voting system still appropriate.
