Voting is everyones right if you're of legal age. Especially in the United States they make a big fuss about it but actually their voting system is really inefficent and inaccurate. So now they want to computerize their voting system. But with this idea comes a lot of critization. A report stated the negative aspects, whereas the text above supports the idea of computerizing the voting system.

The report states that a lot of older people might not understand technology as well as young people and some might not be able to afford a computer just to vote. Controversely the text says that the technological version will make voting for everyone easier and suggests that less mistakes whilst choosing your vote will happen. 

Another negative aspect stated by the report is that we cannot be sure if we can trust technology and be sure that the programm is flawless. A programm error can lead to extrem miscountings, whereas the human could only miss a few ballots, which would lead to small miscountings. But the text says that the technologiacal system is way more trustworthy and efficent. The text makes another point by stating that we trust technology on a daily basis, so why shouldn't we trust it with voting as well.

Another problem listed by the report is that a recounting is impossible, if the voting happened on a computer. 

So should we trust technology or rely on the human?
