The main question which is dealt with in both media is: sould computers replace human voting counters. While in the text there is a clear tendency pro computers, the presentaion ist totally against it and this because of different reasons.

The presentation states that only people who are used to computers will vote and not all are able to afford this kind of technology. they even think that less people will attend elections because of this issue. The text does not go into this question at all.

An other point are human errors. The text states that ther are often counting errors made by humans which can result into recounting all the sheets.They say that this problem can be solved by computers. On the other hand the presentation states that all programms are manmade and there are also going to be mistakes. And these errors can result in even more severe problems, like the loss of all votes.

The presentation also sees a trust issue with the computer technology because national voting occures only every two years. People have no time to feel confident and trust the technology. The text on the other side states that goverments and individuals trus in this technology and even banking is done on computers.
