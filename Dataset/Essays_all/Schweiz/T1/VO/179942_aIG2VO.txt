The woman sais that people who aren't used to computers will make mistakes when voting. But isn't that they point of doing the votings on a computer? Because it's hard to understand the piece of voting paper. On a computer it would be easier with an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. You only need to touch the canidate's name and everyone can do that. 
And then there are people who don't even have a computer because they can't afford one. But there will be more and more computers in the future that we can't keep up with even though they are made by humans after all.
Officials make mistakes all the time and when they detect one, everything has to be done new wich cost a fortune and much time. Going through millions of votes one by one is very exhausting and time consuming. The computer system would do that in a matter of seconds and trustworthy. When there is a error on the coputer, all will be lost. But the chance of this happening is small and a few ballots of votings miscounted or missed out of can change an election completely even if it's not much. 
The problem is that people don't trust computersystems even though there are world wide governments and individuals who daily trust their complex computer technology. And doing banking transactions online is totally normal for people since it was introduced and it almost never fails. It would be a good step in to the future.
