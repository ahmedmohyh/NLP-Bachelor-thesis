Computerized voting is no better than the current voting system. One may argue that it is easyer to vote via computer than via ballot, but there are a lot of people who are not used of computers, they wouldn't understand it. This may lead to voter discourage or to marking the wrong candidate. It is true that humans make mistakes, but the damage they can possibly do by misscounting is far less than with a computer system. It does not add up that much if someone misscounts five votes, but if a computer system makes an error, all information is lost. there is no physical record of these votes, so one can not re-count them. As previously stated, humans make mistakes. So there is no guarantee that the computer programm counting the votes is flawless, because computers and their software is man-made. To the last point: It may be accurate that people rely heavily on computer technology, for example in banking transactions or communication of sensitive data, and nowadays, it works. But it took them years to eliminate all the bugs and to make it consumer friendly. Voting in the US of A is once in every four years, so the software for computerized voting wouldn't be used as much as it should. Many errors would not have been detected and it would take a hell-lot of  time to make such a software programm flawless.
