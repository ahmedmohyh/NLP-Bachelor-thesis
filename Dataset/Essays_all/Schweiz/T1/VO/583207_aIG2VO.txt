I listen a lot of arguments in the Presentation. They say that voting on computers are easy for people how use the computer every day or at home. But not for the other people. For example for old people it`s very hard to vote on the computer, they make a lot of mistakes. Also for people how don?t use the computer often or people which have no money for a computer, how can they vote? The computerprogramm also makes often mistakes in on year they make more then 1000 wrong votes. The voting is only once in a year, maybe it's better when you vote on a sheet for this important thing. The Text say something else, they bring there arguments for a voting system on computers. They say voting on sheets is too old people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. The computer voting machines have a easily voting system and you can decide long what you choose.
