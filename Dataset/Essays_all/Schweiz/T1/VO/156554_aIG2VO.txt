The lecture critiues the claims made in text one by one, going through all of them and offering reasons why they would not improve the situation, or even worsen it. The lecture claims that people accidentally voting for the wrong candidate is not something limited to traditional ballots, as even, or especially, with a computerized input this could still happen. The main reason for it would then be some voters being unfamiliar with computers, which could in turn lead to them either not knowing how to input their vote properly, or even being discouraged from voting alltogether. The lecture goes on to critique the claim that computerized voting would stop human error in ballots, as this software would still have to be programmed by humans to begin with. While human error in counting votes usually leads to a small amount of missed votes and the ability to recount as physical evidence of those votes exist, if everything were fully and only digital the possibility of losing all data if an error were to occur could mean that it would be more difficult, if not impossible, to accurately take another count upon encountering errors. The lecture then points out that people trust in other complex computerized technology like banking as this has been used every day for some time, meaning the most significant errors have been ironed out. As votes only happen once every two years on a national level and only once or twice a year on a local one, there would be a lot less opportunities to use the system and field-test it. This would mean that any potential errors and weaknesses would not be found as quickly and the system would thus be more vulnerable to attacks.
