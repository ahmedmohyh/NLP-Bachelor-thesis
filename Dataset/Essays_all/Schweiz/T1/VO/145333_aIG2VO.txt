In the presentation it is said, that a computerized voting system isn't a good alternative to the system the US voters are used to. Is it because not every US citizen can effort a computer or is used to work with computers regularly. It is also talked about human error. When the people who count the votings make mistakes, the error isn't as big as it would be if the future computersystem has any errors, because they are programmed of humans too of course. On the other hand the text sais that the human counting is inefficient because of its slowlyness and the inaccurate counting of votes. But the programming of a new system needs time until it is perfect, otherwise the consequences would be dramatic. Another contra argument is that national votings take place only every second year. Is the effort really worth it for this?
