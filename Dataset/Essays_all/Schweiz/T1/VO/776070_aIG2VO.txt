In traditional voting a lot of people accidentally vote for a wrong candidate because of poor eyesight and because you have to search for the name on a large sheet of paper. Computerized voting would solve this problem, since you would only have to touch the candidates name (with the touch-screen) and could even magnify the name to read it better.
But if ypu're not used to computers, because you can't afford one, you will have trouble using the computerized voting. Some people wouldn't even go voting, because they would be afraid and discouraged by the new technology. 

Another problem is that officials have to count all the voting sheets one by one. There are thousands of ballots and it's inevitable that they won't make a mistake. Computers could easily count them automatically. But the computer is a human-made thing and it can be programmed wrong by a human. This human error would be far larger and could delete thousands of votes. And since there wouldn't exist any physical version of the voting nobody could recount them again.

But there thousands of complex computers who are trusted daily to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensitive information. These computers are used daily, so they can be improved a lot to make them perfect. In the beginning they weren't reliable and you had to make them better. Since aren't a lot of elections in a year, it's impossible to make the computers as perfect, because the use of them is simply not sufficient.
