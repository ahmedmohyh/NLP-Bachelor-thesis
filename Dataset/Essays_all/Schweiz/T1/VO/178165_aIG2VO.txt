The main arguments of the presentation are that traditional voting systems are still better than computerized systems because for especially older people are not used to computers or do not even have one, which results in a loss of votes. On the other hand the problem with traditional systems is that people with poor eyesight can easily pick the wrong name. 
Even though there can be miscounts or errors with the traditional system which result in a few wrong votes, the programs for the computerized system are made by humans which means that there will be most likely an error which can cause over thousands of wrong votes. On the one hand there are already similar technologies in use and they are fully trusted by the governments and individuals but on the other hand these are daily in use and were massively improved over the years. Whats more is that errors in traditional systems are more easy to correct because you just have to recount while in the computerized system you have to first search the fault in the program and then do the vote all over again.
