The woman in from the presentation opposes computerized voting. She says that people can make mistakes when counting votes but these would only be a few votes which would be miscounted. On the other hand if computer programms, made by humans, contain an error thousands of votes could go to the wrong candidate or just vanish. And these votes could not be recounted. The lady also mentions that if the voting system would change to  computerized voting many people might vote wrong or not at all because the are not familiar with technology or even afraid of it. The main issue between the presentation and the article is that the article says that human errors can be avoided through computer technology and there wouldn't be any need for exspensive recounts. But in the presentation the woman doesnt trust the computers software wich also could be faulty because it's made by humans and humans indeed do make mistakes.
