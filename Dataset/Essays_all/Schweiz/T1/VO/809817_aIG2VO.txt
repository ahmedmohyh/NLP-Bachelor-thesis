The audio was about the voting system in the United states. They discussed if the voting system in the US should by over a computer because many errors happen when people have to vote and count by hand. The woman in the audio said that this could be a problem for people who are not used to computers or technology in general. This may be a good solution for people who know how to use a computer. Computer are also programmed by humans and many errors can happen by programming the voting system. And what if something like this happens? It's impossible to recount in this case. Furthermore the voting in the US only happens once every two years and twice a year in local regions. So it would not be a lot of effort to do it by hand.

The text was from another point of view. According to the text people often vote for the wrong cadidate because they make the mark next to the wrong name. This happens often to people with poor eyesight. They say that it would be easier on the computer because they only have to touch the name on the screen and they could magnify the name too. A major difference to the audio is that in the text they see the computer as a solution for the errors. It's more efficient than counting by hand because it also needs less time. They see it as a very big effort to count every mark and to count again if they did a mistake. According to the audio this could happen with computer too but if it happens there it would be impossible to go over all of it again.
