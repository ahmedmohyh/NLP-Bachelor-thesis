So it`s true that computers are faster and it`s more difficult to make a mistake by counting. But as the person in the recording part said computers are programmed by humans and it could be that they make a mistake in programming too. So if now the computer fails in counting there could be a miss counting over nearly 1000 votes. At the traditional voting it would be less common to make such big mistakes because the people which are counting would only miss a few ballots.
The text says that many people can`t read the names of the candidates on the ballots because it`s to small or they just miss crossing the right name and that it`s easier to read it on the computer because there`s a tool where you can make the letters bigger. But many people don`t have one or aren`t able to use one. Especally the older genaration. So the may pick the wrong candidate or don`t even try to vote because they are affraid of the technology. So is it really easier to handle everything with the computers just because we used to it? Or should we trust our own human brains? 
Because in the end both voting systems are not as efficient as they seem and it`s very difficult to find the right way.
