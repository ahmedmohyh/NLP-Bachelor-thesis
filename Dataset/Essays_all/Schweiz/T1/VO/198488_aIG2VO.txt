Voting
The text says that voting systems in the United States are complicated and don't work perfectly. In traditional voting the people often don't find the name of her chosen candidat or the letters are too small to read it. For all the old people or human with poor eyesight its difficult to vote.
But when you vote on a computer there are also some problems. Maybe the computer has an error or shows you one candidat in bigger letters then the others. For some people its much easier to vote on a computer but when we think at all the other ones who aren't good witch all the computer stuff, they might have problems with that. Maybe they don't know where to click or what to do. So that isn't the perfect soluction.
When there is an error in the computer system they can't count it again and everyone has to vote again and again.
The facts from the text and the facts from the speaking person are mostly the same. Both questioned why we didn't promise a vooting on the computer, when we always tell the computers in the banks our personal informations. Why can we vote on computers, because the people in the United States are voting only one in two years.
There are everwhere problems with voting, because they can make a mistake while counting every single letter or by producing a wrong programm for voting. But it would make it for much people easier to vote on a computer. There are always problems.
