One of the main points of the lecture was that not all the people are used to computers and the new technologies. In our time of the technological revolution there are still some people who are actually scared of using these technologies, this however is not even mentioned in the text.
Further more the woman makes the point that some human errrors during the physical/ human counting still exist but she points out that in case of a computer programming error the result would be much worse! In the text above however  the writer makes no note of computer errores.
The lady from the presentation also talks about that in the early days of e-Banking many mistakes sill have to be discovered and solved. She goes on and states that those programms are used a lot more than this future electronical counting system and so the peole are used to it by know.
She also talkes about that during an e-Vote there would not be any writen record for people to check, to this statement the text does not have any answeres.
