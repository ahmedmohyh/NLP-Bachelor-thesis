Well, basically, there are many arguments for the computer voting, but also as much arguments against it. In the text, it says, that computer voting is a lot better, because there isn`t the chance of human error. On the one hand, this seems right, but on the other hand, you have to see, that when there is an error in the program, the damage is bigger. For exaple it could happen, that the computer loses a bunch of votes, because the programmer made a mistake. In the listening part, it was also said, that the computer system would be a good solution for people, who use a computer every day, but for pensioners it would be a challenge to find the right name to click on, or to even find the way to the voting page. Because they aren`t trained in the use of technical devises, they maybe don`t want to vote any more, because they are a little bit afraid of these things. But in the text, it has been mentioned, that the computer voting has also a big advantage: You can zoom in. Especially for people who can`t see very good, it would be nice to zoom in to find the name of a candidat faster. On the ballots, the letters are very small, so sometimes they choose the wrong candidat, because they just can`t see the name of the person they are looking for. It is also a point, that goverments, banks and individuals already trust other technology eyery single day. For example a banking transaction, which is fully made by the computer. So why should the computer won`t manage it  this.nnnnnnnnn
