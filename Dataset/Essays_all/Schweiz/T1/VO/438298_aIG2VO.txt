Things which were mentioned in the presentation:
There is the problem that traditional voting should be to innaccurate. The option to fix this could be to use computers for voting. But there are some problems about this solution. Computers are programmed by humans which also leads to errors in the computer programm. If there are missing some questions which are caused to an error this would be very fatal because a computer can't recount. There is another problem. A voting system on a computer isn't easy to use for all. Some old people would have some huge difficulties to vote on such a modern device. Which would cause less votings In the presentation it says that these computerprogramms aren't that good for a voting which happens every two years. The consequences would be some innaccurate votings.
 
The text says the opposite. It is written that the voting system in the USA is very inefficient which means that it is inaccurate in counting votes. It says that a tablet is also more visible and easier to use. It is also mentioned that older people could easily mark the wrong name on the huge papers which also causes some incorrect voting. On the tablets the name would be much more visible which wouldn't case some incorrect voting.
