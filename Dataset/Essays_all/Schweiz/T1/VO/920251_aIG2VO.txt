Computer technology can avoid human errors. We already use technology to handle secret information or bank transactions.A recounting of the votes is expensive and needs a lot of time and work. It helps people with poor eyesight to find their candidate. We need to start improving the voting system even if it is going to be hard in the starting time. We already managed to use technology for very important informations like doing a bank transaction. A computerized counting and voting would save a lot of time and work and if it works once it is 100% accurate.
