What is the best way to vote? Isn't going to a polling station too time consuming? What if we used compuerized voting? All of these questions are frequently discussed at the moment in the United States of America. 
Some say we should replace the traditional voting by a computerized voting system. Others, such as in the lecture, are opposed to this idea. 
It may seem obvious for some that computerized voting is the way to go in the 21th century, but it isn't at all. It might be easy for people, who have grown up surrounded by computers, to vote via the computer. But it is easy to forget that not everyone has to deal with computers on the daily basis. Especially for eldery people it could be a reason not to vote, as they are afraid of the computers. Critics say though that using a computerized voting system would facilitate the voting process, especially for those eldery people who might suffer from poor eyesight. By using the computerzied voting system one could magnify the information written on the screen, and therefore less voting errors would occure.  
Critics also oppose that as the computer programms for the voting system is programmed by an actual human being, we can't be a hundred percent sure that there is not any error in the programmation. But is that true? Everyday other more complex technology is used to facilitate other things such as for example in Banking. There those programms work perfectly fine with the given data. 
Summarised one could say that the traditional voting system will be replaced at some point in time by a computerized voting system.
