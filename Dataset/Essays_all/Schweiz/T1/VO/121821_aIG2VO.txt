It is true that the traditional voting system has some problems, but who says that the computerized voting does not. First of all there are many people who have a fear of technology, are not used to computers or can not even afford one. An other very important point are the errors. A human can make errors by missing a few ballots. But the program is made by a human too, so if there is a fault, then the misscounting can get very big. Now you can say that so many companies work with computerprograms. I agree with that but their programs have been improved and improved over years, so many errors were corrected. To develop the voting program is much more diffiult because voting is not that often and it is very new. The text says that computerized voting ist more efficient and trustworthy but all the arguments in the presentation are speaking against.
