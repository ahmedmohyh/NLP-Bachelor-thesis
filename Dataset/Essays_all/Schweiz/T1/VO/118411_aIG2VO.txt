The USA still uses a traditionally voting systems and people say that these kind of voting leads to inaccurate voting data because of faults and errors produced by humans. For example, you could vote for the wrong person by accident because there are so many different names on the list of candidates or as mentioned there could occur counting faults. The problem with the traditional counting system is that one has to count every single vote. With a new technology, the computerized voting system, one could reduce such errors and also minimize the time used for counting. But the problem with this kind of voting system is that people which are not used to use computers in their daily life could be confused by the voting system. There would be a high probability that the people click the wrong button and because of this vote for the wrong candidate. But there are could also occur errors in the traditional voting system because humans have to count the votes and there happen many faults. Computers would not have these kinds of problems. The only human error which could occur in the computerized voting system is a fault in the program system. Humans write those codes and there could be faults in them. Faults in the program codes can lead to huge errors in the end result. Even bank systems had many faults and security issues in the beginning and the computerized voting system will also have errors. The systems will probably be safe after years of corrections of the codes.
