Due to inefficiency of counting votes in the United States people are thinking about replacing the old system by computerized voting. But would this really be more reliable? Will computers do a better job than humans in counting votes?

With the traditional voting a lot of people end up voting for the wrong candidate because for example people with poor eyesight accidently make a point next to the wrong name. But that's not the only thing. Votes being counted by humans leads to mistakes too. That's why nowadays people are thinking about computerizing the system. Obviously human errors will happen anyway, we can't change that. But computers are also built by humans. So it could be that the computers will have an error and if that happens it would have an even worse outcome. The technology today is advanced and we can't complain about the technology we use daily (banking, school,..) very rarly problems occur but that's because we improved alot. It wasn't like that before. That's why critics say using computers would cause a big problem. We wouldn't use it every day because we only vote twice a year. Therefore computers would lack in efficiency this leads to more errors. 
But everything started once from the bottom. If we don't try it we will never know, at least that's what they say.
