The text says that computerized voting is better because it's easier to count. Humans who count the votes on the ballot could make errors easily or people with poor eyesight could choose the wrong person. The reason is that the ballot is a large sheet. Even though humans can make errors it would only be a few votes while the computer could make thousands. A computerized voting would be difficult for people who are not used to computers or can't afford them because they could cast the wrong vote. Thus it's easy for them to make mistakes. For many people technology is more difficult than manual. For instance it's touchscreen so they could tip the wrong candidate. They say that you shouldn't really trust programms because humans are behind them. If something goes wrong everything could vanish or if not that bad 'only' thousands of votes. The problems would be far more worse. So computerized systems don't remove the possiblity of human error they only make it worse. It's true that we use programms for banking transactions but they are used everyday. At the beginning they were bad too but from time to time we improved it. Another point is that votings are only once every year so the programm isn't that good. Even though computerized system count automatically it Moreover if the result vanish you can't recount it whereas you could recount the votes on the ballot.
