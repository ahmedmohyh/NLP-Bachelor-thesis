The oral part said that computer-rised votings are good for people, who use computers daily and know how to use it. But persons who don't use computers and also don't know how to use it, maybe vote for the wrong person or don't go to the elections because they are fear of technology. A point that the woman in the hearing also said was a different statement. Missing votes are only possible with human error, because computers count the vote quickly and without any mistakes. In the reading the possibility of human error was also write down but they have another statement to the theme of voting systems. The positiv aspect of computer-rised votings was that the big administration work is unnessesary because the computer makes the counting. The similarities of the reading and the oral one were that both of it have first a very clear statement but in the end they said that the other possibility has also positiv aspects, not only their favorite voting system. In the end of the reading a point of the rivals is tooked up that said that it's too risky to make everything with technology. And the oral excercise said like I've writed that missing votes are only possible with humans.
