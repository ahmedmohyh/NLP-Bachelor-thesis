People who are not used to computers, for example old people would have difficulties filling out the voting sheets and some people can't even afford a computer. Of course people can make mistakes when they have to count the votes but an mistake in a computersystem, which was eventually made by a human can lead to far more miscounted votes. We will not use these systems on a daily basis and therefor there are not many opportunities to improve and maybe correct the systems. The banking transaction was neither a perfect working system in the beginning and they had to gather a huge amount of information to make it efficient and safe and that was only possible because people used the system regulary.
It's very important that nothing goes wrong during the voting because there is no physical record of your vote if it gets lost beacuse of a system error.
