In the listening was the point and the criticism to the computer voting system. They said, that it isn't a good system because not everyone has a computer in the USA. Really sad isn't it? In the country without problems. They said, that the peoples have too much fear of modern technologys. They also said, that the computers aren't save because computers were made by humans.And if someone haven't a computer it isn't a drama. Then can the others without computer vote with paper. And if computer are made by computers, other humans can failing it. But with the traditional system, in fact papers aren't made by humans. So the reading is more based on the new computer system. With the new system everyone can chose comfortable her favorite politican. And it is also much faster than the old system. If you can trust the computer to go to the moon, you cannot trust the computer for voting a new goverment.
