In the presentation it is discussed, if electronical voting is better than manual voting. The first argument was that people who don't have a lot of experience with computers, will have trouble managing the programm for voting for the candidate they'd wish to vote for. In contrast an argument was that people also make mistakes, which is a downturn of the manual voting but it's still more efficient to prevent miscounting.The difference between the text and the audio is that the text supports electronical voting, but the audio is in favour of traditional voting.
The opinions between the two voting systems are clearly biased. The older gnereation obviously supports the traditional way of voting, as the argument that they're not experienced with computers. But we can clearly say that the younger population wants the electronical voting, beacuse it's faster and easier for them.
