In the USA there are many disscusions about their voting system. Critics say that their traditional voting system isn't efficient. They want a new, computerized system that should  help for more accurate counting votes. The main problems in traditional voting are that when you are going to vote, you'll get a long list with many names on it so you can easily mark the wrong name when you have an eye disease, the other problem of the traditional voting system is that it's counted my human, so it's clear that there will be errors. 
So wouldn't it be much easier if the USA would computerize their system? Wouldn't it be much more accurate than the old system? Critics say it's too risky. Yes, the young generation is used to this new technology but what about the people who aren't used to work with computers. What about the people who can't afford computers? Maybe it will even discourage people to vote because of their fear to use computers. Computers are made by human, so there can also be errors in the software. And en error in the computerized system is a much bigger damage than an official who made an error while counting. The first computers we've used weren't as good as the ones we use now. It took lots of time to improve the computers, and when you only vote once per two years, you aren't able to improve the computerized system fast enough.
