The text and the speech have two diffrent opinions of the voting system used in the Unites States. The text is sure that the current voting system is old, ineffective and there are many mistakes made with it. The two main reasons are the imperfection of the human who can can make a lot of mistakes. First the one who wotes. When he makes just a little mistake or isn't possible to vote correctly it's a problem for the result of the voting. Also the person who chounts the votes has to do a perfect job. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with this voting system. For the text the perfect option would be to use coputerizerd voting systems.

The speacher is sure that computerized voting sxstems aren't as good as they are told in the text. For people who are not used ore haven't got a computer is't difficult to vote. So there are also a lot of mistaked made with this system. The big point is that also computers are not mistakeless becaus they are made by humans. When the computer makes a mistake wich is usually much bigger than a humam mistake it's often not possible to recount the votes. The speacher is also sure that the old system is better because it already had it's time to get better and develope. With a new system that part would take up a very long time becaus there are so few votings in America.
