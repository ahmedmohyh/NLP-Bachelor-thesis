To start things of, the writer of the text and the woman who made the lecture had the opposite thoughts on the voting system. While the writer wanted a new system, the speaker brought agruments for the traditional system. 

The writer started of by naming some of the flaws of the current system. His main point is that the votes are counted by hand. Thus, there are plenty of mistakes made, especially considering that the officials have to count every single vote by hand, thousands on end. The speakers counters this by saying that a failure in a programm would be much worse, because it can forget, miscount or even delete thousands of votes. This would make a recounting impossible. 

Another thing she says is that many people are unexperienced in computer. All the people that can't afford a computer, or simply don't work with it every day wouldn't trust the new system. This could cause accidental misvotes or the people woudn't vote at all. The writer thinks that this problem is already there in the traditional system. The voter have to find the politican they want to vote for out of a huge list of names. Then their vote is made by making a small tick next to his name. This can cause voters, especially those with poor eyesight, to misvote. 

The last argument of the writer is that people who complain about having to trust a programm do this every day. Their bank account, insurence and healthcare are all safed online. The speaker also has an answer for this. She says that these programm were tested for years and improved over and over again. A voting software would only be used every other year, wich wouldn't suffice in testing and improving it.
