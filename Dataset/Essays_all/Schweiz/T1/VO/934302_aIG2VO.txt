The lady said that she doubts the efficency of computer based voting systems. She states that people who don't use computers or who don't have the money to afford one would have troubles with a system like that, even though the text mentions easy to use touchscreens that display the names of the candidates better than the traditional ballots.
She also says that mistakes made by computers are much more serious than those made by humans. The text states that those computers can't even make mistakes. The lady sais that they are programmed by humans making them vulnerable for human errors.
She says that there is no physical record of the votes, therefore they are not secured enough, that it would be risky to implement those computers. The author of the text wrote that people trust other computer based systems where errors could be considerably grave like online-banking as well as communication of very sensitive data.
She also says that the current system is reliable as it improved over the past years it was used. But the text tells otherwise. There is a big chance of human error.
