The referent says that a replacement of the traditional voting system by electronic ones might not improve the voting system. If voting is done by computer that may discourage people, who aren't familiar with electronic devices, to vote. The risk that they accidetly vote for the wrong candidat because they aren't used to the computer may also make voting more inaccurate. The text says the opposit. The author of the text thinks that more votes are casted false in the traditional system because people may hit the wrong box to cross on the sheet. 

Further the author says that many counting mistakes are made if a person counts the votes. If the mistake is detected it is a very expensive procedure to recount and correct it. Therfore computers should count the votes. They don't make mistakes. An other reason why they would be reliable is: We already trust  them to do other important taskes for us (like managing bank accounts etc. ). The referent don't shares this opinion. She states that computers first didn't their job well in managing bank accounts and had to be perfected. The same would apply to computers managing elections or votes. A further problem is also that voting computers aren't used often so it would take long to perfect them and detect errors in their programming. She also has the opinion that a  error in a computer system would be much worse and devastating than an error made by humans. To correct a computer's mistake would be impossible because there aren't any records about the vote counting. 

In general we can say that this is a very controverse issue.
