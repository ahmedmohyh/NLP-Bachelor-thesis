Voting

A women presents her opinion to computer voting. It's mentioned that that kind of voting might probably cause problems. For current users of computers there would not be problems, but people which would not use computer technology in their everyday life, might have trouble by dealing with it and there would be  easily produced mistakes in a voting, the woman explains.
Additionally, computers are made from human, what is a fact, and human beings are supposed to make mistakes. The woman states, that an only human error can lead to a lot of false information, or to thousands of lost votings.
Furthermore she argues, that banking technology was used daily and had been improved and improved over years and years. Votings only take place two times a year, in that case, problems would not be surprising.

In the opposite to those arguments of the woman in the presentation above, the written text sais, that classic voting would be inefficient because ticks would be easily fixed false. The voting results of the United States could be largely improved with the help of computer technology, its mentioned, because banks would also use those technologies and it would be absolutely safe. Also people with only a few computer experience could easily use touch screens.
