The written text is cleary against the traditional voting with a large sheet of paper, while the speech is against the new computer system. 
In the text thy argued with all the positif arguements of a computer and that they wouldn't be any counting mistakes or accidently voting for the wrong candidate  anymore if they would use computers. They wrote only about advantiches and no disatvantiches even do also a computer can make mistakes or has an error. With this arguement the women of the speech liked to show that we can't trust the computers more than the humen counting because also the computers are made by human. An other point she mentioned was that all the people who aren't used of computers would have problems to vote if they don't know how to handle it. In the text they mentioned that it would be much easier for all the people with poor eyeseight to find the right name and also to set the cross on right name, because on these large sheets it isn't easy to find the right name, while on a computer with a touch-screen technology they could just click on they name they want to vote for.
