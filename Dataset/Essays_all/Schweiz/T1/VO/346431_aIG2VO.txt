In this text and listening part, it is informed about the current voting system in the United States. Not only do we get an insight on how the votings are counted, we also get to know about the different drawbacks and good sides to it. 
At the moment the votes in the US are counted by people, which isnt necessary and should be renewed according to many people. Through this form of counting, human mistakes can easily be made and not corrected or seen. If this system would become computarized, we would no longer have to worry about such errors. Another difficulty appearing, is the accidental voting. People who dont see well or fill the form out to quickly, accidentaly give their vote to an unwanted matter. The reasons why it still hasnt been changed, is that there are people who have a fear of technology and these should not be excluded. Some are more worried about the whole system crashing or unnoticably causing errors than any human errors. But since people do use a lot of technology as a help in their every day lives, it is only a matter of time until the votingsystem will be computerized.
