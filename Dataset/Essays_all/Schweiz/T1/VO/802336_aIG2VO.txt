Voting mistakes often happen in the Usa. A person taggs the wrong ballot and choses the wrong candidate or the people counting the votes miscount which ends up being very expensive and time consuming. THere is a soltion to the problem: a computerized voting system.
The traditional voting system is heavily critiziced for the human mistakes but keep in mind that the computerized voting system is a program writen by a human being. If there is a fault in the program the outcome will be by far worse than if a person makes a counting mistake. The comparison with the banking system and all the programs we use nowadays is useless. The programs used to have defaults but they could be corrected and made more efficient because we use them every day. The voting system on the other hand will be used twice a year and will be unreliable because they will only notice tha faults of the system after the election is over. Another big problem of the computerized system is that every citizen allowed to vote must know how to use a computer and own a computer. Not every body owns enough money to buy such a luxurious object.
All in all it is doubtful that the computerized system will be any better than the traditional voting system seen as it is just as exposed to human errors as the old system.
