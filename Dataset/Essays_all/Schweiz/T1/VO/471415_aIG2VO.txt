The first argument was that computer voting is just good for people who can deal with a computer. In the text they says, that especially old people how have a poor eyesight can mark the wrong name. But the same people mostly can't deal with a computer. So they would make more mistake with the computer than with a traditional voting paper. 

The second argument in the represenation was that humans make mistake but computers are made of human so cumputer also make mistake. And when a computer makes mistake it's lot bader then when humans make mistake. The text says nothing about the situation when computers make mistake. It says that when humans count the voting there must be a expensive recount but when a computer make a mistake there probably is a recount impossible. 

The last argument was that you can trust in other complex computer technology like banking transactions because people make it every day, but voting is only every two year, so you can't compare this two things. The text compare this to things and says that when we trust in other computer technology like banking tansfer we also should trust in computer voting. But you can't compare this two things. In the presentation was also saied that the technologie of banking transfer is more developpte than the technology of computer voting.
