Today, voting in the United States is traditionally done: people get a sheet where all the candidates are listened, then they have to find the candidate they want to vote for and make a small mark next to the name. Critis now say that this voting system can lead to inacurrate counting and therefore needs to be replaced by a computerized voting. But is this really the solution for this problem? The answer is no, other people say. There are still people, for example elders, who are not used to computers and don't really know how to use them. If you can only vote this way, it may increases the number of people who don't vote at all, because they are afraid of technology. Or they make mistakes because they are confused and don't now how to use the progam correctly. Also, there are people who don't have the money to buy a computer, so they won't be able to vote at all. Then there's the fact that computers make errors aswell. Of course there are a few incorrect countings of the votes if they are done by humans, but computers could do a lot more damage, because there's the possibility that thousands of votes get deleted or counted for the wrong candidate. Another point the people who root for a computer voting claim is that computers are trusted nationwide for banking transactions and other very important things. But the opponents state that this technology didn't always work flawlessly. It had to be improved over years to work as well as it does now. The votings take place only every two years, so you can't be sure it is going to work as well as the other systems.
