In the presentations they say that it would be easy for people to vote with a computer if they already know how to get along with one. But people which don't know how to work with a copmuter might have some problems. Many of them are afraid of the technology and it's wouldn't make the election easier for them. A lot of people still don't trust the computer system and the system still has to be improved. Like in the article they said, that people who count every single ballot can make mistakes. But if there's an error in the comptuer system they would have a way bigger problem and maybe have to let the people vote again. In the article it says that the computer wouldn't make that big mistakes like humans do. In this point the text and the person of the presentation aren't the same opinion. The article also says that people could make not that many mistakes by voting with a computer. In the old system the often marked a wrong name. This wouldn't be possible with a new voting system by computer. People can see the name of the candidate better on screen and can even have the computer magnify the name.
