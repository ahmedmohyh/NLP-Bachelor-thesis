A lot of people think that it is better to computerise voting. For the people who are used to computers and high-tecnology it is easy to handle whith that change. But what about the people who aren't used to use computers and don't even have a computer? It is said that if voting gets computerised there are going to be people who accidentely vote for the wrong person because they pressed the wrong botton. But the text above says that in the system right now finding the right person for which you want to vote and to make a small mark next to the name is more confusing and difficult than just pressing a botton on a touch screen. The speaker in the other text said that useing computers for counting votes is not going to be better because computer are produced from humans and so it is possible that mistakes might happen. On the other hand the other text says that counting all the votes one by one and record each one of them is more difficult than just letting the computer do the counting. And it says that if they do a mistake while counting it is takes a long time to recount and it is also very expensive. At the end of the text which we've heared it was said that it takes a lot of time to trust computers, because the first computer who was presented wasn't flawless and thats why computers need to be improved  every time a new mistake is found. On the contrary the text above says that governements and individuals alike trust other complex computer technology every day. For example in banking transactions and as well in the communication of highly sensitive informationon.
