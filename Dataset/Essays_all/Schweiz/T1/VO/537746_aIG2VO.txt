The voting system in the USA has many critics. Many people wants to change the system. They don't  want  to vote with the traditional voting. They want some new system, an more efficient and trustworthy system for voting: The computerized voting.

But the computerized voting have also problems. People who aren't able to use a computer have an big disadvantage. If they can't use an computer, they can't vote for somebody. In this consequence the democraty aren't a democraty. 
Furthermore all computers are programmed by humans. In this reason thy can have an technical defect. In this case the voting also can't take place. 

On the other hand computers are very efficient. They count very quickly.
