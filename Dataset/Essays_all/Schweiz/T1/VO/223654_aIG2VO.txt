People who think that voting can be done over computers are not aware of the fact that a lot of people are not used to handling a computer and may get discouraged by that, which leads to people not voting at all. Further more a lot of people don`t have accses to compuers. Also, the fact that people trust computers with the transfer of moey and other importat things is because this systhem is used on a daily basis where as voting is only done once every two years in america. Possible human mistakes can lead to inaccurate counting of votes but who is to say that a computer won`t make the same mistakes? If you think about it computers are also progrmmed by humans which can also cause a human error and therefore lead to a miscounting on votes. A miscounting on votes with a computer is far more worse because it can be a difference of thousands of votes.
A plus with the computer is that you are not likely to mistake your vote on the ballot because you are able to zoom in if your eyesight is failling you.
