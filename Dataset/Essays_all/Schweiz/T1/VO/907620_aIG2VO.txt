In traditional voting, the population of the USA has to choose the name of their favourite on a long list with many names, what causes problems, for example voting for the wrong candidate if you have poor eyesight. Miscountings easly happens if one of the counters isnt concetrated. But in a new computerized voting system, if there the program makes a mistake, thousands of votes could be deleted or count wrong, in the traditional one, its not at all so many wrong counts. But if the election is closely contested, it depends maybe on those wrong-counted votes. When the program counts thousands of votes wrong, it would be obvious and in worst case, they have to revote. 
For people who are used to computers, its a easy thing, but for those who are afraid, they may not vote because they fear the computer. And poor people who cant afford a computer couldnt vote. And you may vote wrong aswell as in the traditional system. Banking systems had to improve and grow and make a lot of mistakes for approving perfection (though there are still mistakes). Banking transactions are daily in use, not like a voting. Votings are most important for the USA, they only take place one time in two years and the future of the country depends on it.
