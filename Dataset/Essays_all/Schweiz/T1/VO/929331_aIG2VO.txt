"VOTING"

The presentation was about the computerized voting. If we are going to vote with the computer, it could be more efficient for people who are working with the laptop or people are well-known by computer, but it would be inefficient for all the others. There would be mistakes making by the computer. The voting could go wrong if people who want to vote and came not clear with the computer. And so on, some people could hack the voting and looking that "their" voting is going to win. 

This presentation is the opposite of the text, because the written text says, that the voting system per laptop is easier and do not need so much time. The text tells also that by the traditional voting the major could look that the wrong candidate wins. Another problem is, that there are rarely people to count the votes, with the electronic they do not have to do that all is happening on the computer. There are no longer more money we have to spend on it. And not everyone has a laptop at home and like that, they could not vote. But electronic voting is the future, because banking and so on is all electronic.
