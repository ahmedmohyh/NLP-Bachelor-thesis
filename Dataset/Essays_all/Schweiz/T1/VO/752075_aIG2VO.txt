It's normal for human beings to make mistakes like counting something wrong. But with the old voting system you're still able to recount the votes if someone realizes that there was a mistake. With a computerized voting system it's aswell possible that there is an error in the programming, because humans would need to programm a system like this. But here you wouln't be able to recount anything because there isn't any physical object with the votes on it. The amount of false counted votes would also be way higher then by the old system. By the old system it's only because some people weren't able to see the correct place for their prefered candidate but by a computational system the miscounting would be made because of a programming mistake what would lead to thousands of wrong counted votes. 
Even when you talk about the great working complex computer technology in banking transactions as example you have to think about all the work over so many years that it took to make them perfect. There were so many errors that had to be fixed. But by a computerized voting system you only have once every two years on national base in the USA and like 2 times a year at some local votings to embetter them because you found an error. It would take such a too long time to make such a system perfect.
