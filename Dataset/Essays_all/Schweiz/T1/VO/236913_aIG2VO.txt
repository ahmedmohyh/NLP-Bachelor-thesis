The lady in the presentation doesn`t agree with the critics. She says that especially for people who don`t own a computer, or don`t know how to use a computer and therefore have a fear of technology giving up the traditional voting system would have severe effects. They could be intimidated by the thought of using a computer to vote and not vote anymore. 
To the argument that computers do a better job, the lady states that computers are programmed by humans, human error can also be found in comupter systems. But the consequences of a wrong programmed computer system would be a lot more damaging because the votes can`t be recalled. If an official does a counting mistake he can easily recount the ballots. But if the computer is programmed wrongly all the votes are gone. Finally the lady explains that we have a very developed computer system for our every day life, exactly because we use it on a daily basis. In the beginning these programmes didn`t work flawlessly either. To adjust and develop the computerized voting system it would take a long time especially because that system wouldn`t be used everyday but compared to for example banking programmes rather rarely.
