The lecture clearly prefers the traditional way of voting in the united states.
It is stated that miscounts and wrong votes ae very plausible, but in comparisson to a computer error they are not grave or even important. Computerized voting systems might discourage the people who are not familiar with very modern technology from voting. Even if they wanted to vote, they might also by accident vote for the wrong candidate, even if their eyesight was perfect.
Having real people count the votes is a long process but it allows for human error. If the errors are detected, there are possibilities for recounts and no data is lost. Computers on the other hand are also programmed by people and could fall victim to human error, but a mistake in the programming of voting machienes can have much worse concequences and data might be lost. Recounts could become a nearly impossible task.
The programmes would take a very long time to perfect and to be able to exclude any possibilities for error the way technology has been optimized for banking would be difficult. Banking is something society deals with day by day but votes are rare and untill all problems can be adressed, enough damadge will already have been done to the democracy of the country.
