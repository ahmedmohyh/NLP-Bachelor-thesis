In the presentation they had only arguments against the computerized system. While in the text they are for the computerized system.
In the text they say it is much easier to vote with the computer because you only have to click on the names and you can read it better. But in the presentation they say, that it is only easier for those who are used to work with computers. Everyone that doesn't know how to use a computer can make mistakes and vote wrong. Some people also can't afford a computer.
With the argument that the computers are an human invention and can make errors aswell the presentation tries to deny the argument of the text. Also if the computer makes an error you can't recount the votes and then you have a huge problem. This would be a bigger problem than a recount. But in the text they think that with the old voting system you can easily make mistakes with the count up of the votes. Officials have to go through the votes one by one and humans make mistake so they often have to recount and that costs a lot of money.
In the presentation they say that we can use computers and electronic in the banking only because we use it daily. The computerized voting system we would only use once in a year. This makes the argument that we use the computer technology everyday seem less important.
