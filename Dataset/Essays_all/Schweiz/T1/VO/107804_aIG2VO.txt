The critics want new voting systems because the traditional ones are very unlikely to use. Also the old systems could be wrong. That the result of the voting is correct is very important. An other thing which is bad in the traditional systems would be the view. Many peoples have poor eyesight and so they can vote accidently for the wrong candidate. 
So the new system have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology with which even the persons with a poor eyesight can vote for the right candidate.
The traditional systems have also another mistake: The people who have to count all the votes have to deal with thousands of ballots by hand. And this can have mistakes in the counting and if it have really a mistake, they have to count the whole thing again which is time-robbing and expensive.
The new voting system count them in a few seconds and if theres now error in the system, it will count them correct.
