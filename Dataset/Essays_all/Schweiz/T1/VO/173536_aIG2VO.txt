The presentation is clearly against the electronical voting systems. But they do have a fair bit of arguments. Don't forget that not everybody is as good with computers as we are. Will we trust those systems altough we just use them a few times a year. Some people don't even posess a laptop or a computer so how are they going to vote if not with the oldschool ballot. Human society is definitely going towards a more globalized world in which we totally rely on modern technology. But we have to be critical and be aware of the danger that comes with modern technology. Most of the people who support a change of the voting system critizise the faults that are made by the officals. They do forget that programs are developed by humans and that those programs may cause errors as well plus the errors caused by a computer may be even worse. Daily used programs such as online banking weren't flawless in the beginning. There has been a lot of problem fixing and improving since day one.
A recount with our current voting system is definitely expensive but possible. But is it possible to recount the votes counted by a computer. There is no such thing as a physical evidence. So the financial damage is probably going to be a lot bigger with an electronical voting systems. Altough there may will and have been miscounts that led to a wrong decision, an electronical voting system isn't better than the current one.
