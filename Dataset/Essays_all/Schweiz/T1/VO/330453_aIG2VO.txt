Is the coputersized tystem of voting better than de old system?
I don't think so because, with the computersized program it is not as controlled as in the old system where you have to vote with ballets.
The biggest mistake which you can make with ballots is that you count it wrong and it won't make a big difference. But an human error is natural, so if one is in the program increased  you won't have a right result. And people who can't afford to work with technological stuff wouldn't be able to make the crosses correctly. Furthermore this votings are only held twice in a year so it's nearly impossible to upgrade the program where as banking systems are used daily and heavily so it's much easier to improve the program. Additionally can we fully trust the systms? It's much easier to hack the system and use the fact against some person
