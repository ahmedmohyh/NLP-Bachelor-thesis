Voting system in the United States

Critics of the voting system of the US say that it is an inaccurate counting system and might be crucial in a very close count between two contesdents. They suggest to replace the traditioonal system by computers to make it more efficient.

In the traditional way of voting critics say that the inaccuracy of voting is by people voting for the wrong person by accident. They have to make a cross behind the candidates name on a piece of paper with many names on it and people with bad eye-sight are very likely to choose the wrong person. With the computer voting system although there is a touchscreen to choose the candidate from and people with bad eye-sight can easily magnify the name of the candidate to make sure they vote for the person thea wanted to. But it's hard for people to vote that are not used to computers or haven't grown up using one and may mark the wrong candidate as well. As well people might have fear of using one due to not believing in the reliability of the computers as people say. In the traditional voting system there surely is the factor of human error however there can be human errors in the new system as well, the program has to be done by human as well and if something is wrong with the computers, thosands of votes are wrongly counted. Another fact about computer systems is that like all the programs used by banks and others had to be evaluated and renewed after first introduced and voting only happen twice a year and have hardly any time to become more efficient.

Finally some people use the bank systems as well used by computers and much more highly sensitive information and why not use computers to vote.
