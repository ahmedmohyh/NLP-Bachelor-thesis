Today it is so usual for the younger generations to have a computer at home but the point is that not everybody has one at home and not everybody is used to a computer and knows how it works. Or maybe some people can't even afford it. These would be real problems if we had computerized voting. Sure the old system of voting can cause some errors. For example if an old lady votes for the wrong person because she can't see that well because all of the canditate's names are on one list. It is also  dangerous because the votes are counted one by one and it's all humans counting the votes. A computer would do much better  in counting and voting for the right person because the canditate's names would be written clearly and they would be no errors in things like that. But can we really trust computers? At the end the computerized voting will be programmed by humans and they can't afford themselves one little mistake because if something goes wrong, everything could be counted wrong and the computer would get fake results. We knoe that today we are really informated when it comes to technology and computers. Let's take a look at eBanking, it isextremely reliable. On the other side eBanking is used every day and it wasn't that secure at the beginning. Versus the computerized voting will be used every 2 years which can cause bad results.
