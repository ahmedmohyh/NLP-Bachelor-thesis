The voting system in the United States is a debatable subject. Some find it inefficient and would like to introduce cumputerized voting, while others prefer the traditional way of voting.

While the author of the text stated, that it would make voting a lot easier if you replaced the traditional system with computerized voting, the women of the presentation reminds us of the fact, that not all the citizens of the United States are able to afford a computer. She said it would be either difficoult or terrifying for them to use a computer, which could make them stop voting.

The woman speaking also talked about how the computer programmes have to be improved all the time until they are as trustworthy as the programmes used in banking transactions. With this statement she refers to the last two sentences of the text. She also stated, that an error in the computer programme could delete or miscount thousands of votes without anyone noticing, while the person who wrote the text only wrote about how humans miscount votes and that it is expensive to recount.
