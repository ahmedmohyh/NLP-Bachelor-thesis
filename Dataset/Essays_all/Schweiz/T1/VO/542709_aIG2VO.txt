In the text is written that computerized voting would be much easier to view the names of the candidates and that it's unlikely to make a mistake. The women hasn't the same opinion about that. She said that it may see easy to use a computer in the eyes from a specialist, but people who don't have a computer or can't afford one would get in trouble. In conclusion of that they could also happen a lot of mistakes. Another argument from her is, that the programm is also created by humans. There can always be mistakes in the programing. And if their is an error in the programm, a recount would be nearly impossilble, what wouldn't be the case when the votes happen on ballots.
It's written in the text that complex computer technology like bank transactions are used every day and that this works. The women argumented that they work so good is because they are used every day. She also said that they didn't worked very well in the begining and that their were a lot of errors. The voting programm would only be used about two times in a year, so it can't be tested very good and a mistake in the computerized system would be fatal.
