For people who are not used to computers, especially elderly people, it is very difficult to do some important things like voting on a computer. They could cast the wrong name on the list or maybe they could cast the whole list, because they are not used to computers. Miscounts would be a enormous problem. In the text it is said that the voting systems in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes, because one person has to count the votes. Of cours nobody is perfect, so it is inevitable that this person will make a mistake.
Computer systems are made from humans. May the humans have made an mistake inviting the systems and the whole vote is removed or they the votes could be miscounted. In the text they thing the opposite: the voters have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper, so especially people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name.
