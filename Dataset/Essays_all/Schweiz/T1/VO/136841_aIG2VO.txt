The lector mentioned 3 main points against computerized voting systems. First of all, while people might make mistakes with paper ballots by choosing the wrong candidate by accident, using a computer to vote may be detrimental to the cause, since not all people are used to using computers. Elderly people will have problems using computers to vote, and may even be discouraged to do so. Furthermore, while human error is present when counting paper ballots, the computer used to count the votes are not perfect either, simply because they are programmed by humans who will make mistakes. While counting the ballots by hand will result in one or two wrong vots per worker, a bug could lead to thousands and thousands of wrong votes, and it is impossible to recount the votes since the ballots are not stored externaly most of the time. To the people who say that other complex computer technology are used everyday, the lector says that exactly becasue they are used everyday and are used heavily, the computer errors are discovered very quickly and resolved even faster. When those complex computer technology first came out, there was a lot of mistakes which got resolved in time. There will be a lot of mistakes while using a computerized voting system as well, but because they are only used once ever two years at the most, it will take much more time to perfectionate such programs. 




while we are at it, a quick feedback.
You should secure your programm more. If I wanted, I could listen to the recording as often as I wanted. at least disable the windows key and the alt-tab function while in the program. is beeing able to write the desired effect? because it is possible to do so.
