The text describes the benefits of a new voting system. They say that the current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and so they were looking for a better way and now they think they found a solution to replace the traditional system with a computerized voting. Obviously the most important reason to replace the current systems is that today in the United States people have to make a small mark next to the name of a candidate. This is a big problem for example for people with poor eyesight or old people. The new system makes it possible that the people just have to touch the candidates's name because of the touch-screen. But now we there's another problem. What about the people who don't have a computer at home or at least never used a computer before. There are a lot of people who can't use a computer. So there is no guarantee that there won't be no wrong votes because of the new computerized voting system.
Another point is that the current systems rely on people to count the votes. So it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes because they have to go through so much ballots. And that can fake a resultat in the end. In a computerized voting system there's no chance for human errors. The computer will count the votes easily and it isn't dependent on human at all. But now we have to say that the the programm is made by humans. So they can make a mistake and that is definitly a bigger mistake than a wrong count.
