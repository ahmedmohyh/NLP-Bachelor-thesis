The handcounting system is not that accurate than the people think. The counting people, have to check thousands of ballots, so it's impossible to not make mistakes. Also there are votingmistakes. The people have to find her candidat on a long list with all the names of the candidats and make a cross next to the name of her favorit. But older people, or other people with bad eyesight have problems to set the cross at the right place. The solution is, to computerize the voting system. The only thing the voters to do, is to click on their favorite candidat and their voting is done. All in all, the computerized voting would be much easier, much faster than the tradidtional voting and there won't be any counting mistakes.

It is true, that a comuterized system would be much faster, but not easier. A lot of people don't use their computers regularily. They would have problems with the voting. In fact, they could vote for the wrong candidat like in the traditional system. By the way, this computer programm or this website would be made by a human. Why shouldn't be there a mistake in the system too? So, if there was an error in the computerized system, the damage would be much bigger than the little voting mistakes in the traditional system. Instead of one or two votingmistakes they would be thousends of mistakes. To summarize, the ballots are saver countet in the traditional way, there are only a few and little mistakes.
