So we are talking about the voting system in the United States of America. Nowadays there's the possibility to vote with computer-voting-machines. This opportunity to vote with technology, is a good thing for lots of people. To vote on the computers is especially comfortable for those, who use the computer regularly, teenagers or young adults for example, and who know how to use it. But what with those who aren't used to the computer? For example old people or people having a disability? For these human beings this technology isn't really adapted, so a lot of times they vote the wrong person because they can't see very well or they just don't really understand where their favourite one is listed on the screen of the voting machine. By the way though the computer-voting-machine is fully trusted and is a modern way for voting. These systems are used daily, although in the USA there's the chance to vote once every two years, and maybe in some States a few more times. There's a concurrence between voting by computer or by pen, the traditional voting system. Is it already old-fashioned to vote by pen? Everyone has its own opinion for this. If this new system, voting with the computer, is really that bad and inefficient, how critizens describe it, that at the end probably the votes don't correspond to them they should have been, maybe one day the world comes just back with the "older" system, voting by pen. Both system, the technological and traditional one have their advantages and disadvantages, most people trust more the computers than the counters, the people which have to count vote by vote, reading them on the sheets of paper. Let's say, the computer is in our days a perfect way to communicate and to work. If the computer was installed to be neutral, how it really should be, everyone can really trust it, finally the votes should be correct and not wrong.
