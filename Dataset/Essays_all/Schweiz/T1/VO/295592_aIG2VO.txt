The voting system in the United States

The main point in this essay is the voting system in the USA. Some people think it should be a computer voting and others say it should be as it is right know (you mark the candiate you want on a sheet of paper). In the speaking part they had arguments against the computer voting. A computer voting wouldn't take place without any problems. A computer voting would be good or easy for those who uses computers everyday but for those who can't afford one or aren't instructed like the older people it would be more difficult to vote. So but if your really want a computer voting system it takes years or more to have a system which is as good or safe as the ones we use in the banks. There is also another differents between the bank system and the computer voting. The bank system is used every day and it also showed us as i wrote before i took many years to have a safe and a working system. The computer voting system won't be used everyday so why should we produce something like that for years when we use it just once in four years. Also a main point in the speaking part was that an error counitng done by humans isn't as worse as a computer error which misscounts everthing.
In the reading part they support a computer voting system. They say that the counting system we use now is inefficient and inaccurate in counting so it is the opposite the other group says. They also say the possibility of voting the wrong is higher than with the computer voting. They also show us nearly the opposite of the other group because, they say that we trust the computer everywhere and daily so why souldn't we do that also for the voting. And another opposite view is that they think human errors happen more and are more fatale than computer errors in counting the votes.
