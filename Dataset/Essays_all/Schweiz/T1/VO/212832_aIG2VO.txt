The voting systems used in the United States may be a bit inefficient but that doesn't mean that computerizing the whole voting is going to make it any easier and there are some arguments mentioned in the presentation that support this.  
One of the main problems is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because pepople with poor eyesight mark the wrong name, but for the people who aren't used to computers or technology it's also going to be difficult to vote. The fact that they aren't used to computers, because of whatever reason, might cause stress and panic, which leads to voting for the wrong candidate.
The counting system on the computer may also be a problem. The counting programms are programmed by humans, who also make mistakes that can be even more serious. One single mistake can result in thousands of votes being miscounted or even getting deleted. This means that the recount of the votes is impossible. If a person makes a mistake, a recount is possible but the process is very long and expensive.
Finally the programms used for banking transactions are used daily and they get improved every time they see a mistake. If we compare bank transactions and votings, votings are only held every two years nationally, the programm will only be used every two years and mistakes will be harder to detect and the programm will be harder to improve, which makes everything even more complicated.
