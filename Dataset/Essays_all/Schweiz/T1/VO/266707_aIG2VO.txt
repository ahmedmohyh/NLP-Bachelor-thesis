The text is saying that voting in the United States is inefficent and that it's easy to make some faults. And also the women said that the voting how they do it now in the U.S isn't at a high level as well. She said that the counting strategy is not good right now but it wouldn't be better if a computer is counting the votes because the computer is programmed by human and so it is possible as well that the computer makes some mistakes as well. The text also said that people with bad eyes can easily vote for the wrong men and so the computer can't be the solution for those people. All in all what the women wants to say is, that they need an other solution,a better one, a more efficent one and cheaper one. It would need a computer course for all the old people because they can't handle with computers.The text is comparing the computer technology system of the voting and the sytstem of some banks. But the women thinks that's nonesense because the bancs are  more trustworthy than the new voting sytsem.
