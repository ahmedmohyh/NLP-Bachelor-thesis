In the text which is for the computer voting it is said that people make inaccurate counting of votes which leads to miscounts and that is a problem for important votes. So a vote could go for a wrong candidate which is not the purpose of giving an individuel opinion. Also a point which is meant in the text is, that people with poor eyesight can easily mark a wrong name, which does not occure if there is a computer in which we can change the settings for everyone. Another negative thing of normal voting is that we have to count the votes one by one where it is a great possibility of making things wrong, but a computer could easily count all votes in a few seconds without mistakes. The last argument for the computer voting is that such systems are already in progress for example in banking transactions or as well communication, which does not make any problems.
Against the computer voting are the problems, that only people with computer knowledge can handle such system correctly and the others would surely make a mistake. Also is a computer programmed by human so it is possible that an error could take place. Another point which is said in the hearing is, that this voting systems would only be used all two years and in this time many things could happen such as inserting a trojaner or giving an error counting system which manipulates a voting system.
