The main statemaent is that using computers to improve the efficiency of the voting system in the United States may not be the best solution. It is said that there certainly are people that don't know how to handle a computer since they just never used one before or they fear the technology. The text however, emphasizes that there is a programm to be developed that everyone manage. It would be based on an easy-to-touch-screen-technology which could solve the problem of people voting for the wrong person because of their bad eyesight. However, the opposers do not doubt that this is a bad aspect to improve the system. Further the ability of the human was questioned by the opposers. The text mentioned that computerized system could remove the possibility of human errors when counting the votes. But the opposers say that humans are the ones that write the actual programme for the computerized system so there is a high possibility that they could have made some crucial mistakes. For example the e-banking is only this competent because there were mistakes at the beginning. But they all were corrected since is it used daily not like the voting system that is needed every two years only for the presidential election or twice a year in some states for elections within the state.
