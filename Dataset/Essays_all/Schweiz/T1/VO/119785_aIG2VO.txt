Some people in the US said that the voting system, in the US is inefficient and they want a computerized voting system. In the text it is said, that the computerized form of voting would be more efficient and easier. In traditional voting sometimes they vote for the wrong candidate, because they only have to set a mark next to the name and they can easily make the mark next to the wrong name. Critics said, that with the computerized system there will be less errors. They also said, that there are going to be less human errors by counting the votes. Because if the votes are computerized, the computer will count the votes easily and without any errors. In the spoken part they had other arrguments which are more about the possitives of the traditional voting system. They said, thatwe have to know, that there are people who doesn't really know how to use a computer and it would be difficult for them to do the voting computerized.  An other arrgument was, that the computer can make mistakes too and we can not be sure, that they won't make any errors. And it can also be, that the computer makes bigger mistakes than the human, because computers are programized by people. So in the end we can't say, what would be the better way to vote because both have their good and bad things about having a fair voting.
