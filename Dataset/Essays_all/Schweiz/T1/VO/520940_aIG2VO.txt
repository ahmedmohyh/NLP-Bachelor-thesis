Voting 

Many people belive that the voting system is inefficient and leads to inaccurate counting of votes. A reason for this opinion is that people accidentally mark the wrong candidate because everything is written so small and compact. Those people are usually old or have a poor eyesight which also means that they probably don't use a computer and will have even more difficulties with a computerized voting system. The other big problem with the current voting system is that the votes are counted manually and if an error has been found they have to recount all the votes of course an inefficient kind of working. But a computerized voting system won't eliminate this inevitable human caused problem. Because who would programm those computers? Humans and yes they will make still programming errors which will cause more serious problems. Finacial transactions are made every day with computers but you cannot compare them with a voting system which is only used every to years.
