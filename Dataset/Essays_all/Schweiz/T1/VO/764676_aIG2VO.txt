E-voting is a big thing in the USA. It has critics and it has also people who think that computerized voting must not be allowed.
The critics say that the usual system fails because there are some points which are very important for people who have problems with reading or have a poor eyesight. They think that this people vote for the wrong person and so they could no vote how they actually would. 
The counters too could make errors. The critics say so too that the computers could not make some human errors and that it will be a lot faster if they count the votes with computers.

The people who think that computerized voting is bullshit say that they use computerprogramms all day and it could fail and all the results could be destroyed. And all the people who have voted must going new for voitng.

This is an opinion but how the women in the hearing said, the system may fail but they have to improve it like all the other computerbased systems and it gives also systems for banking transactions which are very important and they work also very good. They have enough time to improve it from the first vote to the second vote with this system too.
