It is said that by the tradition way of elections in the U.S. nowdays, it is likely that especially older people and people who can't see that well cross the wrong name because of all the other names on the voting sheet. The computerized method is promissing that people who aren't able to see well can see the names big in the screen and only have to press the one they want to vote for. The problem in all of this could be that people who are less used to cumputers would have big problems.
An other source of mistakes are the people who count the votes. At the moment there sit people who count every vote by hand. This can lead to big inaccuracy. The solution of the computerized way would be that comupters count all the votes because computers can't make mistakes in counting. The problem in this point is that computers have to be programmed and this programming would be the major mistake source. The mistake of one programmer could lead to miscounting in the whole States. Because it is only voted very rarely there would be not much chance to remove the mistakes made by programmers.
An other problem is the security. It is said that with the computers there would be a lower safety in the election. But the security nowdays is really high and it's compareble with the security of bank transactions.
