In the text it was sayed that traditonal voting systems aren't better as the computerized voting systems. But in the listening they mentionated some problems about computerized voting systems. 
One big problem ist that not everybody is used to computers and there are people who can't afford an computer. But in the other hand by using the computerized voting systems, the are able to count the votes automatically and very quickly. By using the old methode, they can make many mistakes in counting by hand. This can influece the voting if the election if it is closely contested. An other problem of using this voting system ist that people can accidently vote for the wrong person. 
So in the end, we have to say that if there are too many votings every year the computerized technique will be the best one. But if there are only a voting once a year or even all two years, the old methode would be the best one.
