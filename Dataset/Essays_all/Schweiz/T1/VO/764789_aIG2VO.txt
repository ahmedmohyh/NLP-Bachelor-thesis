The Text is about wheter the voting system of the United States should be computerized, which means that people would be able to vote on their personal devices. First, the computersystem is considered as safer as the tradional system where real human beings are counting the votes, since machines are much more effiecient and free of human errors. The problems caused by falsely counting the votes can be enormeous especially when an election is closely contested.Further, the computerized counting doesn't need as much time as the tradional way, which means it's way more efficient and cheap. Although the positives of computerized voting are obvious, there are also major negative points: First of all are not all people of the States used to computers, some are too old, some can't afford one and some simply don't use them. This leads to a huge amount of people who couldn't vote because of their lack of knowledge about computers. The critics say also that this new election system may be insecure, considering that the it wouldn't be used very often so there isn't much time to detect problems and improve.
