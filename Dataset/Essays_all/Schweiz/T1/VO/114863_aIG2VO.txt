Human make mistakes. That is normal. But we can't afford them in elcetions. There it is very important to have an accurate voting and that no ballot is forgotten or is read wrong. The offical counters have a big responsibility. Because they have to read so many ballots it is understandable that they may count them wrong. The ballot is too full. Ther is much confusion. But the turst in the human hand is still big enough that the United States of Amercia haven't changed their voting system. 
The traditional old system was so many times imporved and for a long time daily used that the possibele mistakes would be very small. Althoug some people wnat to computerize the whole system. That should be easier for the voter and for the counters, who wouldn't be necessary anymore. But what if there were an computer error? Then the whole voting would be flase. The damage would be way bigger than the damage in counting by hand. 
The new generation is used to the technology wich is on the market.The computerized system would be easy for them. But what about the older people? They are scared of all these technical things. They didn't grow up with them. They still want to vote but it is too complicated. And those people who can't afford a computer they couldn't vote anymore even if they had the right to.
