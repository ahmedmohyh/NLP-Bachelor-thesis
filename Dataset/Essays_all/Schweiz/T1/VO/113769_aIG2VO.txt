"Voting"

In the United States there is the question if the voting should be online in future. Some people are hopeing that the result is going to be more efficient and accurate. Others are saying that computers can also count wrong.

If computers are going to count our votings they are going to be faster than humans. As a consequence there are less jobs and money needed. The traditional system with counting by humans is not as efficient and accurate as a computer can be. And peoples can also have sympatics for a candidate, so he can count wrong to help his favourite.

Other people do not trust computers. They are programmed from humans, so there can also be inaccurate. Furthermore there are people who are not confident with computers like older people and computers can also count wrong. For to by and to install computers there are also humans needed and it is expensive and have to be improved bevor it worked more or less.
