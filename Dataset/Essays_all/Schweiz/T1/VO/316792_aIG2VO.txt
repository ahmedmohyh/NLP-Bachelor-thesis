If we want to change the voting system into the computer voting we have to deal with the problem, that not everyone has a computer, because maybe he can't afford it. And even if you can afford one, a lot of especially elderly people aren't used to work with computer and this digital system. In the beginning a lot of mistakes will be made by people don't know how to work with these computers and the voting system. So the problem that people accidentally vote for the wrong person won't be solved.
When humans work together, there will always mistakes been made. Computers just work how they have to based on their program they work on. If the programm works perfectly, the result will also be perfect. But when there is just one small mistakes in the programm made by humans (a "1"instead of a "0" for example) it can cause a damage contenting thousands of miscounted votes. This is far worse than a few miscounted votes in one ballot. 
We trust in the complex coumputer technology in banking transactions or in the communication of highly sensitive information because nowadays we use them daily. They also had their problems in the beginning when they were invented and it needed a lot of time, until the people started to trust them and they were as reliable as they are today.
