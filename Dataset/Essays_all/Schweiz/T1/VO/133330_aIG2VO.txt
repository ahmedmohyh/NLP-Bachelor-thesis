The lady said that people make mistakes at counting the votes and the text agrees. But in the text it is written that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, but as it was said in the oral, computers rely on humans and humans make mistakes programming those computers and who knows if they are any better than humans? There is no such system yet. 
The computer we use today evolved. It took years and years to improve them and to trust them and a computerized system will not be used everyday so its harder to trust it, which gives an explanation from the lady why people won't trust the system compared to the text which just asks why we trust other technology, but not the voting technology.
 And what happens when all the votes are getting lost in cyberspace? Nobody will be able to get them back.
