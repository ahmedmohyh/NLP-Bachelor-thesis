Summarizing the arguments that were said in the lecture, it is clear that there were differences. For example the lecture was criticizing the computerized voting while the text was favouritising the this system. While the text was pointing out the flaws of the current voting system in America, the lecture was pointing the flaws of the computerized system in other words the alternative that the critics in the text were offering. 
In the lecture it was said that a computerized system would have a much higher inaccuracy than the tradional system because of the fear of technology that some people have. In the text they were critizing the innacuracy of the traditional system because the people that have to count the votes are human and the chance of human error is very high. Whereas the lecture stated that a computerized system could have devastating causes for a vote. This means that if the computerized system contains an error that a human created the chances of leading in an innacuracy of the votes is much bigger if some ballots have been forgotten.
Another argument stated by the lecture was possibility of loosing thousands of votes and not being able to collect them from the data. While the text was saying that the computerized system would deminish the possibility of people voting the wrong candidate the lecture 'countered' stating the same chances could happen if the system was computerized.Therefore leading to more missvotes.
Another argument was the a lot of people would not be able to vote because of the lack of computers in some homes in America leading to a vast decrease of people voting. Which would lead to a huge inactivity of voting.
The only point where the lecture and the text agreed was the high risk of this computerized system because it would be to complicated for some people.
