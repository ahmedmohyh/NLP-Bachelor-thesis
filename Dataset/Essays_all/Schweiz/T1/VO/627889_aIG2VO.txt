In the text, it`s said that the current voting systems are the problem of many mistakes by voting people. For example, people who don`t have good eyes, can easily miss the person who they want to choose on the sheet and vote for the wrong one. And critics say that it`s unefficient to count every single ballot and that the civilisation needs a more efficient system. But in the film, it`s said that the computerized, complicated system is very dangerous. Not just that people, who don`t know how to use computers, have a big problem. If the computerized system makes mistakes, the consequences can be terribly. The voting can turn out incredibly wrong (for thousands of votes). By seeing that point of the discussion, it doesn`t seem like a problem if the counters or the voters make a few mistakes. 
So the text says that the traditional voting system makes too many mistakes and the hearing example tells us that the computerized voting system makes too many mistakes.
At the end, the question is how safe are computer systems? Nobody knows until it gets testet for real.
