The current voting system of the United States may be flawed, but it is doubtful that computerized voting will be better. 
Especially people of the older generation have diffuculties using  technology, so there might be some people who aren`t able to vote because of a lack of knowledge about computer programs. Also, not everyone has an easy acces to a computer, for example poor or homeless people.

It is also questionable if computerized voting will erase the possibility of errors, because systems are programmed by humans, therefore there can be human errors too. These errors might even have more devastating effects,that would cause a greater inaccuracy than just counting a few ballots wrongly.
And if there was an error to be found, recounting the ballots would be difficult or even impossible.

Another point is that elections take place only ever other year nationwide, and locally about twice a year, which isn`t very frequently. The effort to create a trustworthy and efficient computerized voting system seems a little ridicoulos.
All things considered, it`s fair to say that at this time,  a computerized voting system would not be benefitting the United States.
