The computers maybe easily to handle for people who are used to work with computers, but old people or people who fear the technology dont know how to handle the computer and can easily make mistakes in their votings. In comparison to the text here it says that just the people who know computers have it easier but the computeruntrained people have no chnace. But in the text it clearly says that the programs are easy to use and that you can do nothing wrong there. Also it is a high risk that the programs, that the votes take and count, have errors and then there are not just some miscount ballots, there are tousands of miscounted or even lost votes. In the text they argument with the technologys we use in banking transactions and in the world of communication. But in the audio file they outargument this argumentation by saying that those programs for banking transactions and communication are very trained and used every day. So mistakes are easily found and corrected. At the end these programs are free of mistakes cause of the often use. But the futuristic voting programs will be used once in a month or even once in a year. They will be very untrained and we dont have the needed security in the program. So it's riskier to work with a computer to work instead to just count it by hand and vote by hand. At the end we can say both ways are risky and not safe anyways, but when we try it with the programs we will have to do it right.
