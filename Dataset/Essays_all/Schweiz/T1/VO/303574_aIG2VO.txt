Summary

These two texts are about the systems of voting. They spoke about the disadvantages and advantages of computer and traditional voting.

A disadvantage about the traditional voting is, that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, because of the groupe of people, which have poor eyesight. These people would easily mark the wrong name. And if these people can make voting on the computer, they can just touch the candidate's name on the screen and they can also zoom the name for a better viewing. 
Also an advantage about the computer voting is, that it needs not so many people to count the votes, because the computer can count the votings automatically. Without the computer it needs a stuff, which have to count with thousands of ballots and it is possible and an human thing, that they will make mistakes. 
They have also spoken, that this computer votings are also programmed by humans. And that is also an human thing, that they could make some mistakes.
We are also confronted in our daily life with such computer systems, which we are similar with. But we have to vote just for one time in a year, and that is why we are not so similar with this type of voiting and it is difficult to make the people sure about this thoughts.
