The text has in many occations a different opinion than the woman who spoke, now a comparison of these opinions: "The automatic voting system is more easy to use", well this statement ist only true for those people, who are used to computers and people who can afford a computer. If someone cannot do this, he couldn't vote and his vote will be missed. And the automatic system can break up in the middle of a voting and nothing  can be made, everything would e lost just because of a fear of technology. With the traditional voting, it could be that a few ballots would been missed, but it's not the majority. The current voting system could discounte thousands of votes and another decision will be made. The text says, that we can trust the technology, so as we trust it on banking transactions and so on...But this systems are used daily, and not only once in two years. Although now they are working well, they had to be improved and improved since they were introduced, that will be the same with the voting system. Consequently, there's a good reason to question, if the automatic voting system is better than the traditional.
