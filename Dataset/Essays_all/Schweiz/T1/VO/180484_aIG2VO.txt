The voting system in the Unitet Staates is a global theme. The person which will be elected will have much power. So the voting has to be exact. There are People and critics which say that they should vote with on a computer and not on paper. But there's also the opposite wich says that also computer make mistakes and they are human made too. The ones wich want to do it on paper say that all the persons are very used to the new technolociqual stuff and they will make mistakes for example by voting for the wrong person by accident. but the group of critics which are for the new system say that there are also mistakes made if its written on paper. The ones who count the papers can also make mistakes. They mention that they have to concentrate themselves for a long time and its just natural to make mistakes by counting. The other way round say the others that its was true that the computers were used daily but the election was not very often and we really didnt`t now how exact the computers were.
