Current voting - efficient or inefficient?

It is said that current voting would be inefficient in the US. People could accidentally vote for the false person in a traditional voting. On the one hand every computer has today a really good screen and so people with poor eyesight may have a better choice to choose the right candidate. On the other hand the traditional voting is more personal. But traditional voting has one point which isn't good. We know human make a lot of mistakes by handwriting. But we also know that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error. There is also a problem by traditional votings because there are a lot of ballots where you have to go through. It could be that the number of mistakes increase. Well, computerized systems may also be better for people who use computers often. In conclusion it's difficult to say that computers are better because the voting by hand is only once in the US  and we are using our computers every day.
