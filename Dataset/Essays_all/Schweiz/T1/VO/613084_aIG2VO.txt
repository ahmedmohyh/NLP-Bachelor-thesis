In the text and the listening, there are two different sides of electric voting. One side says, that there isn't any trust in the nowerdays votings. Because it is sometimes just a paper which easily gets lost. They want an electric voting. I would be a lot easier to bring all votes together and it would reduce work. But the woman in the video said, that the internet isn't safe. If there would be an error for a short time, they would lose a lot of the votes from the humans. She also talked about the flawlessnes from the internet. In the computerworld, there are a lot of hackers who could destroy a lot of datas. It is incredible how the todays societs is built on the internet. If a good hacker would catch the server from Google, the whole internet would be "down". And if this happends, the world would change completely. This is the reason, why we should stay with papervotings. Because in the end, it is the safer way from a democratie. And the argument with the poor eyesight is also stupid. If a person really is interestet in politics, why should he choose another guy who candidates too, just because of her same first name for example?

I have to apologise, that i can't speek about the whole video. Almost over the whole video i haven't heard anything. The microphone wasn't turned on. And I couldn't refresh this beautiful voice again.

But why do they wanna vote either, when they only can descide between an rasict Trumps, and a liar Hillary. I'm glad that I don't have to descide between them. Here in Europe we can catch us some popcorn and just enjoy how a land destroys themselves.
