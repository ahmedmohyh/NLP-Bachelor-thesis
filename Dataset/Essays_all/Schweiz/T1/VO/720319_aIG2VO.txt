A lot of mistakes can be made with traditional voting. When peoplevote,they can vote for the wrong candidate. That's because there is a lot of names in the lists and they just have to put a small mark next to the name, and some people isn't able to se very well, so they could mistaken.A computerized voting could help to don't make mistakes.The voters could find the names easier and then they only need to clic on the name for voting. But it will be easier for pepole who use often computers. The others could make mistakes too and vote for the wrong candidate, etc. 
The second point is for the counting of the votes. It often happens that they must to count the votes one by one, and it's inevitable for an human being to make mistakes.The computer can do that faster and without any mistakes. But if the computer programm is wrong, and if it makes a mistake, this mistakemight be bigger than if it was a man. If a man make a mistake, it's about tensof votes, but for a computer programm it could be about hundreds and even thousands of votes.
