She said that computers are programmed by humans and humans can make faults by wirte the voting programm. Wehn humans count the votes, the only fault can be that they count some votes less. But when theres a mistake in the programm, it could be that verly much votes are false. In the text they talk about the failures which can be made when the people vote by using the computerprogramm. They could vote the false person because they saw too less but this can also be a problem when problem when people vote writing a name on a paper. In the text, they also think it's a problem that the votes are count by one person and some where must be faults. But the women said in the lecture the same but I think she is right when she said that it's the bigger problem when there's a fault in the computerprogramm because then more votes could be misscount. They think in the text that we must give the technology a thought because it works in the banking system and thats right. Other peope think it's risky but why not give it a tought maybe with a test voting which couldn't have bad followings.
