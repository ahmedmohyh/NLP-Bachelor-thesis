In the lecture it is said, that traditional voting has a few problems. In that she agrees with the text. However she goes on saying that using a computer to vote won't solve these problems. She declares, that people who don't use computers everyday or can't afford a computer would probably be discouraged by a voting system involving a computer and not vote at all. 
She also says, that people make mistakes, just like it is said in the text, but goes on to disagree with the text saying that since human beings would have to program a voting system for the computer, it could also make mistakes. She even adds that when a computer makes a mistake it could be a far bigger problem, because it would not only miss one ballot, but count wrong all together. She also agrees with the text in that we trust computers in banking etc. but she explains that when these systems first came out, they had quite a few errors, which they now managed to fix, but since voting systems would only be used twice a year in the United States, the program would be nearly untested and likely unsafe.
