So, the voice we heard was totally against to replace the old traditional voting system with a new computer technology system. The woman who has been talking to us mentioned some arguments against the technology. One of them was the statement that computers can't improve the voting system because not everyone has the knowledge to use them safely and in this case many errors will be done either. In the text which is against the traditional voting system they talked about the difficulty of the ballets, in which many errors are done, because of the large list of names and the little mark you have to right down next to the name. Even people with poor eyesight are in this case in a bad situation and alot of them will make errors. Another point of the Woman who talked who contrabutes with the argument of the text was that computers are made by humans so errors are possible too. Even worser things could happen than to oversee a mark. The whole computer system could turn down and all the choices can be delted.
