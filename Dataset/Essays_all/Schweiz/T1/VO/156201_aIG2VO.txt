Firstly, yes it is true that people who have not good eyes could vote the wrong thing or that it is not that not so efficient like computers. But how many people are not used to computers? A lot people would not vote if their have to vote with them because their do not get it and their afraid to fail and vote the wrong candidat. 
And yes it is true that humans make mistakes by the counting of the votes and a recount is not cheap but computers are not perfect eighter. They are made by Humans and if the computer fails and delets everything you can not make a recountig you would have a serieous problem because all the votes would be deleted.
Computer systems have to be proofed for years before they work good enough. The problem is that the vooting is just every second year. And it has to work otherwise it would be a desaster. 

In my opinion we should try it and work a programm out which can handle it. And we could try it in the voting of staates. Because no risk no fun and if it finally works it would be a bit step for humanitiy and maybe the people have to get use to it but at some time you have to start. It would make voting a lot easier.
