Computer based voting systems are programmed by human so there can be a human error in the code of the vote counting program. The text says that human couting the votes makes more errors than a computer. But a error in a computerized system can make far more damage and can change the result of a voting by thousends of votes. When a human makes a mistake the damage is much smaller and only change the result by one or two votes. The system of banking transactions and communication of highly sensitive information is so secure because it was made better over the years, not because they were secure from the beginning.
