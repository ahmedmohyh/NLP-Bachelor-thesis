There is a lot of controversy around the current voting system in the US. The upcoming election are making the people think about, wether the system is good or not. Can the voting system can change the outcome of an election?

While critics say that traditional voting system should be replaced with a computerized one. Many people doubt that a new system would improve the inaccuracies. They think when people make mistake counting the votes, why would not they make an error programming the computers which would be far worse than a few miscounts here and there. We trust computer with complex  things like banking transaction, the voting system is only used once every two years national wide and a few times more localy. Banking transaction and other things we use daily use to have flaws too.

The critics think it would not be so easy to vote for the wrong canditate, if the system was coputerized. Because there would not be so many names on one ballot. What they seem to forget are people who can not afford a computer or people who do not know how to use one.
