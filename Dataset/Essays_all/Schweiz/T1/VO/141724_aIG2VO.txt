Because many peole don`t like the voting system of the United States, there was the idea of making a new computerized voting system. Those who prefere the old voting system arguments, that many people aren`t used to computer, either because they are homeless, can`t afford one, don`t use them on daily bases or simply don`t like them. On the other side the traditional voting system is bad for the ones with poor eyesight, because they have to search the names in a large lists and it is easy to accidentaly vote for the wrong candidate. Although they are errors in almost every vote, there is no guarante that the computer doesn`t make errors too. And while a persons count a few votes wrong, a computer can lose a thousands of votes. An other argument against a new voting system is, that it almost never works flawless at the beginning. It has to be improved over time. But national votes are only once in two years.
