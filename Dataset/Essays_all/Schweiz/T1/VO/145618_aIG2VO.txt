Computerized voting is heavily criticised during the lecture. Saying that some peple can't afford a computer or aren't good with computer and are scared to vote by computer, fearing that they could make a mistake. They also doubted that the computer does a good job because ultimatly the programs used by the computer are developed by humans and so human error can also affect computerized voting. The lecture says that if humans count the votes mistakes are likely to happen, but that if thers's a mistake in the computer program the mistake is spread more widely than one mistake made in one case by human hand.They say that a recount is impossible in computerized voting, because mistake mad in a program often lead to a chain reaction of mistakes in the whole voting.They would have to repeat the voting.
In the text they criticised the counting of votes by human hand and said that it is inefficient and easy to manipulate. They also said in the text that computerized voting is more efficient and safer. In the lecture they did the exact opposite, criticising the computerized voting in favour of the voting by checking a name on a ballot.
