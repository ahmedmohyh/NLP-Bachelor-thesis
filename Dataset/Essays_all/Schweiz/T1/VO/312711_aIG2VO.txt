Intruducing a new voting system could be troublesome because a programm is made by humans and humans tend to do errors so the programms could also have many errors and that could leed to a lot worse then the old voting system which relies heavily on people. People who are not used to computers on the daily basis would also have many problems with a new voting system. Are we even sure that a new computer system would make the voting system better? Because the programms and systems we use on our daily basis had to be improved many and many times over so they would work like they should. Also a big factor in this issue would be the acceptance of the older people who are not used to computers.
The old voting system may look like the right choice but the voting system done by humans is is inefficient and inaccurate. Old people or people with poor eye-sight could mark the wrong name on the huge list of names. In a close election a vote more or less could mean everything so that the humanerrors may not be tolerated. A good made computer programm could count the votes many times faster than officals could and it would be better than the same vote done by humans because it would have close to no errors in it.
