The presentation is about the current voting system in the United States. They mention, that computerized voting systems are not as good, as many people think. One of their argument is, that there are many people, that can not handle computers, because they are not used to them. If a person never used a computer before, it is nearly impossible for him or her to do the voting on a computer, even though the critics of the current voting system think, that it would be much easier to read. An other problem of the computerized voting system that is mentioned is, that there are many people who are too pooor to buy a computer with their own money, so it would be difficult for them, to find a computer where they coud do their voting. They also question the thesis, that coputer would make less mistakes while counting the ballots. They even think that the computers could make more mistakes than the officials, because they are all programmed by human beings. So they do not argree with the argument from the essay, where the say that human errors could be removed. In the presentation they also mention, that these computer programms for voting would not be used that often, because nationwide voting is usually every two years. This means, that one would only find mistakes in the programm every two years and the programm would probably still contain faults after many years of nationwide voting. With this argument, they disagree with the argument mentioned in the essay, that computers very rarely do faults in these days.
