The main theme of the discussion is if computer voting is easier and safer than traditional voting or if it's not. They mostly have the same point of view but not in every case.

Both of them say that the traditional voting has many problems lately. In the text they write that it's difficult for people with a poor eyesight to mark the right name on the sheet. It would be much easier if everyone could do it on a computer.
 But in the audio they talk about the disadvantages if the computer. They say it's very difficult for people who don't usually use computers to vote on it just one time all two years. 
They also say that computers are made by people and if people can make mistakes by voting, then why they shouldn't do any when they're building computers? This argument directly speaks against the argument from the text in which is written that computer voting is much safer and trustworthier than traditional voting. 

All in all the text is definitely pro computer voting and the audio against it and belives in the traditional system.
