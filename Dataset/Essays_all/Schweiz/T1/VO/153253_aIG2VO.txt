In the United States are still traditional voting systems with pen and paper. A lot of people would change this into modern computer voting systems. But their's also a lot of critics against this. There are for both systems advantages and disadvantages. In this eassy we will going to answer this difficult question about the american voting systems.

So in the tradional voting system there is a long list with all names of the candidates. You have to search your favourite and cross this name. For older people this is sometime very difficult, to find the right name. Another problem is to count all this votes. The USA has a very big population. It takes a lot of time to coutn all this votes.
The other more modern choice is to vote on voting machines with a touchscreen. There it is more easily to use so also old people are able to see the names clearly and give their vote. But critics say that there are many people who didn't manage to use this voting machines. So the problem is that not everyone would  could use this and we have to ask ourself if we are sure that the new method is better.

So in the end we have to discuss this problem very well to find the best solution, which makes the voting for the people more easy.
