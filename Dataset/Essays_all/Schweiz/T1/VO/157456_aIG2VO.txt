Voting is very important for every democratic nation. It gives them the right to decide who they want, as their representatives, so it isn't surprising, that many people want to improve the current votingsystem. This improvement could be achieved by involving computer-systems into the analysationg of votes. 
At first these computers may be programmed wrong, which could result in a desasterous miscount of votes and even make the wrong candidate become president. But after those Programms are tested long enough they might replace humans. 
Elderly people might not be common with the new computers so they might not understand this technology. On the other hand, there are more and more older people who don't have a good eyesight anymore and the small letters on the ballots might not be good readable for them also with a lot of similar looking names this could result in misvote. This could be avoided by computers with presenting an image of each candidate next to their name. Furthermore when humans make an error and it is detected, this results in an expensive recount of votes. But if the error in the Computer is detected this results just in a reprogramming of the system and then a short rerun of the programm.
In the end mankind is evloving constantly, and so are our systems. In every area there are new technologies beeing used. Sooner or later this will also happen to the voting system, partly beacause of the lazyness of humans and also because of our demand to speed things up constantly.
