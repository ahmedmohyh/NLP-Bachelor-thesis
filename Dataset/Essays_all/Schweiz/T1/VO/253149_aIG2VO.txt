Computerised voting, a good or a bad thing?
Basically there are two different oppinions in the text and the presentation. In the presentation about the computerised voting there is said that it would make a lot of problems. The woman first talks about the problem for people that aren't used to work with computers. Also would people that can't afford a computer have no chance to vote. Furthermore is mentioned that people with the fear of new technology wouldn't vote anymore. To the first point that people that aren't  familiar with working on computers in the text it is said it is much more easier to vote on the screen than on the paper. Therefore older people should be able to vote with the computer programm. Also a difference can be seen when they talk about the security and possibility of mistakes in counting the votes. In the text it is said that human error can be eliminated with the computer system because this is done automatically. But in the presentation it is said that the programms that are made from humans can also have an error and that would result in a bigger problem than with human errors. Besides that should the computer program be improved continously like other systems in online banking. Because the computerised voting is only an issue once a year it is more difficult to improve it that it is safe. The question is also if we can really trust the computer system with highly confidential or sensitive information. In conclusion we have to decide if we can trust the computer program and help the people that don't like to vote on the computer or if we want to keep the old system and accept eventual human errors.
