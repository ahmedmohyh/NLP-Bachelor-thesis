Critics say that the voting system in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. Mistakes are inevitable with this counting system. You can also accidentally vote wrong because there are many names on the list. Those critics would like to replace the old system with a new computerized one. The computer could search or write the name of the person you want to vote for. 
Others say it may seem easier this way but computerized voting is not that trustworthy. The first computers and programs didn't work flawlessly, they had to be improved over and over again. Humans make mistakes, also in programing, and if there's an error in the program the results will be far worse as when a person miscounts one ballot. It's not just one mistake, it's a thousand mistakes. Also there are people that don't have or can't afford a computer.

Those critics say that because of the errors which have been made they want a computerized system. But the others say that in a computerized voting will be more errors. So, they do not have the same opinion on which system has or will have more ore worse mistakes. Even though the computerized version may be helpful for people with poor eyesight the traditional system is better because if the people can not vote there is no counting necessary.
