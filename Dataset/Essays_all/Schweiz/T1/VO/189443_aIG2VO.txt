Many people are against a computerized voting in the U.S.A. They say that computerized voting isn't better than the traditional voting. The computerized voting would have many technological mistakes and would miss a few ballots, because the system is progammed by the humans but humans can also make counting mistakes in the traditional voting. When people count the votes, they also can do mistakes and then they have to recount it and the computerized system can remove the possibility of humans error.
People who don't use oder know a computer would also have problems by voting their favorite candidate. But with the trational voting system people can also vote for the wrong candidate, when they have a poor eyesight. The computerzied voting ist faster than the traditional counting, because all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.
