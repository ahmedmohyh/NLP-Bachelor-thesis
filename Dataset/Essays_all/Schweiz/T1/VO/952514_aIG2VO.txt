Voting
Every person over 18 years has to vote. We are used to voting by hand and letting the votes be counted by humans. But is that the best idea?

A lot of people started discussing about the human voting systems and the said to be better computer voting system. They think that the computerized system is more trustworthy and would make fewer mistakes with counting. In some points they are right. Computers make fewer mistakes than people and the result is more accurat than by hand. In traditional voting, people have to select their vote out of a long list with names and often select the wrong one, especially elderly people. Another problem is the relying on people to count the votes. It is human to make counting mistakes but it does also make the result damaged.

There are also people on the other side, who say that computers are not the ultimate solution. Computers are programmed by humans and could make the same mistakes but more severe. Furthermore are a lot of people not used to computers and their use. They can see the names on the list better but they do not trust these eletronical devices. The last point is the rar use of these voting systems. Other than banking or communication programmes are voting programmes used once every two or three years. The technical people behind the whole ting don even have time to test it and to exlude major mistakes.
