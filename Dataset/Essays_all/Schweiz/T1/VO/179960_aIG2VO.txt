The opinion of the woman holding the speech was quite clear. Computers can'tpossibly make a better work than humans do, mainly because they've got programmed by humans. This means, that all the mistakes someone could do countig the votes, will most probably happen in another way while a human is programming the computers.The text however, says that mistakes are already made while someone's searching the candidates name on the list. A program would would provide a bigger screen, where the names are big enough thart everybody can read them properly. The woman encounters that for people who aren't used to technology it would getmore complicated and not easier sincethey won't understand how it works and following to that, mistakes will happen. In addition she brought the point, that a program like the this voting system would need an improvement after a few trials. But in the USA they vote only all two years, which makes improvement going on way to slowley. An error in on the computer couldhave major issuse and the programm wouldn't aloud a recount. She thinks that errors amde by humans will mostly only have a smalleffect on the final result while a computerprogramm can't be trusted. The text responds to that, that computers are alreads doing a lot of secure working nowadays. They work for banks and do transactions all the time. From this point of view, we are already trusting computer programms with a big part of our money, which should allowus to trus them enough to use them in other parts of our life.
