Critics of this typ of voting say that computers can do the things like counting the votes easier and faster then humans. But there are also a lot of problems with voting on the computer. Not all persons are good on computers. There are a lot of , who have problems with computer and technoligy. This persons can`t vote when there is only the computersized voting, they will make a wrong vote. An other problem is that humans make mistakes and the voting programms are constructed by humans. So if someone make a mistake during installing the programm the whole programm make mistake and a lot of votes are wrong what could be a extremly problem for an election. Critics say that computersized voting isn`t better than traditional voting. But in community are also people who are critics for the traditional way of voting. The say that in the traditional way to vote the names of the voting papers are written so small that persons withe eye problems can`t read exactly the names and vote for a wrong person.

This person mean that with screens aren`t less mistakes during the votes.
