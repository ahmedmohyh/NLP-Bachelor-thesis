First of all they talk about people who aren't used to computers or have never touched one. They can't afford or just dont't want to buy a computer. So it's likely that they could't handle the computerized voting system and that way would't vote vor the wrong person. The text says that people with poor eyesight have a hard time finding the right name on the long list and also that normal people accidentaly vote wrong. So both text and speech mention a group of citicens who aren't able to use one of the voting systems. Another problem that is talked about and on which bothe have different opinions is the fact that errors ocurr. Human and coputer both can make mistakes. On the one hand a human easily miscounts the thousands of ballots and on the other hand a coputer ist programmed by a person who could programm it wrong. But if there is a problem with the computer you don't have a physical backup.
