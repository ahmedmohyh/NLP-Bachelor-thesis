The speach I heard was about the voting system in the usa. Today it is still voten by hand, not by computer. In the speech they doubt that voting with computers is gettintg easier, because of people who are not used to computers. The text above has the exact opposite opinion. It is written that computers are easyier to handle than voting by hand, because when you vote by hand, then you could easily choose the wrong name out of the many written of the sheet. A computer voting system with touchscreen would  be easier. In the text is also written that the possibility of human error, for example in counting, is removed with the computer system. But the speach says thet there could be an error in the programm, which is made by human and the computer system does not work flawlessly all the time.
