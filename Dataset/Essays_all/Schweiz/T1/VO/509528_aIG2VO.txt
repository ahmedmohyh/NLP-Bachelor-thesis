What is better? The computerized voting system or the traditional when all votes are being counted by humans? The young generation would say, that it's a massive improvement voting with the computer (and as it is in the text). But what is with the people who are not used to comuters? And these who can't afford a computer? They would have many difficulties to join the election. In all of the parts where the humans are working there are mistakes. Humans are making mistakes. When they have to count millions of votes there could be easily a mistake. But what happens if there is a mistake in the computer system? The women in the presentation said, that it is possible that a human installed the computerized voting system wrong and there would be thousand of misscounted votes. Not as in the text, the women is very critical and doesn't think, that the computers would solve all the problems.
