In the USA there are problems bacause of the voting sytsem. In the presentation they said that computer voting in the Unitet States would be big fault. Sometimes yout put the wrong pick and it`s difficult to realize that because it`s small written and you can`t controll it at all. At contrast, in the text, they tell us that human vote for the wrong candidate cause of the large list of names. At the whole they want to say us, that the United States have a porblem at the voting system. They don`t know if they should change the actual system to  "far more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems", as the text say us strictly. 
The other big problem is the counting of the whole votes. Traditionally they have to count one by one. It`s not just that the counter can make a lot of mistakes, it`s that the counter has to spend a lot of time on the marks of the votes. Twice a year. So the speecher from the presentation want to computerize thw whole system and make it more easily and efficient. On the other side, poeple say, that it`s to risky picking the marks by the internet, cause of the many defaults. For me it should be traditonally done, cause of the many hackers and other problems in the net.
