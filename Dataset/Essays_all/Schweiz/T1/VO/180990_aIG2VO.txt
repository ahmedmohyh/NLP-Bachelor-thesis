Some people suggest to change the traditional voting system. The question remains whether or not a computerized system would be a better way of counting votes.
Firstly, a very stong argument for changing the system is that miscounts often occur in votings, these kind of mistakes are inevitable. Therefore it is suggested that computerized votings take place. Furthermore the vote counting of computers are done a lot quicker and more automatically. 
An argument against this system would be that there are many people who do not use computers on a regular basis, thus these people would be discouraged of voting due to their fear of computers.
To sum up, we as governements and individuals use other complex computer technologies like bank transactions and communication devices on a daily but also heavily basis. Using computerized systems to count votes would not be very unusual.
