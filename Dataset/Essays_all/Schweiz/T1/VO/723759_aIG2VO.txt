Computerised voting
Computervoting is a very good thing for people who new and use the Computer. But they`re also people who doesn`t use the Computer. They have a fear of Technology. It`s clear that computers do the better job. But computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. If there is a human error in the programm there could be 10000 of votes missunderstood. And this is a real Problem 
But in the other side the traditionally voting have some errors too. There is a large sheet of paper with a lot of names with small markes beside. People with poor eyesight can accidentilly mark the wrong person. This isn`t a problem with computers beacause they have a touch screen. Traditionally voting has also human error. People have to count the votes one by one. If there`s an error they must do a long and expensiv recount.
Finally both meanings are right. We can vote how to vote.
