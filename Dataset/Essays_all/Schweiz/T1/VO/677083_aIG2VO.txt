It is said that voting systems in the United States are inefficient and not absolutely safe in counting votes. More and more want a new computerized voting system because of these critics.
The traditional old system often makes accidentaly mistakes. So do the voters when they mark the wrong name. It takes a long time for counting all the votes. Maybe it would be good to make a step to the future or better said in the current world we live in full of technology. 
Computerized voting systems would be a great improvement for people who have computer knowledges and really like to use them. For the ones who have a "fear of technology" it would become a problem that they are able to handle it. The problematic is, that maybe people (more the old generation) who are not into computer, start to stop voting.
There are good arguments for computerized voting systems like we trust technology in so many ways, as well in banking. Computers have been improved everytime and so will they develop in the future. The bad thing if there would happen only one mistake at the wrong time thousands of votes will be deleted and the voting has to be repeated. Or the system gets hacked and the results would be wrong.
In general we can trust computers and go on to this step with confidence.
