If we compare the traditional voting with the voting on computers we see, that both of them have avantages and disavantages. 

Voting on the computer is easy for people who are used to computers. But people who don't know much about the modern technology they are going to have problems with the modern voting system. They will maby vote for the wrong person because they don't know how to use the programm right. It isn't sure if computer votings do a better job than current votings because humans wrote the computer programms and if they made a mistakes by writing them many votes are countless. That would be a disaster. A recount is nearly impossible. But they said that we can trust modern voting.

On the opposite critics say that current voting is inefficient and that many people choose the wrong candidat because there are so many names on one sheet of paper. It is very hard to count votes without a computer and therefore many mistakes happened. A recount is very expensive and hard but easyer than to make a new computer programm.
