The textes say that not all people agree with the system of voting in the United States. Some of them want to have the system where humans count the votes. They have more trust in humans than in computers. They all know that humans are going to make mistakes but they think that humans are going to make less faults than a computer. If a computer makes mistakes they are bigger then those mistakes did by a human, that's what they say. The other people want computers to count the votes. They say that nearly everyone uses computers day by day. That's why they think that computers can't be that bad. They also know that a computer can make mistakes. But they also say that computers are invented by humans. So if humans make mistakes when inventing a comupter, why shouldn't they make mistakes while counting votes?
