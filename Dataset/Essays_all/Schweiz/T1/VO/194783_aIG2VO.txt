In the lecture, the main argument agianst the computerized voting system is that those programms are not reliable. First using a computer is not easy for everyone, for example there are people who are not used to computers, because they simply can not afford one. Those people would not vote, because they are scared by the technology. The second point is about the relyability of the programm, the humans programming the machines can make failers too, and those are expected to be way heavier than a simple miscount, can be, and, in case of an emergency, we can not rely on physical votes, because they are simply not existing, so no physical recount, as expensive as it maybe, is not possible. The last aspect about people trusting computers in their daily life is that those programms had problems in the beginning too, and that they have been extremely improved over the last years, because they are used in daily life, a voting programm will only be used all two years and will be much more difficult to improve. 
Manual counting and voting seems to be more vulnerable, but the failors that will happen are less dangerous.
