It can make problems witch can make a result in a different meaning. In the other hand, they will be peoples witch doesn`t understand how the new voting system works, so he/she will not able to be make true votes. A other proplem is, that there can be erors. Erors are made, when the computer doesn`t work right. These are made by the peoples by them self, because the makers of the computers are the peoples too.
