Votings

To vote right shows some problems in any way you do it. A big question is the use of the computerized voting or the traditonal voting. 
The problems of traditional voting can be voting for the wrong candidate because of bad eyesight and that it takes to long to check all ballots.
But the problems of computerized votings are much riskier if there's an error in the programm of those computers. Also aren't all people accustomed to technology or can't even afford any computers eventough the majority uses it daily. A pro to the computerized voting is that it goes much faster and for those who have bad eyesight can zoom the names of their candidate with the easy-to-use touch-screen.
