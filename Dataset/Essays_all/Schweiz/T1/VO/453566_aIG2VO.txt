The opinion I heard was pretty much against the computer voting method. In contrast to that, the text was against the traditional, human voting method.

The woman said, that the computer method would be much easier for people who are used to computers. But for people who can`t afford a computer the system would be very complicated and those people are more likely to make voting mistakes than with the traditional method. She agrees with the text that human counting votes do a lot of mistakes, but in her opinion computers are doing less, but heavier mistakes. The votes aren`t physical recountable if they have been deleted by the computer by mistake. Computers have to be programmed by humans, who, as we know, make mistakes. So if the computer has been programmed wrong, the whole voting comes out wrong. In fact that she agrees, that things like banking transactions are already reliable, effective and most important done by a computer, she denies the theorie that it would also work with the counting of the votes. She arguments with the ineffective start of banking transactions and that it had to be worked on till it worked reliable.
