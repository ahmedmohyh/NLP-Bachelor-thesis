Thelektue was about online voting in the United states .the woman who talked was talkin wals clearly against it and her first arument was about thethought that people who are not used to use a computer would have many difficultis with taking part of the elektion if id woul change to be . She even said thatpeople would be discouraged to vote at all evegough ther still is the possibilety to learn it. But she also talked about the consern of pro online votingpeople abot the misscounts all the peope who are voting would make but her argument againstthis wwas thata machine is also capable of having errors and those wouldn't be smallones like two or three miscounts, it would be possible to lose thousends of vots in a split second. The reason she thinks that there isa high possibilety for the online voting system to fail was that unlike the online banking this sytem wouldent be tested as mouch becose programers where only able to correct errors after someone uses it int notices that ther is an error but becose of the voting sytem only beeing used every two years nationwide and twice a year state-/townwise she claims that the errors wouldn't be able to be corrected as fasas needed
