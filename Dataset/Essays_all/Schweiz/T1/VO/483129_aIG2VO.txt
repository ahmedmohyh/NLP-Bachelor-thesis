Voiting:
The critics say that the voiting systems in the United States aren't safe and it can have a lot of mistakes.

The first problem is that it has a lot of people that vote for the wrong canidate. For Exemple people with apoor eyessight can easily mark the wrong name.
Because there isn't a big space between the candidates names. 

But if you do this voiting on the computer it has a lot of people that can not use the computers and have a lot of problems with the touch-screen-technology. To cast a vote, the voter needs only to touch the wrong name for a second and then he have wote for the wrong canidate. 

Another problem is the counting of votes. The text describes the problem with the old voiting system and that the people has to count the voices and says also that the computer remove the possibility of human error. The presentation says that a lot of people has to check the whole computersystem always. Because if it isn't good programmed it can do a lot of mistakes and more that a person can do when he count the voices.


In the first two arguments thetext and the presenation have the same opinion. But in the lat argument the have an other opinin. But booth of them can not say with one the better is.
