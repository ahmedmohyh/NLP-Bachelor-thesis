Voting

In the U.S.A. many people want to computerize the traditional voting system. 
The text states that there are two reasons why the tradtitional system needs to be completely computerized. Firstly, because the ballots are easier to read and the voters will not mark the wrong candidate anymore. Secondly, the computers count faster and don't make any mistakes in comparison to a human who has to count every single ballot one by one. Conversely, the podcast disagrees with these two statements because not every person is used to work on a computer and therefore, might make a mistake while voting, or not vote at all anymore because of their fear of technology. In addition the people who made the podcast stated that computers are programmed by humans and therefore, can also contain a human error in the programming. Nevertheless, there is no recount possible when voting on a computer and thousands of votings will be lost, falsly counted or unaccounted for. Furthermore the text states that: "computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions" whereas in the podcast they make clear that the technology used, for example for banking transactions have had glitches at the beginning and were improved daily, but with computerizing the voting system that won't be this easy because there is only every second year an election what means that this system would be harder to improve.
