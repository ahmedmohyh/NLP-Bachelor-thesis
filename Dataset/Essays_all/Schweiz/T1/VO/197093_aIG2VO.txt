Many people say to electric voting it's inefficient, unsure, many errors and unuseful. The text and the meaning are agree in many points. The text want to have new machines and brings good arguments.The text told us many people is heavily to count the votes and the screen is to small and has to many information on it. The system has an other problem, they count the votes one by one and human makes always mistakes. In the story which I read, told me the programm is not very good. The system will used only one in 2 years so they don't enough prove the electric-programm. An other big problem is by the programm, if it has one problem, 1000 of votes are wrong and could'nt used.  In one point the meanings are diffeferent. The text means the human error are higher than by computer errors. The story means both make the same mistakes. 
I'm agree with both meanings about the voting-system in America, it's bad. Both meanings are agree about the future by the voting system: The have to look a new system. The voting should be more trust, sure and and efficient.
