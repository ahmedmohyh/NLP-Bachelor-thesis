The text says as a main statement, that votings in the United States of America are too inacurate and that there is an easy possibility to improve it, by replacing the counting system of human counting every ballot by hand, using computer technology to count the ballots. According to the text, there's more than one advantage, wich it would bring  with it. The people could vote on computers, what would especially be good for the ones, who have poor eyesight. There would also be less mistakes because computers are a lot more precise than humen, who have to make a long and expensive recount if a mistake was detected. And for the possible argument, that it'd be too risky, the text says, that we also use this highly precise technology almost everywhere in our all-day-life, just as in bank transactions or others. 

The presentation denys every argument brought up in the text. To the first argument of the text, the fact that it'd be easier to vote by computer for many people, is denied by saying, that it'd be easier for the people, who use computers in their all-day-life, but for everyone else it'd be a lot more difficult than before. The presentation also says that the counting wouldn't be more precise because computers are programmed by human, who make ,as also the text admitts, mistakes. The damage would also be a lot bigger, if the computer made a fault than if some people miss some ballots. The final argument of the presentation is, that a computer counting system is not to be compared with bank transactions, because they are used daily and were also not so precise when they were set up.
