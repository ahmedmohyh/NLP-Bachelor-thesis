The first difference I've found is, that the lady of the presentation says that the computers got programmed from humans. As we all know humans do make errors, so what's the difference? But in the text I've read, there it says, that the computer would be much more accurate. The lady mentioned as well, that there is a problem with the people who don't know how to use a computer - or those who can't afford one. All of these things haven't got mentioned in the text above. 
Every change needs time to get used to, said the teacher who held the presentation. The problem is, that there's just one vote each year... So how should the society get used to it, when there's no time to "practise". She compare's the online voting with the bank-system. These days the banks are only using computers for work, but it took a long time until it worked without problems. Another point, that the lady surely would see different as the author of the text above, is the quote: "In traditional voting, one major source of inaccuracy is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate." What should be the difference when you have to vote on a computer or on a sheet of paper? The ones who don't see well, won't see the names on the screen I'd say.
I think the presentator thinks it would be a great idea to introduce people in to online voting because it's much cheaper and the errors are plus-minus equal. But as I said - somebody needs to introduce the people... And who want's to do that? From who this instructor got paid? She also thinks you can't forget about the people who don't want a computer or are to old to learn it. Maybe the two authors would find an compromiss if they discussed once together...
