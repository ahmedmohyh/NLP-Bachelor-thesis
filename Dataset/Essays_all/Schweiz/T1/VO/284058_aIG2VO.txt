The presentation was quite positive towards technology. They admit that the voting systems used in the United States are inefficient but they also show us that there is people who still question wether modern voting systems are easier to use and more reliable than the traditional ones. 
First, it is stated that the major reason of inaccuracy is that people vote for the wrong candidate, this is often due to poor eyesight. Technology is helpful in this case because the small names on the list can be magnified. Then, they tell us another reason why the old system fails, they rely on people to count thousands of votes, so human error is not unusual. If someone does an error, the votes have to be re-counted which may require a lot of time. Computers do this task in no time and they are way more accurate.
They say that there is people who question technology but this is quite controversial since the individuals and even the government rely on technology all the time when it comes to banking transactions or communication of highly sensitive information.
