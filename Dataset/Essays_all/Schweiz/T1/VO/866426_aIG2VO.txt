The woman who was talking was clearly against the using of computers for voting. Her arguments were that not everybody could buy a computer or know how it works, that a programm can have errors bigger than if a counter makes some mistakes but they are heavier than the ones of a counter, that were computers are used they are used on a daily basis and didn' work at the beginning and that the votings are only every two years so they are not able to solve every problem quickly because they only see every problem after some votings. So as a comparison these two texts are not of the same opinion. The text was for computer votins and only shows the good sides but the speech was against and shows only the problem that will happen if we change to electronic elections. So the text says that the counting has more mistakes and the speech that the couned mistakes are very little but the computer ones are way more crititical. They are always just saying that the other solution is worse but there are no proves because the computer election has not been tried till now.
