Firstly, computerized voting may be a good idea for the youth, but people who are not using computers in their life, like old people, could have problems with the computerized voting systems. They don't know how to use things like a touchscreen.
Secondly, people make mistakes when they count votes in the traditional way, computers don't, we think. But once a human has programmed the computer and is updating it from time to time. So its possible, that the programmer made a mistake at the beginning, and the computer could do bad work.
Finally, there is a risk that the voting computers could get manipulated by hackers or other enemies, like it happens with banking transactions. That's easier than cheat on a traditional voting system. If someone would cheat a computerized election, he could get very mighty and dangerous.
In conclusion, there are good arguments on both sides. Maybe we just should wait 'till the computer technology is safer and the old people are dead.
