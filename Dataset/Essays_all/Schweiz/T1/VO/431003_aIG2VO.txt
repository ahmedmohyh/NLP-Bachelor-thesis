The text is written about facts, which damages the project on the major way, the paper. The talking person speaks about the problems in voting systems on the computer. But both of them have quiet the same arguments for the other mathode. That's interesting.
So first point is the counting of votes. If we use the traditional way of voting, it's hard to count all the votes by hand without any technology help. Every Person makes mistakes in counting and that's absolutely normal. But if we would use computers, there are also some risks which can influence the counting resuats. For example a mistake in the programm. The programms are written by humens, also there could be some mistakes. So now we see, counting the votes without mistakes is in every way mostly impossible.
The second point they're descussing, is how the old people can vote. Again, first the traditional way. For old people, f.e. with poor eyesight, it's really hard for them to vote for the right name because they can't read it. So the text says that the computers habe an easy-to-use touch-screen which is more easily for the old men. But the talking person said also a really good point. Some people know, how to use a computer. But some of them can't even afford it or don't want to. And for them it's even harder to vote on a programm, which they don't understand. We can say that also in this case it's really difficult to find a way which is for all people an easy and quick way to vote.
