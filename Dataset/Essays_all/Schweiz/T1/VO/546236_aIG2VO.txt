Both texts talk about voting and if it should be done by hand or by computers. One states that it's more efficient let the computers count the votes and the other opposes to that.
The first text states that it would be much easier and efficient to replace the old counting-by-hand system and replace it by computurized voting systems.
Some say that the traditional voting systems are inefficient and inaccurate. When thousands of votes are counted by hand, the non-computurized way, it's easy to make mistakes. If an error was detected they have to count them all over again, which takes a lot of time and money. Another issue of voting by hand is that many accidentally tick the wrong name and thus vote for the wrong candidate. Therefore some critics say that the computers would improve in minimizing these mistakes. One would silmpy have to touch the candidate's name on the screen. If some people can't read what's on the screen it can be magnified. They think this is a more efficient and trustworthy way of voting. 
However the other text disagrees with that. It states that computers won't diminish the mistakes being made and lead to some other problems. One being that not all people know how to use computers but of course know how to tick a little boy next to a candidate's name on a piece of paper. It's good for those who know how to work computers but not for those who don't or can't afford one.
The speaker reading the text also says that computers can easily cast the wrong vote, maybe even worse than humans can. She says that humans do make mistakes and miscount some votes but only in a small amount. I computers miscount votes it wouldn't be just a couple, but a couple thousand. If some of these votes are even lost, there'd be no physical evidence of them. Therefore she and many other people are against this computurized voting system and would rather stick to the tarditional one.
