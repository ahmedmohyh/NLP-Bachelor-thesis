The voting technology is too risky because if the voting technology has an error, the vote will has to be repeated because an arror in the programmation affects on the whole voting and is not acceptable for result. With the old system, mistakes are always made. But this errors don't affect the voting very much. Even less than an error with the voting technology.
It would be easier to vote with the computer-voting-system. Most people have a computer at home or in their office or workplace. To send all these ballots and count them is a big work to do. However, there are many people without a computer at home or don't know how to use a computer correctly. So there could be created mistakes. The acces to the post has everybody. Everybody is able to vote with ballots. If there is somebody, who isn't able to vote, the result would't represent the opinion of the habitants and this is not good. 
The text above is far more critical to the current system. The negative faces of the complex computer technology voting-system aren't realy analysed. 
The person who had the presentation tends to like more the old system.
