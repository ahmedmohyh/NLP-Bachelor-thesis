First of all the speaker wanted to make us clear that the computerized voting wouldn't really make it better, because a lot of people may can't afford a computer or they are just not able to use one. In the text there is the speech of voting machines which work pretty well nowadays and that is what they are critisizing in the listening and what wouln't work for them.
As a second point they say that programms made by human could also contain huge mistakes which probably make the programm either completely unusable or it maybe won't count every bellet and the voting wouldn't be accurate. On the other hand there are a lot of people who have to count all these bellets piece for piece and the chance that they will make a mistake is very big. And if the bellets have to be recounted because an error is detected, it would be a long and expensive process.
As a last point they still don't like the idea of computerized voting because of the programms. In the banking and communication sector they work pretty well, but they were not as reliable as today when we started using them. It is a long, expensive and hard way to the fully reliable programms which can count the bellets without any mistake. But when we look at it with the other point of view we can say that without giving it a thought the other programms wouldn't work too, so someone had to make kind of a start. And all these programms could be tested in a long time period until they are really used in a serious voting.
