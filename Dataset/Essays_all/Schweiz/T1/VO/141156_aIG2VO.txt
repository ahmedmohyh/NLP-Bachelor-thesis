It has been a while since people are talking about the possibility of computerized voting machines. With the traditional system there are some problems. One aspect is that we have to rely on the people who are counting the ballots. If they make a fault the result will be wrong or they have to start again with counting. Computers don`t make such mistakes
On the other hand it`s much easier to vote with a computer and probably less people would accidentally vote for the wrong person. in the traditional system the voters have to find the names of the candidate on a large sheet of paper. It`s really hard to find a specific name and of course one can make the cross at the wrong line. Therefore voting with computers would be much easier because of an easy-to-use touch screen.
But as always there are also people who don`t like new ideas. In this case they think that even computers aren`t perfect because they have been programmed by humans. In addition not everyone is used to computers or can afford to have one. If they can`t afford one they wouldn`be able to vote anymore which would be a big problem. Another aspect is that votings can get lost because of technical errors. What would happen if all the votings get lost? Would we simply vote again or what else would we do? 
In addition votings don`t happen as much as making banking transactions or communicating highly senitive information. Every new way of doing something needs practice but we can`t practice voting do we? When we vote it`s a definitive decision and we can`t change it anymore but maybe this decision will change a lot for our future life.
