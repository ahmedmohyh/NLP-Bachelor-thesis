The lady giving the lecture made quite a few interesting points about the nature of computerized voting. First of all she stated that computerized voting might be easy to understand and work with for people who are used to using computers but can be a real challenge or even a big hindrance fo people who are not as familiar with the digital world. For example people who can`t afford a computer could end up voting for the wrong person because they`re not used to this system. Furthermore she said that computers aren`t as perfect as we think they are when it comes to counting votes because after all they`re programmed by humans and a mistake in the program would cause greater harm than just an official who misses a few votes here and there. She also mentioned, the impossibiity to recount the votes with a computerized voting system in case something goes wrong. The text made its final point by saying that we`ve trusted computers with our banking and transactions for years, so it would make sense to trust these machines when it comes to counting our votes. She counters this argument by pointing out that we use the internet and computers for our banking every single day of our lives and so they profit from our long term experiance with them. They weren`t perfect when they were first introduced. We only vote once every four years so we can never achieve the sane level of experince.
