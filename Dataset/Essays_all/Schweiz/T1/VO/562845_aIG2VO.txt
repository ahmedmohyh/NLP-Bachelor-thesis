In the article and in the record we just heard it says that traditional voting is inefficent and often leads to an inaccuraty couting of votes. Both, the speaker and the author of the article agree, that traditional voting can be inaccurate, but only the article says that computer voting would be better . The speaker holds against this argument and says, that computer voting is only an option if you're used to work on the computer and especially the older generation isn's used to work  with technology every day. In the article it also says, that humans make mistakes like accidentally voting for the wrong candidate or the officials miscount. But if you think about it, who says that computer never make any mistakes? Nobody. Computers are human-programmed objects and it's obvious that mistakes can happen there too. And also would mistakes in the computer system cause problems that are not so easy to solve. While the officials can "only" miscount, the whole computer system can break down or it could be hacked. And it's not possible to compare computer voting with baking because this is something that got proved very often and it's used much more that computer voting would we. While you only have 1 or 2 elections a year, banking is used every day and all over the world.
