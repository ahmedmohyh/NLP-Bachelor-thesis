According to the audio, computer voting has a lot of negative points. One of the main argument is that a lot of people don't know how to use a computer or can't afford one. This people would be handicaped in the voting because they don't have the possibilty to vote There are people who have a fear of tegnology and for them it would be really hard to vote. Another point is how easy it is to click on the wrong candidate. The text describes the problems about the current voting system. The people get long lists with all the candidates and it's very easy to pick out a wrong one. So people vote accidentely for the wrong candidate. They say that it's almost impossible to count all the votes going trough every ballot and record the votes without doing some mistakes. If someone would find one, it would be really expensive to correct this errors. But computer errors are usally a lot bigger. People have to program the computers and they can do mistakes too. In this cases a lot of peoples votes are involved and in the end it's a bigger problem. Critics of current voting systems argue that in our modern technology we use computer technology every day for example banking transactions. How do we know that a computer system doesn't work for voting if we don't try it. On the other hand the critics of the computerized voting say that bank systems are secure and good because we use them daily. They are improved and improved over a long time. Voting is just every two years. To develop such a programm you would need time and a lot of time for improvements. It would be very risky to just start voting with complicated voting technology nationwide.
