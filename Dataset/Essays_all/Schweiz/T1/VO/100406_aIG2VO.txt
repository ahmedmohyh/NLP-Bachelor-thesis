Voting is the fundament of democracy, although it is really difficult process, lots of countries introduced this kind of system. But a big problem is the counting. The critics of the traditional voting with paper ballots would replace these old system with a computerized version to eleminate counting mistakes and recounts. One major problem of these paper ballots are, that the list of the candidates are huge, through this it is first really hard to find the right name and second the marking of the right candidate is sometimes impossible. With the electronic version, you just have to click on the name and if it is needes you could zoom to see the capitals better.
Further the people, who have to count the voices, must go through every single ballot and when they make an mistake, which is really likely, recounts have to take place. This costs time, money and energy. In contrary the new technology should abolish these human errors, because they count automatically and really quickly. 
So why we didn't introduce these new system right now? It seems like it hasn't got any disadvantiges. 
The reality is different; first the people have to know how to use computers. The handling is just easy for the humans, who use these new technologies on daily bases, but the US is big and not everyone is a banker or a journalist, also people work as farmers and mechanics. For them it would be sometimes just impossible to vote, because they didn't know what to click or do.
In theory the human problems should be minimized by the computers, but the computers are made by humans, so mistakes are really likely. But if one voice on the paper ballot is misscounted, the consequences are much less big, than the ones, who makes a computer. Thousand of voices could be lost, because there aren't written on paper.
So the idea of compuerizing the counting system is a good one and good to try.
