The text and the presentatiom are both about voting systems. The text says that the current voting system has to be computerized due to inefficiency and inaccurate count of votes. The computerized voting machines would help people with poor eyesight not to mark the wrong name due to its touchscreen  that can magnify the name for easier viewing. Another problem the computerized machines would solve ist that the computer already does the work to count the votes and that it's not heavily relied on people doing the work anymore. Because of that less errors while counting will happen. 

The presentation on the other side thinks that updating the current voting system won't be a good idea. Many people, especially old people, don't know how a computer works. Also a lot of people can't even afford one. It's also possible that the computer programe can be deffective since it's programmed by humans and human mistakes can happen. And if an error happens while counting the votes can't br recounted again. Another point is that systems don't always work flawlessly. They have to be improved. But that will be difficult because votings in America only happen every 2 years.
