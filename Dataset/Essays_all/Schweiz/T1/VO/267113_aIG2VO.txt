Voting

It's true that there are many problems with current voting, as the text tells us, but will coputerized votings do it any better?
They don't think so. Because a computer is made by humans is in fact also made with human faults. Sure the humans who count the ballots, could count something wrong, but it would be much more difficult to recount the votings if the computer system doesn't work right. 
It might be true that there are people with poor eyesight, who choose the wrong candidat, but can we fully trust the "easy-to-use touch-screen"? 

In the text we can see that many people think, that the current voting is ineffective, but if you look at the fact, that not everybody can afford a computer to vote, then the computerized voting system isn't effective as well. And there is just one voting in two years, so why should we giving it a tought like the text tells us?
