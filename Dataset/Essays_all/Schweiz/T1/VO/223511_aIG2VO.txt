In the lecture, this woman, who as far as we know is of no importance whatsoever and is just somebody rambling and complaining about things, talks about how computerised voting may not be better than traditional voting. 
She states that it would only be an improvement for people who are familiar with how computers work, this point is however overruled by the critics since they say that all you would have to do is touch the name of the person you want to vote for with your finger, I mean, come on, you do not have to know anything about computers to be able to do that, that's a fact, not my opinion. 
Another point she mentioned was that if voting was computerised people who do not trust technology may be discouraged to vote. 
Furthermore, she asked if we can be sure that computerised voting can be trusted since computer programs can have human error too like traditional voting and that the consequences of those errors are far more dire than those of the traditional voting system. 
Her last point was that even though we trust computerised systems for things like banking, that those systems were perfected over time and were not anything like how we know them nowadays when they first came out and that this only worked because since it was used constantly it was constantly perfected whereas voting only takes place in gaps of years. 
The critics' text contradicts these points stating that we didn't give it a thought when we trusted banking with computers the first time either so there is absolutely no reason to doubt them now.
As for the point that states that people who do not trust technology would be discouraged to vote, for one those are mostly the older generations which includes most of those who voted wrong due to bad eyesight and this would only mean that this error margin would be removed and secondly, there are people who are also discouraged to vote because they do not trust the traditional voting system because people will always count wrong, one way or the other there will always be something that discourages people of voting.
Regarding the statement about human error in programs, this is also contradicted in the text which states that computerised systems would eliminate human error, she however stated that since these things dont usually work the first time around that it would take too many years to perfect it and thus making it uneffective. Computer programs however are always tested for long periods of time before they are released especially programs of this importance.
