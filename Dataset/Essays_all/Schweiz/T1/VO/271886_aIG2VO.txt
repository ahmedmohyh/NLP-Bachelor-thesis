"Voting"

Now that the elections in the USA take place again many critics say that current voting systems used in the USA are inefficient and from another century. But does that mean we have to change anything?

Voting in the traditional way can lead to a lot of mistakes because of this huge list of names, the ballot, on which one has to make a tiny cross next to the name one wants to elect. People with poor eyesight have a lot of trouble with this and even for someone with good eyesight it can be a problem to mark the right person. But are computers the solution? A lot of people these days have trouble with PCs because they either don't trust them, don't have money to buy one or because they are simply not used to them. This aswell can lead to a lot of mistakes which can lead to the wrong person being elected.

Another major issue with the old system is that the votes are counted by humans. It is easy to make a mistake when you have to count thousands of votes a day. On the other hand PCs that have counting programs or tools on them would make everything easier right? Well programs are usually programmed by humans. Humans can also make mistakes while programming such a program which can lead to miscounts and totally wrong election outcomes.

A third argument to change the current voting system is, why shouldn't we trust in PCs for elections? We trust them everyday in other important parts of our lives aswell. For example in banking or to transmit sensitive information. So why don't we trust them for elections? It is said that this is because these programs we use, for example in banking, weren't perfect in the beginning already there often were mistakes which cost a lot of people a lot of money. They have been improved everyday for the last decade. Elections are only every two years. There can't be any mistakes when we such a  program. it would be disasterous. There would be no time for improvements it would have to be perfect from the start.
