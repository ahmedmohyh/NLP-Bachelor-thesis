the computerized voting system may seem easy for people who are used to technology. But there are also people who don`t know how to use a computer and people who can`t afford it. This could lead to a incomplete voting list or it would be very hard to complete it. 
Also, this voting system would be programmed by humans and there could be errors in it too. Worse problems than in a traditional system. If the computer breaks all the data would be lost.
other technology which is used daily and heavily- for example bank transactions- had a long time to come to point where they are nearly perfect and errors don`t happen on a daily basis. But te voting takes place only once in two years so it won`t have so many possibilities to prove itself and many errors won`t be detected.
so in conclusion the essay says that the computerized voting system isn`t 100% perfect and that a mistake would be way worse than in the traditional system where the information ecxists physically.
