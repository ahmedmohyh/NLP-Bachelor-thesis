There is about a voting system in the United States. I was introducing by a new system. Now you have to vote on the computer and before ages it was traditionally by handwriting. So the technic changed the whole voting system. This change gets a lot of attention of course and in addition a few critic. 

Not everyone is able to work on a computer and know how it works. So old people have a big hindrance to vote with the new system. In the text they are saying just that the arguments for the new systems are good and there is not a argument against. But in the referent they are discussing a few points against the new voting system.

Logically, the arguments for the new system are more valueable. The critic for the old system was that the list of the names was very small and people with a poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. With the new system problems like this do not exist.
Besides for the people which counted the votes have to look up to every piece of paper and now the computer program make that much easier.

In conclusion I think the new system is better than the old system. I think the critic against the new system is just because humans did not like new things and changes. The only disadvantage of the new voting system is that there are people who do not know how to work on a computer.
