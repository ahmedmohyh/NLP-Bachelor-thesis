Nowadays the society is proud of the demokratic system. And because everyone is a part of this system we are nationally voting once ore twice a year. So it is not surpising that the votingsystem is questionned. Traditionally we vote on paper and there are humans who are counting the votes but with all the new technologie would maybe be easier to vote on computers. So what do the critics of the traditional way of voting say?
The critics are investigating for a computerisized voting system because a computer would`nd misscount votes. They also argue that it would be easier to handle a computer than to search for the candidates name on a long list. That would  avoid that we vote for the wrong candidate. So that the computer woud also help elderly persons who have poor eyeslight. 
But there are also persons who are defending the traditional way of voting, so what do they say?
The defenders say that people who are not used to use computers will have a hard time by voting and that there are even some who can not afford to buy a computer. The defenders are also talking back to the argument that there are some serious misscounts in the traditional way of voting.  They say that if there was a mistake in the computer programme witch is done by humans there would be more serious problems because maybe it is not counting a whole thousands of votes. 
So would it really be a good idea to vote on computers? And to screw the traditional way we used for decades?
