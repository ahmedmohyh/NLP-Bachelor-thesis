The text says, that replacing the current voting system with a computerized voting system would have a lot of benefits, like marking the wrong name by mistake because of a poor eyesight, but in the listening they had a lot of worries. They said computerized voting would be only good for people who are used to work with computers, because if someone has no idea of how to handle a computer, they will have a lot of trouble with voting. And in the time of now, there are many persons who are afraid of the technology, and it wouldn't be fair if they couldn't vote because of a computer. Another problem that is wrote in the text is that in the old voting system, people have to count the votes. This can lead to a lot of mistakes because the persons have to deal with thousands of ballots and it's clear that this isn't done without any mistake. In the new voting system, the computer would count the votes and this would be producing less faults. But just like they said in the listening part, the computer programs are programmed by humans and this can lead to a lot of mistakes because, like nobody is perfect even the person who programmed the computer system could have made some mistakes. These mistakes in the computer system would lead to a thousand of wrong votes instead of a few wrong votes when people count the ballots. The last argument of the text is that if the governments and individuals trust other computer systems like online banking they should trust the voting system too. But for example online banking did have some problems at the beginning and was made better a few times. But if there are mistakes in the voting system it's vry bad because votings are only made every two years, so there is no need to make it better as fast as possible, because it's not used every day
