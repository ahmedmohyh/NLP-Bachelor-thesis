Both of the texts are about the mistakes that could be occur by votings in the USA: On the one hand, it is really hard for people with poor eyesight to read the very small printed names on the paper so they want to change the concept of voting to a computer program where it should be way easier to read. In the same time, it would also be faster to count the votes because it is all automatically and withaout any errors.
On the other side there are arguments, that this verion is only easier or people who are used to the modern technic. People wo don't use the computer everyday won't be able to use it for that either. Although we can't be sure that a computer doesn't make any mistakes. Computers are also made by humans and if they have an error in it, this will have a way bigger impact on the results of the voting wether the one from the humans.
