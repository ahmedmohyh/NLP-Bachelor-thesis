the text is basically a pro arguement and the presentation a contra arguement to computerizing the voting system. The text claims that there would be far less mistakes made by voters if they had computers, because it would be easier to just touch the name of the candidate whereas the presentation says that using computers is only easier for people who are used to working  with them and that for people who aren't, for example people of age, it would make things even more complicated. They would make by far more mistakes and maby even skipp the whole voting process alltogether. The text arguments ass well with less mistakes being made in the counting part of the whole process.Human error might cause tons and tons of miscounted votes. The presentation defends the manual prosedure by explaning that computer programmes as well are made by  humans and can easily contain errors themselves. And an error in the computerized voting system can be far worse since it would most likely effect a couple of thousands of votes insted of just a few manually miscounted ones. The woman as well claims that these kind of mistakes made by a computer programme are impossible ot reverse. Finally, the text arguements with things that have already been computerized and are working flawlessly like banking transactions. The presentation defends the manual system by simply mentioning that all these things have been used for a few years maybe decades and are used on a daily basis.
