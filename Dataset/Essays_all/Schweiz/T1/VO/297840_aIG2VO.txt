Soon there are the nationwide elections for the president of the United States of America. Nowadays, the voices of the habitants of the USA are only counted with computers. Is it really worth to use computers instead of people who count the ballots by themselfes? This i probably the bullet point of the presentation.

All elections in the Untited States of America are made with computers today. The new technology allows to count the ballots immediately and does not afford a  lot of people to count them by hand. Although we think, that if we count with new technologies there would not happen any mistakes, errors could appear. Because if the ballots are hand-counted, there are only a few wrong if there is an human error. But if the ballots are counted with computers, human errors could have enormeous follows. Of course we need the new technology daily for e-banking or things like that. But an election is at maximum once in two years, so the results should be really exactly. Also the text contains the inefficience of current systems and the risks which appear with the new computer technology. 

Further more, the hand-counted elections were mor easy for a lot of people who have never seen oder used a computer before. For them it is to difficult to vote with copmuters or online-votingsystems. A lot of people even have fear of technology - especially old people. For them the new technology is quite inuable.

All in all the new technolgy with the computer systems are wether told good in the text nor in the recording. The mistakes which could happen are too big to accept. Altouhg lots of people think the same, it is used already!
