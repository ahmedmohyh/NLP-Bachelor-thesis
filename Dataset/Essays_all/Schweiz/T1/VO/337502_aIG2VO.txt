first of all they said that computerized voting is very easy to understand for the people who are used to work with computers and the new technology. But for people who aren't used to the computer and the ned technology it is very difficult to understand the program and to learn how to use it correctly. For the elderly it can be very hard to understand how to do use the computerized voting on the computer in the right way, because they usually don't use their computer or laptop that often. Sometimes older people are even afraid to use the new technology and they're scared to do something wrong. A positive point about the whole online voting is that the amount of mistakes and miscountings is very small againt the ones of the old voting system. A human being can quickly count the votes wrong or forget about one vote, but a computer doesn't make a counting mistake that fast. but for the older people who can hardly see or read something is the old system worse because they can easly mix up the names of the candidates and as a result they're going to vote for the wrong person. In the new system mistakes like that aren't done so fast because they are able to zoom on the monitor and have a much better eyesight. In addition i have to mention that a comoputer is less likely to do a counting mistake but if he does one it is even worse than when a human is doinig one counting mistake. Because the whole program can be started again when one computer makes a mistake and because of that it is difficult to trust the whole new technology thing with the computerized voting. Nevertheless are those systems used daily and we should all learn to trust them because honestly they're going to be our future.
