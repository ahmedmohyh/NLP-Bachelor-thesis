In traditional voting in the United States there are many problems.Tipical mistakes are miscounts because its nearly impossible for humans to count thousands of thousands votes without doing any mistakes. These miscounts can be very damaging so that the number of votes for each candidante is wrong. The people often vote for the wrong candidate. So many people think there needs to be a change.Those people want to computerize the voting, so its much easier to do the voting. The only thing that the voters have to do, is to click the candidates name on the touch-screen. Thats it! Even people with poor eyesights can do it properly. But there are many humans saying that it would be worse then the traditional voting because of those who cant handle a computer or not using it on a regular base. Some say it is to risky to use computer techology because if there is a bug in the system the whole voting act could be manipulated. Some candidates would recieve votes of other candidates. So in fact there is a big discussion of the future of the voting system in the United States.
