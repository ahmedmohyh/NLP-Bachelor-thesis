The problem about voiting in de United States

Voting is a big thing, then it is about who is going to be the next president or an other importan person. But the people do not like their voting system. They have to chose in a long an complicatet cheet. Mostly the people do not really have time to fill out those cheets, so they just vote someone, maybe thy even do not want. The next problem is the counting. All those votes have to be count, so they know who had been chosen. That is not good for the world and to count the votes of millions of people it needs a lot of time. So the people want a new system. In that system the people have to chose the candidates on a screen of a computer. They donot want de cheets of paper, they just want, that the candidates where picturiesed and the voters can just click on they favorite one. But this system has an other problem: Firstly not everybody have an computer,so it would be complicated, when some voters could vote whith the computer and the other whit the cheets. Secondly maybe a voter have a computer, but does not really know how to use it. Thirdly maybe the programm to vote is notgood enough so a person could hack the programm and maybe he could change the programm and everybody could cheat, and vote not only one time. 
Finally both of the system have their good pionts so the traditional, you can not cheat and the system whit the computer is even easier. But the both have their bad points,like the trantional whit the long, complicatet cheet and the other whit the  notexistent interduction.
