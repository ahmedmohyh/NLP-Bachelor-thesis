In the discusion about the current voting system the women argued, that people who are not familliar with computers or modern technology in general could have problems with voting. And I guess especially older people have problems with their eyes so this wouldn't get us any further. The women also said that programms probably not have human errors but they still can have errors because every programm is written by a human in the end. And if such an error should happen the votes couldn't even get recounted since they are just in the computer saved as 1 ands 0 and not physically on paper. So we also loose the human error aspect which the text mentions. An other reason why the lady wouldn't change to computer voting is that the voting system, like the system of the bank for example, has to evolve. She said that even the bank system didn't work from beginning and it needed time to make it better, more saver and so on. And this is a system, running every day. So how long would it take to develop a good working system for voting when there is just one in two years? It's nearly impossible.( At least thats what the women say). So also the last reason, the reason of security has got objected by our lovely unnamed women. 

(It seriously wouldn't be all too hard to test such a system... I'm just saying...)
