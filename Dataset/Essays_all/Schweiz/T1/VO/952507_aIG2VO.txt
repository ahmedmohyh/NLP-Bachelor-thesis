I will summarise now the arguments from the heared speach and add the counter arguments of the text. The arguments of the heared speach are just against the computerized voting and it isn't neutral. 
Their first argument is about the computer itself. Many people who doesn't use the computer often can't handle it, this causes problems in voting because they click on the wrong candidate or even can't start the voting. Another problem is that still a lot of people don't own a computer so they have no chance to vote. The people which are for computerization say that they are also faults in elections by hand because some people can't see well and so mark the wrong name. But isn't this also a problem for computerized voting, because if you see badly the paper you also see badly the screen. 
Secondly they say that they are also faults in the programming of the computerized vote because it is also human-made. And the problems which this faults will cause are much bigger and expensiver than some miscounts of ballots.
Also is it not safe because the voting data is not physically safed. A cyber attack or an error which deletes most of the votings could be a huge problem. 
The argument of the text, that asks, why we don't use the computer in voting when we use it daily in banking and communication of highly sensitive informations is explaned by the voice speach that the banking and communication on the computer wasnt good at the beginning and just because we use it every day made it better and better because the developers saw the problems good and they could change it fastly. But for a computerized voting is it bad if the beginning fails, because it is also once in 2 years and so much times worse.
