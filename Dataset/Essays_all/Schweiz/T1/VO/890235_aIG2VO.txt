The person in the listening said that computer voting is not made for everyone. Many people wouldn't be able to use this new technology since they are too poor to afford a computer or have other issues. If you would change the voting system to the new computer version, you would easily create a group of people that isn't involved in society anymore. There is a huge trust in the banking transactions that happen online like the communication of private information. The point is that these systems are used daily. Since elections and votings happen a lot less regular it's more common that there will be mistakes in the programs. Because of this it would be very difficult to gain the trust of the society for this new voting system. The text says that a major problem of the old voting system is that people make mistakes. The officials have to work inefficient and go throught every little detail - failure is inevitable.
