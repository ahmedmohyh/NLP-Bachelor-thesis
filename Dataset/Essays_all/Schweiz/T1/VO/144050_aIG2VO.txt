The lady in the lecture talked about the traditional voting system in the United States and about the thought of computerising it. She said that the traditional system surely brought certain difficulties with it but reorganising the system won't make it much easier at all. The text on the other hand obviously encouraged the change to a more electronical and automatic system. A huge argument made in the speech was, that it might be easy for a person used to computer technology to cooperate with the new electronic program, but people without any computer skills or those, who can simply not afford modern technology should not be forgotten or disconsidered. Huge numbers of voters in the United States might be confused by the new system or even be disencouraged to vote all together.

Another point the lady made clear in her speech was the problem of failure. Surely errors were made by counting the ballots in the past but those problems are nothing compared to computer technical ones. If computers malcalculate or even lose certain data all together the impacts on the society are way bigger. Disagreeing with the statement made in the last sentence of the text the lady points out, that computer systems, even though they are used daily and heavily by issues with a huge importance of accuracy (such as banking transaction), took long periods of time to get developped and improved. Voteing though only takes place every second year on national level and the system will therefore not be used on a regular basis. As a result the new automatic system will take years and years to get to the level of accuracy needed for a topic as important as the elections.
