Critics claim that the current voting system in the United States is ineffiecent. Would computerizising the whole system change it for the better? Or are humans after all more reliable than computers? 
In traditional voting, people can accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. Either because of poor eyesight or because the sheet of paper contains too many names and the mark next to the is too small. With the touch-screen technology, it would be easier since the people would only have to touch the candidate's name and you could magnify the name. Yet there are critis about the benefits of using a computer. First of all some people don't know how to use a computer and might stop voting completly because of the fear of technology. At the same time some people don't have a computer and can't effort it. 
Another problem with the old system is that people have to count the votes, which means going through ever ballot one by one. With the enormous amount of votes, there it's unevitable that at one point mistakes are made and correcting an error is long and expensive. Computer system would count the votes quicker and automatically. And many people trust in technology like that for their banking transactions. But how do we know that there are no flaws in the computer system? The banking system had to be improved many times over the years to make it as good as it is now. But voting is only every 2 years nation wide. It's possible that and human made error in the programm occurs and that can be far more severe than a few miscounted votes. And a recount wouldn't be possible electronically. 
After all critics want to change the voiting system but is the electronical way the right one? Or do they might need to come up with a completly different way of voiting?
