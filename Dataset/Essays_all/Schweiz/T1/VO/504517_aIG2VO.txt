People make mistakes, computer don't. The problem in this statement is, that computer are built and programmed by people and people make mistakes, so even if it's easier for people with poor eyesight to choose the right name or to count the ballots, computers aren't perfect either.
Computers are something new in this world. They can make our life easier. But many people aren't able to use them correctly or are afraidof modern technology because they think they don't know how to use them correctly.
People are able to recount all the ballots if they made a mistake, but if the computers have got an error, it's impossible to recount and the whole voting has to get repeated.
So even if the voting could be made and counted automatically, computers don't remove the possibility of human error and if an error on the computer happens, it's totally worse, then a mistake of a person while counting the ballots. 

I don't think the world is ready yet to make votings with computers. Computers aren't perfect yet and i guess it'll take a while until they are. But as soon as the risk of errors can be minimized and computers did become better, it's possible that in future votings can be done with them.
