There is a huge discussion about how voting systems should be improved. On one hand, there is the point that the traditional voting systems are very complicated and often lead to errors and miscountings. But will they really get better if we do votings on a computer? There is evidence that many people which aren't into computers are often even more confused as with the traditional methods. That would lead to even more false votings and the result would be incorrect. There is also the problem with the computer system itself: If the computer system fails there is no chance to do a recount because the informations wouldn't be stored elsewhere than on the computer. We see there is a huge controversy on this topic. We'd like to improve the voting system but the "solution" wouldn't be any better than the traditional methods.On the other hand: If we could eliminate the errors of human faults in the programme and make the voting system extremely easy to use it would be a huge improvement to the traditional counting and voting system. There wouldn't be any miscountings anymore and also a lot of people could vote easier and faster.
