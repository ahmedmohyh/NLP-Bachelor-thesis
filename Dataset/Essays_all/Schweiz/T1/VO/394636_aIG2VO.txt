Firstly, who say that voting using technology make it easier to vote for exampel it could be that some people don`t have a computer, aren`t used to a computer or don`t want to use a computer to vote that could mean that many votes would miss because some of the people didn`t vote.

Secondly, human error can also show in a compute system when a human programed something wrong or bad i could lead to a catastrophe it could not count many votes or even count them wrong.

Also, it is true that computer system of this kind already exist like the computer system in banks but this system are used daily but people vote only once or mayby twice in a year because of that the computer system wouldn`t be used that much and this means it could have major problem.

Finally, a mistake made by human means some wrong counted votes but a mistake made by a computer could be worser it could count thousend of votes wrong.
