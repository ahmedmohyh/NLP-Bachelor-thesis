There is the discusion about digialising the election in the USA. 
The arguments for this project, are that humans make mistakes, at the voting or at the counting part, and thats a good point. Another, that many people have work very long till al ballots are counted. And if there is an eror detected it can't realy get undone. And a computer system can be very save, in fact there is online banking and stuff.
But against that the is the fact, that computers and programs can fail too, because they are human made. So a wrong counted ballot is one thing, but thousands of votes geting lost in a software bug is a disaster. The whole election needs to be repeted. Also the system could be hacked and maipulated too. People who arn't good at using computers, or can't effort one, can't vote. Older people are maybe affrade of such new technology and refuse to vote. Banking programs have been tested for a long time and had some failures also.
