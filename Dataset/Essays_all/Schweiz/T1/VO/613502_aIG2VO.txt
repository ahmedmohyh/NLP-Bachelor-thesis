In the presentation the lady said that many people are not used to computers and therefore could vote for the wrong candidate because they missclick or dont know how the virtual voting system works. In the text however it says that compuerized voting systems are much more easier to use than the traditional voting methods. Because the computerized voting machine has a touch-screen which makes it very easy for everybody that votes. The computer can also magnify the name of the candidate in case the somebody has poor eyesight.

The second argument of the lady that held the presentation was that the software of the computerized voting system could contain failures or bugs. This could mean that many votes could be misscounted or even deleted. If this was the case recounting the votes would not be possible anymore. In the text the autor say that the chance of mistakes when counting by humans is very high and almost inevitable. Recounting all votes takes a lot of time and is very expensive. Computers could remove the errors that humans make.

The last arguement of the lecturer was that many of the complex systems for banks or the government have been improved over many years because they have been used frequently. This means that the software companies were frequently updating their software and computer systems. This would not be the case for compuerized voting system because they would be used every two years or even less.This means that it would take much longer to develop a stable and reliable voting system.
