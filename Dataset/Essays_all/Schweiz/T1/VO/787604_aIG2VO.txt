The voting system used in the United States is very traditional. People use ballots where they mark the name of their candidate and then all those ballots will be counted by officials. The problem with that is that it is very likely that miscounts are going to happen since there are thousands of ballots. People with bad eyesight might tick the wrong name and the result will be inaccurate. So critics would like a computerized voting system. So you can just touch the name of a certain candidate and you can enlargen the names if you have poor eyesight. The counting will be much faster and easier and there won't be any human error. Others disagree and state that there is for sure going to be a human error because the voting programm will be made by humans. And that computer technology we use for banking transactions are used every day and have been improved to be as good as they are today. While as voting is only maybe twice a year an so it will be way less trustworthy. Also it is feared that the mistakes that the computer makes will be far more serious because it could miscount half of the votes because of an error or even delete a majority of them. And there will be no backup data for the votes so it can't be recounted.
