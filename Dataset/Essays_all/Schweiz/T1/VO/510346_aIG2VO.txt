How can we improve the voting system, to decrease errors? The article said, that it is better to use technology to vote and to count the votes, while the woman who held the speech said that you can not trust technology and that there would be less votes, because there are many people who are not used to use computers to do stuff. She thinks that there are people who do not trust technology and would not vote because of that. She also said that there might occur errors by using technology, because it is made by humen as well. She claims that it could be even worse if technical errors happened, because it might affect not only a few ballots, like in the traditional voting system, as we have currently, but even thousands of them. She thinks that it is going to take a long time to vote by using technology properly because technology constantly needs improvement. Because there are not many votings in general, it is going to take even longer, because they can not test the technology on a general basis. 
There are some points mentioned by the woman, which do not make much sense. She says that technology is only easier to use for people who do much with technology and that people who can not or do not use technology will not be able to vote. However, the article says that it will be easy to vote, because you only have to touch the name of the candidate to vote for that person. Everyone would be able to manage that.
