Humans make mistakes and also computer programs are made by humans. So how can we trust the computer so much?
Also many people are afraid of the technology and they often have troubles while using computer voting. Everyone uses the internet, the computer and how can we be that sure, that this system works at everytime? And also computers can be hacked, and so votings could be damaged. At the old voting system, the votes have to be counted one by one, so it's possible and clear that there are many faults made. So the traditional old voting, isn't that good. Critics say that the voting is inefficient and that voters have to find the name of their candidate in a very long list ( the ballot ). Also old or even young people with poor eyesight can easily mark a wrong name. So they would like to replace the traditional voting by trustworthy computerized voting systems. And when the voting would be computerized, there wouldn't be any faults at vote counting. Also the computerized banking works very good and there are much more highly and sensitive information.
