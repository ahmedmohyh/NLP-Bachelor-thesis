The arguments form the lecture are that people, who aren't used to computers will have a promblem with voting on computers. There are people who don't own a computer, elders who don't use modern technology or people who have a fear of technology. And to think that there will be less mistakes with computers is debateable because those computers are programmed by humans so it is most likely that there will be errors either way. So you can't say that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error. But to miss a few ballots isn't as huge as having a programm with an error, because this could give a totally wrong counting. You can say that complex computer technology are  perfectly accurate in banking tansaction as well as in  communication of highly sensitive information, but you have to keep in mind that those affairs have been improved by using it every day. But an important voting happens once a year in the US.
