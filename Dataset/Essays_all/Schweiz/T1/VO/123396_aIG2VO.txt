There are problems in the USA. Ther are different votings in a year and that scholud be on a computer. The problem is that sam people don't have a computer at home and can't do that voting on the computer.
An other problem is that computers can make mistakes, but not so many as a normal person. How can that be? Because we, the people on the earth, have maken this compoters. 
In traditional voting you can easyly facked. You can writhe a other name of the top of the sheat and no one can test it.
In the next year the USA would do the voting electrony, because it is safer and easyer to do it. The computer is also a divice that is dayly used. Many peoble worked with it, because it ist faster then do it withe your hands.
