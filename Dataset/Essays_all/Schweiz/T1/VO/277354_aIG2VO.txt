The text states that the current voting system in the United States has some errors that could be easily wiped out by introducing a computerized voting system.
In the presentation on ther other hand the presenter strongly suggests to stick to the traditional voting system. It highlights the problems voters might have when using the system that relies on technology. The consequences of an error in the complex computer technology could be far worse than those from the traditional system. Counting the ballots by hand is therefore viewed as much safer. While the text supports a change in the voting system the presentation stands in for the traditional one. Another argument of the side which supports new technology reminds us of how easy it would be to replace the complicated ballots which contain many names with a clear structured website. There we would just need to click on the candidates name to give our vote. For people with poor eye-sight this strategy could be really useful. Their opponents argue that the website could cause even more problems than the traditional one does and therefore would be to complex for people with poor understaning in technology. In the end two come to the conclusion that the possibility of such a system is very much possible since highly sensitive information is transfered everday without problems.
