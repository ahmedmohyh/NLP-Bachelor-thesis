A lot of arguments for and against computerized voting systems were mentioned in the text and the audio presentation.

In the text, they mentioned, that while counting and recording by hand many mistakes can happen if someone miscounts or just skips a few ballots. The women in the presentation argued, that human beings do make errors and that computers were invented by humans, too. She said that if a person, who counts the votings makes a mistake, maybe five to six votes are miscounted, but if a computer makes an error, thousands of votes can just get lost and then there is no turning back, because with the handwritten votes, you could start from the beginning, with the computer, they are just lost.

An argument in the text was that older people with poor eyesight could not make a mistake, when they tick the wrong person, they can with the computer touch on the name they want to elect and they can even computer magnify the name, for easier viewing, but if everything is computerized, older people may are a bit afraid and stop voting, so they would loose a lot of voters.

A big problem in today's live, is the time, we do not have so much time anymore, so we want to make everything more efficient. The computer would count the votes by itself and that would be way more efficient.
