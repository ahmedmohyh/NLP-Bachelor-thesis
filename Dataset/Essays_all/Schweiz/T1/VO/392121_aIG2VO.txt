The arguments of the presentation contradict with the points mentioned in the essay as far they look at the problem of technology and voting from different perspectiv. They computerized voting being easier for people is not what everbody agrees on as we can hear in the presentation. Especially elder people and people who are not familiar with computers and technology would tend to make mistakes because they do not understand and comprehend what they should do. This then leads to discouraging the elder people and only benefiting the so called "digital natives". 
Another issue that came up was whether or not the computer programms make mistakes. Every human being makes mistakes and they both aknowledge that there are going to be mistakes made when the traditional voting system is being used but the computer programms are also made by human beings and can therefore be inefficent. One big problem of the computerized model is that if the computer does make a mistake there is no physical prove of any vote ballot. The argument that we trust in E-banking and other computeried system that make our lifes easier is being dealt with that these get used on a daily basis and get improved a lot.
