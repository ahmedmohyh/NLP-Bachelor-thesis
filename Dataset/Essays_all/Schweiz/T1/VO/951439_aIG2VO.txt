The woman explains how traditional voting is more reliable than computerized voting.
She starts off by explaining that people who dont use cumputers on a regular basis might not have the confidence to use one for voting or they might not how to use one in the first place. Though the text mentions errors in traditional voting system aswell, as people with bad eyesight might select the wrong the candidate.
The woman then admits that mistakes are bound to happen when the votes are counted by human but she continues to add that those mistakes are mostly small ones however if there was a flaw in a computer program, which is also just made by humans so mistakes can happen just as easily, then the outcome of a rogue program is just fatal. The might be losses of a few thousand votes or even more. But the text highlights, that errors in the traditional system use a lot of time but a porgram does not only remove the possibility of human error but also uses less time. The text goes on to mention that despite critics similar programs are trusted every day for banking or the comunication of highly sensitive information. But, so the woman says, these programs can only be trusted because they are used very frecuently and they had to go through a long process to get to where they are now. And with the elections only held every so often the work put into those programs are much smaller.
