In this text I want to show the problems of the voting systems in the United States. 
For the beginning a lot of people say that the old systems to voting for a candidat are mostly inefficient and inaccurate. Yes, I think if there are millions of voting papers mistakes gonna happen too fast. On the other hand, if we are looking for a new system the computer voting, we will get a hole bunch of new problems that appear. What could we do with the elderly peoples wich are maybe not able to use any computers or modern technology. They would make mistakes easily. A other problem is we have too many humans wich are really poor and can`t afford their own gadget. And do you know who make the computers? Yes, computers are made by humans and humans make mistakes. So why should computers don`t do any? 

In conclusion, computer would make many things easier for voting, but in the end it is far better to do it with the old system because so many peoples aren`t good in using technology gadgets.
