Some people say that in traditional voting are made maybe a few mistakes by miscounting ballots. But if the votings are counted by computers wich are programmed also by humans there could be made mistakes wich possibly end in maybe thousands of not counted votes wich is far worse than miscounting some ballots. Also people who use computers on a daily base may think its easyer to vote on a computer but there are many citizens in the USA who don't have a computer at home and don't know how to use one. Anyone knows how to put a mark on a piece of paper. Another point is that such voting computers need to be tested so if there are problems with the programming they could be solved. But in the USA people vote every two years and thats far too few times to test the computers.
