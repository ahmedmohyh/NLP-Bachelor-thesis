Critics maysay that currentvoting systems in the US are inefficient and old and that the better alternative would be to introduce a modern voting system with computers which count the votes automatically and work with touch-screens. But these critics are wrong in may ways because computers are not so common in the US and many people don't use one on a daily basis. This would probably lead to many people who are so afraid of technology and of doing something wrong that they don't vote at all anymore. Computers are also programmed by humans so it isn't automatically better to use a computerized voting system as the text implicates but also in computer programs human error can show up, because humans programmed the system, and would most of the time have a very big influence on the results.
Because there is also no physical backup in that case a recount would not only be long and expensive, as the text says, but would be completely impossible.
The text also says that computers were already heavily used in everiday banking activities and so on but whilst that is true it is not true that these systems were flawless from the beginning. They also had many faults which were removed one by one. This was possible because they were used every day and they could "mature" over time. In the US national voting is only done once every two years and per-state voting is also not done more than twice a year. It would be nearly impossible to generate a computerized voting system which just works from the beginning but exactly that is needed because there is not enough time nor enough testing to remove all the errors.
