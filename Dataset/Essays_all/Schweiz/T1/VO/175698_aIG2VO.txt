Voting
The listening which could just be heard. Is strictly against computer voting because it says that it may seem easy to vote on computers for people who are used to operate with computers but what about the people who are rarly working on computers and those who can not even afford a computer. The woman speaking is afraid that the people who are not used to computers will not even vote becasue thay are to scared of this new system. And besides that she makes clear that a computer counting system may not make less errors than human beeings for that th counting system is also so created in human hands. And if the computer makes any errors thay maybe much worse, such as deleting thousends of votes at once, than the errors caused by human countings. Although we may relay on computers when working in a bank we must not forget that this system in the beginning caused errors too, but thay could be repaced fastly because we use this system every day, but national votings are only held every two years which means we have no time to get used to the voting system. 

On the other hand we have is printed text, which says that the errors caused by human counters are to big to just ignore them. The computer counting system may not be the result but the gouvernment must at least leave one single thought to it. Because counting all these ballots is a during process and the errors can be damaging if an election is closely contested. It even happens that some people vote for the wrong person. People with bad eyesight have problems to make their cross next to the right name becasue it's written so small. This porblem would be sloved with a computerized voting system.
