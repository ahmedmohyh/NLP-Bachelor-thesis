It is said that people who do not have a computer at home or who did not grow up with one will have some difficulties with the voting machines. We can see that this may be a problem when we observe older people trying to use a cell phone or a computer. They have no idea how they have to work with these technologies. They often touch the screen at the wrong place so they could give the wrong vote. In the text it is argumented that computers are easy to handle, mostly because of the touch-screen-technology and the zooming, and that people will not accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because they made the mark at the wrong candidate. So the computer-voting may be easier for the young generation which grew up with this, but not for the older or the poor people, who can not afford a computer at home.
Another Argument from the hearing example is that humen made those computer voting programs and they could make a mistake. So then the whole result would be wrong and they would have to do the whole voting from the beginning. A human error like it is said in the text could be fixed easily by recounting the votes. Of course this is expencive and long but when a computer makes a mistake, it is worse.
The last argument from the hearing example is that there is nationally in the USA a voting all two years and regionally there are two votings a year. So there are not enough votings to see how the computer-technology works. When the first computer has been invated it took much time to make it work and delete all the errors. The text says to this, that we trust the computers much for example the banking system, so why not trust them for the votings?
