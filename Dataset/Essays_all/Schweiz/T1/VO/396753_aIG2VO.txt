I heard that the voting system isn't that good and people want to change it, so that it's computerized. That's maybe easy for the ones that are used to computers and stuff but for the others it's more confusing than helpful, for example elderly people or people who can't afford a computer and it's said that they might have a fear of technology. Another theme is that many people think that computers are better than humans, but is this true? Computers are made by humans and we make mistakes, so probaby the computer does too. If a computer loses votes, it isn't able to remember them, a human is (mostly). Would it be nessecary to introduce a computerized voting that we only use two times a year? No it wouldn't says the record that I heard before.
The text is the opposite of the record I heard, because the text says all the negatives of the old system and not the ones of the new one. In the text they say that people accidently vote for the wrong person, because of poor eyesight, but like we heard people wo aren't used to computers could also vote for the wrong one because they don't get hot it works and just try it. And if people have a poor eyesight they won't see better on a computer. Also the counting of the votes is being difficult because humans can't be so efficent like a computer, because humans can forget to count a few votes and the other sight of view is that computers have been made from humans and it can also do mistakes( And if we are honest both people and computers aren't subjective.) . In the text they only say something about the fact that computers are good and we trust them, even for banking transactions and so on, but in the record it's said that this voting system would be new and we couldn't trust it until it gets more used. The text is for a computerized system and the record is against it, so it's like pro and contra.
