In the United States they have diffrent meanings about the voting system. The problem is, that the traditional system has some problems. In the text is written that one problem for example is that the voters, which hasn't good eyes, can easily make a mistake, like mark the wrong name. A other problem is that the counters of the votes make mistakes by counting the votes. A next point that's shown us in the text is, that some peopel say it is too risky, but in an other way the peopel manage their bank and other things also with their computer and this could be also riskly. In the listening they say that the tradition voting system has some problem and so using the computer for the voting system is better. But they say also that's only for peopels they can work with a computer and understand what they must do. The computer system is also a trouble for not users. That's one of the biggest problem from the listening. A next problem from the listening is, if humans make mistakes and the computer is programmed by the humans, so make the computer also mistakes? When in the programm of the voting system is any problem, 1'000 of votes go away... so the world must trust the electronic system. A next thing that was in the listening, was that the voters only must voting once every two years and not every day. In the text and also in the listening, the peopel see in bowth things problems. But they see problems in the traditional and computer system.
