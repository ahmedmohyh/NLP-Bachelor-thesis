If the traditional voting system would be replaced by a computerized one then for people who know how to handle a computer would have it much easier. But what about the people who aren't exposed to computer in their everyday life.They would be overwhelmed by this way of voting. It would be possible that they wouldn't vote at all.

There wouldn't be any counting mistakes anymore which there are certainly some in the current system as humans make mistakes. But the software on which the computer depend on is made by humans which means it is possible that there are mistakes in it. Those mistakes would be far more problematic because it is impossible to do a recount as the votes arent saved.

The complex computer technology which we use everyday and trust has been developped and perfected since implacement.A computerized voting program would be used a maximum of twice a year. It isn't worth it to develop a flawless system for such a small usage.
