In the USA the current voting system has some problems because the votes are counted incorrect by the people or the voters mark not the name they want to vote because they mark the wrong name in the large sheet of candidates. So a new computerized voting system should replace the current system. In the new touch screen system the voter can much more easily vote, so the possibility to mark the wrong name is small. The Counting of the voting would be done automatically by the computer. 
But there are some problems. They're still people which are not familiar with the Computer so they are not able to vote anymore. Human errors can still be possible in programming the computers but the effects would be more than some false counted votes by human and rejecing is impossible.
Finally other computer technologies are improved by many years and are used daily, this voting system would only used once a year.
