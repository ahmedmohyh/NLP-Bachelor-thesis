The first argument of the women is the fear of technology by elderly people. These people are more sympathisised with the traditional system. This argument stays in conflict with the one from the text wich says that people with poor eyesight may have problems crossing the right name on the ballot.
The second argument is about counting the votes. Officials sure make mistakes, but these mistakes are far less heavy than an error of a computer. If the computer gets an error, the whole system could shut down.
The last argument wants to make clear that sure computers make less mistakes than humans, but are programmed by humans. Bank-transaction-systems are there for much more used and improved than a programm wich is only used once or twice a year. A computerbased electionsystem would need many years to be as highly accurate as needed.
