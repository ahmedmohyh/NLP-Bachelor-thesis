Computer voting isn't as good as many people think. There are a lot of people like old persons or people who don't be used to work with computers! These people would have problems to vote on the computer, if there is just this one possibility to vote. They will have trubles with the tecnolology and in the end they won't vote for the election because the are angry about the way the have to vote. 

On the other side, in traditional voting, a lot of people are used to vote for the wrong canditates, because it isn't as easy to find the name of their candidate. The sheet on which it is written, who is canditating for the voting, so to large that many people make the wrong choise. Then, there is another problem too! Often, old people or poeple with poor eyesight choose the wrong name because they can't see well. So, for these people it would be easier to vote via computer. The new tecnologiy make it possible. They just have to have touch-sceen computers.
