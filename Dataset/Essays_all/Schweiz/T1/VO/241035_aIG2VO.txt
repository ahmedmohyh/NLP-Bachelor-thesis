Critics of traditional voting argue that a major source of inaccuracy is people accidentally voting for the wrong candidate. Howerver, opponents of the computerization of voting systems argue that such change could discourage voters unfamiliar with computers. They doubt that voters that can't afford computers or voters that don't regularly use computers could have trouble voting with a computerized system. The elderly would certainly have a hard time adjusting to this drastic change. Proponents of the modernisation of elections say that the people that code the voting mashines are also human and thus would also make mistakes. But such mistakes could cost much more than one wrong vote. 
Another argument made by people in favor of computerization is that human error while counting could be eliminated entirely using mashines. But, as there are no physical records using computerized voting, a possibility of recounting the votes by hand would not exist.
