The basic arguments of the audio documentare was the unrTelieableness of computerized voting system and the danger that may occur with it. The text completely opposed the audio file by saying, that governments use trustworthy computer systems and that computers manage to be very accurate. 
The audio file also explained the troubles people might get, when the government introduces a computerized system for voting. The women, speaking in the audio file, said some might not be able to afford computers and others will be struggling while using computers. She even went as far as to say that few people just won`t vote because of the fear of technology. It will be an unneccessary problem to deal with for the government. 
But on the other side the text explains how much easier it would get with a computerized voting system. The Ballots are quite big and the marks one has to make to acctually vote is rather small. The Computers could make this kind of issue disappear. People who can not see very well could just klick on the name of the person they want to vote for. Furthermore mistakes are often and easily made, while counting the Ballots. With computers an automized counting will occur and the task of counting will be made much more efficient. 
But according to the audio file computers can contain errors to. And if an error is found in a computer system the consequences will be tremendously bigger than if a ballot-counting error happens. 
To sum up, while the audio file is opposing the introduction of computerized system, the text is encouraging the replacement of the tradiional voting system by computers.
