The mentioned problem is that they are argumenting if they should use computer programms to count their votes for the election of politicians. They are afraid that the computer system does have any fails on it and it does not work and it will not become better because an election is just once a year so the progress in making the computer systems better is very slow.And people who not use to work with a computer are not able to vote. But counting it all by hand is also full of problems people with bad eyes can mark the wrong candidate of the list. It is normal and obviously that humans will make fails too in counting and votes.
The text tells about the problems of old voting systems and giving the computers a chance and the soundtrack tells about a lady who tells about the problem with the computers.
