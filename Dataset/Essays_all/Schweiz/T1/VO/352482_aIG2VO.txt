In the United States there is right at the moment a discussion about how you should vote, traditionally by paper or modern with a computer. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. If you vote by paper, every single vote has to be counted separatly by humans. There is the possibility that the voter markes the wrong candidate, because of theyr poor eyesight and so give theyr important vote the wrong person. Also there is the simple possibility that the person who counts the votes makes a mistake. Since they have to deal with thousands of thousands of ballots, it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes.
If you vote by computer there isn't such a big chance of making mistakes as by paper. The computers all over the country can automatically count together theyr votes. But there is still the chance of an error because the programm isn't correct. In this case the mistakes would be much bigger. A wrong programm could make thousands of mistakes. In this case a recount would be impossible because there aren't any old voting sheets you could simply get out and recount. Although you could easily vote with your computer, there is the chance that many people don't vote because they are scared or simply don't trust the technology.
