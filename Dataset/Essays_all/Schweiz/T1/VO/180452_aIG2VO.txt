People who fear technology and never use computers would have problems with computerized voting. 
We are not sure if computers really make a better job than human. When people make mistakes, they do not count a totally false number of ballots. The number of false counted ballots is not as big as it could be with computers. If there is an error in the voting program, thousends of votes could get lost or be false. The system with the ballots had to be improved very much since it was new. That did take much time. If we use a new system it will also take time to make it useful.
We do not vote often. The amount of work to count the ballots is not very high. So we should just leave this system. 
The lecture critics the computerized voting. The text tells us about the advantages of the system. So the lecture warns us from computerized voting. Voting and counting will not be easier like the text says, but more dangerous. The lecture tells us the opposite of the text.
