Compurerized Voting

The current voting systen in the United States is heavily criticized in the Text, as an improval, a computerized counting system is suggested wy the writer. But he concentrates on two negative points only. The first one is the design of the ballot, which in his opinion is too complicated to fill out for poeple with poor eyesight, in his opinion a touch-screen where you wolud olny need to touch the candidates name would eliminate that problem. The other point is the possibility of human failure when counting the ballots, and also here the aswer is technology, he suggests computerized counting with machines, which can`t make mistakes.
The voice in the listening part has an opposite opinion, she agrees that there may be peolple who have trouble, marking the right candidates name with the current system and she also knows about the mistakes, the ballot-counters make while counting all the votes. But she still disagrees with the autor of the text. She also brings up older people as the target group which might have the most problems, she says that the voting machines are in no way better than the classic ballots because there surely are people who can`t afford or just dont want a PC, so they aren`t familiar with this kind of technology. And this infaliliarity could lead to even more problems or even people giving up voting at all. She also gives her opinion about the second point, written in the text. She thinks that it could turn out to be very difficult to make a perfect program, which wouldn`t have leaks or mistakes in it, and if something like that would happen, the outcome would be fatal, because you could not check again, if the machine counted right. And also in such a system, mistakes would be much heavier to detect.
