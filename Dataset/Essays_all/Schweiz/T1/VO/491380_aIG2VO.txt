In the United States people stll vote traditionally by making a mark on a ballot. Critics are concerned that this system is inaccurate because human errors can easily occur. Opposed to the text, the speaker is convinced that the traditional voting is more accurate and safer than computerized voting. In his opinion it may seem easier, but only for people who are used to modern technology. Many people don`t use computers in their everyday life and may have problems voting for their favourite candidate. The speaker even goes as far as assuming that they won`t vote because of fear or their lack of knowledge. The argument that human errors occur more often in traditional voting as the text says, is also mentioned in the presentation. Computers are programmed by humans and therefore not free of human errors. These errors can be much worse, because the whole system is influenced, and not only a single ballot. Since voting doesn`t happen often like banking transactions, it is far more difficult to perfect the process and give the people confidence,
