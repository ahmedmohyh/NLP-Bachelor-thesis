The speaker of the presentation names several points against computerized voting systems. 

First of all, it is mentioned that many people, especially elder people, are not used to using computer technology because they fear technology. So they may easily vote for a candidate whom they actually do not support. This is in contrast to the text, which says that the current voting system is inaccurate because people, especially those with poor eyesight, easily mark the wrong name on the sheet of paper containing the candidate's names. Therefore, using computerized voting systems would make voting more accurate and easier.

Secondly, it is said that an error in a computerized voting system would manipulate a vote, and worse, it would not show up because in a computer, there is no physical record of the votes. In contrast, the text says that in the current voting system easily happen errors because people count the ballots. If human errors happen, a long and expensive recount has to take place. So computer technology would remove the possibility of human error, and elections could take place quickly and smoothly.

Finally, it is said that when computers were first introduced, they were not working smoothly, and many errors happened at the beginning. This does not make computers trustworthy enough to give them issues to work with which are as important as elections are. But the texte mentions that we already trust computers in other important issues like banking transactions and other highly sensitive information.As a result, it would be a logical sequence if we also trusted the computers in our elections.
