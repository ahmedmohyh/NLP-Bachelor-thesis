Computerized voting
The proposal is to  remove the traditonal voting system because of its inaccuracy and its inefficiency. By counting the votes human  make errors and recounting is expensive. People could accidently choose the wrong candidate, especially if their eyesight is poor. 
On the other side we have the computer voting. The counting is done by computers, wich is quick and automatical. The  easy-to-use touch screen technology needs special devices. But some people might not be able to afford a computer or are not used to computers. They may even fear the tecnology and therefore don't vote. If a computer programm has an error recounting would e impossible. We  relay on e-banking an other complex systems every day, but voting woud occur ones or twice a year. Therefore it would take long to improve the computerized voting systems.
