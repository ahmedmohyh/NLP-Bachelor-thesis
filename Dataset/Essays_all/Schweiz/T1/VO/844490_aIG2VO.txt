Traditional voting can cause many problems because the votes get counted by humans and a mistake could always happen. On the other side, the computerized voting system may be more efficient but critcs say that it is not, because computerized systems are programmed by humans. Human errors would be reflected in the system. In both systems there is a big source of inaccuracy. In the United States voting takes place just every two years nationally. So if for example elderly people do not use computers that much, they will forget everything after each voting and that would cause immense problems. so probably in that point of view it would be better to leave the traditional voting systems because the change would be too big and would take too much time. In the text above there are no critics to computerized voting systems. The errors would be removed quickly because a computer can do that faster than a human. If a person with poor eyesight has to count up the votes, it can easily come to an ineffiecient result. So actually nothing is bad about the computerized systems. The question is how would the government make reality out of this?
