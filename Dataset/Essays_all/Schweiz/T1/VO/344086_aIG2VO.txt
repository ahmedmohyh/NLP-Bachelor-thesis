Summary of the arguments to the subject "Voting" 

A computerized vote system is better because of the current time and because of the citizens who are using technology but a 
disadvantage of technical systems is that people exist who don't use technology as much as for a political changing. Because of the technology there is the danger that the citizens can vote wrong. We don't have to forget that computers are made by huamans who aren't flawless, they make mistakes. Our century without technology is unforgettable and the systems are daily and heavily used by us, there exist technical not corecct programmated fuctions and a political vote has these dangers of happening mistakes which can have maybe bad consequences for the citizens, especially for the U.S people because there are world wide influecal. (It's a huge unrealistic hypothesis of me but good to write)

But it's good to change this traditional U.S. vote system of the 17th century, which is inefficent for our time. But it's a huge administrative exercise to change an almost acient:) system and most Americans are proud of it. If the modern people can trust to put their finances on their computer than they have to able to do an electronal vote. It would be for the people helpable to make advisors of the technical vote system.
