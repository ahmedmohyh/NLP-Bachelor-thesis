The speech is basicly all on doubting computers and technology. The people fear of technology it's not that easy for everyone to handle computers and not everyone has one of them at home so how do they even vote? Computers  are also programmed by humans leading the mistakes are even worse because thousands of votings are not correct. Another huge problem is that there are no phyiscal votes it's all about electronic. An electronic voting is clearly worse than the traditional way.
The text is all about the electronical way. The sheets for voting is way to long, so you can't even find your candidate or worse you could accidentaly vote a false one. Another problem is that humans are counting thousands of votes so mistakes aren't rarly and by the way it takes much more time to count every single vote. And we are confrontated with computers anyway for example in banking, social medias and so on, so why we don't vote with them? It's faster and more accurate
