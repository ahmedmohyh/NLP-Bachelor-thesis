In the presentation about voting systems, several disadvantages of computer voting are named: One of them is that many people aren't used to computers  or can't afford any. For those people it's really difficult to vote with computers, so they will maybe don't go voting at all because theiir fear of technology, or they're going to do mistakes because they aren't used to computers. So, as it's mentioned in the text, there might be some people who choose the "wrong" result because they can't see very well, but they are way more people who won't be voting at all because they aren't used to computers or don't even have any. Another disadvantage is that computers are programmed by human beings, which means that there can still be mistakes in the whole system of computer voting. Human beings might count some few wrong voting results, but once there is an error in the computer system, there will be thousands of wrong results and, in contrast to human counting, recountings aren't possible. The presentation does agree on the point that computers are used in many highly important areas such as banking transactions, but it also says that those areas are worked with every day, so the human beings had a lot of time to develope a well-working system where mistakes happen very unfrequently. Votings, however, only happen once in two years in the whole United States ore maybe once a year in smaller areas, but never every day. This makes it very difficult for the human beings to develope a safe system, because they only work with it quite rarely.
