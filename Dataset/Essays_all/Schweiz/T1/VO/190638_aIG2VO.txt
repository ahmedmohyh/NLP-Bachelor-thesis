The speaker doubts that computerized voting would be better than traditional systems. Computerized voting requires people to have a computer and be used to it. That means that voters who can not afford a computer or are not used to computers could easily cast the wrong vote or it could event discourage them from voting at all. Besides, if the traditional systems are processed by humans, how should a computerized system work better if programms are made from humans? An error in the programm could be worse than a mistake from a human. The programm could miscount 1000 votes or accidentally remove them if there is an error. There is no way of correcting mistakes because the ballots are not physically existent. Programms which we use today have had a long journey before they were as flawless as they are today.We improve them on daily base. But voting happens only once in a 2 years base for regional voting and that is hardly sufficient to improve the programm.
The differences from the speaker to the text are that the text is clearly for computerized voting and the speaker is against. The text blames human for inaccurate counting of votes and the speaker blames a programm with flaws for miscounting. The Text says that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. On the other hand the speaker warns that people who are not used to computers would either not be able to vote or make the wrong vote because they lack experience and knowledge. For the speaker it is safer for humans to count votes because they can only have few mistakes not like a computerized voting where it could occur thousands of mistakes because of a flaw in the programm. Also the text says that traditional voting system has a long and expensive way of recount, but the speaker says that through computerized voting there is no recount possible.
