Which voting system is better?
In the speech it is said, that voting with a computer is easier for prople, who often use computers and are used to it. But for older peole or people who are not used to computers is it much more difficult to use them and maybe they would do much more mistakes. Maybe those peolpe would also have a fear of the modern technology and would not vote any more. The text says it is easier to vote with computers and there would be less mistakes, but people who do not often use computerscan make as many mistakes as people do with the old system. And people who have got problems with teir eyes would also have problems with the new system even if it is digital.
Another point is that the text says people have to count the votes and that people makes mistakes with that, but computers also make mistakes and if thers a mistake in the program the mistake would be much bigger than the mistake if a person forgets to count one vote. And computer are also made by human beings, so they somtimes also have mistakes in their programs. And a mistake made by a computer would cost minimum as much money and time as a mistake made by people who made a mistake with counting the votes.
Computers and programs to vote have to be invented with a high standart and technology to to use them for nation or region wie votes.
