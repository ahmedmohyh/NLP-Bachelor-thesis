Computerized systems for voting are questionable: Some people would prefer it, other would not. In the presentation, the speaker doubts that a compterized voting system would be better, because there are people who are not used at all to work with computers, so they might even avoid to vote because of their fear of technology. On the other side, on the side of the author, people with eye problems might have difficulties to find their candidate on the large sheet which countains many names, so it can happen that they vote for the wrong candidate, a candidate they did not want to vote for.
The presentation has the opinion that computerized voting system might have as much human mistakes as the traditional system, while the author of the text is convinced that manually counting of votes is much more likely to be inaccurate. The presentation arguments too that our other daily-used computerized systems like e-banking and communication needed also to be proved. So the computerized voting system might need to be used several times over several years before they can be sure that there is not an error in it anymore. But as long as this can not be proved, one little error might cause several thousands or even more mistakes. In opposition, the author of the text thinks that counting by human beings is much more inaccurate, because they need to count ten thousands of votes manually. Due to the author, this is a "safe" source of mistakes.
