Will voting be computerized in the future?

The text shows the disadvantages of the traditional voting in the United States and insists on computerizing the whole voting system, whereas the lecture counts the disadvantages of the computer system and shows its disadvantages. Both, text and lecture, speak of the same subject but have a totally different view of it. 

The autor of the text thinks that the traditional system is too inaccurate and don't match with people with problems with their eyes. They wouldn't be able to read the small letters on the paper and could vote for the wrong candidate by accident. The computer system on the other side could zoom in on the text and new thechnology makes voting so easy that you have a touch screen where you could just click on the candidate's name. This system takes much less time for both, voters and counters, would hardly make any errors and costs much less. 

The woman in the lecture argues strongly against computerizing this system. Her first argument is that there are people who can't afford to buy a computer or aren't used to work with computers. Some have fear of technology. She speaks also about that errors in the system could be much worse than they are in the traditional system, that recount is not possible and voting is done not very often to be worthy of the whole system change.
