The opinions I heard were quite different, if not to say opposite. The text takes quite a positive stance towards using computers in elections while the lecturer is heavily against it. The lecturer points out that using a computer programm to do the voting and counting wouldn`t remove the factor of human error, since the programm itself is made by humans. Infact, she even claims that the consequences of an error would be much higher since there is no actual physical record of the votes, in case a recount is needed. So if there were an error in the programm, several thousands of votes could be misplaced or lost. She also argues that not everybody is as used to using computers, which opposes the statement of making the voting process alot easier and more user friendly. Furthermore she points out that it might even prevent people (that are not used to technology) from voting, since they do not trust the programm, which also leads us to her last statement. We do have faith in all the common programms like e-banking and the likes because they were tested and improved alot, refined by trial and error. On the other hand, elections only take place once every few years so it would take quite a while to find and correct errors, resulting in possibly multiple years of miscounts and maybe even wrong elections.
