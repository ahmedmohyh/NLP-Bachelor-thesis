The speech talk about the traditional voting with a list, where we have to find the candidats. This sounds very easy, but for persons with a handicap, like poor eyesight and so on, this can be difficult enough. Very fast, there are faults. This system isn't perfect. To eliminate this problems, we could use computerized voting machines. There is a special system programmized, so we have just to touch the candidates name on the screen and the voting is done.But like everywhere also there are critical toungues that says, this system isn't the best thing because there is a shift of people that won't use this tecnical system, because they don't understand the tecnic.
It's important enough that the voting is regarded as an important thing. The people of the USA have to take this seriously and make a vote that is right. This is difficult, if the system has faults or isn't perfectly designed. They should find a solution that is ok for everyone.
