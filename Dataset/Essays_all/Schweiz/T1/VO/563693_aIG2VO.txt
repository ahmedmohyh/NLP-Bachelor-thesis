should voting get maded by computers?

In the text are different arguments. They say, that human are making mistakes. By the actual voting system, we have to count all votes one by one and by thousand of votes there could come many errors. Also humans with bad eye sight could not see it right and so they vote false. Computers are making a good job because there cannot exist human errors.By a computer it is much more easely because you can just take your finger on the screen on the nae younwant to elect.
In the speak the person said that a human error is a small error at a voting and it is true that humans are making small mistakes, but if a computer makes a mistake it is much more problematic. If computers are making mistakes, there are thousand of votes terminated ore ucounted. So the old system is much more efficent. It needs more time than a computer, but it cannot get a virus or getted hacked. So we cannot trust the computers.And the people who cannot look good cannot look better just by looking on a screnn then looking on a paper and the name of the candidat is always the same so in this argument the computer is not helpful. In America there is all two years an election and so this is not too much for the old system.  
The old system worked many years right and why should this getted changed?
