The text sais that the voting system in the USA is very inefficent and that it often leads to inaccurate counting of votes. They say it would be better if the votes are counted by a computer. It would also be much easier to vote for the right candidate, because you dont have to look through a list of hunderts of names. In that case they say it would be possible that elderly people with bad eyes would mark the wrong name. But the women in the listening part says that it would not improve anithing, if we would change to a computerized system, because there are people who fear technology. Some habitants of the United States do not have a computer or have never even used one before. She also says that the programms are developed by humans and an error in a computer program would cause a misscounting of thousands of votes. Some of them would also be impossible to recount. In the text they say that in the banksystem we also trust in the programms made by humans and it works. But the women says that these programms have been overwritten several times until they really worked like they are working today. But the voting is only once every two years, so we don not have the possibility to improve it every now and then.
