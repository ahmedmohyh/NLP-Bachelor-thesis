First of all not everyone is able to handle a Computer, so when votes are held on-screen some people just do not vote or elect the wrong candidate because of a Mistake. This is a larger number of people then with todays non-voters because of eyseight problems and you can't garante that these can vote on-screen.
If you vote on a paper you can't hit a wrong candidate because of a mistake, you must be somehow limited to vote "wrong". At the computer you can easily hit a wrong button, sometimes without even noticing. Next we have the problems with the counters. They do some mistakes by taking tow ballots and just count one, but if the program has one little mistake thousends of votes are just nulified and no one ever sees them. so maybe a whole city didn't vote because one programmer made one litte mistake. If anything happens with the courent voting sistem you still have the ballots and you can recount them. And when someone infiltrates the voting program he can just select who wins the election and maybe the infiltration can't even be found. Sure today a lot of people trust in Computers in important things like banking but you can reverse a transver every day and elections are only held once every tow years so if there is a problem this can led to long lasting problms in every part of daily life like economy transports or even led to a war.
