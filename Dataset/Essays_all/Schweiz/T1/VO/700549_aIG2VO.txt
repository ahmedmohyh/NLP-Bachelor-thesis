The text and the presentation have quite oppositve views about the voting system in the U.S. The text is definiteley for the voting system with computers whilst the presentation is against it. The following are some examples.

The women in the speech says how natural it is for most of us to use a computer on a daily base but what about older generations or people who can not afford a computer. They are discouraged to vote and would probably even stop voting. On the other hand the writer says that it would be so much easier for people with poor eyesight to vote and there would be less mistakes made by accident by the voters.
Whilst the writer says that the people who count the votes make many mistakes and computer systems would remove the possibilty of human error. The women who held the speech said that computer systems are programmed by humans and therefore can also have mistakes.So if there was a mistake in a programme thousands of ballots would be miscounted in contrary a person is wrong by one or two ballots. The writer justifys his opinion by talking about the computer systems in the banks and how all our transactions are made by computers. But the women correctly says that bank systems had to be improved until they were perfect and because it is something we use every day this was easy. But to do this with a voting programme which is only used every two years is way more dificult and probably impossible.
