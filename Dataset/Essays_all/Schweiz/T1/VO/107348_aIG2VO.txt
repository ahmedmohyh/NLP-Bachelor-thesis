Firstly they are saying that not everybody can handel a computer or even can effort a computer. So it would be impossible that everyone who wants to vote can vote. Then secondly it comes to errors. The lecturer is explaning that humans can make mistakes while counting the votes, this is natural, but humans also can make mistakes while programming the computers. And if a computer is wrongly programmed they can be alot more errors than the votes are counting by the human hands. The technic can lose up to 1000 votes and can't recount the election. In contrast the humanbeeings can lose about one to ten votes. That is a very big diffrence.
And at the end the lecturer was mesuring that the voting system isn't that good. The electronical bankingsystem is proved many years. There were many problems but while this long time they were solved. And as a result the system became better and better. But the votingsystem is not that long proved. And it will make more mistakes as if humanbeeings would count the votes.

As a contrast the critics in the text are saying that people with bad eyesight can't tick on the right place and if a computer would count the votes th election would be without some errors. The mesuring also the bankingsystem wich is working perfectly, as a example for the exact work which computers can do. And at least the text is saying that the computer is free of humancaused mistakes.
