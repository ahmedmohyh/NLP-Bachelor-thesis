The United States traditional voting systems is critising, should we change it to an electronic voting systems?

It is true that in the traditional voting, it is easy to make a mistake. For example for people who do not have a good eyesight, they easely cross the false name. But would there people do better on a computer? The text may be bigger. Nevertheless it is also really easy to make a mistake for someone who is not used to the computer.

In traditional voting, there is sometimes error by the count. Yes, errors are human... and who would programmes the electronic voting systems? Human. And if there is a mistake in the programme, all the votes will be false.
In addition to that, if there is a mistake in the trditional voting, we can count it again. But on the computer not, the votes are not physical.

In fact, computer thechnology are used every day in banking transactions. But we do not vote every day. A computer programme have to be used often, to be certain that it work correctly. And there is not enough votes for that.
