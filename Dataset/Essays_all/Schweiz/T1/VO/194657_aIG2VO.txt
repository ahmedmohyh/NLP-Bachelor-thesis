Both text and presentation have the voting systems of the United States as main topic. But whilst the text is promoting to replace the old voting system by ballots with a new computerized system, the speecher in the presentation wants to keep the voting system as it is in order not to have big mistakes done by computers. Both sides use a bunch of different arguments to promote their opinion.

The text for example points out that the current voting system in the USA is very inefficient because the counting is often inaccurate. To reduce mistakes he would recommend a computerized system which is easier for the voters to choose the candidate they prefer instead of having to look at a long list of names, all close to each other and difficult to choose the correct one if you do not see very well. 
The woman in the speech admits that there are mistakes happening in the current voting system, but she does not think that it would get better for the voters by using computers, because many people are not used to new technologies.Those would make mistakes in voting because would not understand how to use the computer.

The text also points out that it is really inefficient that people have to count up the votes one by one. It is nearly impossible that no counting mistake happens because of human error. Computers would do this faster and without any mistakes.
The speecher is not sure if computers would really do a better job than humans. She points out, that computers are still a humen invention and if there would be a fault in a programme, the mistake would be extremely worse than only one false count.

Finally, the text tells that other risky processes like banking transactions are done with computer systems and there are no trust issues.
But the contrahent in the speech points out that voting is only done once in every two years, which would be too less to improve the computer system as it was done all over the years with other computer programmes.
