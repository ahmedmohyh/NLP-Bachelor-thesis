Computers are easy to use, but only for those who know how. A lot of people in our days are affraid of technology and refuse to ever touch a computer. There are also the ones who can't afford a computer. 
Yes, humans make faults. It simply isn't possible to count all votes without a miscount. But we also make faults when programming a computer. And one miscounted ballot is by far not as bad as a misprogrammed computer. The computer will affect thousands of votes when only single ones are affected by the counting by hand system.
According to the article we also use computer programms for data traiding and money transfers. But these programms are heavily optimised because they are used that frequently, every second to be speciffic. Voting only happens all two years in the USA. So finding all flaws of a computer would take a very long time.
One last argument is that we do get a physical evidence of what has been voted. Thus a recount would be possible, even though it would get very expensive.
