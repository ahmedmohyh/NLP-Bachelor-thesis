The discussion about voting systems is always an ongoing topic, especially in a digitalized world. A lot of people, espacially the young ones and the ones who aren't afraid to use technology want a computerized voting system. But what happens with the old people who don't understand our technology or the ones who are handycapped and also can't use them, should their vote not be counted because of computers?
A computerized voting system wouldn't equalizie people the same as the traditional one. Lack of finances, misunderstandings and other problems seem to be the major problem here. There ar a lot of people in the world who can't afford computers, tablets or other technical devices. America is not an exception. For examplem the homeless ones it would be very difficult to share their vote - their oppinion. And it's the duty of a democratic state to listen and respect the right, the vote of each and every citizen.
On the other hand who can guarantee that computers won't make mistakes? Aren't they also programmed by humans? Wouldn't it be much worse if the computer was programmed wrong and would change every vote people entered in the computer, than if a normal person counted a few wrong? 
And for the ones who rely on our daily computer technology for example with their banking transactions. It wasn't always like that, in the beginnig their were huge mistakes, the programs weren't working yet, the computers didn't get the necessary upgrades, a lot of people lost their money.
This shouldn't happen with our votings especially not if we vote once a year national wide and every 4 years our president. Be on the safe side, choose the traditional voting system.
