In the United states there are problems with the current voting system. In the traditional way the people are voting by hand. This could cause problems like voting for the wrong name. Other problems include poor eyesight of people. They could easily mark the wrong person.

The new system will replace the traditional voting system into a modern way by letting the people vote with the computer. This would make the job of Officials way more easy, becous they won't be counting every vote one by one.

But there is also a negative side of the new system. There are many people who don't understand this new system, becous they have never used it before. They could easily mark the wrong person, althought they didn't knew they marked this person. In rare cases the computer could have an error miscount. If these problems make their appearence, there will be even bigger problems.
