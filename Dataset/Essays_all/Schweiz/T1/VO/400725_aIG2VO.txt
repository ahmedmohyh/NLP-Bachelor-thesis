The major point of the hearing was, that the computers are also programmed by human, so it's not sure they have no mistakes. If there's an error during the counting and thousands of votings are deleted, a recount is nearly unpossible because the votings aren't available in physic stuff. If they're deleted once, they are gone forever. You also have to think about the elderly voters who may not be able to manage a computer or maybe don't even have one at home. For them it would be hard to vote, at least much harder then to make a cross next to a name. And that's the point the autor of the text didn't think of. He (or she) only thought about how great this system would be. He wrote how less mistakes would happen as we can see in the e-banking system. At the beginning of that, there were mistakes too! But with the time, they managed to solve them. And that's the point. If you use the voting system only once or twice a year, it wouldn't be used often enough to solve every small problem (caused by human of course). So it's not sure at all, that they are really no mistakes made, because the computer only makes things, that it were told by human.
