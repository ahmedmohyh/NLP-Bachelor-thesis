In the United States the traditional voting system is still in use today but a lot of people are not content with this voting system. They think that a computer voting system would be much better. In the following essay these two systems will be discussed more closely.

Many people feel as if the traditional voting sytem is ineffiecient and takes too long. There are high risks of either marking the wrong candidate for the people with poor eyesight since the names are written very closely or the counting at the end being incorrrect since everything must be counted by humans. Now some people think that the computer voting system can solve these problems: They say that the usage would be much easier since people can just go ahead and click their candidate and there will also be a zooming option. This can reduce the problem of voting for the wrong candidate. In addition to this the votes do not have to be counted by humans but the computer can do the voting and very quickly.

However there are also disadvatages to the comptuerized voting some people say. For some voting can become harder since they maybe do not own a computer or some elderly people may not understand how it should work since they are not used to it. Others also say that if humans make mistakes while counting that may be a small amount and it can easily be found out, but if the computer is programmed wrong then there might be a chance that the computer counts incorrectly and some of the data could go lost as well. Lastly some people find that installing a computerized voting system is usless since there are only 2 votes per year and they do not find it necessary.

There are many advatages and disadvatages to installing a computer voting system. The computer might be faster and more efficient but there are still risks of it being programmed badly and losing some of the votes.
