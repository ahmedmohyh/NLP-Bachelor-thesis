The woman talked about, that computers would not be better than humans. That you should think that it would be easier for the people, which use often a computer, but what is with the people, witch do not now, how to use a computer?
She also asked, if computers are better to count the votes, as human errors, because computers are programmed by people, witch can also make misatkes, but this would be a bigger problem, because humans may do not count a few votes, but the computer would not count tousends.
Another point she talked about was that offices etc. use the system daily, but you can only vote all two years in the U.S.A. and twice a year in some gouverments, so it's even more possible, that there could be some mistakes, and it should use a long time to change the system.

In contrast, the text talks about that there could be some faults in the programm of the computer, but other offises like banks use the systems every day. Also, that human make misstakes while they are counting was written about. Another point was, that some people with poor eyesight easily mark the wrong name, because they have to find them on a large sheet of paper containing many names.
