The Speaker says, that computer thechnology is not as good as we think. He also tells us, that for people like us, its easy to use a computer, because we use it nearly every day in our lifes. But there are also people, who dont know how to use a computer. In this case, the speaker talks about fear of technology. There are many old people in the USA. And they dont even know how to use a touchscreen or a mouse. 
Critics say that there are to many counting errors in the traditional system. Because every official needs to count up thousends of votes one by one.
The speaker absoulutely disagrees with this. For him, this is the main problem with the computers. If there is for example a human error in a computer program, the computer could delete thousands of votes. And cause there is no physical paper, we cant remove the mistake and the votes are lost, And this would defintely be more expensive than the recounts of the officials, if there is a detected counting mistake. And there are only a few votes a year (all 2 years national and 1-2 times in certain states), so it wouldnt even be profitable.
The speaker votes clear against compuerized voting systems and their usage.
