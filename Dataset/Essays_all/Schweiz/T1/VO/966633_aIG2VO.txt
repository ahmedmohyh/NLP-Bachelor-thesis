Both, the text and the speech, talk about pros and cons of the traditional and computerized voting system. While the text is more about the pros of computerized voting, the lady from the speech talks about all the cons of it. The text says that traditional voting is very inefficient. It takes very long to count all votes to come to a result. With the computer it would be much easier because technology is able to count them way quicklier. And because there are some many votes to count it can often lead to miscounts. Using the computer there are less miscounts. They also talk about the advantage for people with bad eyesight. Because there are so many candidates on just one large sheet people easily vote for the wrong candidate because they don't see that they put their mark at the wrong place. With computers, this problem would be slolved. Also the text says that nowadays everything is computerized and so should the voting system be. But the lady from the speech says that the traditional ay is much better. She points out that there are many people who are not used to work with computers and they would also vote for the wrong person. So there would still be people who vote for th wrong candidate, just the group of people would change. She knows that there are counting errors with the traditional way but she says that amount of miscounted votes is much smaller. If there is an error in the computer system there can be thousands of misounts. Also it is by far more difficult to work those errors out than it is in for example a bank. The website of a bank is used daily and if there are any errores you can work them out and the problem is solved. So there were errors in the beginning but there are no more now. With votting it is a little bit different because it just happens every two years. So the system has to work and if it doesn't there is a huge problem that has to be solved quickly. And two years later there can be a new problem.
