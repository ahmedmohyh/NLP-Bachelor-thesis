The speeker has an other opinion about the topic as the textwriter. You can say that the speeker has the opinion the other way around. He not think that current systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. He thinks thats it is different (the whole thing). Traditional voting leads to a wrong canditate says the textwriter. This is also wrong because traditional voting is an important thing in every bodys life. The old voting system is much better than the new one. The argument that they rely heavily on people to count the votes is not relevant. The whole thing is not that risky. It is save. The old stystem is more confident that the new one because you spend more time to write and you do not just click on the computer. It is important to keep the tradition and do not change everything everytime.
