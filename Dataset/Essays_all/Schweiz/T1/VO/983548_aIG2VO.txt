The text that we read was pro computer. It said that elections on paper are more likely to be miscounted, or that some people vote for the wrong candidate because the boxes are so small in contrary to the papers they get. another argument for the computers is that a lot of people trust them more because they are used on a daily basis and work perfectly. 
The text that we heard was against electrical voting. they argumented, that some persons just couldn`t afford them, are afraid to use or don`t know how to use them. that wouldn`t improve anything it would just cause people to not vote anymore. Another point is that computers are designed by humans, which implies that there are mistakes in them, because humans make mistakes. it would be way worse if there is an error in a computer system, than just counting one paper incorrectly. the system could count thousands wrong and no one would notice. it could also happen, that a computer system erases elections and they would be lost forever. Another thing is that most computer systems still need to improve. they would have to test them, so why should they not just stick to the paper which they are familiar to and know how they work?
