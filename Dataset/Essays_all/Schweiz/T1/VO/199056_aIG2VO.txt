Both the talk and the text are about the traditional voting system in the USA. However, they take two different side. The text states that a change to a computerized system is necessary but on the other hand, the women who was giving the talk argues that such a massive change could lead to a lot more challenges that are harder to solve. She accepts that a computerized voting sytem would possibly make it easier for people who know a lot about computers and technology and how to use them but the what happens to all the people who don't? She believes that many US citizens would be discouraged from voting because of these technological challenges. Another problem is that some don't even have access to a computer and therefore, you would somehow have to  get them access to one which will probably cost money. The author of the written text sees human errors as a huge problem of the traditional voting system. One example is the inaccurate counting of votes. The women from the talk has a counter argument ready for this statement: Computer are made by humans, programmed by humans, so how can we know that they are any better? She also explains that a computer bug could be a lot worse. In the traditional voting system, only a few votes are usually miscounted. She believes that a computer error could lead to an inaccuracy of thousands of votes. The text also states that the fear of change is not reasonable because in today's world we already trust into computer technology that works with highly sensitive information. The women however has another opinion. She thinks that an implementation of such a system would take a long time and a lot of tries and errors until it works perfectly what they cannot afford with somethhing like elctions.
