This article is based on the differences between technological votes and votes done by hand.

One of the major problem is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. This mistake can happen because they have to search the name of their candidate on a huge paper and make a small mark next to that person. But this mistakes can happen with the new voting system also. Because they do not go well with the technology. Most of the people who can vote are not the technology-generation, so they can be desturbed by the fact, that so many people can vote at the same time. Nowadays the most of the votings in the United States are done at the computer. But do the computers a better job than the people who count the votes by hand? Clearly, every person make mistakes but why the comupter doesn't? He is created and installed by people and the voting is only used one to two times a year, so the technology isn't perfect.

The gouvernment and the people should give it a though because both can make mistakes and with the computer the whole voting is faster.
