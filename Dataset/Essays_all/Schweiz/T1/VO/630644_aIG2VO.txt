The presentation concludes that letting computers count votes can cause fatal errors which could lead to wrong results in counting the votes(which isn´t true) and that people, mostly the elders would have problems to use them. Because to tap on a name is much harder then marking something with a pen. So computer based voting would make it impossible to vote for people with an electrophobia and there wouldn´t be any physical votes so if the computers crash all the votes would be lost(does noone in this company know how harddisks works?...). By counting it by hands the mistakes would be far less fatal and there is workspace for more then tousand peoples which get payed by taxes. The presentation is all about "never touch a running system" and that humans should trusth the state to count the votes correct and not in someones favor.
