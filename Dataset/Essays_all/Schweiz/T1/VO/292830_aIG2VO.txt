Computer Technology

Peoples meaning on computers differ widely. While some say, they are more efficient, much faster and securer, other think they make bigger errors and aren't more secure at all. The text above is about the vote counting system in the United States of America. Until now, people had to cross the Name of the person on the paper they voted for. But a new computer system is a new possibility. Techniciens say, that it would be easier to use, most of all for people with eye problems. It's true, computers are faster, but a even a good system needs time to get efficient and people to get used to it. Also, of course machines don't make as much errors as humans do, but if they aren't working well, they cause much bigger problems than humans. On one hand, humans really aren't perfect and can easily miss a vote, but on the other hand, if a computer has an error, it could easily miss over a thousand votes. And last but not least, the counting system would be used only for twice or three times a year per state, so does it make sence to change the system?
