In the text and the presentation they talked about a non-traditional way of voting in this case with computers and if it is more efficient and accurate. They mentioned the problems but also the opportunities of this kind of voting.
Due to the difference in age, job and wealth not everyone can afford a computer or knows how to use one. This could lead to a high rate of people which are afraid to vote because they do not understand the technology. But there are also oppertunities for the elderly people for example that they can read the names clearly and do not vote for the wrong candidate due to their bad eyesight. Also with the traditional way of voting the rate of misscount is very high and this leads to expensive recounts. This could be minorised with the computer-voting. But in case of an error the damage could be much worst because the informations are not written on a paper. Also the technologies have to be improved over several years before they can be used properly.
