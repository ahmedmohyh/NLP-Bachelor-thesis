The speaker of the presentation admitted that the traditional voting got some problems, but she thinks that computerized voting may not be better. In the text it is said that people with poor eye sight can easily mark the wrong candidate, cause there are very much names on a big list. This results in missvoting wich would be eleminated if using computersized voting, since the touch-screen technology makes the voting much easier. And this is the point where the speaker of the presentation does not have the same opinion. He says that there would just be a new group, who would not be able to vote, wich would be the people that do not know much about computers. For people that are used to computers the voting system wouldn t be any challenge, but people who don t know how to use one, would not be able to vote anymore, because the new voting system would be to complicated. A other problem the speaker sees is that the computerized voting would still be made by humans, so if a human would do a mistake it could result in a desaster. With the traditional voting system the only thing that could happen is, that they forget to count some votes, but a problem with the computersized voting could result in maybe a cancellation of thousands of votes. The idea of the text is good, but it is risky aswell, too risky to introduce it for a thing that happens only all 2 years, because it would take much time before the system would really work.
