The normal voting system in the USA is being questioned by many people. Experts say, that the regular voting system ist too inaccurate and that a computerized system would be much better. For example, in the ordinary voting system, officials must count all ballots. If an error is detected, those officials have to do a long and expensive recount. The computerized voting system is way easier to handle and it doesn't make such mistakes. Experts say aswell, that the comuterized system is easier to handle, because one can easily choose the name of the candidate on a big touchscreen, instead of searching this name on a list. But there are aswell many experts, who don't agree with this statement. It's hard to tell, that a computerized voting system is any better that the regular one. For example, people, who aren't used to computers will have problems with using those computers. And the counting system makes maybe less errors, but if such an error would appear, the whole counting would collapse. And last, but not least, computers are used every day and are upgraded daily, but such a voting is only once in two years, so it's much harder to upgrade and make this system better. Those experts doubt, that computers would do a better job.
