"Voting"
One of the main problems of the modern voting in the USA is the use of the computer. Not every american is used to work with a computer. This fact might leed to accidentally wrong voting and some people will be discouraged by voting. So the electors quote will decrease by the use of computers.
An other strong argument is the errors which are made by the count of the votes. As we know as a human, it is not difficult to make a fault by counting. Human errors leed to little faults in the total amout of the votes.If a man-made computer makes an error, we have totally wrong soutions of the voting, so the error of a computer has a much bigger effect. 
Of course computerprogramms for the elections need to be improved. This is a really difficult task because national elections only take place every two year. So the computercontrolled ellections in the USA run on a long way to be part of everyday-life. At the moment it is still to risky to use them for the national elections.
