The main topic of this text and the record were the voting system in the United States. The Question is if it would be more efficient and trustworthy if we would use computerized voting systems. 
First of all they said that this kind of voting would'nt be fair because not everyone uses a computer or atleast has one. There are many people who cant afford to buy a computer. This would help the richer part of the population in the United States. There are also some people who have a fear of technology and thats why they don't want to vote like this. On the other hand, in the text they mention that it would be far easier to vote because of an easy-to-use touch-screen. In the text they say that human mistakes do make it a lot more complicated and the votes have  to be recount. But when we use a computerized system which is programmed by someone and it has a error in it or something produces an error, we can't recount the votes. They're lost. But computer technology is already used in banking systems. Thats why the text says that it would work really well. 
To summarize, there are many pros and cons for the computerized voting. Thats why the text and the record have different meanings like this.
