First up I will start summarizing the texts arguments and compare them with the ones in the presentation. So the text is very different to the presentation.
They start up by saying that todays voting system in the United States are very inefficient and not often very accurate. 
Why is that so? Well, first up the people who are voting most likely choose the wrong candidate because they need to find their person first on a large sheet of paper and make a small mark to it. 
On the other side those people, the officials, who are counting the ballots will have some problems aswell since they have to count every single ballot and write (or mark them on the computer) the content down. There might be some inaccurate votings then. Obviously by using a computer these problems wouldn't happen because they are using a much more efficient way and it's a lot quickier. 
Therefore the presentation is against those computerized voting systems. But why? Well one of the arguments is that people who aren't used to computers will have a hard time. Some might even cast a wrong vote and this will be tragic for the people. One of the other arguments is that even humans make mistakes, computers are developed by these. So let's say if an official just counted one of the ballots wrong, that wouldn't be that tragic but if a computer has an error; this would lead to more than thousands of misscalculations. 
Are computers really reliable for a voting system? 
Well to be honest both aspects are some kind of right, but with the technology these days I guess there wouldn't be any problems of doing a computerized voting system, you could implement a search button and search for the one you want to vote so the problem with casting a wrong vote wouldn't be there. Obviously you could also take your vote back and vote for another candidate if you made some kind of mistake by voting for the wrong people.
