Voting

In the following essay I am going to write about voting. The different voting systems and problems which may can accure.

The first sentence refers to the Interview in which the female said that human make mistakes. Counting the ballot is a problem and mistakes are happening fast. Many people want to replace the old voting systems with more efficient and modern computerized voting systems. 
Computer systems are easier to count out the ballots. Because the computers are made my humans it is possible that there is an error in the systeme. If there is an error in the computer system a recount would be impossible. These informations disagree with those from the text above. In the text there will be no problems with the computer systems. But reality is different.  

For older people with poor eyesight computers could be a solution but if they do not use computers daily it would be difficult for them to work with all the new gadgets. People which use the computer daily have no problems with the new technology and voting system. 

Some people thinkt that computer voting systems are worthless because there are only two votings each year.
