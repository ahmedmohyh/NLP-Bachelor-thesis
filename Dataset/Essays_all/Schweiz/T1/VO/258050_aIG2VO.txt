The text and the audiodat talked about a new voting system in the United States.
In the text they think that the problem of misscounting ballots wouldn't be if they use a computer system. But the women told us that there are lot of other problems with computers. For example that there are a lot of people who doesn't know how to use a computer and that there can also be technology mistakes. If the computer was programmed wrong there will be not only a few ballots missing, but thousands are just deleted and they are impossible to recount. 
A good argument of the text is that computers are also used in banking transactions and in communication of highly sensitive information. To this the women said that the voting system was improved since the last two hundret years and this makes her hardy to believe that the new computer system is as good as the old one. Another thing she manchened was that computers are programmed by humans, so there are still humans mistakes.
The text writes about the long process of the counting system, but if there are thousands missing ballots, the whole voting has to be done again.
