While the text claims that a computerized voting system would be easier to use for citizens the woman in the talk explains that this may be true for people using the computer often but not for people who do not do so or cannot afford one. These people may then accidently vote for the wrong candidate or may even be discouraged from voting by an introduction of such a voting system. 
The text also raises the issue that there may be miscalculations in the numbers of votes as the counting is done by humans. A computerized system would remove the possibility of human error as the computer would count all the votes. In the talk however the woman says that the human error could also occur in a computerized system as the computers are programmed by humans and on top of that an error in a computer program would lead to errors causing much bigger faults in calculations.
Opposed to that the text says that we also trust computers to do banking transactions. But these systems are used daily while voting takes place just twice a year. Also they did not work as smooth as they do today from the beginning on they had to be improved many times over the years.
