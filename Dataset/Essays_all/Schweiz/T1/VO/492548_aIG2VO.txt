In the speech the woman is against the computerized voting. She still thinks that the traditional voting is a better solution. 
One point that she mentions is that people who don't use computers often will make mistakes, because they fear technology. In the text where the author supports the computerized voting and is against the traditional voting he says that people will also make mistakes in the traditional voting, because they have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names. For people who have an poor eysight or maybe old peole it's difficult to mark the right name. In the computerized voting the people have only to touch the candidate's name on the screen. 
The second point in the text which supports the computerized voting is that officials have to count up the votes one by one, which will take a lot of time. So it's sure, that they will make mistakes while dealing with thousands of ballots. And if a mistake is detected, they have to recount all the ballots. The text says also that with the computerized voting the vote counting can be done quickly and automatically by the computers. In the speech the woman mentions that computers are also done by people. They are just programs which someone has made. So it's also possible that the computer has an error. And if the computer has an error, there's not just one mistake, there can be thousands of ballots that are miscounted. The next point is that computers has always to be improved by people. With the computerized voting this computerized voting program will be only used once a year. That's far to less to improve the program.
