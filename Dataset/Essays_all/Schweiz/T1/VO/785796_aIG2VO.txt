Traditional voting is more and more replaced by computerized voting. But this can also bring problems; many people aren't used to computers or can't afford it. The text says that computerized voting have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology, so it's much more easier to use computerized voting. But if a person isn't used to computers, this person can't know how to cast a vote or how to magnify a name. Another point is that humans make mistakes and computers are programmed by humans. It can be that a whole group of ballots is permanently removed or that the program misses to count some ballots. The text says that the proplem is the traditional voting, not the computerized voting, because they have to count votes one by one and it's almost inevitable that they make mistakes. The record says that with the computer, recount is impossible. The text says that the problem is the traditional voting, because the recount is long and expensive and computerized voting would remove the possibilit of human error. But much people trust computer technology every day like in banking transactions; this is also said in the text. But to make this program so trustful, humans had to improve and improve this program just to the moment it works properly. Another point is that in America they vote once every two years and in other countries twice a year, so it isn't a very big problem.
