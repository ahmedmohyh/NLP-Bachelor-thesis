Voting the wrong candidate

The people in the United States can vote every two years. Today they have to use some computers to vote, becaus they think voting by hand could have many faults and in the end the wrong candidate wins. Because if you have to find your favorite candidate on a big list wih many names, faults could happen very fast.
An other problem is counting the votings. If you have to count every single vote by hand, the chance to make faults ist much bigger. With computers counting goes very fast and simpel. That is why they vote by computers now. But can we trust the computers? Computer systems are made by human and human make faults. An other problem is, how can people vote by computer, if they don't afford anyone? Not everyone knows how to work with an computer. That makes it very easy to make faults too. 
In the end, the big question is, who does it better?
Some people say voting is better by hand, other people say computers do better jobs than human.
We use computers every day, to do banking transactions or other things and we mostly have no problems. 
So why should we not use computers for voting?
