In the text it is said that the most frequent error in elections is that people vote for the wrong candidate. But as the woman in thevoice recording said, when voting on a compter the same error could occur, not for people with bad eyesight, but for people that usually do not use computers or a frightened by this technology. It may even lead to people not voting at all because they are afraid that they wont be able to manage the computers. Another argument of the proposition for the digitalization is that humans make errors and these errors affect the results. But computers are made by humans and therefore can make mistakes too. Furthermore the mistakes computers can make are enormous compared to the one or two votes a human may count wrong. The last point against renewing the old system is that the programs we use for example for banking are used and tested everyday whereas elections happen considerably rarely and it is difficult to test them, which makes it take much longer to discover flaws.
