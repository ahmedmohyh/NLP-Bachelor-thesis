In the text they say that people sometimes accidentally vote for the wrong people because of bad eyes or something else, and with a computer it would be a lot easier. In the hearing example they say that people, who aren't used to computers wouldn't vote anymore and this could lead to a big error. For people using computers daily it would be easy but for the others it would be a lot harder than the traditional system.
They say in the text that people, who have to count the votes will automatically make mistakes, and a computer wouldn't. But in the hearing they say that the program is also developped by humans and if ther's an error in the developping, it wouldn't be a little mistake as in the traditional voting system: It would be a huge mistake. Because of that the writer of the text says that we trust computers in our daily routine; in banks, in communication of highly sensitive information and so on. The speaker says that we used some time until the computers were perfectly programmed and it would also take some time to be good programmed.
It is clear that the writer of the text wants the new voting system and the speaker of the hearing example is against the new system.
