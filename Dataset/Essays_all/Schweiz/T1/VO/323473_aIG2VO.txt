The two texts are more or less about the same topic. Both are talking about the voting systems in the United States. The difference is that the text is in favour for the new voting system and the presentation is rather for the old one. The text says that the old voting system is inefficiant and causes too many mistakes. It's inevitable. In order of that the result is inaccurate because people often pick the wrong candidate and the counters often miscount the ballots.And their consequence is repeat of the vote. for everyone. On the other hand the presentation tells us about the inaccurancy with the new voting system. They doubt that it would get easier or better with the new one because not everyone knows how to use a computer or not everyone can afford a computer. Further doubts are that the programs are made from humans, so of course they have faults too and the consequence could be a loss of thousands of votes or permanently removed votes. In addition, we don't use the voting system often and people are too habited with the technology and trust them blindly. Both the text and the presentation wants to replace their system to the other one and both are not completely for or against their favourite system.
