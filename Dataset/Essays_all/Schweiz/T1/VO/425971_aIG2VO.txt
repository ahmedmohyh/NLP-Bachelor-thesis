The woman from the presentation has the opposite opinion to the text. She doesn't say that the traditional system is the perfect system and it doesn't contain fault but in her opinion the computerized system doesn't solve the problems.

First of all, she explains that the computerized system only is good for people who are used to computers. The text says it is easier for people to use computers to vote. In the womans opinion they forgot the people who are not used to computers and the people who can't afford computers. The fear of technology would be a big problem in the computerized voting system.

Secondly, the text says counting the votes by hand is a bad idea because it is nearly impossible to avoid mistakes. In the presentation the woman says that the vote counting would be made by programs which are made by humans. Therefore, you are not able to avoid human errors in programs either. If the counting is made by hand there are only a few mistakes which have not a very big impact. However, if a computer makes an error it could lead to thousand of wrong results.

At the end, she explains that the traditional system is used for years. In this long time of use the system got better and better because the people learned from their errors and they got used to it.
