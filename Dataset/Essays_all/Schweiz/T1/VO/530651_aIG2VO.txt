There is the question with which system people have to vote. 
According this subject there are to two primary systems. The first one is based on traditionaly voting, in brief voting by hand.
The other system is the way with the computer. 

Critics of the copmputer system say that there are also people who do not use the computer as a basically instrument. So it is difficult for those and it can easy happen that they vote for the wrong candidate. Additionally, they think that also the computer system makes errors beacause basicaly it was made by human and human make errors. That is why they want the old system of voting. 

The other side arguee for the system with a computer.  They say that with a computer it works faster. Because this way they do not have to count all the votes by person. However they think that it needs time to introduce this system and it can not work by beginning.
