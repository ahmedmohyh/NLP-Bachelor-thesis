The person speaking had a completely different opinion. To her it is highly doubtful that it is a good idea to replace the old voting system. She thinks computers aren't that easy to use and especially people that don't use computers everyday or can't afford them or people that are even scared could really struggle with a new system based on computer technology. She also mentions that computers and computer programms don't have to be flawless. They're programmed by humans so there could be far more serious errors than some miscounted votes. She states that if an error occurs on a programm there could be thousands of miscounts and a little chance to recount everything because there's no real physical evidence of the votes except for the statistics on the computers. Votes could even be permanently removed if things really go wrong. Another argument of hers was that voting programms shouln't be compared to  computer programms because in america you only vote once every two years so they're not as frequently used as banking programms which are used on a daily basis and improved all the time because flaws can quickly be analyzed and corrected.
