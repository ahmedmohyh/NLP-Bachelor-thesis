Both sources have the same problem, the inefficience of the traditional voting system in America , These arguments are like in the text. But the teacher thinks computers are made by humans and when humans make misstakes, computers could have some programming errors. And when a human makes a misstake there would be like a few votes but when the computer does it, it would be terrible. But haters would say the ebanking system is pretty safe and hasn't any problems. But the teacher says the ebanking system is daily used and improved so much over the years. 
But the national votings are once all two years and when they fail yeah nothing to add.

These arguments with the errors weren't showed in the text and that is the big difference between them. The text is for a new system and the teacher who spoke is against it. I personally like the arguments of the teacher more, because he had destroyed the best argument with the comparing to the ebanking system. 

Sorry, in this task i unfortunately did'nt understand the first part of the listening task.
