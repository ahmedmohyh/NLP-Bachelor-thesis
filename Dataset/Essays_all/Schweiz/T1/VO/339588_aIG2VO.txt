Due to the increasing number of votes and ballots it gets more difficult to make a vote without any errors. So the computer technology which already helps us to make our daily life much easier may replace the inaccurate counting of votes. 
Firstly, it is much more convenient for older people because they only have to touch the name they are in favour of and cannot mark the wrong name. They also can have the computer magnify the name for easier viewing. 
Secondly,the calculation is based on a machine that hardly never counts wrong. Furthermore, it removes the possibility of human errors and offers a much cheaper and easier way of voting. 
But in contrast, computers are built by humans and this is why they sometimes crash down or make an enourmous misscounting of more than 1000 votes.
Another factor to be considered is certainly the use and common of computers in our society. People who often use their useful piece of technology are common doing something serious on it. But what about the others? They have never handled with a computer and are not used to do huge opportunities they can give us and might have a fear of technology such as older people.
All in all, there are remarkable arguments on both sides but with a trustable programme it could really help us to remove errors in votes. They have to be improved and one day we all can count on computerized systems which will convince with its safe and trustful casts of votes.
