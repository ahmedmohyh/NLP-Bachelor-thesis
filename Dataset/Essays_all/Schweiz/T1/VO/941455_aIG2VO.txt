The two sources, text and hearing, were both made with compleatly different points of view. They said in the text that the voting system in the US is inaccurate and leads to a damage of an election if it is closely contested. To summorize the text: They say its better to use modern technology like computers to vote. For people with eyeproblems it will be a easyer way to vote beacause of touch screen and so on but in the presentation they eliminate this argument by bringing up the point, that people who are not used to use computers, will make mistakes and accidently vote for the wrong person. 
In the text is mentioned that there can occure misscountings while counting by hand. But in the Presentation they also confront this arcument with the fact, that if the computer makes a mistake, there will be no physical material to recount the votes. In the worst case scenario, every thing will be gone/deleted. It is clear that where humans are will occure errors but a computer isn't better as the human who uses it or programmed it.
Even if there are problems with miscountings and misunderstanding of the traditional way of voting, computervoting will be risky in many ways.
In the text it is said that it is heavy to count thousends of thousends voting sheets, but the hearing sais: these votings are twice in four years and this shouldent be a big problem. There is one last argument in the text saying, that we have to give it a thought beause we use computer technology everyday, even to make banking transactions.
So think about it and choose.
