Critics say that the traditional voting is inefficient and leads to a false counting of votes. Would a computerized voting system make the voting systems more efficient and cut out mistakes?


People have to find the name of their candidate on a long list full of names, and mark the candidate they want to win. It's easy to make the mark on the wrong name, especially when you have a poor eyesight or are not concentraded enough. 
The counting is done by human hands and that can lead to a big miscounting. They go through every ballot and count one by one. Mistakes can easily occure. This errors are often not controlable and can lead to a big mistake in the whole voting and election. 
A computer system would erase this errors. To vote online you would have to click on the candidates name, people who have poor eyesight can magnify the text on the screen to not make errors. The voting would be done automatically, so no errors could occure. All banks use reliable computer systems and that is a good sign and a good argument for computerized systems. But is this really true? Would a computerized system be better?
People who don't use computers often, or can't even afford one would have a little problem and maybe also be discouraged from voting. 
Also the computerized system is programmed by humans. So who can guarantee that the system wouldn't have an error and so change the whole result. Banks systems didn't work properly at the beginning either. er
