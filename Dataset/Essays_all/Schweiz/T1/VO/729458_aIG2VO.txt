First of all not every man and woman in the United States has a computer at home. Maby it's because they are uncomfortable with handleling technic instruments or they just can't afford them. 
Then, errors can appear, that wolud be really bad and there would be much trouble connected with this. With the old-fashoned systems the worst thing, wich cold happen,wold be a misscounting or someting like this. Thas much less heavy than an error.
A point could be, that bankes are trusting to this systemes every day for really important moneytransactions and goverments for communiction of really important news and informations. This systems are used every day, a long while now and it took much time to be able to rely on this computersystems.
The voting system are used once in a year, so it don't has the time to get better from day to day by using it. It would take something like sixhundret years to be able to get efficent used.
At last but not least, the systems are programmed by humans anyway, and there it wouldn't be guaranteed, that human-errors won't appear anymore.
