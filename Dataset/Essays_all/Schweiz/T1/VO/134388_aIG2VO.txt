Both textes, the spoken and the written one, tell about the voting system of the United States and how it can be improved. They tag many diffrent arguments.
The author from the written text wants to replace the old system by a voting system based on a software. He tells us that people who have to count every single vote are way too inefficient an cause too many faults. On the opposite theres the woman who says that computers can make faults too and when they do so its much heavier because the computers lose all votes after they have counted them.
A big problem of a system based on computers are, as the madame says, the people in the US who don't own one or don't know how to use it correctly. So it doesn't make sense to implement a new system if not anybody could use it.
The last point is the reference to other computer softwares in our everday-life like e-banking systems or even social network.The argument is, that they work perfectly every day but they didn't work really good when they started.
So in the end the written text wants to reform the system, the spoken one definitly not and both textes have really good argument to be for or against this improvement.
