The woman says that it is no problem to vote on the computer for people who are used to do things on the computer. But for those who are not used to work with computers or can not afford a computer it is difficult to vote. They do not have trust in the new voting system wich leads to that they do not go voting. In the text it says that the advantages of this system is that people can not vote for the wrong thing. On the paper there stand many things and it is easy to get confused. On the computer it is clear and you can almost not vote for the wrong person. The women also says that the computer does not count better than a human. When a human counts and he counts wrong than maybe the result is just one or two votes away from the right. But if the computer system has a problem/error 1000 of votes get lost. This refuses to the text, because there it says that because there are so many ballots, it is almost inevitable that they make mistakes. And to recount the votes it takes a lot of time and is also expensive. The computer system would remove the possibility of human error because all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically.
