It is doubted that computers are a better alternative than humans, when it comes to counting votes. Some critics say that relying on people counting votes in to risky, yet computer programms are also engineerd by humans. If a person is counting votes it might be possible that they're going to make a few mistakes, but if a programm is wrongly made, the mistakes could be immense and no one would even notice. It's true that computers improve and become better at avoiding mistakes, but votings are only a few times a year, it would take up too muvh time for the to become reliable. Comparing banking transactions and voting programms isn't very accurate since both of them are very different. banking transactions being technological is much more neeeded that voting software, since there are millions of people in the United Staates that want to transaction their money every day where as voting only take up the time of say 20-40% of the population. 
Using a the computer and the promgrammthem would also be a problem since not everyone knows how to deal with one. The cost of all this new technology would be an other issue. Buying computers, programming and improving the needed software and hiring expirienced professionals is all very expensive.
