One arguement is, that current voting systems have their problems. They lead to inaccurate counting of votes, so there is a lack used by human failure. So far the text and the hearpart think same. But if we would replace the voting system by trustworthy computerized voting systems we wouldn't have solve the problems. Then there are people who have fear of technology and beacause of that the can't handle a computer. Or there are people who aren't that modernizied like we are. They also can't use a computer. So there would be a second problem to solve according to the hearpart.
Another aspect is, the computerized voting systems would be based by a program who would be written by a human. So there is again a lack of human failure. That means the computer won't make it better, maybe just worse.

In the text, there is the aspect, that some people say it s too risky to implement compicated voting technology nationwide, and ther is the disarguement that this individuals trust ohter computerized systems like banking transactions or communication per apps. But this wont change the aspect, that this programs  , better these systems, were used daily and they are more efficient. But the voting just happens ones per two years. So can we fully trust them if we just use it all two years? The hearpart added, that if there would be a programm failure, the votes could get misscountet and thousands of votes could be marked wrong.
