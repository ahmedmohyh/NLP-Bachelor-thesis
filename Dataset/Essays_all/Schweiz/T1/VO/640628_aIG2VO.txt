Both textes explain the problems of the voting systems in the USA and what we could make better. One solution  is the computerized voting. This is more efficient than the current voting systems. But in the text we heard, the critics said that it gives also problems with the computerized voting. For those people, who don't understand the computer technology very well, it is very difficult to make a right vote. But for these people who understand the technology very well, it isn't a problem. Then it has very much positive aspects. With the computerized voting it doesn't give so much mistakes when they count, but on the old voting systems it can give very fast a mistake when they count. Also it is possible that we vote for a wrong name, when a person don't see very well, because it gives only a small mark next to the name. But with the computerized voting it doesn't happen such mistakes, because  these voting machines have an easy-to-use touch-screen. So for  young people who understand the technology well, the computerized voting is much better than the old voting systems. The old voting systems are inefficient and it gives a lot of mistakes.
