A computer voting can be easy for people that are trusted with working on a computer. It can be hard to vote on a computer for people that don't know how to use a computer. This people often have fear of techonlogy and wrote wrong.
A computer is programmed by a human being. The ussage that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error is wrong, because the mistakes of a system that is programmed with faughts can be much bigger than some mistakes of counting the votes. Another problem is that the programms of banking transactions are used daily, the voting system is only used once every 2 years. The programms of a bank are updated every day by day and the faughts in the programm systems are little. A voting system is hard to develop witout mistakes. Nobody can find the mistakes because nobody can test the system to find the faughts. Every person in the USA must vote with this system. I'm sure that one person will find a faught or a bug is the voting system.
