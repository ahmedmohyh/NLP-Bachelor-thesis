If the voting systems get completely computerized many people will get in big trouble. For example there are persons who can't afford computers or aren't used to them. Because of their fear of technology they may vote for the wrong candidates or don't even vote. It wouldn't solve the problem of accidentally voting for the wrong canditate - maybe the people with poor eyesight will catch the right, but many of the technolohie-strangers will not. 
An other point that's mentioned is that computer programs are human made. So, if humans make mistakes by counting the votes, why won't they make mistakes by raising the program? If there's just one little failure in the system a tousand of votes could be removed or miscounted.
Now you may say that we trust other complex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information. But these systems are used daily and heavily. The computerized system will be used once every two years and even the baking transaction had problems as it started. If the computerized voting system would have problems our whole country would stuck in problems. So why risk it?
