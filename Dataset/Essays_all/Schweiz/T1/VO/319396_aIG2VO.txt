What's about people who don't know about using a computer? There are people who have a fear of technology. Especially older people don't know how to use electronic gadgets. They may would press on the false button or the false name, what would turn the voting result into nonsense. Computer systems are also programmed by humans. So there can be also human errors, especially in voting systems, because they are used only once in two years. If you compare voting systems with banking systems you see a difference: Banking systems are used heavily, so they are checked out quit good and they have many updates. Voting systems are used only once in two years, so they aren't checked out and nobody will expect an error. That could be followed by a big political unsureness. What I want to say:The arguments in the presentation are the real opposite of that one's in the text I had to read.
