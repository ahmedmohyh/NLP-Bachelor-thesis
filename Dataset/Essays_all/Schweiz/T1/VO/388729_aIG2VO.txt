In the presentation they say, that a lot of people aren`t used to use copmuters. There are also people, who doesn't like to work with a computer. They are afraid of using technology and get in trouble. Maybe these people won't elect and that is quite bad, because every vote counts and people should give their opinion.
Further they argument, that the electronic votes are also made by humans. So it's possible that there are mistakes in it. The other argument is, that humans elect the false person, because there are so many names on the sheet. Or you count wrong and you have to start an expensive recount.
Next they critic that just a few humans vote the false person, but if a programme is false, a whole election can be destroyed. And if you vote with ballots, there is a phisical prove.
Today a lot of people use online banking systems, which is quite safe. Critics mean that banking systems are used every day and that they have been improved many times. But an electronic election would be used just every two years, so there wouldn't be a lot of possibilities to improve the system and make it safer.
