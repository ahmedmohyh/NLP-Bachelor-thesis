With the traditional voting system, people have to make a small mark next to the name of the candidate, but the ballot contains a lot of names and it is more likely to make a mistake when setting the mark next to the a name. And even if the voters voted right, the officials could count wrong and if the error is detected, it costs a lot to recount the ballots. The counting would happen much quicker by computer.
