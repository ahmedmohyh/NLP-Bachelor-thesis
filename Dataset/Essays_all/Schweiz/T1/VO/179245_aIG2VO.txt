Computerized systems can be very efficient when it comes to voting. For example it happens often that people vote for the wrong candidate, as the names of the candidates apear on a large sheet of paper and can be hard to read. On computerized systems people could use the magnify function for a better sight of the names. But a large amount of these sight-troubled people are elderly people that did not grow up with technology, that system would maybe bring even more difficulties or would even discourage them from voting. The old voting system can be untrustfull, because thousands of people count thousands of gallons so it is normal for human nature that mistakes happen. The process of recounting votes is time consuming and expensive. But if we look at a digital voting system, which is programmed by humans, mistakes can also happen and they are often bigger and worse than with the old voting system. Banking systems are indeed very reliable and work nearly perfectly but these programms are used daily and have gone through a long process of developpement and improvement during the earlier years. As the general voting system is only used once every 2 years, improvement is way more difficult and would appear in larger time intervals. An other problem with a computerized voting system is the financial aspect of the hardware necessary for such a system. Poor people would have problems to even get access to voting and therefore we would make a step backward in developpement of our society, it was a few centuries ago when only the privileged and wealthy people had access and an influance in politics.
