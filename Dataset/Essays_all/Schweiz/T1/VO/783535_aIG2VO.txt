Voting on computers or voting by hand? Some people who are used to computers think different than others who are not used to them. The risk of errors plays a role as well. Generally the fear of technology is the main issue. In the moment voting by hand is the main method.

Computer votings are easy for such persons who are used to them. However these people who are not used to them will probably get in trouble. Especially older people do not know how to use a computer. On the other side the text says that people with poor eyesight will have an advantage on computers because of the easier viewing on them. They just can touch the name of the person they want to vote for. 

Furthermore there can be as well lots of human errors in computer programmes. Imagine, when thousands of votes are wrong and they must be corrected?
Programmes on computers must be improved several times, before they are without any errors. Like banking programmes. 
Text says that voting by hand has also his risks. Some persons must count the sheets one by one. So after thousands of sheets, there can easily happen a mistake. 

To conclude, voting programmes on computers will be used in future, when everybody is used to them.
