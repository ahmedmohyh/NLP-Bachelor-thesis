Although majority of the people today have computers there are still some that aren't used to technology and almost fear it. They would have trouble voting with a new system and rather search their favourite candidate on a large sheet of paper. Because of that they accidently vote for the wrong person. An argument against the traditional voting system is that it's inefficient and the counting of votes often is inaccurate because of human error but humans created computer programmes consequently there could be also human error in it and if there was, it would be way worse. Not just some votes would be counted wrong but whole elections and votings. We use computer programmes for example for banking transactions but those we use daily and in the beginning there has also been trouble with them. And votings only happen once or twice a year.
