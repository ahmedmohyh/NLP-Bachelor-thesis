Its an obvious problem that if elections are inaccurate, they may lead to bigger miscounts and probably the wrong candidate may win. Current voting systems in the USA are critizized to be inefficient so may be they will have to do a revision in that problem. Some people say that computers will have to replace the older voting system. The human counting of votes may be inaccurate and this might lead to problems, especially when it's a tight result. There's also the problem of voting for the wrong candidate by chance. It's a big sheet, with small written names and older people may have problems with that voting. But would it really be a good idea, if we fully relied on computers? Examples in the government show: It is possible to function. But isn't too risky to let all americans vote by computers. Some of them may not know how to use a computer or may have problems with that. And another, by far bigger problem could occur: If there was an error at the computers, there will be huge miscounts which wouldn't concern only a few votes, but a high number.
