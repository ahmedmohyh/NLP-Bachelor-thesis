The two statements are about introducing a computer voting system, because they want a better one and less risky electing system.

In the text they want to introduce a new technologial system. They think that a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong person or people who count the votes make too many mistakes. So a computer voting system would be better, saver and faster.

The other statement says that a computer voting system can be dangereous. Much people are not used to technology and have no experience with computers. For them is much more difficult and they may also vote accidentally for the wrong person. There are many computer errors if a programm is new, so it would take years to make it work without any mistakes. The question if it is worth it when the electing is just all two years.

The two statements disagree with each other. In the text they want to introduce a new technologial voting system. In the other statement they do not want this new system. Both statements want to have the best voting system and the one that does not make any mistakes.
