In the referat, the speaker said that computers will not be the better voting - system. In first, because of the fact that those people who does not use the computer on regular basis or nearly never will have much more problems than with a large sheet. Furthermore, there are peolpe who cannot afford any computer. So, they should be let out of the voting? In the text they are not talking about. They seem to forgot that there is something called poverty (Armut gemeint, falls falsch).
Furthermore, the issues of elderly are also left out. For example, the lower see-capacity. Especially the elderly are having problems with smartphones, tablets or computers reading the letters correctly. But in my opinion this is a low argument. Do the elderly have less problems with reading the letters on a large sheet than on a computer? I doubt it.
The fact, that the counting of million votes needs much time, many employes and a big amount of money which has to be invested on counting the votes is not noticed in the referant and in my mind, an important fact. 
It is time to substitute the voting - system of today. Already a long time ago.
And to be morally correct, instead spending the money for the old voting - system, they could buy a computer for those people who cannot afford one. Or at least, they can give them temporarly one so they can vote.
