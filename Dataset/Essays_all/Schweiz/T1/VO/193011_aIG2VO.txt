If the human voting system or a computerized system would be better is a widely discussed subject. Both of them have positive as well as negative aspects.

The voting system worked by humans is bound to have misscounts and errors. It is what makes us human, making a counting mistake happens very easily while counting thousands of votes by hand. It often happens that a few votes are overseen, which leads to a recount which can take far to long just before an important election.

Computerized voting systems on the other hand are made by humans, which mean they will never be flawless eventhough it's a machine. If there happens a counting mistake in the machine, the consequenses are have a lot bigger impact on the elction, since there is no physical evidence of the votes and the counts can be a lot mor inaccurate, than if some of the votes were overseen by beeing counted individually by man.

Another reason for most of the inaccuracy in the current voting system is that many people accidently vote for the wrong candidate. People with bad eyesight are likely to tick the candidate above or below the actual candidate on the list for the elections.

A big problem with the computerized systems are that many citizens might stop vonting caused by the fear of technology. They don't know how to handle a computer correctly and don't want to vote at all.

Both systems have their flaws in the end it depends on which of them will give the most accurate results for a fair election.
