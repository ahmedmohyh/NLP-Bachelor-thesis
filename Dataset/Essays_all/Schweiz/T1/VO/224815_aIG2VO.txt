In both of the just heard and readed texts there discute about, if the new or the old voting systeme in the United States is the better one. In the text, they prefer the computer voting system (the new one). They say it's easier to use. The older people can use the touch screen technology easier than a large sheet of paper  containing, where they have to mark next to the small writen name. So they often make mistakes, because they mark the wrong candidate. The critics mean with the old system it gives a lot of more problems. But also there are some people they found to trust complex the computer technology everey day to risky. In the hearing they think also the new system is the better one. Because we can use the Computer system each day and they do a better job. The votings are just ones or twice a year so we should handle with a known systeme. So both of theme have the same opinion about the voting systeme in United States.
