Are computerized voting systems better than human counting?!
 
The use of computerized voting can heltp the American voting system to protect the election of miscounts. But not everyone know how to use a computer or even have a computer. For those people it would be impossible to vote with these new computerized voting systems. It also would be a problem for old people who are afraid of the use of technologie and computers. 

In elections when mistakes are made of one man, when he or she counts wrong, that would make a diffrence betwen 10 and 100 votes. But when the computerized voting system counts wrong or delete some votes or even counts some votes twice, that would affect miscounts of 1000 votes. 

In fact all computers are made an programmed by humans, so why humans will not make any mistakes by programming these voting systems?

In the world there exist many electronic counting systhems by banks and so on. But these programs are used every day and they are proved by many years. It would thake ages to make sure that computerized voting systems work, because there are only votes in America every 2 years so it is nearly impossible to integrate these computerized voting systems in America.
