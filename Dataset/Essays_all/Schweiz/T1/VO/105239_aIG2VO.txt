Both the text and the presentation talk about introducing a new voting system in todays society.

The presentation stated that there are many people in the united states that don't know how to use a computer or even are afraid of using one. Technology scares them and if they have to vote with computers the get discourage and they might not even vote at all. Another downside to voting with computers, that the presentatir mentioned is that although if we work with a coumputer voting system and therefore exclude all human mistakes, computerprograms are still written by a human and they could lead to wrong votes aswell. And if a computer programm makes a mistake, it will have far more serious consequences. In addition, if the computers count wrong, they can't do a recount. And last but not least, she mentioned that nowadays technology might be really good and that its doesn't make as many mistakes as before, but it didn't start of like that. And since there is only an election every 2 years, we won't have time to test them as much.

In comparision to the presentation, the text focused on the downside of the traditional voting system. It talked about the inaccurate counting of the votes by officials and that they make many more mistakes than a computer programm would. It also mentioned that the paper on which you choose your candidate isn't big enough and you can falsly mark the wrong candidate.
Eventually both examples talk about the introduction of the new voting system in todays society, but while the presentator says that it is way to risky to try it, the text thinks that it should be given a thought.
