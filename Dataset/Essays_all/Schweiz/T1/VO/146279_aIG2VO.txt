The woman was against that new system of voting with computers. She said that it sure would be easy for people who are used to a computer but what is with the others. Many people do not even have a computer. There maybe is a whole generation which has a fear of technology. The text says that it is easier for everyone and that there will not be as many mistakes as there are at the current voting system. She said that also computers can make mistakes and if they make mistakes, the expanse of damage would be much higher than if just one human votes wrong. It could affect thousands of people and it was not even their fault. The text says that if there is an error in the system the computer will detect it by itself and solve the problem. She again said that we trust computers even though they are invented by humans.
