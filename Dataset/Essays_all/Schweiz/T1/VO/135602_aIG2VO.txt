Voting needs to be as efficient as possible. It happens once every two years nationaly and it can determine the future of a country. Mistakes in voting can influence contested elections and may elect the wrong candidate which would be a disaster.
Many people are not fine with the current voting system because it has its flaws. For example if people accidentally vote for the wrong person, there is no way to change it and although it may seem to be very easy to vote, a mistake can be made very fast and you don't even notice it. In the current voting system, there are also people that count every single vote and if one mistake is detected, a whole recount of all the votes needs to take place which is very time consuming. This technique isn't very efficient either because there could be made mistakes aswell but it won't have as many mistakes as the technique from before because the faults get fixed.
But computerized systems aren't flawless too. Old people for example that have never really used a computer, have no idea how vote exactly and may vote for the wrong person by misclicking or taping at the wrong name on the screen. In addition, computerized systems are made by humans and could also have mistakes it them. Those systems have to be tested beforehand and have to be trusted.
