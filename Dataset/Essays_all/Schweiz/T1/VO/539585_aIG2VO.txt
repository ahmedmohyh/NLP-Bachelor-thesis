For a lot of people, especialy for the younger people, e-voting is way better way to wote, because they know how technologie works and these voting programs are also very good programmed. Its visiulised way better than on these ballots, wher you have to search for your candidate. They also have to be counted one by one. You can't cause an error voting on the computer, because if you make mistakes you can't vote until you write it correctly. And i also think thes e-voting are trustworthy because its based on programs like the e-banking and so on and i don't realy think the state would try e-voting without some test and realy good programmer. So there wouldn't be as many mistakes as in the normal voting.
But there are also a lot of people that can't afford a computer ore don't know how to use it. There are also a lot of people, that don't trust these technologies, but that doesen't mean that theyr opinion is not important. Also if a big mistake happens, the results arent printet on papers, so they are lost for ever. Such an mistake can also thousands of votes in a fraction of a second.
But at least i think the e-voting should be a option for woting, because it is simply for the normal young population and a way easier way to vote.
