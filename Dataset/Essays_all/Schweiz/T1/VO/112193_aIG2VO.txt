The current voting systems used in the United States of America are inefficient and inacurrate in terms of counting the votes. This is especially damaging in close elections. Another major source of inaccuracy are the ballots the voters need to fill in. They need to choose their candidate's name from a very large list and tick the right box. This is challenging for people with bad eyesight. They may choose the wrong candidate which in the end affects the election's result. 

This traditional voting system should be replaced by new computerized voting systems. With these new machines, the faults caused by human failure are eliminated. But people who are not used to work with computers ore have a fear of technology may get some prolems with the computerized voting system.
Another point to bear in mind is that these machines are developped by humans, which means errors could have been made in the code. This is by far a more damaging error than some misscounts in the traditional voting system, because this error would cause problems all the time but the people do not misscount all the time.
