Some people say that the voting system of the United States is inefficient and often lead to inaccurate counting votes. These people would like to replace the traditional voting system with a new computeriezed voting system. They say that the computerized system would be far more efficient and trustworthy than the old system. But is that really true? In traditional voting it happens sometimes that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate or that the votes are miscounted. These things can be damaging an election if it is closely contested.
On the other side are computers programmed from humans, so it would also be possible for miscounts to come up.  And where do all the people without a computer or with a fear of technology vote? Should it be necessary to have a computer to be able to vote? Moreover to this it is (at least I think so) harder for people with bad eyesight to read on a computer.
It would be risky to start anew voting system and replace the old traditional system, but it could work really well for the future altough it won't work flawlessly at the begining.
