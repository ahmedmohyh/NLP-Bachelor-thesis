In traditional voting, a problem is that people can mark the wrong name due to the small ballots. With a new, more efficient voting technology this problem would be solved if you can see the name better, because you can make it bigger on a screen, even if you have a poor eyesight. But the new technology isn't a good solution. It's expensive, so not everyone can effort a computer. Also not everyone is able to use a computer because they don't have the know-how.
Another problem in traditional voting is that they rely on people to count the votes. The officials have to count the votes one by one which leads to a few mistakes after counting thousands of ballots. A new technology would take away this problem by doing the job of counting votes. The argument going against this is that computers are programmed by humans. Therefore, it's possible for the programm to include mistakes which is even worse.
if the officials see hat they have been mistaken, an expensive recount has to ake place. this isn't necessary if a new technologyis introduced, sais the text. But, like the woman said, if the program has an error, the programm isn't able to recount, due to this error.
