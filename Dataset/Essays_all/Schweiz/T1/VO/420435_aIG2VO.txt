In the written part it is said that the traditional way of counting votes is highly inefficient because it seems that some of the voters are not capable of voting for the right person, it is also said that the people who count the votes, often make mistakes in counting because appearantly it is very difficult for an adult person to count some sheets of paper and in case of such an error they have to recount all the votes which is expensive and costs a lot of effort. In conclusion they want to replace the current system with computers because it is supposed to be much faster and the possibility of an error is practically non existent.
In the listening part it is said that computers won't be any better than the current system because there seems to be a lot of people who are not capable of operating a computer or some people who are even afraid of technology for some reason. They also mention that computers are programmed and built by humans so there still is a possibility of an error which would lead to much more fatal consequences than an error by humans.
They also mention that computer systems improved in the past years because they are used very frequently but with voting softwares this wouldn't be the case due to the reason that votings in the US occur only once every two years and in the different states maybe twice a year.
