Voting
Every two years in the USA there are votings for their government and every citizen can go and vote, but get his vote recorded correct or did he even voted correct ? This is a problem for many critics as they wish to change their traditional system into a newer more professional and computerized voting system. Because the voters get ballots where they can mark their favorite choice but on this ballot are a lot of names and it isnt easy to  find the right name, especially if you have a poor eyesight. And the mark next to the name you must do in a good size so you can see which one of these names you wanted to choose. The next critical point in the traditional system is that the ones who record the votes are only humans and with recording thousands of ballots you do mistakes. But on the other side there are also critics of the computerised voting system, because the computers that we're using for banking or at home  get tested and it isn't that bad if a computer doesn't work, but the votes are only every two years and if they don't work, there will be huge problems. If a computer makes a mistake then get thousands of ballots deleted and you can't start again like in the traditional system. So you see there are on both sides pros and contras,  which one the USA will coose stays in the clouds...
