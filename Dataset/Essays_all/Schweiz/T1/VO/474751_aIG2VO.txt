As the text above says, in the USA votings are still made traditionally, with a piece of paper where you have to find the name you want to vote for and make a little cross next to it. People are now complaining that many voters vote wrong, for example because of their poor eyesight, and that the votes are oftly counted wrong because the votes are still counted by people. Many do want the traditionally votings with a piece of paper replaced with a voting system on computers, like we use online banking transactions and communication. But many critics are against this. They say it's too risky because many inhabitants of the USA are not used to computers and will therefore vote wrong and that it would be way worse if the computer system has an error than if a human would count the votes wrong. Furthermore it is more likely that the voting sytsem has an error as it is only used every one or two years other than the online banking because it is used everyday.
