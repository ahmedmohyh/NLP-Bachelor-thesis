Many critics say that the current voting systems used in the United States are not good. They would like to have a more efficient system on computer. The current system is that the voters have to make a small mark on a paper next to the name. But many people mark the wrong name because they have poor eyesight. And the systems are very hevily on people to count the votes. When it is an error all the informations and votes have to recount. They think that the computerized voting machinses are better because they have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. With this system you only have to touch the candidate's name on the screen. And the vote counting is done more quickly and automatically by the computers. And the old system isn't very actuelly because today all the things are made with computer and technology. 
But other people think that computers are not better than the currently system. Because many people don't know how to deal with a comuter and the technology. And many old people doesn't have an computer. And also computers can have errors. Because they are programmed by people and people can also make mistakes. And you have to improve the systems of computers very often. But the people have to vote twice a year. So the questions is, do you want to make expensive programmes which you have to change and improve many times, when you use it only two times? All the people have an other meaning about this decision.
