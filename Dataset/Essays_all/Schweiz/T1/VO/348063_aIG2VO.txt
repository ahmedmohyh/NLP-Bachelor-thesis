The presentation is more critical to computers that the text. 
The first problem caused by computers is that there are people who aren't used to deal with computers like old people or there are people who can't afford a computer. Most of them are feared of technology. For them it's hard to vote if the votings would be electronic. 
The second point is if it's sure that computers do a better job than the traditional voting system. In the presentation they said there is a bigger chance to miscounts, cause a computer programm was also written by human beings and may has faults. If the voting programmes are compared to ebanking and communication programmes there is a big disadvantage for the voting programm because it's only used once in two years, the ebanking programm is used daily and improves every detail. An error in a electronic voting system is worse because it miscounts many votes, and the officals only make some faults which doesn't affect the majority.
To the first problem: But the text says that the traditional voting system is also bad for old people because they accidently vote for the wrong person. 
To the second problem, they know a voting system is risky but if a fault is detected at an official (which has happened) every vote has to be recounted, and that is very expensive.
