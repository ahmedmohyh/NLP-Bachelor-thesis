Computers take an omnipresent role in our lives nowadays, we use them for learning purposes, banking transactions, entertainment etc. But are they also the solution to constantly accumulating voting problems in the United States?
First of all, there are many arguments pro computers. For example, due to a large ballot sheet, people sometimes accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. The computerized voting machines however have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. Besides that, the old voting system heavily relies on people to count the votes; as a result, errors are inevitable. 
Computers on the other hand are not perfect either. For instance, not all the voters are familiar with computers and may not be able to use them. Plus, in case of a counting error, a recount cannot be started. The worst aspect is that an electrical voting system has no room for improvement, the system has to work properly, otherwise the voting will be a disaster. 
Ultimately we can say that the old voting system has become slightly unwieldy, but still offers a relatively safe alternative compared to electrical voting.
