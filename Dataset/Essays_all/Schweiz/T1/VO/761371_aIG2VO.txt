In the United States everyone has to vote every two years. The voters usually get a large sheet of paper where they have to fnd the names of their favourite candidates and they have to mark them. After that, the votes have to be counted by other people. So you see that it could easily have a few misscounts because of human errors. Because of that, there is a new system of voting,  the computerized voting, where the voter only needs to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate. People think that this way misscountngs can be remvoved because there's no possibility of human errors. But this isn't true. People who can't afford computers can easily catch a wrong vote ande moreover computers are also built by humans and they may be defect. And a defection while computerized voting could remove thousands of votes. This would be absolutely more dramatic than just a few misscounts.
