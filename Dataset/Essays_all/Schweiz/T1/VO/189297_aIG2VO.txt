In the text the critics want to replace the current voting system by the computerized voting system because they say that there are many mistakes happening during the counting of the votes or while the people even fill out their voting paper.

But in the audio the woman said that the computerized voting may be good for people who are used to working with computers but not for the ones who may not even have a computer. The woman in the audio also mentioned that of course there are mistakes happening during the couting of the votes by people but the thing is that if we vote with a computerized sytem we have to think a bit further because this system was also programed once my a humanbeing. So if this person made a mistake while programizing it, the impact which it will have on the voting will be much bigger than the one which it would have with the current voting system.

As a conclusion the critics from the text want to replace the current voting system, where as the woman in the audio thinks that computers can't be fully trusted.
