The computerized system is better to count the votes, because they can't make so easily mistakes. But it's a problem for those people, who don't use a computer or don't have the money to buy them. Humans can make more mistakes by counting the votes, than a computer can do. The computer also has miscounted a lot of the votes. The systems are used daily and heavily and the voting is once in every year. In the text it says that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. With the computerized voting machines it's different, because they have an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology. They just have to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate.The computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers. I think the presentation is against the computerized system and the text is for the computerized system.
