Nowadays there have been a lot of manipulated elections caused by human errors while using the newer electronic voting system. In case the election is closely contested, people having trouble with handling the machine can be harmful to the score. In contrast to the text, the hearing told me that human errors are mainly done by those who are willed to elect, and not by the counters. Examples are elderly people who have never used a computer in their lives, and, for instance, simply people who refuse to use a computer in their household. Though, the text tells something else. People blame the counters of the election for being inefficient and inaccurate. Once a fault happened and they do not remark it, a huge problem will be caused for the whole system.

Eventually we can say that even high-professional computers do make mistakes, because they are programmed by humans. Counting up elections by hand is also a doubtful thing with regard to the huge number of faults being caused when counting. I would suggest offering a semi-electronic system in order to avoid as many mistakes as possible. There should be given the possibility for elderly people to do the election paper-based as not to make a mistake while using a computer. On the other hand, younger people are supposed to fill it in completely electronically. They are used to dealing with computers, whereas my grandparents have to get used to it.
