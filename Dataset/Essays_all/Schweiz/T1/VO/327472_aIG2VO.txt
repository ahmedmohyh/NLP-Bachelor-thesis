It is true that the traditional voting system has it's problems, but would a new, computerized system bring improvment? Computer programms might have a higher accuracy in counting votes, but it would also reveal some new problems. First, aged people and people that don't use computers on a regular basis could  have problems with the computers. They might even be scared of voting just because they don't know how to use a computer. Secondly, it isn't guaranted that a computer system will be more accurate than people counting the votes. Computer programms are also made by humans and therefore can also make faults. To make things worse, a fault made by the programm could be way more severe, because it does things in greater scale. An other problem is that the voting results are digital, and they can be lost without leaving a trace or a way to recover them. In the end it is certainly true that there are computer programms in other important sections, for example banking, but these programms are in heavy use and they have to be improved all the time. It is very unlikely that a new voting programm will work perfectly from day one, and improvement will be more difficult because these programms won't be used very often. To improve a computerprogramm you need data from its use, and there might not be enough if the programms are only used three times a year.
