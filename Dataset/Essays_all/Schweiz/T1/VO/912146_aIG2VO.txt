Critics say that voting systems in the United States are inefficient. They say that there are many people that accidently vote for the wrong candidate. For example people with poor eyesight may not see which name they mark on this large sheet of paper containing many names. Also the huge amount of people who are needed to count these Votes aren't abel to complete their work without making mistakes at all. Missing a sheet of paper or forgetting which they alredy checked happpens faster than you think. 
To get rid of all these problems the critics want to replace these votings by a computerized voting. Computers would check the votes quicklier and automatically. Everyone can click on their Candidate and it's done. No more People to count the votes are needed. 
But it isn't done with these discussions. It never ends. What if people aren't used in Computers? What if they can't afford a Computer? What if there's an error of the whole System? 
These System isn't flawless like the important huge bank Systems who are used every day. 
To summarise these questions; Can we trust the Computers?
