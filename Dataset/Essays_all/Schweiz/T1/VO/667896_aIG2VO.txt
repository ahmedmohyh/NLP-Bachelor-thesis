At the moment the US still uses a traditional voting system. In this system voters have to mark their choice on a ballot. The votes then get counted by officials. This can lead to many errors. For this reason some people want a new system, where votes can be made digitally. 
When votes are made on a electric device, it would be easier for people with poor eyesight because they could enlargen the names. Like this people wouldn't accidetaly mark the vote for the wrong candidate. But oponents say it would discourage some people for voting because they're affraid of technology. Also some people have troubles working with computers and so they may still accidetaly clic onto the wrong name.
Another source of mistakes in the current voting systems is the counting. Officials have to count through thousands of votes and since they are only humans they will make mistakes. By using computers we could avoid those human errors. But of course also computers have their flaws and they are only programmed by humans. If there is an error in the programm this could have a bigger impact as the single mistakes of the officials. And as the act of voting isn't recorded, it would be extremely difficult to prove a mistake. 
Last but not least there is also the argument, that we trust computers with a lot of other things like banking transactions, so why shouldn't we trust them with our votes? Well all these programms we use every day have been developped over years. They weren't flawless in the beginning. National votes take place only once a year in the US so it would be extremely difficult to improve the programms in a usefull matter of time.
