The speech of this woman shows, that she is against computerized voting systems. She says that people, who don't use computers often, could have many problems with voting, and she adds, that there were people, who can't afford a computer. The text says, that the current voting system made more difficulties. The text also tells us, that the many names on the ballot confused the people, and that people with poor eyesight have even more problems to give the vote they want. Also the human errors in counting the votes in the current voting system is a big part of the text. But the woman says in her speech, that human mistakes in the voting programmes would have much bigger consequences on the results of the election, because there would be probably missed thousands of votes. Because these votings are happening only one time every two years, she thinks that people hadn't got enough possibilities to get confidence in this system.
