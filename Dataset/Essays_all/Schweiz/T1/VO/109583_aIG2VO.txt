The woman says that people, who don't have a computer or aren't used to it will have a problem with voting from then on. But the problem with her argument is, that, if you don't live somewhere alone in a hut, you most certainly need a computer. Almost for all jobs you need one. And most people , even elders use e-mail nowadays. But what makes her argument even more invalid, is that in the upcoming years even more people will know how to correctly operate a computer. She also made a point that people with poor eyesight might missclick and vote for a wrong cadidate. But, as explained in the text, that happens just as often in written ballots. The argument she gave the most time for was that computers shouldn't be trusted, and this just an old, conservative argument. Computers are far more efficent than humans when it comes to tasks where you need to do the same thing, over and over again. Thats the case in counting ballots. And if you have once programmed this step right, that it counts right with one ballot, you can be sure that it will go on the same for the ongoing thousands. And you can be sure that computer programms that are that important will be tested that often that every minor misstake will be found. The only problem that may occur is, if a person hands in a ballot where he / she as example voted for more than one candidate, then the computer may have a problem. Another argument that I would like to add is, that it's simply more economic to vote digitaly, because paper for all 300 Million US people isn't cheap, and especially not good for the forests and the emissions they produce.
