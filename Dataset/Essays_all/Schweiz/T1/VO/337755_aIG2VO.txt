Can we trust computers
In the presentation they said that computers are great for voting if you're used to it. But old people could have big problems with this new technology. These people could also make mistakes and vote for the wrong candidate but worse, they could be afraid to go voting because of the fear to make mistakes at these new things. The presentation metioned also that computerized voting technology isn't that efficient an trustworthy as it seems. Then computers have to be programed by humans, and humans make mistakes. 
First the text points out, that we already trust computerized systems like e-banking. In the audio they attack these argument by saing that these systems also had the problems when they were used first and had to get better until they reached the accuratcy of the systems today.
So the text says that computer doesn't make mistakes, but in the presentation it's said, that if a computerized voting system made a mistake, it would be a very big error and a recounting is not possible. An other point of argument is that old citizen weren't able to mark the right candidate, then the lists are very long and written in a very little font. In the opposit the audio presentation says that old citizens aren't used to computers.
