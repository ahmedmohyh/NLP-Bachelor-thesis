In the text and the presentation the main topic is voting. The question that is discussed is wether a computerized voting system should be introduced or not.An arguement that speas for introducing this new electronical system is that the traditional voiting system is way to inefficient and that it leads to inaccurate counting of votes. Moreover the coputer sytem can remove mistakes made by humans.On the other hand in the presentation it is also mentionned that this new voiting system may be easy and comfortble for people that are already used to electronical devices. For people that are not, people that do not like it or do not have a compuer it can become difficult to vote in that way. They can easily make a mistake while. In addition to that the presentation also agrees that humans make mistakes as it is written in the text. The thing that speaks against it is that computer are programmed by humans and because of that copmuters can also have mistkes. If a computer system has such a mistake this could have bigger consequences than a tradtional vote counting. Furthermore voting happens just once in two years in the Unted states and from voting to voting it can be worked on the system to make it as good as possile. The text speaks for a new voting system and the presentation is for the traditional system.
