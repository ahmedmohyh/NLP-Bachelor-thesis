Voting

In the USA are a lot of people who critisice the voting system. The critics say that the system is very inefficent and it can lead to inaccurte counting of the votes. The problem they have with the system is that it's very complicated. People have to search the name of the person they want to vote for on the ballot, a large sheet of paper with many names on and then make a cross next to that person. That is very hard for people for example with a poor eyesight. The other problem is that the sheets have to be counted by humans. This can lead to miscounting. These critics want to computerize the whole voting system. On the other hand are the people who absolutely don't want to replace the system with computers. They say, that it's much more risky. The arguments they have is that not everyone is used to computers. This can also lead to failure and accidents. And then there is the problem, that computers can make mistakes too, because they're made and programmed from humans. The mistakes they could make are for example delete accidentaly a lot of votes or miscount the votes. These people say, that when the computer makes a mistake no one can recount it. This is much easyier when you have the votes on sheets. .
