Is it a good alternative for us voting on a computer? For people who knows how to work on a computer it's maybe a good thing but for people who doesn't know how to use a computer it's very difficult. And does the computer really a better job than we? The computer is constructed by humans so the computers can make as many mistakes as we do. Perhaps the people have a fear of technology and push by voting a wrong name or maybe the computer doesn't work anymore and we have to vote like we've done befor - on papers. So it's not sure what the best opportunity is but the text and the presentation are both clearly against the voting on a computer.
