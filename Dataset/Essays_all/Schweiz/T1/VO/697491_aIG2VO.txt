The text only lists the positive things of computerized voting. They say that the traditional voting system is inefficient and a threat for inaccurate counting of votes. So, it should be replaced by a computerized voting system, because it removes the possibility of human errors. Then peoples may make mistakes while counting up the votes one by one or already when they have to decide their candidate and mark the wrong name. The difference to the presentation is, that there the person speaks much more about the bad sites of computerized votings. Computers are made by humans, so it's quite possible, that there are many errors in the computer too and if there is an error in counting, there may be a big fault hole voting and it wuold be completely false, much falser than with counting mistakes from humans. Another problem is, that not every person in the world has a computer or  knows how to work with it. So, there might be many persons who can't vote. To rsume, Computerized Voting is only possible if we can trust computers and everyone in the world knows how to vote with them.
