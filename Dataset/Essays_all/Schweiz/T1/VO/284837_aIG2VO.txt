Nearly everybody works daily with a computer and all of us know, that sometimes there are some failures in the system. So, would it be a good idea to vote on the computer instead of voting with letters and counting them?

There are sertains of reasons for voting online. It would be a lot easyer, if we could just log in and send our vote, instead of fill out the votingletter and then put it into the box, where all the letters come together. The counting of the voises would also be much easyer. The system would count it imediately. If the humans count the letters, the chance of a failer is a lot bigger than when the computer makes it.

On the otherhend we have to see, that there are also humans who don't know how to manage a computer. For them it would be bad and they probably will not vote again. Another point is, that humans-failures are still very common. So what if there is a failure in the system? It would be a far bigger problem to solve, than if we would make a mistake by counting the letters by hand. Of cours we are using aleready other computersystems like ebanking or stuff like that, but they are better proofed then the new votingsystem. They become proofed daily!

So in my opinion, although there are many positive aspects, I am against the computer-voting-system, because it is harder to control.
