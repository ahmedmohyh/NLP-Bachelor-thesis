First, in the text it is said that it would be easier for people with bad eyesight to vote with a computer, because you only have to touch the name of the candidate and on a sheet of paper you could vote for the wrong name. There is also a risk with the old voting system. One person has to caount all the ballots and this has the possibility of human error. And why do not trust computers? We use it also for our banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensitive information.

On the other hand people without any knowledge with computers could have some problems first, but I think they can learn it quickly. Another risk is that computers are made by humans and humans can make mistakes, so if there is a mistake in the programming of the computer, it could be a huge broblem. In my opinion they could just test the computer first before using it. 

To sum up there are many reasons to change the old voting system to a computerized one. The arguments against the coputerized voting system are not really serious problems, they are just complains. If I had to decide, I would give the computer a chance.
