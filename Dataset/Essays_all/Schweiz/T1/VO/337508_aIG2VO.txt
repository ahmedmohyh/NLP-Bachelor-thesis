In the presentation, the main argument was the fact that some people are not used to computers and therefore are not able to do their voting correctly within the electronic voting system . In addition to that, the electronic system has been criticized, as a mistake due to the computer system is often worse than a mistake done by people. In the text though, the computerized voting system is described positively - there it is said that current voting systems are rather inefficient and in fact, the new computerized system would make more sense. Furthermore, with computers, one could even magnify the name for easier viewing and it would be guaranteed that you tick the right name. Here again, the contrary argument from the presentation was that there are people who are not good at dealing with electronical devices in general and as a result do mistakes. To sum up, we can say that the presentation is basically the contrary opinion to the text. The presentation is relied on the text, and is based on the arguments from the text.
