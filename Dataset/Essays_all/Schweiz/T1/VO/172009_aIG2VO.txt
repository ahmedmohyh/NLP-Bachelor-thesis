Voting by Computer; How good is it?

The speaker in this speach is heavily against voting by computer. She fears that many people have a wrong idea of it; they think that voting by computer might be easier than voting by hand. She indicated that many people dont't own a computer and even if they do, they do not always know how to use it properly, so voting by hand is the overall better solution. The speaker critizises the statement "counting by hand is inaccurate". She admits that human can and will make mistakes, but those mistakes are of low count compared to the possible tremendous mistakes of a computer programm, which is programmed by humans in the end as well, those human could damage the result much more, than one person, which counts wrong intentionelly. 
While you may have to recount the votes when a human makes a mistake counting, this is often not possible, if you vote via computer, which obviously is a bad thing. 
The speaker implies that computer had to be worked on for a long time, until they had the capacity and relyability they have today. If you were to introduce electronical voting, you would have to elaborate it over a long period of time, which is even harder in the US, where national votings take place every two years and even local votings only twice a year.
