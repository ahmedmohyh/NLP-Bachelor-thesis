Whether computerized voting would be better than the current voting system in the United States oder not, has very different points of view. In the presentation, it was said that it is doubtful that it will be better, because what do we do if we can not afford a computer, do not use a computer on a regular basis or we have fear of technology? The positive aspects are, that computerized voting systems seem more trustworthy because people may accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because of their poor eyesight. Also we could do miscounts, which would be very damaging. But how can we be sure that computers do not make mistakes, just like us? Humans invented the computer. And when a computer has an error, it is much worse than just one mistake of a human. Some say that it is too risky but trust in other computer technologies every day. In comparison to our often use of computers for banking and communication, these had the chance to get improved. But the voting only takes place one time in two year, which makes it very difficult to improve efficiently.
