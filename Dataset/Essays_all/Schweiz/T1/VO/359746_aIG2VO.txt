Human error can also be shown in computerised voting because humans can program the computers wrong.  
Not everybody has an access to computerised voting since not everyone owns a computer. Many people also don't know how to use a computer, and so maybe they won't vote because they fear the technology. That would lead to a smaller voting participitaion, which would be a major loss for the society.

When there's a problem or a fault in the voting process and dates are lost, there's a huge problem because the dates don't exist in any physical form so they cannot be reconstructed. Votes can't be recounted and so everybody would have to vote new. 

Most new computer technologys have lots of problems when they are implemented, but with time they become better and better because there is always something to improve. Votings doesn't take place very often, so the improvement would be very slowly and over a long period of time. 

Traditional voting is a major source of inaccuracy, but so is computerised voting.
