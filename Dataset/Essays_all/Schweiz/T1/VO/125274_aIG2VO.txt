Computerized voting vs. traditional voting

The audio file describes problems, which might occur when using computers to vote. The persontalking presents several issues and risks that can come with this new idea of voting. First of all it is mentioned that computer voting won't be any better than the traditional voting, because of many people not even being able to handle a computer. Elder people mostly are not familiar with computers and there are still surprisingly many people that don't know much about how computers work either. Additionaly is said that many people can't afford a computer and it would be a much more expensive way to vote for people that don't own one, which then would lead to an inequality caused by financial reasons. Furthermore the speaker questions if computers are better than humans, because they are produced and programmed by humans, which means that there could be a programming error, leading to even more severe voting misscounts.

Those arguments pretty much contradict the arguments mentioned in the written article.
In the article the computer voting is seen as more trustworthy and efficient than the traditional system, but the audio tries to convince people by exactly the opposite. The computerized voting system would only cause more problems and isn't easier to handle at all, especially for people that don't use computers daily. Also mentioned is the accuracy of the computers, but like already mentioned above, that might be the case in 99% of all votings, but even a small programming mistake might cause a lot bigger errors, then leading to more costs or even preventing an exact vote, if there are thousands of misscounts.
