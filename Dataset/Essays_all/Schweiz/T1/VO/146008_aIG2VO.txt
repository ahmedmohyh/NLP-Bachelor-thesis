The article shows the positiv aspects of a computerised voting, which would manly be to avoid the chance of human error. It is said that humans maybe can't read the ballet because of bad eyesight or that the people counting would miss ballets. 
The interview on the other hand as a strong contra-argument: The computers are programmed by humans too. If the human has made an error in the programm, this would lead to a major problem. There wouldn't be only some ballets missed, but rather the votes of an entire state could be counted wrong. And there would be no chance to test that programm all day and approve it, as it has happened with the other computer programms were trusting, banking and communication of sensitive information. These programms might work good today and can be trusted, as the article says, but they had to be improved over years. Big errors of the voting programm are considered more serious by the interview, even thouhgt the article states that the correction of an human error is very expensive. 
One can see, it's said that computers can be trustet in the text and the opposite is said in the interview. None of them gives speciffic arguments regarding the computer's trustworthyness, but it's pointed out, that some humans might be affraid to vote when all this technology is inclouded, while the article says that other programms are used without problems too.
