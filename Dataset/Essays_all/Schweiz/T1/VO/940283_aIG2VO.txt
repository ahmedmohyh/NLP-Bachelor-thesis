Different than in the text are the main arguments from the speach used against the voting system with computers. Because there are many people who aren't used to computers because the may are elderly or can't afford such a maschine at all. So it would only be a system for rather young and rich, let's say not poor, people. But isn't voting a thing of everybody's interest?
And another argument against mentioned by the speaker: Humans make mistakes. Humans make mistakes by counting the votes. And Computer's are programmed by humans, so may their programms consist also some faults, and these faults can may be bigger than a human miscounting of one vote. Who says that computers do always count without mistakes?
Computer's don't have the important human skills, even though one could mean counting votes can easily be done by computers. How about recounting if it's really neccessarily? That's an impossible thing with computers, as the speaker says. In contrast, the text is about long and expensive recounts if an error is detected.
We saw some good arguments for a voting system with computers that are mentioned in the text, where human mistakes are made up big. But the speach did anyway convince us that we can't always trust in maschines, even though they often work fine like for banking transactions and communication.
