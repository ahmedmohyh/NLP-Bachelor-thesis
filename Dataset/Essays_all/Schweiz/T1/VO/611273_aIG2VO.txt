The reading part criticises the old voting system pretty heavily. They say there are too many mistakes done and this can lead to inaccurate results. They can even lead to a wrong decision if the election is a close contest. Their arguments are human errors. The chance of doing a mistake during counting all the votes physically are immensively high. And when there is done a mistake, the votes have to be counted again in a long process of recounting all the votes. But in contrary, it's a good security to still have the papers in a physical version. If there is once a mistake in the program in a computerized voting system, and the data is lost, there may be thousands or millions of votes are lost. That's not possible in our old voting systems. 
And of course, not everybody is used to computer, or can even afford one for himself. It seems easier for young people or just people, who are used to computers to vote directly from their computers. But they say we shouldn't forget older people, which are maybe not so used to this new system and they may are afraid of technical progress.
Before I talked about human mistakes. In the presentation of the reading party, they said that we shouldn't forget, that computerized systems are still programmed by humans. And if there is only a little mistake in the program of the voting system, maybe thousands of votes are easily in lost in the nowwhere. So the affect of one human mistake is much bigger in a computerized voting system, than in our traditional voting system.
