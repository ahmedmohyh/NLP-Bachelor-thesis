The presentation and the text in comparison

What they have in common is that both sources tell us advantages and disadvantages. The question is, if computers should be used for votings instead of people who counts the votes by hand. This becomes a really important question when the quantity of the votes for the candidates are just slightly diffrent.

The presenter said, that humans do make mistakes, but not as worse as it would be, if a computer made one. There would be thousands of miscounts. And who knows, if computers are really better than humans? Humans invented them. And, it might be easy to use computers for people who are used to it, but what about the other ones? 

While the presenter seems to support the tradition of counting votes by humans, the text supports the idea of using computers instead:
 It says that people with poor eyesight may easiliy mark the false name on the list. The computers have an "easily-to-use touch-sreen technology". The text arguments are fewer, that computers can "remove the possibility of human error", and "all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically".
 
Both sources name similar arguments, but they support different opinions.
