The woman says that we can't always trust the new tecnology, because the computers are programmed by people. And if there are mistakes in the programming, thousands of votes could be false in the end. Computer also can't be trusted to count the votes. When there is a mistake in the programming it could lead to a false result with just one click. If there is a major mistake or an impossibly high number, the computer wouldn't know that and couldn't correct it. So even when we can vote with computers, it could lead to inaccurate counting. Furthermore not every body uses a computer on the regular and it wouldn't be that easy for some to vote with the computer. The easy-to-use touch-screen is for some people not so "easy-to-use", because they don't know how to handle a computerized voting system. Some people also fear the new tecnology. So this computerized sytem is doubtful.
