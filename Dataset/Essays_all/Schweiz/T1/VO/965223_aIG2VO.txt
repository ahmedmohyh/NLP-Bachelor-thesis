It is doubtful if a compiuterized voting system would make a big improvement. It maybe easier for the people who are used to the usage of computers, but what is with all the others? What if you can't afford a computer, but you want to vote? Or if you are not able to use a computer because you have never done it befor? The text tells us it would be a help for all the people with poor eyesight, to have the names on  a screen instead of having them on a paper. But these  people normally don't normally work with computers, as a screen is not easier to look at. Furthermore the text tells, the mistakes made by humans during counting the votes, is a major problem. The offials have to count thousands of ballots which leads easily to mistakes. If those mistakes are detected, a recount has to take place. As a solution, the computorized system would be the best.it would not make any mistakes. But would computers really do a better job? The programms with which a computer would count the votes is made ba humans. If a mistake was made while creating this program,  not only a few votes would be affected. Rather thousands of votes would be miscountedor even deleted. As there are no physical versions of the votes, a recount would be imppossible. Additionally, it's always hard to get something new to to work perfectly. Other systems have problems at the begining as well, but they are used daily and therefore can be fixed and reprogrammed quickly. As votes are only once a year nationally an d twice a year in the different states of the USA, this voting program would not be working fine for long period of time, as it can be used only few times per year which makes it hard to detect mistakes.
