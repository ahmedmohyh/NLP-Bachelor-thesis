In the United States, a lot of people can't afford or even handle a computer. For us, it might be very normal to live with a computer, but it isn't always like that. A lot of old people for example have no idea how to even start a laptop. The text says, that there must be a very good communication system, but it the end it won't really help you, if you don't know how to use a computer. In the text, they speak of a far more accurate counting, but the speaker of the presentation has the opinion, that if this automatic computer voting system is made by human hands, there are also oing to be human errors. And those can be a lot worse in such a computer system, than it might e on paper. For the countings, you absolutely need many people to work on that, and computers would make it easier, but still you only have a few votings. Finally, it is just the question if you trust the computer systems enough or not. Nothing more, nothing less.
