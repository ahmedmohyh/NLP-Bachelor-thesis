They want to change the voting system into electronic. But the problem is that it wouldn't make oure situation easier because a lot of people can't afford a computer or doesn't want to buy one only for the voting. And the question is do we want to change it into electronic voting?
Because in the usa they have to vote all two years and maybe it won't be nessecary to change it. They are telling that the current voting is inefficient and often there are missing votes but maybe we have to ask us why? The problem is that we human always want to change something and we don't try to do in a other way. The other problem is that if we people are creating this electronic system and if we are doing mistake the hole system would be an error and we couldn't use the voting.
An other question is  can we trust as a computer? I think for the people it's hard to trust as a computer because if we write it on paper we can prouve that we vote for it. With the computer we can do a lot of mistakes.
