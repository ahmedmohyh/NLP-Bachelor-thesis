The text says, that humans make too many mistakes when counting ballots. It is inaccurate and many miscounts happen. Also, escpecially people with bad eyesight often accidently vote for the wrong person, which is ridiculous. It also say how much better the computerized voting system would be. The other probem would be, that humans make mistakes and that mistakes always happen, so we should use computers for voting. 
The listening part said, that not everyone is used to technology and not everyone can afford it. Also, there are apparently people with fear of technology. In addition to that, it says that even though humans make a few mistakes, the computers could cause way more problems, because the computer could maybe have a mistake, because it were also humans who made the computer. 
Since the main argument of the people who prefer humans as counters is, that a computer could maybe possibly in one case of a thousand have a mistake, I declare that argument as invalid. They could've talked about viruses or hackers but that argument was just weak. Also, whoever takes counting ballots as a job should be good at counting and not make mistakes.
PS: the last paragraph was only to reach the word limit.
