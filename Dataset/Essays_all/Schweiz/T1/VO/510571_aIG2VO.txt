Voting
The two sources I just read/heard,clearly don't have the same opinion on the subject "voting". Whilst the text tries to explain to us, how inefficient the current voting systems in the United States are, the woman in the audio tries to prove the text to be wrong. Critics think that the current voting systems count the votes very inaccurate, because of human mistakes, such as accidentally voting for the wrong candidate, by making a mark next to the wrong name becausethe person voting might have a poor eyesight.The critics say, that a computerized voting system would be much more efficient because there wouldn't be any mistakes like these ones anymore. But the lady in the audio sais, that computer systems might just as well contain human mistakes, such as, maybe a mistake in the computer program itsself, a mistake caused by the person who invented the program. She sais, that this would bring major problems with it, because if a program, which the whole United States use, contains an error, there could be thousands of wrong votes counted, whilst the traditional voting system just has a few inaccurat votes in it, caused by a few human mistakes.
