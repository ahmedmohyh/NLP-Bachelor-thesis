Altough faults can happen with the manual voting and counting there are many people who think doubtfull about the computerized voting system. Arguments are that people who aren't used to computers may stop voting. People who don't own a computer wouldn't be able to vote. People who didn't want to accept the new system wouldn't vote. Critics to to the traditional system argue, that it can lead to an accidentally voting for the wrong person, especially people with poor eyesight are ment. The electronical voting would be arranged for anyone with any disability. But what happened if there was an error with the computerized voting system? This would cause way worse circumstances than a misscount with the traditional counting by hand.
