The question is if voting systems are really better than the traditional voting. For people who are used to computer and all this stofes with the high technology, touchscreen and so on would it be better but for the others? Many old people don't konw how to use an computer or even don't know what an touchscreen is. The women said that people may make mistakes in traditional voting but only missing a few ballots. If suddenly the computer don't work anymore is the problem more worse than missing a few ballots or voting for the wrong person. The information would remove from the recotz Another thought is the point that the voting is only twicea year. Is it really important to create an touchscreen technology for voting who would only used twice a year. And we can't trust more in computer than in humans. Anyway both system have theire pro and contra arguments.
