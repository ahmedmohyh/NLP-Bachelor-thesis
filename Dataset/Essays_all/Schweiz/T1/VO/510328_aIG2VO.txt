This texts are about voting in America. Critics say that a probelm in traditional voting is, that voters have a large sheet of paper with many names on it. The voters have to mark a name, but if someone with poor eyesight wants to vote, it can happen that they mark the wrong person. The compurized voting machines are more easily for us to vote. You can just touch the photo from your favourite candidate. There are other problems, for example with the old voting systems you have to count all the votes. 
Another argument is that some people doesn't use computer or other technology like ipad or tablets.
Human can make mistake in traditional or old voting, but how can we be sure that a computer doesn't? At least computer are programed by human.
