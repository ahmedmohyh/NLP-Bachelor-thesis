The presentation show us the negative part of computerized voting. They support their statement with a smal amount of examples.
They mention that it's probably good for people who use their computer every day and are used to working with them, but there are  people in the USA who don't use a computer or can't afford one. The text on the other hand explains that it helps people with bad eyesight to make the right ''click''.

The text says that the ballots could easily be miscounted and they could make mistakes, but the presentation makes a point with the statement, that the computerprogram could have an error in the system which would lead to  even more sever mistakes. A whole bunch of ballots could be lost or miscounted and since there is no physical record of the votes, the whole voting has to be retaken.

Voting takes only place at rare occasions. The text and the presentation show a completly differenty view on how this affects the voting. They both say that's the reason why there should be a change/ should be no change in the system of voting.
