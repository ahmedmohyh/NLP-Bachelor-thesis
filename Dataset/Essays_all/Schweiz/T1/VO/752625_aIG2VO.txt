The text says that the current voting system in the USA often leads to inaccurate voting of votes. This has to to do that you can eassily choose the e^wrong candidate by accident. When you have poor eyesiht or just cross the wrong name. But in the Vortrag the sayd against this that computer aren't so much better. They could be better but only for people which own a computer or know how to use it. What is with the people which don't have the money to afford a computer or old people which don't know how to work with it. They could not vote anymore. 

In the text they also say that one problem of the old voting system is that you need to count the votes one by one. Eassily a person can make a mistake when they count. Otherwise there would only be like one at a time mistake and not the whole votes. Y compuzter wouldn't make many mistake. But when he do, he could delete all the votes and you would never find them again. That is a huge problem.

In the end you can say that both technics have their advantage. The old one from hadn and the new one with the computer. You ust try the new one to say if it really don't work becaus enobody ever used it before.
