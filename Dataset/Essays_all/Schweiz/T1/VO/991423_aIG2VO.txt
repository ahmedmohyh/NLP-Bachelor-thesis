In the presentation they said that computers aren`t very reliable. Nobody says that computers can`t make any mistakes. The people trust computers beacuse they use them daily. There is also a problem with those who can`t afford computers. So they won`t be able to vote. The critisizers are afraid of technology, why trust a computer?
The text is described the opposite way. They just count the positive affects of involving computers into the voting systems. Now for years people make mistakes, it is normal when they have to count that many votes. Some people think computers will succeed and be better for the voting system. "You should give it a tought" they say. 
To sum up this topic can be discussed for hours, I personally believe that the computers need time to be developed. Until then human beeings should carry on doing the voting count. The improvement of technology is good for us.
