The two surces perfectly show that there is a problem in the election system of the United States, but that there isn't satisficiant solution. Both of them show the problems of the others suggestion: the text the problems of manual counting and the presentation the problems of counting with computers. There are always some points with are quite similar to the opposite. By solving a problem by introducing a new sistem you create a new one. If the people with bad eyes haven't any more problems to read the names of the candidates, poor people will have a problem because they cant affort a computer and others who are affraid of technology can't vote alone so they can't vote freely. Another point is that there will allways be some miskates in the counting. In one system there are human who make mistakes in counting them directly in the other the humans make them indirectly by making mistakes in producing computer systems with mistakes which can cause a large number of theme, but not  in each election, while in the other system there are less in number, but always. You can't avoid the mistake in counting because humans will always make mistake if they have to count thousends of ballots and you won't use the computer system often enough to correct all mistakes.
In a nutshell you can say that the election system in the United States isn't and we haven't found a solution yet.
