In the presentation it is said that using computerized voting would cause trouble for people who aren't used to computers. It would cause people to vote the same as their friends or family because they're too scared of the new technology. On the other side a similar issue exists when it comes to traditional voting. Mostly people with poor eyesight have problems with the ballot which contains a lot of names and might be quite confusing. But then there are also mistakes that can happen when counting the votes. Officials who count them might easily count a ballot twice or miss one. If that's the case a revote takes place, which is expensive and takes a lot of time. Computers could minimize the risks of little counting errors. But if there was an mistake in the computer system, which is in fact built by humans too, it would cause huge damage with thousands of votes being miscount. In conclusion we could say that traditional voting as well as  computerized voting both have good and bad aspects and only the future will show the truth.
