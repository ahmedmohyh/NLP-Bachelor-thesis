The presentation is about computerized voting and it says that it isn't even a better method than voting with ballots.

 Yes, it's true that voting with ballots can have many mistakes and human errors but as in the presentation mentioned, computers are made by humans which means it can also have human errors. Computerized votings are much easier and much faster than votings with ballots. But that does not mean that it is more exact and free of mistakes. In the text it says that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error. But the presentation says it the other way around. I agree with the presentation because a mistake by the computer can happen so fast if something is programmed wrong. 

Or also not everyone knows how to use computers while almost everybody knows how to make a small mark by hand. So we can't say computerized voting was easier and better. 

Sure the counting is done quickly and automatically while every single ballot has to be counted by human themselves. It takes very long and if an error appears it has to be recounted. But the counting by the computer could be completely wrong and no one will know it, because they think that a computer won't make any mistake.
