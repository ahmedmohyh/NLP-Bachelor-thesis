There is a huge debate about computerized voting machines. Some people want to modernize the old system. But not ever
The critics against the traditional voting say that it is too inefficient because everything has to be counted by hand and it often leads to miscounts. If this happens the people have to recount the votes. Another problem is that old persons can easily mark the wrong name because they can not see well. At the computer there is a easy-to-use touch-screen which makes it nearly impossible to mark the wrong name. But there are not just pros for the computerized voting system. People who do not use computers all day maybe will not understand the system. When a mistake happens in the traditional voting you can recount it but with the computer it will make it impossible. And critics say that the counters can make mistakes in counting but what will happen if the computer will make a mistake? 
So as you can see there are a lot of pros and cons and it is not clear which one is better. I think everyone should decide for himself which one is better.
