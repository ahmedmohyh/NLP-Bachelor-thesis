To elect a government in a democracy, people have to vote. For the last century, people did that by marking their candidate on a voting ballot. After voting, officials had to go through all the ballots and evaluate the outcome of the voting. Rumors say that those elections were inaccurate because of people's and official's mistakes, therefore people want a new voting system to be evaluated. They want to replace papers by computers so people vote digitally to erase miscountings, especially for close votings. For many people who are used to computers this would be easy and it would simplify the way of electing. On the other hand there are still many persons that can't cope with new technology. Those people would struggle at voting in this way and they could easily vote for the wrong candidate. Another point against the new system is that human beings do mistakes, but so do computers. Those are also programmed by humans and if there is an error, much more votes could be lost because they're only saved digitally. In the daily life digital technologies became absolutely normal, but still it is seen as very risky to give everything into hands of a machine, especially high-risk data so as votes for elections.
