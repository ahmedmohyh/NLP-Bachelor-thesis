America's voting sytsem is strognly criticised and proponents believe that many mistakes happen during the voting because there are lots of factors that lead to an inaccurate counting and voting. 

For the opponants is evident that people make mistakes and that miscounts are likely to happen but they are sure that there will be no improvement on this if the system is just replaced by an internet program. Firstly there are many people who are not used to the usage of a computer and furthermore not all American citizens own a computer by themselves. Even though some people have a poor eyesight and the sheet of paper containing the candidates names is poorly overviewable, it is stil believed that this system is better than forcing people who do not possess the knowledge of the usage of a computer to vote on an internet system. 
On the one hand it is inevitable that mistakes during the counting of the votes happen because human beings make mistakes but on the other hand human beings can only miscount few ballots which would not have had that much of an impact in the whole votings but a computer can make huge mistakes and miscount a thousands of ballots. 
Additionally it is true that Americans use and trust the online banking system and all of the social media which is provided on the internet but these things did not work flawlessly in the beginning either and it took those systems lots of years of improvment to work as good as they work nowadays. Votes take place twice a year and if it takes some years to make the system work flawlessly there will be lots of mistakes inbetween those years. 

To sum it all up, it is still not known what will happen in the further years and how the system will improve or change but there are strong arguments for both sides.
