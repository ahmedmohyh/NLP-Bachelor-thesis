In the lecture we heard that traditional system can be problematic but computer systems can also be problematic. They said that not every person knows how to use a computer and not every person can afford one. People can also make mistakes using the computer because of fear of technology but this contradicts to the text which says that, because there is so many names in the paper people with poor eyereading can often cross the wrong person, which acording to the text will not happen in a computer. In the lecture they affirm that computer won't make any mistakes but they also say that computers are made by humans and that there could be a minor error in programing it, which could lead to a lot of problems, but counting ballots in an election were the results are very tight having made mistakes counting the ballots could lead to a candidate becoming president that wasn't suposed to be one. Finally they say that the computer voting system is not going to be used everyday like online banking. They say that online banking is used everyday and that at the beginnig of online banking there were a lot of problems which have been solved because of the constant using of the programme. If there is a mistake in the voting programme it could lead to do the voting again which is not good
