The speaker made many different points against using technology for counting votes in the United States of America but  the main ones were: Computers are made and programmed by humans, which means that the're will still be errors made. If a human makes a minor mistake, like forgetting a vote or miscounting something the outcome is hardly different but if a computer is falsely programmed the outcome can be far more drastic. And since there is no possibility to recount the votes, the whole population of the United States would have to vote again, which would be very expensive and discouraging for the people.
Another point opposing the use of technology is that a lot of elderly or inexperienced people would be discouraged by it since they are not familliar with computer technology. It could be rather hard to understand how the voting process works if one has hardly ever used or owned a computer. Another point the speaker  made was that it is quiet difficult  to create a perfect computer program for the voting process. Humans use computers daily for all kinds of different tasks. But these computers  have all been perfected for a long time and since the general population only votes once in every two years nationaly it would take very many votings until the program was perfected.
So basically she is saying that mistakes can happen everywhere and that modern technology won't necessarilly make it better since everything is programmed and monitored by humans anyway.
