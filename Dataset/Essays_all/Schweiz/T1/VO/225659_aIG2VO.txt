The two source; a listening and a text, are mainly related because they concern the same topic. Firstly there is a text which empathize the urge to change the current voting systems used in the United State. It is not only inefficient while it relies on people to count the votes, but also lead to the inaccurate counting of votes caused by the fact that one person have to deal with thousands of ballots where it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes. The text states that computerized voting would be fat more efficent and trustworth and that the governments and individuals today already trust other complex computer technology  to be perfectly accurate. On the other hand the listening raise awareness of the problems which would be caused by a change of the  current voting system. It is clear that not everyone knows to use a computer and some do not even own one because they do not have enough money to buy one. Also it states that one error by the computer has a far bigger impact than one caused by a human. Last but not least it says that we are not used to a computerized voting sytem and also the realisation of banking transactions have took its time.
