The person who wrote the text is for computer votings. His arguments are: 
-It`s easier to find the right candidate. (easy-to-use touch-screen technology)
-There will be any human mistakes any more. The computer techology are much more shure than human counters.
-It`s much faster than if the humans have to count all the votes.

But the person who spoke the text is against computer voting. That`s what he`s saying:
-There are people who have a ,,fear of technology``. So they can`t go voting any more.
-Not everyone can afford a computer, so they poor ones can not vote anymore.

-It can`t be truly trusted because we can`t check the results.
-You give highly sensitive information to the Internet, so everyone can watch it.
