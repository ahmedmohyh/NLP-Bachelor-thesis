The presentation directly oposses many of the earlier mentioned advantegeses of a computer based voting system. One of the main points of the presentation are the possible mistakes that could do much more harm if using a computer system. Miscounting by a computer could mean thousands of votes miscounted or missed completely, while as with a human based system there are mostly only minor counting mistakes done by the employes. A complicated electronic system is als not capable of recounting. While really expensive recounting is at least possible with the current voting system. The other heavily relied on point is that many people don't trust computers with such an important task. In the text our complete dependence on computers in other fields such as banking is mentioned. The presentation raises some questions about a reliability of a computer system, that is used at most twice a year. Both the presentation and the text make a point, that using their prefered system is easier for the people.
