Would it be better to use computerized voting systems instead of traditional ones?
The text says that traditional counting of votes is inefficient and inaccurte. The people counting the votes would make too easily mistakes, what is not really astonishing because they have to count thousands of  votes a day. And if they make a mistake a long and disturbing way of recounting begins.
The presentation confirmed that the people make easily a mistake and then they have to recount thousand of ballots. But recounting would not be as bad as if a computer system would have an error. Because when that would happen the whole election would be rigged. 
The text confesses that it would be a very difficult mission to implement a complicated voting technology nationwide. And in the presentation it is said that for people who are not familiar with modern technology it would cause trouble voting your conscious. In the text it is said that people entrust modern technology in many situations of the daily life but not when it comes to elections. The presentation refers to the same point and explains this contradicting situation with the reason that for example money machines are used much more often and a nationwide election would just be every two years.
