Altough computer voting systems tend to make less mistakes than us humans, an error by a computer will be much more damaging than a mistake made by a human individual. The worst thing that could happen is, that everything could get deleted permanentely, so it would cost a huge amount of money and more effort to repeat the whole voting. But if an human individual makes a mistake he can easily correct it. 

 Of course computers are doing less errors that doesn't mean that they don't make any. As mentioned before an error made by a computer can be much more annoying, even if it's just a small mistake, the whole procedure could get eliminated by that "small mistake" so that means they do not remove the possibility and if that happens everything must be repeated again under the circumsatnces that they find the small error! So the Argument that computers are always faster depends on the situation.
