There are two sides of people. The one is for replacing the old traditional voting system with the new efficient and trustworthy computers. But are computers really better than the traditional system.

 Pro-computer people say that a human who votes doesn't know really much about the person they vote for because they weren'r really good informated. As a resualt it's really hard to vote for them if the have to go though all the names and choose one of them. Furthermore they have to make a cross next to the name of their favorite candidate which can't be read really good by the counters with a poor eyesight. Because of that many votes are wrong and in the worsest case the wrong candidate wins the voting. Another fact is that the counters have to go through over a thousand of billots filled with crosses and over a hundert names. With the time they are very exhausted and don't want to read more sheets because they just can't do it. It's like when we are reading a very long text again and again and again. In the end we don't want to read this text anymore.

On the other hand the Contra-computers say that the computers were also programmed by the human hand and because of that they aren't so much better than counting the ballots by hand. And if one computer makes a mistake or just have an error the whole voting is wrong and unusable. This group of people say also that many humans are afraid of the technology and don't belive in it. The computers also doesn't work really flawless because the are only used like one or two times a year and that fact make the system works slower.

In my opinion both systems are very good and each one has it's prioritys. And we are all just humans and make mistakes but the computer does that too.
