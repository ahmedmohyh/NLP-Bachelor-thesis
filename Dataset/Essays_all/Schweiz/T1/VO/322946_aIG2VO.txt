Of course there are a few problems in the current traditional voting but there are also a lot of advantages. Computers may seem easy for people who are used to computers but a lot of people have a lot of difficulties with computers or can`t even afford a computer. For older people it would be really hard to choose the right vote, it`s much easier when they do it on a normal sheet of paper than on a computer.
At second, computers are also just things programmed by human. The computer just has to make one error and the whole votes would be miscounted. This would really be totallly unefficient. Maybe it takes longer when people count all the votes by themselves but there wouldn`t be any errors at all and we can trust the solution. 
In the bank or at other works they use computers daily and they don`t really have any problems anymore. But at the beginning the computers weren`t that good at all. The votings are just once in two years, so the computers wouldn`t be as used to it as they are at a bank office. 
Technology is really good nowadays but we can`t always trust technology. We have to be critical because even technology makes a few errors and this would be a big influence for the whole votings in the United States. 
So at last I want to say that technological voting is hardly sufficient and wouldn`t make any sense untill the computers get safer and better.
