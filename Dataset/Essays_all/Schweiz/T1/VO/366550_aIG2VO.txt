In the following essay I will summarise the different opinions of two people, same are about voting. The first one particurarly criticised current voting systems. He sais that they often lead to inaccurate voting and are not very trustworthy. The second one has the opinion, that computers can also cause some mistakes in voting, like humans. The first guy sais, that current voting systems can also lead people to vote for the wrong candidate, because the sheet of paper on which they have to choose their candidates is very large with lot's of names on it and people who can't see very well easily can vote for the wrong person. On the other hand, the second person sais, that current systems may have problems, but with computers it wouldn't be better. What about people who can't deal with computers? What about the ones who doesn't use them in daily life? Would it make less people to vote, because they've got fear of technology?
On thing, which he also wasn't sure about, is what would happen if a computer got hacked or simply has an error in the program. He thinks, that it would take a lot of time, to develop a computer system which was reliable enough to use it and that actually works for everyone.
