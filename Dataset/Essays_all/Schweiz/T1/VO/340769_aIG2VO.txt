In the presentation that I just heard, many negative points of the computerized voting in elections were explained. Many people still are not used to working with computers or don`t even have one at home, so that would already cause a problem and it would be quite difficult for these people to vote then. In the text it is written that in the traditional systems people may also have problems, like marking the wrong name as there are many names on the sheets. Furthermore it is said that the current voting system is too inefficient and not trustworthy because people have to count all the votes and could easily make mistakes - computers would be a lot faster. On the other hand computers may also cause errors as they are programed and made by humans, if they have a mistake in the system they could delete all the vote sheets. But they are also used in the bank systems and in most professions today, so humans trust them in the most sensitive things. There are a lot of advantages but also some disadvantages when we would use computers in the elections, so we will see what the future holds.
