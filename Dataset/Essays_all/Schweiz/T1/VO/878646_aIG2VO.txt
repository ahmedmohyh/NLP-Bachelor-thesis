Traditional voting or computerized voting

The main argument in this presentation was, that people who don't have a computer or don't understand how to use a computer, won't be able to vote with the computerized voting machines. Also an argument was, that the computers will have errors or other problems, which will be more dangerous than some people who set a ballot wrong. That is different to the text, where they say, that the possibility of a human error is much higher than from a computeriezed systems also it wouldn't be something completly new, that computers have to deal with highly sensitive informations.
