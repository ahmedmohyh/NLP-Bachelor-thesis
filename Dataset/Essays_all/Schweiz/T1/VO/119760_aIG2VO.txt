In Switzerland we have no problems with the voting system but in other countrys likethe United States of America they have bigger problems with the whole voting system. The people want to replace the counting system, which is done so far by humans, with computers, because computers do not make as many mystakes as humans do. But is this really correct?

Computers maby seem easy to use and to handle for those who have one at home or at workt, but for example a poor family can not afford a computer and they have absolutly zero know-how about computers. If the government replace the old voting system with the new computers, many people will have trouble with this system because the dont know how to use it. If many people have trouble with the voting, they maby vote for the wrong person, or stop voting because it is not that easy how it was.

An other point is also mistakes. The people are affraid that those people who count the votes make mistakes or fake the ellection. With the computer voting system this problemshould be solved because computers do not make mistakes. Wrong! Many people forget that computers are programed by humans and humans normaly do mistakes. So if this voting machine/computer has an error or a virus thousands and thousands votes will ble lose forever and they can not be refreshed again.

At the end we have to say that the computers also have many weak points like the humans. We are now in 2016 and i also think it is impossible to stop that things getting more electonic so Thats why I think that the ellection will be with computers in the near futr because even if they do mistakes I think they are more exaclty than humans even if they are programed by humans. Those who do not know how to use a computer will maby get help from the government. The ellection will be online in the Futur.
