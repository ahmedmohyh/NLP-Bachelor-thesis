A few people think that the traditional voting system in the United States should be replaced with far more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems. In the traditional voting system its easy to make a mistake by voting for the wrong candidate. Another problem is that the counting goes wrong, because there are thousands of ballots that a counter has to go trough one by one. But the idea of voting at the computers is questionable. Its easy for those people, who grew up with the technology to deal with computers and to make no mistakes at votings. But what is with the other people? A wrong vote could happen so fast because of the missing knowledge with the computers. 
The humans even make mistakes when they count with hands. So why should voting at a computer be a better idea, when the computer is invented by humans? Nowdays, the bank is fully automatized. But a difference is, that you can use the bank automat daily, its improved for today. The voting is once or twice in a year. How can we be sure that it is really going to work without mistakes?
