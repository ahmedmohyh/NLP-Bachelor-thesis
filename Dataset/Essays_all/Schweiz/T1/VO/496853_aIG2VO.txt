The text has the idea to use technology for voting because it says that it will be easier. But the speaking person argues against many points of technology. First of all the person says that there are still many people who aren`t used to computers. For them it won`t be any easier to use the touch screen than to mark the right name on the paper. Secondly there is the thing with the misscounting. It is possible that there is made a mistake, if the votes are counted. But the big question is: Are we sure that computers not make any mistakes? The person says that computers are also made by humans, so it is not possible to say that the we remove human error. And if there really is a mistake it is huge on the computer compared to what happens if a human makes some small counting misakes. So maybe the computers won`t do better than humans. And the last point is that it is impossible to recount the votes if they were made on the computer. It might take a long time to recount everything by humans, but at least it works. 
If there will ever be a technology-voting people need first to get used to it like online banking and it is important to make sure that this really works.
