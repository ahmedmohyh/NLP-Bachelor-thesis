Can computers improve the voting system of America? 
Computers are very helpful in our daily lifes but are they able to make the current voting system more accurate?
Some people say that computers would not make anything better. There are a lot of people, who are not used to computers or/ and are also afraid of them. In America live people, which can not even afford a computer. How are they going to vote? 
Other people claim that errors made by voters would happen less often. For example checking the wrong name. With computers, the visability of the candidates names are better and less mistakes are made, which are often caused by poor eyesight.
Officials often have to count the votes one by one. Mistakes are going to happen for sure. With a computerized system, there would be no human error and the counting would be fast and efficient, say some critics. Others claim, that computer system, which are always written by humans, would contain also human errors. These would have in comparison with a single wrong-counted vote a much worse consequence if there is an error in a computer system. There is in that case the chance that thousands of votes are counted wrongly.
Even though computers are used in the banking system, where it^s also crucial that mistakes don^t happen, the computer for the voting system is not used as much as in the banking system, so we can not fully rely of its functionality.
