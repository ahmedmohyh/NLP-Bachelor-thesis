In those two statements, I have heard and read, they talk about the pros and contras of using computers for the voting. 
In the text they say, that it would be very useful to use computers for the voting and that the voting results by ballots are not relaiable enough. they are counted by humans and they make mistakes and its also really expensive, specially when there is a recount needed. It is also a problem that its really easy to make a mistake for the voter while making a mark on the ballot because there are a lot of names on it. Especially for people who are not seeing well its really hard to make their mark on the right place. 
The woman says, that it would be easy to vote on a computer for people who are used to it. But there are still people who are not using a computer or who are not owning one. That could leed to less participation and thats not good. The computers are also programmed by humans so there could happen some mistake as well and they would be major mistakes. She also says, that its not possible to desing a programm that works perfectly from the beginning. It was the same with the e-banking. they improved it a lot over the years to make it as relaiable as it is now.
