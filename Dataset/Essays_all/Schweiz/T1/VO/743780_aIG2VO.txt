The computer dominated voting system is bad for the elections in the united states. 
The system would not be perfect for a quite some time because computer programms have some mistakes when they first come out most of the time. They might not make any counting mistakes when they are set up right but it's very likely that there's some kind of human error in the programm. The error following a mistake in the programm would have a much bigger impact then the human failure in counting names of the ballots. In the text the writer talks about the fact that some people may accidently vote for the wrong candidate because of bad eyesight or other problems. This may be true but could happen even if there's a well running computer system, even though it's less likely going to happen because you could zoom in to see the names correctly. On the other hand the program would have some major advantages when it comes to the counting speed which can't really be discredited.
In my opinion it would be a move in the right direction to work on a programm for elections but you would have to be carefull so there's a minimized chance of any programming issues.
