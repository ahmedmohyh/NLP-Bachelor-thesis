Some critics say that the current voting system has to be replaced with coputerized voting systems because the current voting system often leads to errors. With the new system everything is going to be more easy and there won't be any errors anymore. The new system is easy to use and people won't vote accidentally for the wrong candidate. Computers are also used in other ways like banking transaction or in the communication of highly sensitive information. Other critics don't think a new voting system would do a better job. They say with computers there can be even more errors because computers are programmed by humans and it's jsut normal that humans make mistakes. So if there is an error in the computer, the computer might count every vote wrong and this would be more tragical than just a few wrong counted votes. An other problem is that not everyone who likes to vote also has a computer and not everyone has the money to buy one. Many persons, specially older persons, don't know how to use a computer and the new system just would be easy to use for the ones wich use computers regulary.
