In the audio part, the major arguments were that their are some people who don't own a computer. So they can't get involved in the vote. Also their are a lot of people who are not used to them. So they would not understand where to vote or how to vote. Also they don't trust the computer evrything maybe the computer have a bug or somthing similar.
The elections in the greatest land of earth are only all two years. So if the programm has an error in it it would make the whole election wrong. The programm is not used often and so they wouldn't find the mistakes or bug directly.
In the opinnion of the text they would prefer computers but in the presentation, they said it could have an error in it and so the whole election would be false. The text thinks that people wouldn't make errors when they can search the names in the computer programm. But here is also the same arrgument from the audio part against this one. There is the possibility that it has an error in the programm. The text trust the computer evrything but the audio part thinks don't trust the computer.
