The text says, that computerized voting systems would be much more efficent than the old-fashioned ballot system. But in the presentation it is mentioned that many people think that the computer sytem would cause a lot more problems. One reason for that is, that in the text it says that many people have trouble with the ballot system, for example if their eyesight is bad they won't be able to clearly see the name they're choosing. On the other hand if the system would be computerized, it would be much easier to choose the right candidate's name. But the presentation claims that computers are a bad idea and that people who can't afford a computer or people who are afraid of technic will not be able to vote. Another point that the text makes is that if you let humans count the votes it will be a lot more likely that mistakes happen and that this could be avoided through machines. The presentation does not agree with that, it says that first of all machines are programmed by humans, so who guaratees that these programmers didn't make any mistakes. Second of all, if a human makes a counting mistake it may be expensive to correct but the mistake can easily be taken care of. Then again if a computer makes a mistake the whole vote would have to be done again, that is what the presentation says. The text claims that those counting mistakes comitted by humans could be avoided, if computers were used to do the voting.
