The women in the hearing section doubts that computer tecnologie will be more reliable in elections than counting out the ballots by people. She says it takes years to develop a programm that people can trust. They don't have the time and the possibilities to try the programms out since there's only an election every two years. An other argument she brought up was that a lot of people weren't very familiar with computers, especially the older generation. And if there is a mistake with the programm and the election has do be done again, the computer is not able to do a recount. 
Well, the text does not agree with those arguments. It says that the sheet of paper people are supposed to put their vote on is very confusing and for people with bad eyes hard to read, which can lead to false answers. With computers they would just have to click the screen, but thats exactly what the women in the hearing section critisises. The text makes it very clear that computers would be a much better solution than counting out every vote one by one which of course does lead to miscounts too. These people obviously have the exact oppisit oppinions on this subject and do not agree in any of it.
