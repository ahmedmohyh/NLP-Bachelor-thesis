The lecturer critizized the computirized voting machines. He said that people, who have less understandind about technology, in this case about computers, will have problems with the ethernet voting. The other critical point he talked about, is the errors in computer programms. The voting programm ist programmed by humans, which means errors in the programm are possible. Another problem is that, when ther is a programmerror, it will besuspected after the whole population vted. If the votes were miscounte by the computer, because of this programmerror, it will nearly be impossible to reccount the votes.
The text about the new voting posibillity was very supportive about it. While the lecture said that some peolpe, with a lack of understanding in computer, will have problems. THe text reassured, that the programm will be very easy, because it's an touch scrren technology. The population, just has to click on the name of the person they want to vote for. Another point which was said in the text, is that it's nearly impossible that the programm will have errors, because it will be tested over and over again, until it's perfect.We can use the example of E-Banking. The technology was tested, until it was perfect and now quite everbody is using it. It's more likely that some people will make mistakes with th old-fashioned way of voting. Because the names of the candidates are all writed on one ballot, and it's it's much more difficult to read them on the ballot, then on the computer, beause the computer has a zoom function.
