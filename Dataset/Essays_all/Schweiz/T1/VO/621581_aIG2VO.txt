Traditional voting isn`t that good. People vote for the wrong candidats and the reasons for this is that they have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names. So for people with poor eyesight or people who don`t read very well, the wrong name is easily chosen. That`s what the text said. The text is talking about to replace the Traditional voting with computerized voting. With these machines we would use an easy-to-use- touch-sreen technology. That means, a voter needs only to touch the candidats name on the screen to record a vote for him. As easy as it sounds, the presentation and some people say that it`s to risky to use computerized voting. Yes of corse human make mistakes, but we cannot forget that computers are also human made. So what if they also have faults? We use a lot of computers nowadays, like in the bank or in airports or something. In this case we use them daily, but The voting happens only ones, all two years, so the computers cannot be trust that easily. And maybe not even all people understands the whole computerized voting, maybe they`re to old, maybe they don`t use computers or maybe they just don`t trust in them. 
So now the question is, witch voting system causes more problems and more faults? Honestly I`m for the traditional voting. As the name says it`s something traditional, and yes voters may not chose to right candidat, but to be honest, do you really thinkt that making a fault once or twice is that dramatic? I think computerized voting is more dangerous. We can take an example on the ETH computerized tests. If the network breaks apart, we cannot do anything and we weren`t able to vote... So let`s be traditional.
