Peoples in the USA don't trust the computer voting system. The persons, who are against the computer voting bring up the argument, that not every person can afford him a computer for voting his candidate. A second argument is that computers allways be programmed by humans, so if a human would made a fault it could have crucial concequences for the result of the vote. Also an argument is, that no computer works without any mistakes. Buy on the other side the prof. said that ,in our time, we have to trust computers, we trust them allready in the banking system. 
The text has the opignion that the current votingsystem used in the Usa is inefficient and lead the person to cheat. They have the opignion that it would be better if there would be a easy-to-use-touch-screen-technologie, so you can press on the name of a candidate and your vote is counted. Now people, who are old or don't see good anymore, vote sometimes for the wrong person because it isn't overvievable, and the persons, who have to count the votes make a lot of mistakes. So it would aols be easyer for the people who have to count the votes, they can simple watch at the screen and see the number.
