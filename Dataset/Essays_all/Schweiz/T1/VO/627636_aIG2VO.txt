The presentation says that it is hard for peoples how are not used to computers and have truble with thems. The peoples could easily vote for the wrong person or they could vote all together because of fear. But we also have to think about our daily live, with all the banking systems and all the technology around us. We all know that humans are failing. But what is if a computer is also making a mistacke because its programmed by humans. That would have a much more bigger influence to the votingsysteme

The audio says that it would be easy for the people who haven't a good relation to computers to vote without them.But the text says, that there could also be much mistackes in the old system cause the old people ore some with eye problems could make a cross by the wrong candidat. An there is a simple new system by witch you have a touchscreen an you simply have to touch the name of the persone. So there are also easy electronic voting systems. And in the old systems the peoples have to go throug long lists so its also very possible that they will make an error. But the audio means, that to oldfashioned system is making less mistackes than the computers. And the text also says that it is more possible that humans are making faults than the computers. The to articels have the same meaning if its about today, we are all sourounded by technology all the time.
