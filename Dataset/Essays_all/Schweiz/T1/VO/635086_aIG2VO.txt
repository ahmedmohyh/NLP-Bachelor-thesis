The question is, if they change the counting system for votings, will it be more efficient and do they make less mistakes? So the first topic which was mentioned was that computers are difficult for non compuer users. For example when someone has a poor eyesight. But in the text they mentioned that it is really difficult to read the papers for voting and they make mistakes because of that. 
An other point was that humans mike mistakes while counting but computers are built of humans and like that they also make mistakes. According to that the text sais that computer systems are used in banking systems as well and it is working. The only differnce is that they are used for a long time and the mistakes are corrected. So it would be a really big problem if the computerized voting system would error and all the informations would be lost forever. And in the end the speaker said that banking systems are used a lot but voting systems would only be used all two years. Because of that it would be really difficult to correct all the problems in a short time.
