The human race is imperfect. We make mistakes. This leads to mistakes that can happen during traditional voting and have a great impact on the result. Because of the voting system currently used that relies so much on people, there are chances that some people especially those with eye conditions may accidently vote for the wrong candidate because they have to find the name of their candidate in favour on a long list. With a touch-screen the voting could be made much quicker and easier. More common mistakes are made while counting thousands and thousands of votes. Of course real people count them and a mistake is easily made and can lead to serious affects on the election results.

But is technology perfect? Computer voting systems are created by humans and if we make mistakes, who can garantee that the systems don't have mistakes in them? A mistake caused by the system can have much worse affect since thousands of votes can be miscounted or even worse completely lost. One should also take in consideration that not everyone can afford a computer or knows somebody owning one. In such a digitalised world we easily forget about citizens especially older people who are not familiar with our technology and could have a hard time trying to vote. Because of that many might get discouraged. The argument from the text saying that our lifes function perfectly with our nowadays common computer systems we use like banking transactions isn't taking some points in consideration. They do function well but they also needed  do develop and improve and that took a long time. It could've taken a longer time if they wouldn't have been used on every day basis. But elections are only every two years in the USA. One could think the effort to make this computer system for technological voting consumes too much time.
