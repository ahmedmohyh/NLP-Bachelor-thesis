The United States have a problem, should the people vote per computer? 
The speaker said, that it's a problem to vote per computer because many of the people don't use or don't have a computer and they often tick the wrong vote. but also a computer can make mistakes, somtimes there is a technology problem and the computer counts not every vote. But maybe the vote per computer is better than a vote with a paper. 
The text said, thet the people normally vote with a paper and that they have to find the name of their candidate on a long list. Another problem is that the people with poor eyesight easly mark the wrong name. So the key for this problem should be computers. The voter have only to touch the candidate's name on the screen, so it will be easier. One more problem is to count the votes. The text said, that people count the votes and the speaker said, that compuers count the votes. But both will make some mistakes by counting the votes. The text said also that a compoterized system will remove the possibility of human error, the counting will be done quickly and automatically by the computers.
