In the presentation they said that the computers, are something you can't trust when it comes to count votes. It was also said that humans could make errors but comuters also can do but the errors of the humans have a much lighter weigh in the elections, because they could may oversee some of the votes but if a computer makes an error there could be a thousands of votes which are miscounted. 
There are also who never use a computer, and that could come to errors in how they vote. 
The text says the other thing! It is said that you have to give manimalisticly you have to give the computers to give a thought. And that the technic is developing since the developement of the computer The text says thet the computers are reliable enough to count votes. The main theme in the text is that computers by now is that computers are more reliable against the saying of the presentation which says that humans are more reliable. That is the complete contrary!
