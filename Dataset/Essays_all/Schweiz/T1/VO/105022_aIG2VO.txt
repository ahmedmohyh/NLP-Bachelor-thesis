The big question is: "Should the traditional voting system be replaced with a computerized voting system?" 
The text says that the traditional way should be replaced because it is really difficult for people to find the right name on these large papers. With the help of computers it would be easier, especially for the people with poor eyesight. Another problem with the traditional system is, that officials have to count up the votes one by one, with this method it is obviously that they make some mistakes. Computers would make this automatically and they would remove the possibilities of human error. 
In the presentation the woman critised the computerized voting system. She questioned the point, that not everybody has a computer at home especially old people. Another problem is that not everybody can or want afford one.
