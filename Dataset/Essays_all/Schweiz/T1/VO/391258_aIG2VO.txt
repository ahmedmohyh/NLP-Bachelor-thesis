In the reading it was said that the biggest advantage of the computorized voting systems would be a decrease in mistakes and errors. It`s widely know that making mistakes is considered human but you can´t really afford to make mistakes in such an important matter as voting. If one person of the counters counts wrong you can start from the beginning and that`s a lot of wasted time and expenses. Often people even vote accidently for someone or something that they`re not even supporting because of bad vision or other complaints. With computorized voting you just have to touch the name of the project or person you are supporting and it`s done. The rest is up to the computers and computers are perfect calculators and are known to make never mistakes. That system would be more secure, user-friendly and easy to use.
On the other hand in the presentation they criticized the idea of such an inovation. There are people who aren`t used to computers or can`t even afford them. That could cause a fear of technology in some people. They probably wouldn`t want to vote then. Additonally it`s doubtful if it would even improve the situation because it`s a human being that`s programming those machines in the end and humans make often some grave mistakes. One programming error could cause a loss of thousands of votes and there  wouldn`t be any physical records of those votes. It wouldn`t be necessary to implement such a system because you go only once or two times in a year to vote. While it`s quite comfortable to manage your bank account from a computer but that`s something you do every week. And those bank systems are trusted because they have been improved over the years and were made safer and more reliable. The voting system is something new and there obviously weren`t any oppurtunities to improve that or search for flaws.
