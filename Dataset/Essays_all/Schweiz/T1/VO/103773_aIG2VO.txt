Voting in the US has so far been on paper. Critics would like to replace the traditional systems to a more modern way by using technology.
Using Computers as a way of voting has its advantages and disadvantages. By going modern, human mistakes like voting for the wrong candidat or not counting correctly would dissapear but new problems would come along. If a human made a mistake, it would mot make a big difference, maybe a vote or two. However if the computer were to make a mistake, it could affect thousands of votes and lead to a major disater.
And what about the people that do not have enough money to have a computer, have not had any contact eith compuers at all or just do not have any basic knwledge with computers? This would probably cause a lack of voting and maybe more mistakes.
