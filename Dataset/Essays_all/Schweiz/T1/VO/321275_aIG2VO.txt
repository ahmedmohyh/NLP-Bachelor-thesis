For an election there are two types of counting votes: the traditional voting and the computerized voting. One of the problems that occur at the traditional elections is that the people make mistakes. One of them is people chosing the wrong candidate. Voters have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper cointaining many names,so the voters can easily mark the wrong name. Another thing about the traditional voting is the counting. Offcials must count the votes one by one. Since they have to deal with thousands of ballots it is probable that they will make mistakes. If they make a mistake they would have to start again. 

So to avoid these problems humans have created the computerized voting. Which has been improved from time to time for a better counting.The computerized voting consists in touching the candidate's name on the touch-screen. The names are easier to find which solves the problem of chosing the wrong candidate. The voting is also easier. The programm counts all the votes quicker and exactly. If there is a mistake it is also easier to detect and solve. 

The conclusion is that both of the systems are made by humans. Humans make mistakes, so that means that we can't be sure if that works. But humans are trying to improve the programms so that it can be reliable for everybody and make it easier to vote.
