The new voting systems are much easier to handle with because of the computers and their technology. But it isn't as easy for people who aren't used to computers. The text says that there's an easy-to-use touch-screen so everyone can do it even if they don't use computers that much. But what if the people can't afford a computer and never got used to it? So they may have a fear of technology and won't do any votes.
The text says that with the old voting system you have to count every vote one by one and so it's nearly inevitable to make mistakes. But on the other hand as it is said in the listening a computer can do a much bigger mistake because it could forget to count more than 1000 votes while a human can only forget a few ballots.
In many businesses there's a huge trust in technology and computers are everywhere used, so why shouldn't it be used nationwide to vote. Maybe it's too risky and complicated because the computers are also just programms made by humans and if they made an error there it would be much worse, as the listening says.
