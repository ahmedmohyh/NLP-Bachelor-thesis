There are many concerns about the voting system of today. Technology takes over in so many aspects of our lives, that it might also be used for voting. Some people welcome that idea, some don't. First of the old voting system is seen as inefficient, because mistakes easily happen. As for example, people vote for the wrong candidate, because those large sheets of paper are quite unpractical, when it comes to making a small mark next. Also those votes need to be counted by people, which is a risk, because humans make mistakes and could count wrong. With computers those mistakes wouldn't happen some say, but there needs to be considered, that computers are also programmed from humans and an error would be far more serious, because it would affect thousands of votes, not a single bullet from one person. There also wouldn't be a physical record for the recount, which if done the old way, wouldn't be a problem. Also some people are not as confident with technology as some others. So there are up and down sides for both of the techniques, neither of them is perfect.
