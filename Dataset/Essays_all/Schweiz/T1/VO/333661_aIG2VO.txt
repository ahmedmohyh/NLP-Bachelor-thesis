In the text, were many critics about the traditional voting. When someone is voting in a traditional way, he has to find the name of the candidate he wants to vote for on a large scheet of paper with many names on it - the ballot. From these ballots are then often count up the cotes one by one by officals. It's a long process with a high possibility of human errors. It sais, that it's also very hard for people with a poor eyesights to find the wright name.
A little bit different is the voting on a computer. It makes it a little bit easier to count up all the votes, but, as said in the listening, if the computer has an error in the computer programm it's worse than having some human errors. The listening also said, that it's more difficult for people who aren't used to computers or for people who can't afford one to vote on a computer.
In both, the text and the listening, it's said, that human errors and an error in a computer system costs a long and expensive recount to take place.
