In the United States there are different voting systems. There is the traditional system, where humans count the numbers of electors a candidate has made , and there is the computerized system, where computers count the electors. But what is better ?
In traditional voting the electors can make a cross at the name of their favorite candiate. But its a long list and not everybody in the States have got brilliant eyes. It can accidentily happen that old or ill people make a cross at the wrong place. When they send the ballot to the office there it will be counted. It's logical that human make mistake , so if at the office the worker reads to fast he can make a mistake. 
So critics say that it would be better to computerized the voting ballot. There wouldn't be so many mistake because peolpe with bad eyes can zoom and its easier to count.  But what is whith all the peolpe who hasn't any experience with computers? The fighters for the computerized voting  say the computer doesn't do any mistakes or much less than humen. But is this true ? The system isn't daily used and who can promise that it will work 100 percent ?  It's possible that computers mix up the names and the ballots or what if the voting for candiate A gives a vote for candiate B ? We have to ask us, what's worse ? Is it so bad if candiare A has a few electers less because the worker at the office had a bad day or is it worse if all the voting for A counts for B ?
