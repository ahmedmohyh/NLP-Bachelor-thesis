Every year, the voting is done by hand. People have to look up their candidate's name to record a vote. But today, they want to do the voting on the computer. The presentation about voting was against the computer voting. The computer voting might be easier, but for those, who are very bad with technology and know nothing about comupters, its impossible to vote for the right person. Its better to do it by hand because computers do often have errors. It could happen, that a error in the computer counts alot more votes for the wrong candidate, and thats a huge problem. But the text remains the easier viewing and faster voting. Its quickly and automatically. Humans are better than computers says the presentation. But the text gives a whole other statement. They say its much more difficult to count the votes one by one. There could be made a misstake very easely, by discounting a vote or losing the right number of the votes.
