In the text you see, that the traditional voting isn't a good system. The counting by humans is problematic, because there are thousands of votes and if a fault is detected the follows are expensive and long recounts. But good thing, there are computers which can easily and quickly count the votes without any mistakes. Also for the voters it's easier to vote, because they only have to touch the candidates name. In the presentation you could hear, that the cons of having the computers for the voting system is a little bit terrifying. Not all people have or can afford a computer, some do not understand how to use a computer. Many people are also scared of computers, of its technology, they don't trust them. They are terrified that people can see who they vote for, so they just choose the candidate which is chosen more popular and chosen. Computers are used heavily and daily. The banking, taxes and all those other sensitive, secret and important things are handled by computers. The whole intimity of the world is held in computers. But the votings, elections are only once in two years. It's hard to lose the trust issues against the computer for something that important and rare.
So the sticking point is; is it better to use the computer for the votings or should the people stay in their traditinons.
I think it's nice to stay with the traditions, as the woman said ' Computers are programmed by humans', I think humans can do,  as our ancestorsdid, still the counting.
