In today's highly computerized world, it is astonishing that the procedure used to calculate the votes in United States elections is not digitalized. Critics of this system suggest the introduction of a new election method involving electronic vote. However, there are also certain disadavantages of such digitalized voting.

While the majority of Americans nowadays are familiar with the use of computers, there are still thousands of citizens who aren't. They are mostly elderly people who either do not have access to computers or who just don't use them regularly. The introduction of an electronic voting system might lead to discouraging them from voting, which would not be in line with a democracy's aim at getting people to decide. The argument that old-style ballots are not handy for people having poor eyesight surely exists, but an electronic poll system compensating these inconvenients would probably lead to even more people not able to vote to their desire.

Of course, the counting-up of votes on a ballot is a potential cause of errors. Simple calculation errors might indeed be abolished with an e-voting tool, but the fact that humans are a latent source of mistakes will have even more severe consequences in a computer voting system. Mistakes in the program source code might lead to elections with completely wrong results, and simple recounting of ballots would not exist.

One might argue that all computer systems can have mistakes in their code and that our society already got used to electronic tools in a variety of fields - even including banking. So would electronic vote catching be more of a problem than the other fields? Modern IT-systems usually base on technologies being invented several years ago. In an early stage, most programs sometimes produced errors or even false results. While in fields, these errors have been neutralized until today, a voting system would be completely new and the risk of errors therefore particularly high.
