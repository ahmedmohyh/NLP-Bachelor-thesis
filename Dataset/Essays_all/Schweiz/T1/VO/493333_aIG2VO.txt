Debates about the current voting system are being fought. On one side there are the people who trust technology and want to implement a more efficient and fault-free voting system through computers. On the other side there are the people who are satisfied with the current system and are bringing up arguments against the new system, saying it will do only harm and no good. Computers should eliminate the problem of voters accidently voting for the wrong person because of poor eyesight and not being able to mark the correct name in the list of candidates. The opposing side however thinks that voting on computers won't make things better, they acknowledge that things will be easier, but they are saying that people who aren't accustomed to working with computers will face problems, leading to misvotes or in the worst case, discouraging people from voting altogether. The next argument the computer-supporting side brings up is the problem of the votes being counted by people who can easily make mistakes resulting in further miscounts, possibly falsifying close competitions. The opposing side denies that problem with the fact that when vote counting, only small mistakes can be made, a fault in a computer's programming however would result in thousands of wrong votes. They also argument that there is no physical evidence of the votes, making a recount of the votes impossible. Many also say that we already trust technology in many ways today, like in banking transactions and in communication. People believing in the old system answer that point with the fact that the reason we trust those technologies is because there are heavily used every day. Voting however only happens every two or three months, which means it wouldn't be practical.
