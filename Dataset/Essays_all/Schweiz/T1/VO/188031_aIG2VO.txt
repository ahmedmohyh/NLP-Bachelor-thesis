When it comes to computerized voting a lot of people already have issues with the idea. The main problem is about all the citizens who don't own a computer or are simply too afraid from technology. Both ways it can lead to unsatisfying results. Some may still vote for the wrong candidate due to the lack of computer knowledge, although this is a point that is clearly said to be improved in the text. Again others can be simply discouraged from voting at all. But it is stated that the technology could make it easier to vote and lower the amount of misvotings thanks to our touchscreen tehnology.
Eventually another major issue is the human error when it comes to counting all the ballots. A simple person can miss a couple of ballots and not count them in the worst case, but a computer error can be far more serious. A computer could loose, not only a couple, but thousands of votings and a recount is impossible since the data has been deleted for ever, the only solution would be a revote from the citizens.
With all those problems coming across some people are still sure that we can trust the modern technology like we do on our daily basis. For example a lot of personal data or transactions are made online and by technology. Human miscountings of the votes can be crucial to the final result of a vote, especially if the election is closely contested. Therefore a computer voting system could help improve the results.
