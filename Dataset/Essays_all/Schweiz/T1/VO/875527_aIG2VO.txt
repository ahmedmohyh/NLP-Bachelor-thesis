Computerized Voting

Elections are, in the U.S.A as well as in every other nation, very important. They decide who becomes the leader of an entire nation, that's why mistakes during the elections can have terrible consequences. With the traditional elections come the problems of human failure. For example, people with bad eyesight can accidentally mark the wrong candiate on the ballot and there are without doubt tons of people with eye issues. Another problem comes with the counting system; it's mostly counted by hand, so again human failure can have a huge impact on the election. Doesn't that make the solution look easy? Just replace the humans with machines and noone has to to worry anymore?
That sounds too easy, and it actually is. Many people think that computers can't be trusted as voting systems. Yes, they cut out the possibilites of people miscounting and having issues with their sight, but don't they bring even more risks with them?
When a person is counting ballots wrong, he misses about hundred votes maybe, but a computer with a mistake in his program can miss thousands of votes! Even though most people trust machines and programs every day, the arguments against the computerized voting systems should be respected.
