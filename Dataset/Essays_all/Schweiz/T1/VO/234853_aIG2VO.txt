The woman that did the presentation was mostly against computerized voting systems. She agrees that humans do fail sometimes but human failure is less tragic than technological failure, because computers could lose all the data taken for the votes. While on the other hand people who have to count the votes can redo counting if they made a mistake, because it is so easily done. Another problem the woman has is that people who are not used to interact with computers will have a hard time because computers are such an advanced technology and getting used to them is quite hard. It is not like you create an easily understandable interface for them.  Also one big problem is that improving the errors humans made on creating the voting system would take a long time because the voting only happens once a year and is not used as much as other technology. You sure can not improve something if you are not even giving it a chance for improvement.
