The content of the presentation was generally, that we should not use computers for votings.There are many reasons why they think so. First of all, voting on computers is only possible for people that have a computer and know how to use it. Then they said that computerprogramms are made by people, and people can make mistakes.That means, just because it is a computer, it doesn't mean it can not be the mistake of a human, if  there is an error. And if there is an error, hundreds of votes will be lost or misscounted. But if a person makes a mistake, it's only one or two misscounted votes. It would also be difficult to envelope a good programm, becouase national votings in Amerika only take place every second year. So it would takes many years to correct mistakes so that the programm works without any mistakes.
The Text says exactly the other thing. Humans aren't able to count the votings correct, there are many mistakes and even if it's usual, it's bad. It says that we should replace the current system by computers, for more accurate countings. Reasons for this oppinion are, that people have to search names on huge lists with a very small writing, so people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name, because they just can't read it. It would also cost a lot to  do a recount, but sometimes it is nessecary, because of all the misstakes. 
So in generall we can say, that the text and the presentation have totally different meanings. Humans make misstakes, and so do the computers, now we have to choose, which misstakes are worse?
