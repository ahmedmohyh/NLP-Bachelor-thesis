If the population should vote by hand or on a computer is a good question. On a voting paper the names of the canditates are really close to each other and often it happens that old people or people with bad seeing mark the wrong name and vote for an other person as they actually wanted to. An other problem is that people have to count the votes and mistakes can happen pretty easely.
But would it be better if we would vote on a computer?  Sure a computer can count the votes much faster but if the voting is on a computer all the voters would have to know how to use one. Also they would have to able to afford one. So people who don`t know how to deal with computers or are afraid of tecnology won't have a chance to vote. Computers are programed by humans so it is possible as well that there are errors. But if a computer has an error it can be so much more problematic than a person who just counted the votes a little wrong. If the computer is programed wrong it can mix up all the votes and a recount is not possible. So if there is an error it is much worse than if there would be an error in the onld system.
In banking we are used to comupters doing everything for us but they do it every day and for a long time now. In the USA people only vote once or twice a year so it would take dacades to improve the tecnology for the voting. because you would always have to wait a year to try the thing, which got improved.
So neither of the systems are perfect and everyone can decide which one would work best for themselfes.
