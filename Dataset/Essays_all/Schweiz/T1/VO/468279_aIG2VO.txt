The traditional voting system in the United States is inaccurate. The major problems that are leading to this inaccurity are, that people with poor eyesight often mark the wrong name on the ballot, as well as that the voting system has to rely on the people that count the votes. They think, that a good way to solve this problem, would be to use computerized voting machines.
On the other hand, there are people who do not like the idea of the computerized voting machines. They think, that altough it might be more accurate in counting votes most of the  time, there still is a possibility, that errors in the system appear (because the computers are programmed by humans), which leads to a way bigger inaccurity than in the old system. Other complex computer technology like bank systems had to be improved many times, which clearly would not be possible in our case, since elections are only twice a year.They also say, that people who can not afford computers or who never use them can be afraid of voting and for example accidentally click on all of the names.
