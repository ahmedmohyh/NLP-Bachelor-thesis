One point that is mentioned in the text above is that people with poor eyesight might have some real trouble placing the marks next to the right name on the ballots and that a computerized system would ease the struggle by giving the people an option to magnify and then click the names on screen. Now, according to the lady I just listened to that allegedly isn't as easy as it sounds. People who're used to computers might not find it very challenging, but for example for older people, who've never used a computer in their whole life, it might not be as easy. Using computers for voting would also bring the problem of everyone having to have a PC at home, and that surely isn't possible, due to not everyone being able to afford a computer or laptop.
The text also hints at the possibility of humans making mistakes when counting the votes. Using a programmed system that actually works would set the chance of that happening to zero, however if it doesn't work flawlessly, things could go very wrong. Thousands upon thousands of votes would not be counted, which could change the fate of the entire country. 
"Governments and individuals alike trust other complex technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communitaction of highly sensitive information." Might be true, but these systems have not worked since day one, in reality they have been improved tirelessly over and over again to absolutely nullify the odds of mistakes. That would not be possible with a system that is only used once every year, thus making it way too risky.
