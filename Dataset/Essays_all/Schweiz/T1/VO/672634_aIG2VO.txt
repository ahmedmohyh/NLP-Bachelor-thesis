Should voting be computerized? Some people say the voting system in the United States are inefficient and inaccurate and want to replace them. They say it's partly inaccurate because people with poor eyesight sometimes vote for the wrong candidate because the names are written too small on the ballot. They can't read the names properly and confuse them, resulting in voting for another canditate.
They also say it's inaccurate because all the votes are being counted by human officials. They have to count thousands of votes, so they're bound to make a mistake sooner or later.
They think computers could solve the problems. Voting on a computer could be easier in many ways. People with poor eyesight could magnify the names of the candidates so they could read them. The computers would also count the votes more precise than a human could.
They also say computers are trustworthy because they are used for banking for example.
On the other hand, some people say it's too risky to use computers to vote. They say that besides people with poor eyesight, there are also people wich are unfamiliar with computers or don't own one. They would be excluded from voting.
These people also say that computers can make errors too. If there is a mistake somewhere in the software the votes could be miscounted or thousands of votes could be deleted forever. Humans may make mistakes, but computer errors are worse, they say.
They also say that computers need to be improved all the time. Voting is only seldom, so it would take a long time until the computers would be fully improved. Until then, they could make crucial errors.
