The securance of voting results has become a problem in the United States already a while ago. Earlier on, less people used to vote, but nowadays much more ballots have to be counted so that mistakes are kind of inevitable.There are many possiblity how mistakes can occure, by counting the votes eighter by humans, or by computers.  Many years ago this did not use to be a problem because there were not that many people voting. But nowadays there are thousands of voters in the United States. There is the possibility of using computer counting programms which should count correctly. But what happens if there is a mistake in the programm, made by humans? It would cause many votes to disappear or be counted for the wrong party, and therefor the results would be highly affected.  As a matter of fact in elections the  number of votes for two candites are  quite often pretty close together. So each small mistake could make a big difference. 

The main problem for voters is that they easily vote for somebody they did not want to, without even reaslising it. Especially elder people with sight problems might be struggeling by choosing their candidates. But with the new technology those problems start to disappear as everything can be viewed much bigger and  in much more detail.
