Critics think the current voting system in the United States are inefficient and are just not modernized to the standarts now. They would like to change the system to one which would use trustworthy computerprograms to vote.
The critics think that a computerprogram (if it is trustworthy) is far more efficient than humans can be. They are more accurate fast and even do very rarely any mistakes. Aswell as they are more costefficency. So they think computers are just far more efficient than humans.
The critics against a new system think that one mistake in a computerprogram can be far more serious than some of a few human ones. Because one mistake will be multiplied a lot more than a few humans could do. Aswell new computerprograms tend to have a lot of flaws and they need to improve with time and experience. But voting onces a year does not give fast experience to improve. So they think computerprograms are not flawless and need to improve with time but for a voting you can not allow this "improvemt time".
The other party think that not regular computer user might get confused and get scared to vote because of they do not want to failing in voting. Aswell older people need to learn the new system which might be hard for some of them. In the end they are saying it is to hard to learn and maybe they just do not learn it and stop voting.
The "pro computers for voting" think that more people will get encouraged to vote because it will be much easier to decect their canidates if they have bad eyesight. Aswell that a touchscreen clicking with a "are you sure" button people can make less mistakes in the process of voting.
In the end I would say we need to improve and get more efficient than now. It is imporant to get more acurate and eliminate mistakes even if we might get more for a short term but in the longer run it would be just better for everyone.
