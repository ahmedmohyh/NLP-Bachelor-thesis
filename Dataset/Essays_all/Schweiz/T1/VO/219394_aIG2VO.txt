The presentation started with the argument that a computerized voting would be difficult for people who aren't used to computers. They would have difficulties using the computer, often due to fear of technology. The text has an other point of view: It says that many people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. It would be much easier to use a coumputer programm than searching the name of their candidate on a long list of names on their ballot. The risk to mark the wrong name would be lower.
The presentation's next argument is that computers can make mistakes aswell and an error in a computer programm would cause much worse consequences than the few mistakes which humans are doing. The text on the other hand says that it is much more expensive and risky for mistakes to happen if humans have to count all the votes.
And then, the presentation means that there are only few chances to get used to a new system. National voting are only once in two years in the United States, not enough possibilites to get confidence with a new computerizes programm. The text's opinion is that we are already using computer system in highly sensible and important situations on daily basis such as for online banking. It means that we would get used it very fast and it would become normal for us in a few years.
