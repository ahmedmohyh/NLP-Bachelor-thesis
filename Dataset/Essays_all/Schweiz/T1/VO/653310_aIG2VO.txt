The problem of all votingsystems is, that people make mistakes. It's not because the poor eyesight, its because the people count the votes wrong. If the people count the votes wrong, they can count them again, because there are physical votes. It might be easy to use a computer for the young generation and how to use touch-screen technology but there are a lot of people who don't have a computer or don't know how to use it. The votingprogramm for the computer is wroting by the people , who says that the computerprogramm hasnt't mistakes too? If the computercountingsystem fail, a lot of votes are lost and nobody can save the votes. There aren't physical paper you can count again. The votes are lost and you have to repeat the main votingprocess. The people have just to vote one time in two years and in different places twice a year. So it shoult be possible to vote with the traditional system.
