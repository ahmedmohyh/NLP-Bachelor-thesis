Voting by computers has many dangers and may lead to very inaccurate results because of various reasons. First of all there are people who can not afford to buy computers and for them it would become impossible to vote and they would be excluded  from voting. Many persons have probems with computers and don't know how to use them. They could easily mark the wrong canditate by mistake and not realize it. But as we read in the text, the voting as we know it now has similar problems. People with poor eyesight often have the problem of finding the right name in a long list and then marking the right one and it's way harder to detect a mistake there. An other problems that would come up with computers is that the counting is done by a program which was written by a human. If people count the thousands of ballots it's easy to get out of count. Humans do make mistakes and that would have an effect on the end result. But humans could also do a mistake while writing a computer program for counting the votes. So if there is only a tiny mistake in the written program it would mess up all the results and it takes quite a while to fix it. But as we read in the article the counting would be done wy more quicker and we could save much time. And why shouldn't people trust this system when their even trustin banking transactions on their computers and send highly sensitive information via e-mails? Those things have excosted for a while and were improved several times so that they have become trustworthy and they are used all the time. This is not the same with the voting program so it can't work in the same way.
