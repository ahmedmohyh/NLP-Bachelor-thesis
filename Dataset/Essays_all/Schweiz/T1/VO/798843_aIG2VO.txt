People they are used to computers have it easier to understand how to vote on the computer. In the text they mention the problems like people with poor eyesight can mark the wrong name. They said that it is heavily, daily used. But it is easy to handle, they say in the text, because the computerized voting machines habe an easy-to-use-screen technology. If a person have to vote, he has just needs to touch the candidate`s name on the screen and they can have the computer magnify the name for easier viewing. Trouble using is also a problem. But in the text they have written other problems. I mentioned some earlier. In the text they wrote that people vote for the wrong candidate. This problems are a fault of the people, because the voting system is programmed by humans. But they make this voting programm with confidence, thats a positiv view which isn`t mention in the text.
