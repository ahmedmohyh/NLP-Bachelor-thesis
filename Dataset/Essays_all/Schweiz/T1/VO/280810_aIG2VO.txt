A highly debated subject in the United States is the lack of accuracy in voting. There are individuals who support the idea that the common system should be replaced by a better and more effective one. Digital voting systems should be given more tries.
  One of the most common problem in traditional voting is that people are overwhealmed with all the names listed on the voting sheed and fail to find the correct name of the wished candidate. Another argument against the currently used voting system is the amount of errors which occure when counting the votes, since many Officials have to count every single vote manually. Therefore, it is almost impossible for those workers to be accurate in their counting. 
  In order to improve the system there are groups who think that computerized voting should be applied on regular bases. The positive side is that a precise lecture of the candidates names could be achieved, what means that a part of the inaccuracies of voting would be solved. However, computers are programmed by humans and humans make mistakes. If an error occures during the set up of such a programm, the following votes could be miscounted. The miscounting may remain unperceived or cause a disaster.
  Nevertheless, people could not agree on a appropriate solution for the problem until now.
