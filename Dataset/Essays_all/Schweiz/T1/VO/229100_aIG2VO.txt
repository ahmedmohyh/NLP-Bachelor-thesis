The first argument is that not everyone can afford a computer and not everyone knows how to use one properly. They say that if they do try to vote, people might cast the wrong vote accidently and could be discouraged from voting again. According to the article however, people are already struggling with accidently voting for the wrong person, especially if they have bad eyesight they find it hard to find and mark their candidate. However if voting were computerized people could zoom in and click on the name of their candidate, without having to struggle through pages of containing names.
The second argument was that a computer error would be far worse than a human error. If a human made a mistake counting votes, this could only mean a few mistakes, but a glitch in the computer programme could delete maybe thousands of votes. There would also be no physical evidence if it came to a revote. In the article they say that computerized systems would remove the possibility of human error, but that's not true since it would be a human who would be creating the programme and who would be responsable for the glitch as mentioned in the presentation. 
The last argument is a retort to the last argument of the article, which states that people seem to have trust in computerized programs that are used everyday, so why would computerized voting be any different? The presentation has an answer for that. They say that because these systems are used everyday and have been around for a while, they have been perfected. All the glitches they had, were caught early on and now they are safe to use. However voting is only done twice a year in America, it isn't an everyday activity and it hasn't been perfected yet.
