In the text, traditional voting system is compared to the computerized voting system. We quickly notice how the traditional voting system is frowned upon, while the computerized system appears to be the very best solution. The main problem of the traditional voting system is human error; people with poor eyesight often mistake their preferred candidate with another. The votes need to be counted by people, a process which obviously has to take human error into account. In contrast, the computerized voting system offers a magnifying option and counts the votes automatically, thus removing the possibility of human error. In the lecture, it is explained how the computerized system is only practical for people who actually do use computers, thus making the ones who rarely use them less willing to vote. Since the programmes are made by humans, in a dramatic course of events they could cause way more serious repercussions than the traditional voting system. While in the text the computerized system's security is compared to the computer programmes in banks, the lecturer makes us notice that the latter are used daily and ameliorated continously, while the elections in the United States take place too seldomly to grant the same amount of security.
It becomes clear that the main difference between text and lecture is that the first praises computer voting, while the second accounts the negative effects it could have.
