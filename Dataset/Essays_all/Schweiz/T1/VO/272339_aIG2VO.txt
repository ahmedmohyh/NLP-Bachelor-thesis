Its right, that humans makes mistakes, when they count the ballots. But if this work is done by computers, who are also programmed by humans, mistakes would be heavier, because it could be that a human counts one or two ballots wrong, but if a computer makes a mistake there could be a thousend or more mistakes, whats obviously heavier. Also there is the problem that there're votings only every two years nationwide, and in the country maybe twice a year. So, the people can not learn very good how to use the computers and the inventors of them can not learn fast enough by seeing the mistakes, that the computers do.
The text says that it is very heavy to count the ballots one by one. And because of this there are many mistakes made by the counters. Computer voting is way more easier to do beacuse you can see the canidates very well, which is a problem on the ballots, because people with poor eyesight, can not see the canidates and so, they often make mistakes by voting the wrong canidate. Also it's easier to count the "digital ballots" for a computer. This is the point where the presentators of the presentation have annother opinion, because a computers mistake is often heavier than a mistake from an human. Text also says, that we're using computer technologie every day, and it works. But the presentators see it diferently, because we have this computer technologies fur e-banking a lot of years, but the e-voting technologie is very young, so there could be a lot of mistakes.
