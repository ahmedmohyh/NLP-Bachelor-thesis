By some critics the current voting system in the U.S. is inaccurate, while people easilly vote for the wrong candidate. Especially people with poor eyesight might have trouble making the small mark next to the name. A computerized voting system could solve this problem by having an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. But on the other hand people who cannot afford a computer and are not used to using them might have even bigger problems with them than without.
An other problem in the old system is counting the votes. Officials have to count often thousands of ballots one by one, so it is almost impossible for them not to make mistakes. Computers counting the votes quickly and automatically would solve the problem. However in the worst scenario, computers having an error could cause some huge damage not just a few miscounted votes. And with these computer programms recounting the votes is usually impossible.
