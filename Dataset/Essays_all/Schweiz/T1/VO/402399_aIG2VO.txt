There's a debatte if the traditional voting system with ballots should be replaced by a more efficient system with computer programmes. Both system have their pros and cons. On one side there is the traditional system. It has been used for many years now and it's known to be time-consuming and human errors can occur. In the traditional system officals have to go through every ballot and it is possible that they make a mistake. If a mistake happens a recount has to be made which takes again a long time. Also the voters can make mistakes, when they make the mark next to the wrong persons name. Even though the traditional system in very expensive and time-consuming, you can be sure it shows the results the voters wanted. With a modern computerized system this can be the other way. Computer programmes are known to have errors in the beginning due to wrong programming. If there's an error in a programme and because of that error all votes could possibly go to the wrong person or party. Computer programmes are faster and mostly easier like banking transactions or emails, but these are programmes that are used daily and not just once all two years. The advantages of computerized voting is that no officals have to go through every ballot. The programmes can show in a short amount of time the result of the voting. Also it is easier for people that are used to computers/touchscreens because they can just click or touch the persons name they want to vote for and it is done. For person that can't afford computers or are affraid of it, computerized voting is maybe a turnoff for voting.
