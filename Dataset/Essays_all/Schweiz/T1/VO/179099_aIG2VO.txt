In the presentation they are talking about the disadvanteges of a computerized voting system. They say that it may be good for people that are used to computers but it's not good at all for people who aren't. Or for people who don't have a computer or can't afford one. The fear of technology will always be present. This may even prevent a lot of people from voting.They say that a human can maybe make a mistake but if there is an error in the computer, thousands of votes could just not be counted. And it is almost imposible to find out about that. They say that all those technologies we trust had to be improved for years. So it would take ages until that voting system could be trusted.

But in the text it is written that a lot of people accidently chose the wrong candidate because of their poor eyesight or because there are just too many names on the paper. And we have to rely on a lot of people to count the votes. Because there are so many ballots it is almost imposible not to make mistakes. It is said that we already rely on technology so much so why not on the computerized voting system.
