The voting on the computer isn't an better system of voting. Just for the one's who knows how to use a computer well, will get on with this new system and consider it as much confortable and helpfuller than the traditional system. But how about the people who have no knowledge about computer? For those this system doesn't work. As they have to get use of it, the gouverment has to face the same problem as in the traditional voting system. May the people will tape the wrong cantidat and than this vote will appear in the ranking. So the leck of this won't change, the problem that they had before. In addition the program on which you have to vote is set up by humans. If there is an glitch or an error in the system, it will lead to an false result in the end. So if this error stays and the gouverment doesn't take notice of it, the voting won't be efficient and they will have to let it like this for two years. In this period they will have to set up a new program again, randomly they will notice the error and fix it. Actually a change of the system isn't a really good idea, because in the end the problem of an wrong voting number stays.
