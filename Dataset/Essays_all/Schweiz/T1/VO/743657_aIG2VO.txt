The presentator started her presentation by talking about the fact that people who don't use computers at all may be discouraged from voting on one because they according to her have a "fear of technology". In the text on the other hand, the writer puts this argument into stark contrast by saying that old people actually benefit from being able to vote on a computer because the text is can be made readable more easily. The next argument is about the security of voting on a computer, as they are very susceptible to attacks of cybercriminals. To add to that, the programs are written by humans, so it is natural for them to indirectly make human errors through wrong coding. However the writer argues that if a system is made secure, it is more efficient and prevents miscountings, since a computer never makes mistakes. The next argument of the presentator elaborates on why online banking is secure, while voting on a computer isn't. Online Banking has existed for quite some time now, so the banks had a chance at building up and improving their systems. Computer Voting on the other hand takes place only once or maybe twice a year, in contrast to the millions of transactions happening every second. That means that they are going to have much less expertise with their system. The writer however says that although it may be risky in the beginning, taking the step may be worth it as computers are already ruling many parts of our life and we are trusting them,so why shouldn't we trust it in counting our votes?
