The text above critizises the old voting system from the United States. It's written that it's inefficient and there are often mistakes made by anaccurate counting. A new comuterized voting technology system would be better and saver. There wouldn't be the wrong peoples voted because there would bean easy-to-use-touch-screen. The thousands of ballots would be counted correctly and quickly. On the other side the woman I heard said that a computerized voting system would only be easy for the computer users who are often in touch with the technology. The others would have a problem or even a fear of voting because of the modern technology. So the question she asks herself is: Are computers a good solution for the voting problem? Computers were also invented by human beings so why wouldn't they do also faults? I heard that the computer always got improved and they still aren't fully trusted nowadays. Even though human error would be far more serious.
