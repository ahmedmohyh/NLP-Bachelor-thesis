The speaker of the presentation criticises the idea of a computerized voting system, in contrast to the text. The first doubt she expresses concernes that big parts of the population may not be familiar with computers, also due to the afordability of computers. Other voters may just be too old to have enough computer-experience. This may lead to wrong votes, given unintentionally. The text there states that the votes would be collected more accurately, with less missvotes for example by people with poor eyesight. Also would the counting of the votes be way faster and the result would be very precise.
Another critic point is that not all computersystems would require personal data for identification. This may lead to anther error-source. But most concerned was the speaker about the accuracy of computer relied votingsystems. It may be true that by hand counted voting, every now and then, there were some mistakes, concerning the counting due to human error, but computerprogramms are also manmade. If those errors would corrupt the voting systems, they would be far more serious, concerning thousands of votes, not only a small number. The text there supports its asumptions with the fact that big government institutions and banks rely on their computersystems everyday. If we trust the government and the banks with our money in computersystems then why not with the votes?
The speaker counters with the fact that those bank and government systems are used everyday and have been corrected over time. But with the votings taking place nationally only once every two years and regionally maybe twice a year, the errors could remain in the systems undiscovered for years.
