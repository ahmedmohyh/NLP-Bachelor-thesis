The american elections take place once every two years. But the question for many people is, if the traditional or the computerized voting is better. In the text and the audiofile they said both that the current voting systems are very inefficient. Many people are needed to count all the votes and it is sure that some of them make mistakes in counting. So if an election is closely contested it can be very damaging. The other option to vote is the computerized voting system. It is much more efficient because the computer counts all votes automatically and there are no mistakes. But in the audofile they said a very good argument. If the computer system has just one error, it could be that thounsands of votings can get lost. Another argument that came up was that not everybody can handle a computer. Many people who doesn't use a computer very often or maybe are very old and not able to use any electronic devices can't vote in this way. So a big part of votes would be missed just by being not able to vote because of the modern technology.
