In the text they say that the traditional voting system is to old for a land like the USA and they want to make a new voting system with computers and other technologies. Only in the end they say that some people are against voting with technologies. In the last sentence they argument with that the computer techonolgies are used every day and perfectly accurate in banking transactions and in communication. In the presentation the lady remindes us that the technologies used in banking transactions and communications are not as new as the voting system they have been worked on and improved on to have a succes like this today. The problem with the voting is that it is just every two years so it would make it very difficult to imrpove the technologies for it. All of these is not mentioned in the text above. An other thing the lady in the presentation says is that not only the human make mistake while counting the ballots but also the computers could have a problem with their counting system and there wouldn't be a chance to count them again. In the presentation there is also mentioned that voting with computers is only useful for people who are used to use a computer and understand the concept. Some of the older people don't know how to use a computer or  don't even have one. The text only tells us about the good things a computer would do to voting but the presentation mentions also the bad things about it.
