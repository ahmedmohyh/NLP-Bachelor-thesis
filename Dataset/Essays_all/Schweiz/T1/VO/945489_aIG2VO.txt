Voting is a vital part of this century. For not even one hundred years humans have been able to shape their country's future through voting. Some believe that traditional voting is out-dated and should be replaced by computerized voting.
 
On the contrary to the text, the woman opposing computerized voting stated that errors made by humans would involve a few missed ballots, while in the text it says that not only in the counting of votes but in the voting itself there are made mistakes. Some people with bad eyesight might mark the wrong name on the ballot, which apparently could be stopped with the zooming that computerized voting would allow, however the woman who spoke about this topic mentioned that the simillar mistakes could occure with computers, if not even worse. Since they need to be programmed by humans, there is no guarantee there will not be made mistakes. Furthermore, she made the point of citizens, who are not accustomed to computers, for financial reasons or others, might find computerized voting confusing or even be discouraged by this innovation for the reason of being afraid of making a mistake they would not make in traditional voting. Moreover, would the time and energy spent on programming and installing these computers be worth the one time that people would vote nation-wide in two year's time? Hardly, even if one would count the one to two times there would be voting annually in smaller regions.
