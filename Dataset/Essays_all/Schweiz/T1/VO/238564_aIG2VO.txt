The current voting system in the United States is often criticised for being inefficient and often leading to inaccurate voting counts. It is suggested in the text that we change the old voting system and make it computerized. That way you can avoid a miscalculation due to human error by making machines count i for you. But on the other hand if we were to chose the computerized system, there could still be error in the counts. Because the computer program that counts the votes of the ballots is created by humans. Which then again suggests that if there were to be a problem while programming it, it would have far worse of an outcome than it would if the officials had counted the votes themselves. In the text one argument is also that there can be a lot of wrong marking on the ballots due to eyesight problems. That is true but then again if we were to use the new system that people are suggesting it would also hinder people from being able to vote. Seeing how not everybody grew up alongside the evolving technologies of today. Older people sometimes are afraid of the new technology and do not want anything to do with it. Others are simply not able to vote anymore because they have no computer at home. In that way inroducing the computerized voting system would lead to just as muc error as the old system. And we all know that banks use computerized systems and it works for them but it did not work as good as it does today when they first started out with using it. It takes time to improve such systems but as we only vote every two years that would be very unnecessary.
