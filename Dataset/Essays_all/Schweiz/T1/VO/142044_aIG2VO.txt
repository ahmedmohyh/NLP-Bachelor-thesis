The computer voting system is not the better solution to the traditional voting system. People who aren't used to work with a computer or who can't owe one, would not be able to vote. Even if it's possible that sometimes, people vote for the wrong candiate, it would be much harder for them to work with a computer. It could be that they won't vote at all in the end. This could lead to the opposite effect. 
Also there is a fear of technology. Who can ensure that the computers will make a better job than a human being? It's natural that mistakes can happen. So there might be also an error in the computer system which was made by people. The mistakes would be way bigger than only miss one or two votes. If something isn't right with the system, thousands of votes could be missed or changed up. There's no physical record at all. To make this right again would take a lot more time and cause more trouble. It would also be negative for the candiates themselves and a total recount would also cost a lot more money.
All in all the computer technology is not something to rely on right now. It's too riskful and the result isn't safe.
