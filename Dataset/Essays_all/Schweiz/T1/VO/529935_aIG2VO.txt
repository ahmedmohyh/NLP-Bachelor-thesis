Humans make mistakes but so do computers because they are made by humans. But the problem is if humans make mistakes by counting the votes the damage that is done by that is only small and the votes can easely be recounted. If a computer makes a mistake the errors can be huge and in the worst case the votes could be deleted so a recount is impossible. A computer may seem very easy to use for those who work with them all the time, but what about the peolple who almost never use a computer? They could have quite some problems using them and the vote would be also inaccurate. Another part about the computers is the price, they are quite expensive and maybe cannot be afford by everyone. Also if it is almost inevitable for humans to make mistakes by counting the votes, as said earlier, these mistake are only small and if necessairy a recount can easely be done. So also if a computer is faster counting the votes, it is much more safe to do
