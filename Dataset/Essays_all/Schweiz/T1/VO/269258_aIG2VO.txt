Voting for an election until now in the United Staates of America has been done by marking your candidate on a piece of paper, by searching for it in a long list with all candidate`s names. With this voting system human mistakes are easily made for example by accidentally marking the wrong name or officials counting the bullets wrongly. Whereas in the new voting system that could replace the traditional one, you would have to have knowledge on computers and be able to use them. There you can just press your finger on the cantidate of your choice and there is less chance to make the typical human mistakes. The problem with modern technology is that especially elderly people might have problems, do not know how to use a computer, need help or make mistakes of a different kind. Additionally, in the presentation the question is brought up if the computarized system is really better since computers are also made by humans and there might be big errors in the program used for voting. If a mistake was made in the old voting system they were easily corrected even though they cost lots of money and time but if a mistake is made with the computer programs, then you have to redo the whole voting process and there is much more that has to be corrected which would be more time consuming and tiresome.
In the text they only talk about the positive aspects of a computarized voting system and in the presentation lots is said about the negative aspects.
