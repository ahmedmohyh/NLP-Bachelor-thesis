The main thing in the text and the audiopart is the badly working voting system in the United States. It is not efficient and wrong results. The system they are using now is to old and could be cheated. Often the people vote for the wrong candidate. The old system is heavy for the people who have to count the results. The new idea of voting with computers is not liked in every place in the country. It is easyier and faster than the old one, because the computer would count it and not humans anymore. They are afraid of errors wich could bring the whole voting to a false result. This would lead to a whole new counting.  Many people wouldn't or couldn't use the computersystem, because lots of them can't afford a computer or are afraid of them. But today computers are very common, they are easy to use for a banc transaction or in the office for the finances and even to send higly secret information.
