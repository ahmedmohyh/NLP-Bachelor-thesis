The author of the written text thinks that it would be safer, easier and more trustworthy to trust computers with our election process. The traditional method can easily lead to mistakes, poor-sighted people can easily mark the wrong name in the ballots, with a computerized system, it would be easier and less time-consuming for the voters. Furthermore, the traditional voting system heavlily relies on people to count the votes, thus making the system inevitably prone to mistakes. Critics say that it would be too risky to computerize the whole process, without realizing how much we all already trust these complex computer technologies, for example with our money and all our personal data.

On the other hand, the person from the presentation  has a totally different view on the situation, she is one of the critics mentioned by the author of the first text. She fears that many people might have trouble with voting due to not havin access to a computer or not knowing how to use one. This might keep some people from voting alltogether. In addition, she doubts the advantages the computers will bring, especially when it comes to precision. After all, it is true that computers are programmed by humans, therefore, if a human makes a mistake while programming, the consequences will be far graver than when a human forgets to count a few ballots. Another point she makes is that with a computerized voting system, it is much harder to recount the votes in case of doubt or accuse of cheating. Lastly, she says that in our communication and banking systems, we had needed time to improve to the level of security of today, but in the   case of politics, it would be too dangerous to test a few different methods until the right one is found, after all american politics influences the whole world.
