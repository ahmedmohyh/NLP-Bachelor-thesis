Voting

The traditional voting systems in the United States are getting a bigger issue. One possibilty to change this problem could be, to use computers as an new of voting systems. The change to make an mistake by computer is very low. And it is also an easier way for us. 

But there is are also a lot of people who can not afford an computer. So if they could vote by computer,they wouldn't be able, because they couldn't use the computers. Of coure people can make mistakes during counting the votes, it is normal. But on the computer voting system there is no error possible.The system is used daily, so we can make sure that there will not be any mistakes. The computer voting system promises trustable voting results.

On the other side the main problem of the voting systems in the United States is that the current voting systems are inefficient. There are traditional problems like, most peoeple accidentally vote for the wrong person. This are people with poor eyesight, who make mistakes ike that.

The possibility to use computers or other technical things to vote for an candidate is an easier way. You only have to touch the name of the candidateand that is it. One other problem is that it relys heavily on people to count the votes. Some people do not make any mistakes and they will not trust an computer system to vote for theire candidate. I it too riksy for them to trust an computer.

So the main difference is that some people see the possibilty of using the computer as an voting systeme as an good idea and some people will never trust an computer. they prefer the old traditinal way of voting.
