Our current voting system is flawed. Critics want to replace it with a computerized system. But is it as reliable as they claim. Of course the people may choose the wrong candidate by accident on a ballot, but can we be sure that it won't happen on a computer screen. Just because it is possibe to magnify something, doesn't mean mistakes won't happen. Many people may stop voting because their fear of the system being rigged or their fear of computers in general. The most important thing is still, an error that was made by whilst counting the votes, doesn't do that much damage. But an error made by the programmer can really change the course of an election. It can change thousands if not millions of votes or not register them at all. Because there's no hard copy of the vote available, a recount is impossible. Yes, we do trust computers with banking transactions and other complex technology, but those programs have been tested, used and improved on lots and lots of times. And there were many failures until we "perfected" them. But errors still occur and they can be fatal for companies and for humans. In conclusion, is it really that good of an idea to computerize everything, especially something so important like voting candidates into our government.
