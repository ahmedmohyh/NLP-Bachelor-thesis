Voting on a comupter is not a thing for everyone: Pople who aren't used to computers or do not work often with computers may have problems and that can cause a wrong vote. The article says it's much easier to vote with the computer system.

For sure a voting system can help in counting votes. But who says that the voting systems don't have any problems. The voting systems are made by humans and there could be some human errror and because these programms aren't used very often they don't chec these programms on mistakes. Mistakes in these voting systems can cause 1000 of wrong votes. In the article is written that counting votes with a computerized system can avoid re possibility of human error and it's of course easier.

 Another thing is that the systems can not recount the votes. So once the computers couned the votes they are "lost".
