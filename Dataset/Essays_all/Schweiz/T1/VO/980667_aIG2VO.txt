The oral presentation explains that computers make faults in votings and the text says the exact opposite, human make many mistakes. The woman who said computers are worse for calculating voting results, used the argument of weight. If a human makes a wrong election or marks the wrong person, it would be way easier to detect the fault and get rid of it instead of a technical error. So if a computer has one while counting the votes, it could become a invalid voting, because it could forget many votes or even lose some of them. They also said that older people don't want to be sending in their votes by computer, since they have always done it like this and are kind of afraif of technology.
The text supports technological improvements, while the presentation rather denies it.
