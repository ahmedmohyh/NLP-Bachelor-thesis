The voting system in the United States are inefficient, many mistakes to count the votes and the wrong vote.

In the presentation and also in the text are the computers very important. The woman in the presentation said that many people don't have a computer at home and then it is impossible for them to vote on the computer. This is a reason why the current voting system in the United States are inefficient because this people which aren't have a computer at home must have to vote on a large sheet of paper containing many names. The name is "the ballot" and on this sheet it is very easy to mark the wrong name. 
The woman in the presentation said that the computerized voting system isn't so efficient and trustworthy how the critics in the text mean. The people which count the votes from the ballot can also make many mistakes but also in the computerized voting machines it can be a mistake made by people.
