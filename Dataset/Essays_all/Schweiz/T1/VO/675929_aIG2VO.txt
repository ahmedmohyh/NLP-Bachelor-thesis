The presidential voting in the United States is a huge event that happens every four years. As an outsider all you see is the campains going on for months on end. On the inside there are thousands of people voting for who they think would do the best job being President. The voting method is to mark the person you want on a piece od paper. These so-called ballots are then counted by people and the president with the most amount of votes wins. There are a few flaws in this traditional voting procedure: there are many names written in small writing on the ballots, so some people with poor eyesight could misread the names and vote for the wrong person. Also the counting of the votes depend on people and people make mistakes. 
Critics of the old system say that the voting should be computerised, which would get rid of the faults in the old way. As the names of the candidates could be zoomed in apon on a touchscreen and thus easliy read. Also the counting would be automatic and done much more quickly.
Banks use this kind of technology every day and it works almost flawlessly and people exchange highly sensitive info aswell.
Critics of computerising the whole system say that it may discourage people to vote, who don't use a computer often. Also people make computer and people make mistakes. This means taht the computers might have flaws in them which would have a much more drastic effect on the counting of the votes that a person misreading a few crosses on pieces of paper. And a recount on a computer is impossible. Which would leave 1'000s of votes missed out or missread.
