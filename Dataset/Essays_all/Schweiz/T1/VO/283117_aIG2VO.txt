To replace the traditional voting system with a computerbased system is doubted to make anything better. Although it seems like a good idea to use computers for people that are used to it, it can have a negative effect on the numbers of people that vote. People that are older, more inexperienced with technologie or people who simply can't afford a computer could stop going to votings at all. 
Also there is the topic of the miscounts. While critics say that the traditional voting system is by far more affected by mistakes - because people have to count the ballots one by one and it is almost inevitably that they will make mistakes - others say that people could make only a few mistakes, whereas a false computer programme would mean thousands of miscounts. 
Then there is also the fact that all those computer programmes were created by humans, which means that there is always the possibility of an error in the programme. 
Neither is it possible to recount the votes on a computer, whereas you can simply do this with the ballots. People that are for a computerized voting say, that we trust in computers everyday (for example with e-banking), so why shouldn't we use it for our votings? But critics on the other hand argue, that those programmes are used on a daily basis and they had a lot of mistakes when they were first used. Programmes like e-banking had to be improved time after time and we would have to do the same with the computerized votings.
