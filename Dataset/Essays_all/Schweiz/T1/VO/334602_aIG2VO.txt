The current voting system used in the United States could be better, or is already on it's best. Here are two views to summe the arguments up:

The voters have to find the candidate's name out of many other names. People with bad eyesight might fail, in finding the person they want to vote on.  A touchscreen could help a lot, because you could make the names bigger, or you could install have a search system. Otherwise might these people be not used to computers. So they would even do more mistakes, or not vote at all.
Not only the voters can do mistakes, but the counters of the votes do mistakes too. A computer wouldn't be as troubled as a human. Well, the computeres are still made by humans. If the programmer makes a mistake in the programm, thousends of votes could be lost, or incorrect.
The computer programs already showed how reliable they are, for example in the banking systems. So it's already proven, that an electric system would be reliable. Exept that in the beginning of the electric banking systems, there were a lot of fails. So after discovering error after error, and fixing them, the banking system has gotten reliable. But the  kdlaj sklövoting isn't often. So there aren't many chances to improve the system. If there realy is an error, the votes could not be recounted, like with the old papers.
