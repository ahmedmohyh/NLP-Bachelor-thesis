What is the aim of a good voting system? The aim should be, in my opinion, to let the highest amount of people choose the politician they want, and that their vote gets counted correctly. So we want to bind as many people as possible in the democratic process. The generation, that doesn't seem to be accounted for, as we have seen in the statistics of Britains recent vote about 'Brexit' is mine. I don't see, what speaks against voting online. Also in Switzerland our parliament only represents 75% of the population, assuming that everybody voted, since about 25% of the population doens't have the Swiss passport. What kind of a democracy excludes a quarter of the population because they recently moved here or their parents aren't born in Niedergösgen or Waltenschwil? But this is a different question.
Critics of the traditional voting system say that by using computers to count and register the votes, human error can be reduced. When people vote, they could have trouble reading the names of the politicians. As an argument against this, the speaker talks about people not being able to use a computer and having to rely on complex computer technology, disregarding the fact, as the text points out, that in banking and communication of 'sensitive information' (whatever that is supposed to mean in a democratic state) we rely on modern technology and computers. There is also the financial aspect. It is way more efficient and less expensive to replace humans by computers.
