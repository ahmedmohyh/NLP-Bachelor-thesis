In the text they use the argument that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name and computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology, so it would be better for the people to use a computer for voting. But in the listening they say, people like an old grandmother who never worked with a computer or don't have one, have a big problem with this voting system. There its said that how should a person like her, use the computer just to vote, when she never used one? Most of the people can write, but not all people can use a computer. An other argument is that not all people can afford one, it isn't that cheap. An other argument from the text is, that they want to reduce the mistakes of humans, its possible that a humanbeing forget to count one of the people or count it wrong, because people aren't machines. But in the listening the people against computer voting systems say, that a computer created by humans can make more mistakes. For examples if theres an error, it can delete more than thousands of votings, not only one.
