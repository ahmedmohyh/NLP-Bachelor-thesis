In the United States they vote with the current voting system. Now they thinking to change it in a computerized voting system. But it is really better or do it just brings more problems with it?
With the current voiting system it can happen mistakes. The people who don't have a good eyesight could make the mark next to a wrong name. In addiction to this there will be mistakes when they count the voting. So the result won't be right. So in this case it would be better to change the system in a computerized voting system.
But a lot people are not very fond of this new idea. Because there are lot people who are not used to using computer. So they would have a lot of problems and would cast the wrong vote. It isn't just the problem of knowledge how to use a computer. Another problem is also with the system itselfs. It is a fact that humans make mistakes and computers are made from humans. So it won't be something new when there would be a problem in that system. And it's worser to have 5ooo votes wrong then just some. The problem is that it isn't something which they would use a lot. 
The computer technology is used in a lot of places but they use it everyday so they can improve this system. But the voting is just every second year in the United States and so they won't use it so often that the system doesn't have any mistakes in it.
In fact both systems have there good and bad sides. So in the end it doesn't really matters which system they're going to use.
