Computerized voting can be a big problem for many people. Because not everybody can afford a computer or was raised with that much technology as the new generation does. Especially older people maybe wouldn't vote anymore, because they would be afraid of voting on the computer.
Computerized voting does not mean that no mistakes could happen. Computers are programmed by humans, which means that the program could have some mistakes too. And what is more important is that humans would miss a few ballots, but a computer could miss the whole voting for a candidate. Computers just can't be trusted.
The text says that in traditional voting people could accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. But that can happen on the computer easily too. Because there are a lot of people which are not familiar with computers and their touch screen. It would be much more complicated, which means some people wouldn't know how to use the computers right and they would be afraid of it, so they better don't vote.
It is also not true that the computerized system would remove the possibility of human error, because they are acctually programmed by humans.
