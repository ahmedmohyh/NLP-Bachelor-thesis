The text says that the current voting system in the United States is inefficient and can lead to miscounts, because every single vote is counted by humans.People could also mark accidentally the wrong name on the sheet with the list of candidates. It also says that computer programs would be a lot more reliable, while the woman from the lecture thinks differently. First of all, she says that modern technology may be easy for people who are used to it, but that others would have difficulties using it and that not everyone can afford a computer. She also says that humans make mistakes and that computers are made by humans. In addition, humans make a few miscounts, while if computers made a mistake, it would be a lot more miscounts and it would have a much bigger impact on the whole voting. The woman says that humans had to spend several years and decades to improve on technology, which means that it would take too long for a new, flawless voting system to be ready. The text, however, says that technology is reliable enough       nowadays.
