The main subjet in the text about voting was the problem about the old voting system. 

The first argument in the text was that people whith poor eyesight easily mark the wrong name on the paper. But in the interview we heard that there are alot more people who have problems with computers. Its absolutly understandible, that people who get along well, or work often with computers are more comfortable to vote with computers but there are thousends of people which can't even have a computer.

The bigger subjet in the text was that people make mistakes by counting the votes. Thats totally normal. Every humanbeing makes mistakes! But is it sure that computers make less mistaks? The woman said in the interview that computers are made of humans. So are they realy the solution? We must see, that computers are never perfect. They must be improved every year. We're talking here about a lot of money which could be saved or used i other things.

If a man or a woman makes a mistake its one vote out of millions which is wrong but if there is a error in the computer there are goning to be much bigger mistakes. Thousends of votes are going to be wrong and the whole voting probably must be  repeated. So are computers fully trusted?

An other theme in the text was, that computers are nowdays used for everything. For banking transactions as well as for highly sensitive informations, so why shouldn't the computers be used for votings?

We see there are a lot of posivitive and negative arguments for modern and old variations of voting.
