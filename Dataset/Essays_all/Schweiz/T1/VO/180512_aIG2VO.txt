The lecture that I've just heard is all about the voting system in America. Although the text and the audio are covering the same topics, they are having a lot of different thoughts. 

In the text it is said that the current voting system is inefficient and often leading to the inaccurante counting of votes. The reason for the misscounting of votes are the people and the way the traditional voting system in America works. One major problem is that there are many people with bad eye sight which can easily miss the wright buble on the voting sheet since it is very small written and there are hunderets of names listet underneath each other. The othe big problem with the old system is that the hole counting of the votes process is relying on people aswell. The people who count the votes have to count thousands of votes and if one does that for a long time one will get tired and makes mistakes because we are only human and we make mistakes that's just how it is. So if human make mistakes why shouldn't we use technology for the voting instead of relying on people who will make mistakes for sure? Another way of voting would be the computerized voting. It would increase the efficiency of the calculation of votes and people with bad eyesight could easily zoom in and read the name lists bigger.

The women talking in the audio reccord has a different opinion on almost all of the points I mentioned before. Her biggest point is that although people make mistakes and there will be a few miscounts, it will not have a significant impact in the end and the endresult will still be correct. But if America uses computerized voting and they compleately rely on technology and then something happens and they have technological problens this will have a major impact on the results because thousands of votes could be misread of get lost. She thinks that we should continue on relying on people instead of technology.
