The first point was that a coumputer based system would be an improvement for the people who are using computers and technology on a daily basis. But, on the other hand, it might give some trouble to people who are not using computers daily or canot computers at all, and it might even prevent people with a fear from technology to vote in the first place. The text states that governments and indivduals trust their data to computer every day, so one should give it a thought. The speaker replies that those computers had troubles when they were firstly introduced. Also, those systems run every day, unlike the voting system running once all four years. The text also states that there are many votes being lost because of human error while counting the ballots. The speaker thinks that there is no certainty of computers, after all, they are programmed by humans. A human error could change a few votes, but a technical error could make a difference of thousans of votes, which could lead to the whole election being manipulated. The text also states that it is easy for people with a bad eyesight to make a mark at the wrong spot. The speaker states that fear of technology could make people not voting at all.
