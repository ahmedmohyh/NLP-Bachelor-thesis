Voting is at the moment a quite important topic in the US. In November the Amercian can to vote for a new president, but is the voting system still enough efficient and modern as it should be?

Critics say that there are some aspects which show us that the old system should be replaced by a new modern system by computer voting. The people get a large sheet of paper with a lot of canidats. On one side it can be very difficult for some people to find the one they want to vote for. On the other side a lot of people aren't familiar with computers, especially the older ones. For them it could be very difficult to vote on the computer and maybe they vote  for the wrong candiat because of that.

An other argument for a reform of the system is that people need to go to all the ballots. That leads surely to some mistakes in counting. But could a computer  be more reliable? Computers are made by humans, so problems and mistakes can happen there as well. And if we think of the quanticy votes happen in the US there isn't time to try a new system out. For example banking computer systems happen daily so they can be improved all the time but votings are only every two years.
