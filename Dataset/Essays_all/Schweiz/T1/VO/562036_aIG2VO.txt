The woman talking in the video record, warns us about being to sure about the computerized voting system. She says that maybe for people used to computers it may appear easy and way more quick, but she says one could not forget the people, mostly elderly people or poor people who aren't used to computers or even technology, Furthermore she says that the errors which we are scared of in traditional votings could undoubtly happen in those computer programs, which are obviously made by us humans and where an error could be much more dramatic as it could mix up all votes or not consider a huge amount of votes or even delete votes, which would be a way more bigger problem then some miscountings. An other point she speaks about is that if there's a suspicious score the computers couldn't recount the votes which would go all lost in the system. Also she says that those votings often are just twice a year or even once every two years, which means that it's quite possible to evite those miscountings or misvotes if everyone is just concentraded for a moment. All those arguments are exactly the contrary of all the arguments in the text which claims obviously for a computerized voting. The text says that a lote of misvotes happen due to the viewing of people and the little written names on the voting ballots, on the other hand the woman claims about knowledge of using computers which does not everyone have. The text says that traditional votings are often very inaccurate, whereas the woman says that computerized voting could make huger errors.
