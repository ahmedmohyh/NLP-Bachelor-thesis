The voting-system in the United States of America is a traditional one. Some People think it would be better if the votes would be counted, not by hand, but by computer technology. However computers aren't guaranteed to do a better job than humans. That's because some people, who aren't used to computers could be overwhelmed by the new voting-system. Furthermore some people have a fear of technology and would therefore be reclined to vote. On one hand computers have already been used in much more difficult regions of our lives like banking-systems, but on the other hand they needed a lot of time and are used everyday to ensure their security and up-to-dateness. While human counters can make mistakes in counting, it will just result in some votes too few or too many. These miscounts, although, could be exponentially higher with the use of computerised counters, since the programs were made by humans and could have errors. Computers also wouldn't allow any possibilty for recounts because the votes are not phisically stored anywhere. Votes counted by hand do exist in our real world and are able to be recounted again.
