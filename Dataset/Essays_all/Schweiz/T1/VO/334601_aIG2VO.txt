The speaker in the listening about Voting talks about the contra arguments of having a computerzided voting symstem. 
Firstly voting trough computers may seem a lot more easier for voters. But this only refers to people who use computer on a daily basis. People who are not used to computers, who are afraid of technology or do not even have money for it, have a big problem if they want to vote.
Secondly computers work more efficient than traditional voting but not neccessairly more trustworhty. Computer are also human made so a human error is still possible. Further is a human error a lot more tragic on a computerized system than in in a traditional one. In this way thousands of votings will be incorreclty treated which follows to a false voting endresult.
