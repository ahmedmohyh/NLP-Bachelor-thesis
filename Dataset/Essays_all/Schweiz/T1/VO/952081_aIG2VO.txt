The woman was talking about her opinion about the computerized voting system in the United States. Currently they use the traditional voting system and in her opinion is it better than the computerized one, even it's not perfekt. Computerized voting systems are easy to use for the young people who are used to computers, but it wouldn't be that easy for the elder people. They aren't used to computers, they will have troubles using them and its not unusual that elder peolpe havn't got a computer at all. Poor eyesight can be a big problem here too. The text says that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, but that's with the computerized system possible too. And there are a lot of people who can't even afford to buy a computer. Many people won't vote anymore. 
Of course people make mistakes while counting the votes traditionally, but computer systems are programmed by humans too and its possible that there will be errors in the system. That would have a huge impact, it would be possible to lose all the votes and lots of people would have to vote again. It would have a bigger impact than some wrong counted votes in the traditional voting system.  Its not easy to confience in such a system. It's true that people trust computer systems every day, like for example with the ebanking, but these systems are used daily. But peolpe in the States only have to vote every 2 years plus about twice a year in the area they're living. And these other computer systems dind't work well at the beginning eather.
