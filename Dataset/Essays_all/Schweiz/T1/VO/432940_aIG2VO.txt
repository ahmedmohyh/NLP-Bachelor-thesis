Elections
Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes.
If an election is closely contested miscounts can be especially damaging. People with poor eyesight have difficulties to make a small mark next to their candidate. Electronic voting systems are better like the bolasie flick.

Computer wouldt do any errors. But computers are done by Humans and so they have a high amplitude to make also errors. For example if a compiter has a rectal disfunktion it makes an error.
