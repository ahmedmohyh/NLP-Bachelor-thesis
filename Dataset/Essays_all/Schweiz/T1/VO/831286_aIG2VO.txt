In the presentation the woman told us something about the oldfashioned voting-system and the voting on a computer and gave us some pros and cons. The woman said that technology not always means a step in the right direction. That was different to the text we read before.
Because there it says that technology would compensate the human error. The lady in the presentation gave us some examples why technology isn't always great. For instance that not everybody can afford a computer. So many poor people wouldn't be able to vote anymore. That's neither fair nor right, because it would give us another result of the election. And on top of that there are some people who aren't used to computers and stuff like that. You can't do an election without considering all the inhabitants of a democratic country.
The lady admitted the opinion of the text when it comes to human errors. But she also said that computers are made by humans. Another point of her presentation was the use of technologycal devices. We all know that we use computers alot and we feel comfortable using them. But these programms that we use needed alot of time to get thre were they're today. So a new programm for voting would need alot of time to get to the point were we're familiar with it. In the text there aren't any negative perspectives of the online-voting-system. And this is a really heavy contrast to the presentation.
