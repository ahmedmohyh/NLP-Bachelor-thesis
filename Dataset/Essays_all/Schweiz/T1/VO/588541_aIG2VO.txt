In the text they are against the traditional voting. They think that they are more mistakes by voting traditional because they are always people that vote accidentally wrong because they have a poor eyesight. This is often the reason why they mark wrong names. Officials count the votes one by one so mistakes happen very fast. They have to recount every single vote and it take to long time. In the listening they are against computer voting. They think that there are many people that don't have enough computer skills to vote. They are many old people that never use a computer so they would have problems to vote for their candidat.It can be that the computer has also mistakes because people do the programs and every person can make mistakes. It's more dramaticaly when a computer makes a mistake because the whole program wouldn't be correct. So the reading and listening are like pro and contra. The reading is for the computer voting the listening against.
