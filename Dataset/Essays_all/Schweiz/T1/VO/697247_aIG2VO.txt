There has always been discussions about the voting system, we have in the United States. Votes counted by humans can often lead to inaccurate counting of the votes. But would a computerized voting system really would be easier and more effiecent? Let us look at the advantages and disadvantages of this topic.

The main reasons, opponents of the current voting system say, is, that when votes counted by humans, they can easily miscount votes, since they have thousands of votes to count, which is a tiring task to do. Following, when Officals make a mistake by miscounting, a recount is very long and expensive.
On the other hand, if the elections would take place with a computerized system, there is is no chance of human error. In fact, it would be much more efficient.

On the other hand, many people can't even afford computers. It is a very expensive item of technology to get. Another reason would be, that some people simply refuse to own a computer. Especially elder people don't know much about technology and don't see why they should get  computer. Another tremendous disadvanage of computerized voting would be,if thousands of votes would have been miscounted or even deleted. So an error in the program would be much worse than, a single vote you could forget, if it is counted by humans. There would be absolutely no record of the lost votes.

All facts considered, I think a computerized voting system is not a good idea. There are just too many people, who don't have access to a computer and so would be unable to vote for their country, which would be a very big loss. Humans will always make mistakes, no matter what. But I'm glad we do, otherwise we  would be machines.
