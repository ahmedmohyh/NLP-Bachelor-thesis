The voting system of the United States is been criticed. Many people say that the person who counts the votes, can make big mistakes. But they also say that computer based voting is also not good.
First, computer-based voting is very easy, but it's only easy for people who works with pc in their job or at home. Older People who don't know how a pc is working have difficultes with the computers. So at the voting stations there must be people who tell them how the pc works. Critics say that humans make mistakes, but the woman said that programmes also makes mistakes. A human can recount the votes but a computer-based programm can't count them again. So the programm must be improved so there aren't any errors. Then when they are without mistakes, we can trust them.
Finally, the text says that computers error remove the human error, but the women told us that computers can also make errors. But there shouldn't be errors because before they use the voting programm on computers they should test it, that they aren't any mistakes because it's important for the US that the system is correct.
