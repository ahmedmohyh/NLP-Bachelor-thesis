In this text the speaker is for the using of computer by votings. But in the presentation the woman said that maybe the computer count without mistakes but there are people who don't use a computer regularly. And this people will also vote for the wrong candidate because they don't know how to use a computer. The writer of this text said that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. But if they also don't know how to use a computer they will also vote for the wrong candidate at a computer. With the normal voting system officials have to count up the votes one by one, they have to go through every ballot and recording the vote. And if they miss a few ballots thousands of votes would be misscounted. With the computer the votes would not be misscounted but there would also be many votes for a wrong candidate.
