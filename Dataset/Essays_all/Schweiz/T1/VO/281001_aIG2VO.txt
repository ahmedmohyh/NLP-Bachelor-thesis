The new and better voting system

In the United States of America the election-methods are very old and therefor quite old. Many people don't believe in those methods anymore. The major problem of the critics isn't that the older people who want to select their preffered candidate on the piece of paper, also known as ballot, can't properly see the names of their candidats on the sheet. Their bigger problem is, according to the presentation, that many people don't believe in the technology that would be used. They think that the technology could maybe fail or be influenced. But at the moment all the methods are even easier to get faked. All of the ballots get counted and summed up by hand, how should that be correcter? The use of technology would be much more accurate!
