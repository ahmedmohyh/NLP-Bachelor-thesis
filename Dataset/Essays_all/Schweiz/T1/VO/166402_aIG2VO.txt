As opposed to the text, the lecturer believes it is unclear and doubtful if a electronical voting system would be better than the current traditional system. She is sure that this would distract old and poor people, eventually with low eyesight, that are not used to using computers and prevent them from voting. On the other side, the text's author claims that espacially these people would benefit from a new voting system because of an easier and self-explainable interface. 
Additionally, the lecturer does not think there will not exist human errors because everything needs to be programmed by humans. That means that bugs and errors are much more likely, especially as these new systems will not be as heavily tested as for example banking systems we are daily using. And she doubles down: Errors will have much larger impacts as previous errors because data could not be recovered if something goes completely wrong. Errors in the traditionnal voting system would have not a very large impact.
In contrast, the text's author does believe in no human errors and would like it to give it a chance, while the lecturer prefers to not even try out something new, at least until society got developed much further.
