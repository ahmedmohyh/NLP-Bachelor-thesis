In the two articles it is about how voting was in early years and how it could be in the future. The traditional voting is a large sheet of paper containing many names and the people have to make a small mark next to the name. The problem are that people often vote for the wrong candidate and miscounts. Thousands of small marks should be counted by some people? Impossible.

Now they want to invent a computerized voting machine but can we trust the technology? When we look at the situation of the people who never used computers, we easily realize that this computerized voting would be a problem for these people because they do not know how to handle it. What happens when there is an error on the computer all of them votes are deleted? All votings should be casted another time.

They now invent a new simple system that the computerized voting machines have: the easy-to-use touch-screen. With this new technology there will not be any problems in handling the system. But should we still trust the computers? What if there are hackers that influence the voting results. Actually our technology is advanced enough to be protected. When we take a look a the banking we see that their online banking is used daily and it did not always work flawlessly. They have to improve it a few times until it became this good.
