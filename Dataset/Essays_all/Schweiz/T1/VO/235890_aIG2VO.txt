In the text it said that the traditional voting systems used in the United states are unreliable. It said that there are many miscounts, because officials have to count up every single vote and then you can be sure that miscounts happen. Now they want to substitute the traditional method by a computerized voting system. Critics say there won't be so many mistakes anymore, but the speech told something else. They think that computers will make even more and also more drastic faults, because when an official makes a mistake it's usually only a few wrong names but when a computer makes a mistake it will influence the whole vote and can lead to a complete other result. Most people say that computers won't make mistakes but computers and their programmes are man-made, so there could also be a fault in the programme. Also, when officials make a mistake it will take a while to correct it and it would be extremely expensive but when a computer makes a mistake it will take even longer and also cost more. For people with poor eyesight computerized voting may be easier so that they won't accidentally vote for the wrong person, but for people who aren't good with computers or for the ones who don't even have a computer, traditional voting systems are better. After all you can say that it would be different with computerized voting, but sometimes you just have to give new things a try, just as online banking it needs time but when it's daily and heavily used it'll work.
