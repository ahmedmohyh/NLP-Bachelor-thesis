Computerized voting systems are more efficent and easier. But the disadvantages heard in the lecture are a lot. On the other hand the article says something totally different. So what are the arguments for and against traditional voting.

Firstly, the voting system in the United States is inefficient and causes inaccurate countings according to the text. If there is a close competition, this problem is much more severe in traditional voting. Many inhabitants of the United States vote for the wrong person, because they marked the wrong name. So this issue can be solved by introducing computerized voting, where the people only have to touch the name of the candidate. Furthermore the officials have to count the votes one by one and of cause they make mistakes. Therefore they have to recount the whole voting papers and that involves a lot of time. According to the autor of this article all these problems could be solved by introducing  a voting by a computer.

On the other hand, we have heard the disadvantages of computerized voting in the audio, too. Many people could not afford a computer and they have trouble to handle this device. Therefore they easily cast the wrong vote. Furthermore these systems are programmed by humans and so there are thousands of errors too.

So as we read the advantages of a computerized voting system in the article, there are a lot of disavdantages heard in the lecture, too. This two informational articles are very contradicting and have a totally different opinion. Overall it is to early to introduce such systems but in the future it could be possible.
