In the presentation a woman is talking about the idea of changing the traditional voting system into a computerized one. First she admits that the traditional systems has some problems. Then she starts talking about the computerized system. In her opinion people who are familiar with technology can adapt quickly to the new system and will find it easy to use. But people who do not have a lot of experience with computers will have some struggles. They could accidentily choose the wrong name or even stop voting at all because of their inability to use computers. 
She also adds that not only humans make mistakes and argues that computers can make mistakes to because they are built from humans. If an error accurs in the computer system this can cause more severe problems as if humans make mistakes. It is possible that the thousands of votes get deleted completely,because there is no physical evidence of the votes. At the end she says that computer system for bank may work excellent but only because they have been improved numerous times. She thinks that it is not necessary to change to voting system because it is only needed once every two years.
