In the presentation they said, that there are a lot of people out there, who aren't used to computers. Some of them don't even have one, because they can't afford it. So they say that there would be much less votes when you have to vote on the computer and can't use the traditional system. 
But in the text they arguement with the thing, that it is a lot easier to vote on the computer because you see the names of the candidats way clearer and you wouldn't mark the wrong one.

The opponents of the traditional system also say, that there are a lot of mistakes in counting the votes, because humans aren't as perfect as computers are.
But the women in the presentation argumented, that computer programms also are made by humans, and if there is one tiny error in the programm thousends of votes could be misscounted, and there would be no chance to do a recount. She also said, that it is very difficult to test such a programm, because elections are only one to two times in two years, and if there would be an major error in the system, there would be a big problem.
