As in every discussion there are two different opinions about the voting system in the USA. The actual traditional voting system is inefficient and inaccurate they say. They want to replace this system with a computer system. Firstly it is easy to accidentally give a wrong vote especcially if you have problems with your eyesight. This problem does not exist in the computer system. There it is possible to make the computer show the names with easier viewing. Secondly  the counting of the traditional system at the end is very much work and needs really much time. Furthermore if there is a mistake made while counting, which can easily happen by humans, there needs to be done a recount which again takes really much time.
Last but not least we should just give the computer system a try. Some people do not trust to the computer system eventhough we use  computers everyday for our banking system and the computers are doing an excellent job.

On the other hand does the computer system not eliminate the problem in human mistakes. The computer program is made by humans and there can happen mistakes too. If there really is a program error it can also lead to wrong votes. And if there happens an error a recount is impossible.
The computer is not easy to handle for everyone either. People who can not afford an own computer or just people who do not want an own computer have no experience and for them it can be really hard to use it.
