In the listening part, they are against computer voting, while in the text, they are against traditional voting.
In the listening part, they said that we can't be sure that computers don't make faults, and, if they do make faults, it is much more difficult to find them, because everything is stored on a system that, in the case of it having done something wrong, isn't reliable. You wouldn't be able to recount because you don't have the votes on real paper or in other form in reality, everything is digital. But you can always recount if the faults were made by human. Also, a fault made by computer can be much more vigilant than one made by human, because a human may skip some papers, while a computer could just lose thousands of files with important votes. But the text doesn't agree with this, the text sais, that the computer can't make faults while human do make them. In the listening part, it's also said, that, with a computerized system, less people would vote because they may be unable to handle the technology, or they can't afford a computer.
