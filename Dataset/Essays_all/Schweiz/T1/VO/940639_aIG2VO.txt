Traditional voting did not include computers. There were ballots on which you had to make a mark next to the candidate you were voting for. This system is now exchanged with the system of the computers.

In the presentation they were talking about all the different mistakes computers can make and that they could get even worse than the ones human made by counting all the marks in the past time. They want that people are aware of which huge problems computerized voting can cause. We have to remember that computersystems are programed by humans and that we are not flawless and that everybody make mistakes. Think of the fact if all of the votes that are captured on the system just get lost it would be a dramatical problem for the governement. It would not just be a few false counted votes, it would maybe be a few thousands, and that would mean big trouble. 
But there are not only this kind f mistakes there would be, there is also another problem that could appear. The fact that not every single person in the United States owns a computer makes it hard to get everybodies vote, just because they are not able to vote for their favourite candidate. And in addition, not everybody knows how to use the internet and so they maybe just decide not to vote before it gets to complicated.

In that way there are not only positive aspects of voting with computers and maybe the traditional voting system would be a little bit more secure than the modern way of voting.
