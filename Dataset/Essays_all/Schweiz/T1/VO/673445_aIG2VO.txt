In the presentation they said that humans programme computers and when a computer is programmed wrong that can cause a much bigger mistake. When you use a system like computers for counting votes there can be thousands of misscounts when there is a computer error. And there would only be a few when a human counts the votes. In the U.S. they need to count votes only a few times in a year in a state and only every other year nation wide. When they use  a new system there are a lot of mistakes and you would need to improve them all the time.
In the text they said that the voters need to mark the name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark th wrong name and humans can misscount the votes and that can cause a wrong election. We also use those systems daily for other business and we don`t think it  is too risky.
There are pros and cons for both systems so it is hard to decide.
