In the presentation I just listened to, a couple of points were emphasized. Looking at wealth distribution across the states, they presume not everyone comes in contact with computerized technology on a daily basis. Therefore making computerized voting confusing and/or even putting them off going to vote at all. Furthermore, for an elderly person or any person not acquainted with such technology, the likelyhood of making an error on a screen is greater than ticking a box on a traditional sheet of paper.
Concerning cyber danger and coming back on human error, the presentation explains that computer software is written by humans and therefore might be flawed aswell. Why, then, should we trust a software that, if an error is present, might have substantially more damage in  counting and verifying votes compared to a human missing three or four votes on a thousand?  And even if it isn't flawed, local votes take place twice a year, national votes every two years. That is too little excecution possibility to refine intuity and quality of the programme specifically created for that purpose. In finance and communication, where services/programmes are used "en masse" daily, we can rely on them as they're constantly undergoing testing and new data helps them improve.
