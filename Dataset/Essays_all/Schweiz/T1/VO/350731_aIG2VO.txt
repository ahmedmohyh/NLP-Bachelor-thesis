The text says that the current voting system are inefficient  and often lead  to miscounts. Officials have to count up the votes one by one and old people with poor eyesight easily mark the wrong name. The critics of the current system want to replace it with a new more efficient system, but the presentation says that the new voting system can also make faults. This faults woud be much worse, because a recount is impossible and if the computers make a fault the do not only miss one vote, the take thousands of votes false. Furthermore in the presentation you hear that computer system have to be prove and at the beginning there are some faults in every system. On other computer systems that are used every day, the  faults can be found fast, but if a system is only used once ore twice a year it is difficult to find them.  On the other hand you can read in the text that the governements trust also on other complex computer technology.
