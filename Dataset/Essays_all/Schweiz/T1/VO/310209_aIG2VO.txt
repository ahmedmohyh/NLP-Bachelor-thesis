Traditional voting system or the new computerized and futuristic one?
 People and the government are arguing if people should give their votes on a paper sheet, or on a computer system. both sides have their arguments.
People who want to vote on the computer, say that is is much easier to read the requierments on the computer than on the traditional paper sheet, on which the letters are written very small. They also say that it is inevitable to make mistakes with the old voting system. Because the ballots are counted by hand and if an error is detected it leads to an expensive and long recount. The also underline that voting with the computer is faster than select your candidates with a pencil.
the supporters of the traditional voting system believe that the programm of the computerized voting system is also kind of hand-made. Because a person has to install and check the whole programm. they say that humans make mistakes and it is common when the whole country is voting for the president of america. Furthermore voting with the computer is just easy for people who know how to use the computers, so the voting could be inefficent or inaccurate if people are selecting the wrong name. Also an important point is that not everyone can afford a computer or hasn't enough experience to use the compuer correclty. So this leads me to my next point, of course ballots can get lost in the old and traditional voting system. but imagine if there would be an error in the technological system? There could be thousands of ballots which are getting lost if there is an error in the hand-maded system. 
so summarising both voting systems aren't fully reliable and not many people are confident with this voting system.
