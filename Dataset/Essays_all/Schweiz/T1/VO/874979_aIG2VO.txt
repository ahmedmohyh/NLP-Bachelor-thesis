The Text and the listening are both about the U.S. voting system. They argue about wether the traditional votig system should be replaced by a computerized system or not. 
The text says that in the traditional voting system, the chance of accidentally voting for the wrong person is high because of the large ballot, and that this risk would be eliminated if the people would vote on a computer. Moreover, humans make mistakes while counting the votes, because there are thousends of ballots they have to count. That wouldn't be a problem for a computer. 
In the listening they don't think that comuters would make it any better. They say that people who aren't used to computers will be afraid of the technology and make mistakes while voting too, no matter how good the program may be. Another point is that the programs are programmed by humans and if they make a mistake while programming there are thousends of wrong votings, much more then in the traditional system would be even possible. On plus, this programm wouldn't be used every day, so it may be too complicated for some people. 
So, the disagree in every point and contradict each other in every point.
