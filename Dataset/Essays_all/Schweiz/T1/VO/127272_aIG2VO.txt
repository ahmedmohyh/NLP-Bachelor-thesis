Voting with a computer system doesn't remove the possibility of human error, because the computer programmes are programmed by humans. If they did a mistake, it can result in misscounted votes for example. Computerized voting is much easier than the current voting system in the United States, espessially for the people who have to count all the votes. If they voted in this modern way, it would facilitate their lifes, because a computer would count all the votes and they wouldn't have to count them all one by one.  Although  the computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology, there can happen a lot of mistakes, because there are a lot of people who don't use computers daily, so they would have problems to vote in this way.
