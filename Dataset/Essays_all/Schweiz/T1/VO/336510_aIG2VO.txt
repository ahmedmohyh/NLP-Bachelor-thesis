The woman comits that the current, traditional voting system has some problems but said that the proposed computerised method isn't better. She said that a lot of people can't afford a computer so they couldn't take parte on the elections. Or that a lot of especialy older people haven't the knowledge for the computer so they don't even vote because they're affroid of the knew technologies.
She denied the argument that computers are better for the counting system because she said that the computers are programed by human beeings too. Some votes could be lost or even be misscount. Finally she said that the computersystems which are used for the banking systems on a regulary basis are working perfect now but at the beginning they also had problems. And at some places the elecction systems would only be used once every two years.
