In the text, it was written, that people in the traditional voting system can accidentally vote for the wrong person. There is a list with many names on it and it can easily happen, that somebody makes a mark next to the wrong name. The women in the presentation had another opinion. She said, that computerized voting can be even more problematic than the traditional voting. It would be very difficult for people, who are not used to computers, because they either have no computer at home or they do not use it very often. These people woult have problems with computerized voting and could easily vote for the wrong person, because they do not get along with the system.

The second point, that was mentioned, was, that the people, who count the votes make mistakes and that it is not reliable that humans count the votes. The women in the presentation did not agree with this. She said, that there can be errors in the computer systems. They are made by humans and can contain mistakes. Errors in computer systems are more serious than errors, which are made of people, who count the votes. Thousands of votes could be miscounted and there is no possibility to find the error. In the presentation, it was said, that the traditional voting is more reliable.
