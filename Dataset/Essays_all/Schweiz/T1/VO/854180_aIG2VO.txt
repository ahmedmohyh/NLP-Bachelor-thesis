In the speech the person talked about the current tradtitional voting system in the USA and made some compariosons to a new computerised voting system they are thinking about to introduce. In the text, the major disadvantages of the traditional voting are explained. This system is described as inefficient and inaccurate. On the other hand, the speaker in the listening speech was talking about the disadvantages which the computerised voting has to face.People which are not used to new technologies, such as computers or mobiles, will have trouble to cope with the new voting system or are scared to even try to do so. Further more the question was raised, if computers and these newly introduced system would be better, than the old system. And the fact, that mistakes, programmed by humans in the computer system will lead to even bigger troubles than a mistake made by a person in the traditional voting. Other than in the traditional voting, a recount would be impossible with the computersiced voting system because the results can't be recounted seperatly again. But an advantage of the newly developed system would be the election of a candidates name, so think the supporters of the computerised system. Because in the old voting system, the voters had to search therir neames in long listes, which would eventually lead to mistakes. The electronic way would be much easier. 
So all in all, advantages and disadvantages are thrown together and named.
