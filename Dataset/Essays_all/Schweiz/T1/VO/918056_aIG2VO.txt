The main point in the text is that the current voting systhem in the United States is inefficient. There are different reasons for that. The first on is that the people who count the votes may make some errors while countig the votes beause the count them one by one and it takes a lot of time. So they could loose their consentration and make errors. An other reason is that people with poor eyesight sometimes choose the wrong person by accident because they can't see the paper very well. The opinion of this text is that the voting system in the United States should be computerized. They think that computers make less errors and people can see better on the monitors and read the names right even though some people might be against it they think the gouvernments has to give it a try.

The presentation has a sleithly diffrent opinion. They think that errors made by the computer pogramm of the voting system could have a much bigger influence on the total counting than little errors made by hand. They also fear that peole who can't afford a computer or are affraid of the new technology won't go voting anymore. But they have a possible solution for this problem. They explain how the computer tecnology was improved over years and years after the first computer came on the market. They think that the United States should start investing and imroving the computerized voting systems so that the future generation is already used to voting online when they can start voting.
