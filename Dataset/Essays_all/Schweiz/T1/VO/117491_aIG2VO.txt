The voting systemin the United States are often critised because of their inaccuracy. The chance to vote for the wrong candidate is high dense the ballot is really large and hard to read which is another disatvantage of the system. It is written really small which increases the possibility of voting for the wrong candidate. When the votes are collected they have to be counted. This is done by humans which can make a mistake when counting thousands of ballots. If a mistake of miscounting was the case the whole voting would have to be repeated. This would cost a lot of money. Because of all this disadvantages of classic voting it is thought to replace it bycomputer voting:

Computer voting has the advantage that it is easier to read and to mark with the touch screen. So it is the risk of voting for the wrong candidate is less high. The computer system also avoids miscounting because it has not to be counted anymore by human beeings. But computer voting has also its disadvantages as said by the presenator: What about people which don't know how to use a computer or those who haven't got one. And this computers are also programmed by humans so why won't be an error there? An error in the computer system would cause a lot higher damage thana miscounting and the voting would have to be repeteated like with the normal system. The whole system won't be perfect by the moment it is launched and it is necessary to increaseit during years.
So both of the voting system have their disadvantages of a miscountig or the choice of a wrong candidate.
