Both the text and the presentation treat a controversary topic - the voting system in the United States. 

While in the text the today's system is beeing considered as inaccurate and inefficient the presentation on the other hand shows a more conservative oppinion. In the text it is said that vote counting using the ballots is not only risky but also expensive. Humans who have to count thousands of votes always make mistakes. So won't it be better to introduce computers? In the presentation they say it will not. That many people are not convenient with computers. Well actually this might be true - but still I think it is easier to tap a button on a display which is bigger than to mark a tiny spot in the ballots? After all, is it really necessary to have a computer at home? In the text we find out: No. There are efficient voting machines to cast a vote.

On the other hand there is the problem with making mistakes. Although both state that humans are liekly to do mistakes they contradict in the second part. The text says computers are far more efficient and less risky because they avoid the human failure. But in the presentation it is said that also the computers have to be programmed by humand, thus it might be done wrongly. Though I have a quesiton here: How do you want to improve something, if you are not willing to let the old go? Today we have decades of experience with computers. The whole world is connected. But it is true that computers cannot think for themselves. Something always has to be done by humans. But in my opinion it is less probable to do mistakes in programming.

So do we want to make computers our lives easier or do we want to rely the human brain?
