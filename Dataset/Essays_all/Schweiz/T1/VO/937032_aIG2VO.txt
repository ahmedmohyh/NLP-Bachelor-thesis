The text and the presentation was about the current voting system and that there are people which want a computerized voting. 
It's told that the people make many mistakes by counting the votes. Also the voting could be donea lot faster. An other argument is that many people vote for the wrong candidate. On the paper are many candidates and the people have to find their candidate. Because of this it oftens happens, that they accidently do the wrong mark. Also for the same reason people with poor eyesigh chose the wrong name.
But other people prefer the current voting system. they don't think that mistakes would be eliminatede with a computerzied voting system, because the computers are controled by human. an other problem is, that when computers make mistakes it often is a realy big mistake, which can't be removed.
