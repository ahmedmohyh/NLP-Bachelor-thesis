The hearing part was about the voteing methods in the United States. The main question was if it is better to vote on the traditional way or to do it on a computer. There are several pro and contras for both methods. If the people vote on the tratitonal way they have to go to this special place and do it as always. But the thing is that it could have some false notes. The people who can not see very well could tick the wrong name. Or the person who counts the votes could lie or do some other forbbiden things, like put some votes more or less for a specific person.
If we vote on the computer it would be more modern and quicker done. The persons with eye problems could easier tick the right person. But the problem is that not all people have an computer. Some people would not vote anymore because they do not know how to use it (old people). And if there is an problem with the counting or if the computer losts dates it is impossible to take all back.

The difference between the reading and the hearing part is that the reading part supports the new technology and it is a kind of motivation to change the system and to vote on computers. In the hearing part they do not support one side. They are telling good and bad things for both sides.
