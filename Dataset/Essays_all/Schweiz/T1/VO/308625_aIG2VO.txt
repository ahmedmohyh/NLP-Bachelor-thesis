In the listening part I heard that computervoting isn better than human counting at all because if the computer makes a mistake, there are a lot of votes which will be counted wrong automatically. Another disadvantage ist that not everyone knows how to work with a computer. This leads to mistakes and the result gets damaged.
On the other side, the text sais that humans make much more mistakes while counting the votes by hand than the computer does. Another problem is that the names of the candidats are all written on a big sheet, which makes it difficult for the voters to find the name of their favorite candidate. Here, mistakes are made often because peolpe vote for the wrong candidate. 
Mistakes during the vote counting process, doesn`t matter if this is made by hand odr with a computer, leads to a long and expensiv process because they have to find the problem and solve it.
