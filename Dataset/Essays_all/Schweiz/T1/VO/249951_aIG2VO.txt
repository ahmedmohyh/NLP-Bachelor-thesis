The written text and the presentation I heard, are the complete opposite of one another. 

The text says, that computrized electing systems would be far more efficient than the old electing system. The old one is said to be full of errors and mistakes, because people with poor eyesight can easily tick the wrong name on the ballot and it often happens that the people counting the ballots one by one, miss a few ballots or count incorrectly. And with the new one we would be able to vote with an easily made click on a touch-screen. And all the counting would be done by the computers, so there would be a lot time saved and a lot of mistakes avoided, so the author of the text said.

The opposing presentation tells us, that it is doubtful wether the computerized system would do any better than the one they already have.
Besides, so the woman said, there are far too many people who don't know how to use a computer or maybe don't even have one nor can afford one. And this would lead to a low number of people voting, because many people would have a fear of voting, a fear to make a mistake whilst voting so they won't even go vote anymore. And further on, it isn't even sure if the computers are as flawless as they're made out to be, because they are human made, and humans make mistakes, so the woman told us. And to contradict, the woman said, that all online banking systems were at first full of errors and that it would take us a lot of time to make them flawless. So in her opinion, we should rather stick to the old system, even if some ballot may go missing.
