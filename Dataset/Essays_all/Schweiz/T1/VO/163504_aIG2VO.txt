In the presentation it is admitted that there exist problems with the common voting system. But still the presentator doubts that a computer would make it any better. While in the text it is criticized that the traditional systems are inefficient and cause inaccurate counting of votes. Because in a system like in the USA, or many other (democratic) countries, the voters have to mark their chosen candidate on the ballot which contains many other canditates' names. This can naturally lead to misvoting, as elderly people for example with poor eyesight might easily mark the wrong name.
Therefore in the presentation it is said that with a new voting system through the computer many people could be led to declining voting. Either because they can't afford a computer, or because they don't use it on a regular basis which means that they would be feeling unconfortable using the computer for making their vote count. And another point is, that it would be impossible to say that a computerized system would'nt have any faults, because it is programmed by human beings. So while in the traditional voting a counting of the ballots by some officials could cause a few miscounts, a fault in the programme would lead to thousands of votes falsley counted. And even worse: While a recounting of the marks on the ballots could be done with some great financial costs, a recounting of digital votes would not be possible because no personal datas are secured and kept.
