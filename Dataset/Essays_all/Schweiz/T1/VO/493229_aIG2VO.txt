In the presentation was said, that there are not only advantages of a new computerized voting system, because there are people who do not trust computers, do not understand how to use them or do not have any access to one, because they cannot afford it. People may think that a computer cannot do any mistakes, but humans have written the programms so how can we be sure that they have not done anything wrong? Because if they have programmed the system wrong there could be thousands of votes who would not been counted and because there are not any physical records of the votes, we can not recount them by hand.
Without the computerized system there would of course be the possibility that a human being misscounts some votes but they could be easily recounted.

In the text they do not have any disadvantages of the computerized system, they try to convince us to support the newer system. Also there is no advantage showed from the traditional voting. They only want to show the negative aspects. The text shows us information which are not said in the presentation and vise versa.

The presentation tries to convince us to stick to the traditional voting and the text to change to the computerized voting system. If you have the information of both you can make up your mind and find out which system is in your opinion the better one.
