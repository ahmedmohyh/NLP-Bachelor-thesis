In the Presentation she said that people, wich aren't working with computers or haven't ever used a computer, would have problems with the voting system on the computer. But in the text was written that people with poor eyesight, often vote for the wrong candidate beacasue they make the cross at the wrong place on this large voting sheet and it would be easier for them to vote on computer, because they only have to press the candidates name on the touch screen. The women told also, that there also can be counting errors in the computer voting system. She said when the system crashes, not only a couple of votes will be missed or haven't been counted, maybe the votes of a hole city or a state will be missing. The autor of the text disagrees with that, becasue he believes that the computer system can't have any errors. He has written, that people have to recount the votes many times and thats very inefficient to recount every vote again and again and the result is not evry time right. The women said also in the presentation, that he voting system only would be used every two years and the system would never be so good than the system that the banks are using, becuase the banks use their system every day and it took a long way to evolve a such a good computer system wich works without big problems. So the women of the Prsentation is for the old voting system and the Autor of the text for an computerized voting system.
