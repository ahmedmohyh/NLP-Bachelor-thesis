Criticers are saying that the actual method of election is not as safe and efficient as an electronic method. They are mentioning that the current voting system contains miscounts and people who can't see very well have problems to elect the right candidate. The supporters of the computer voting system are also saying that an electronic counting wouldn't require as much people as the traditional system. On the other side there are people who are critizising the electronic version in the point that old people who weren't born in the "Computer Generation" would have problems by electing on a computer. It could be difficult for them to understand how the program works and where they have to klick to choose the right candidate. The supporter of the traditional system are thinking that it would be risky to use computer tecnology for such important things like the election of a president. There could be hackers which could falsify the results of the election. Or what about a breakdown of the internet? Many datas would disappear and the elections would have been for nothing. With such arguments they support the traditional old voting system. The other side is mentioning that we use computers also for sensible datas like electronic banking or communication. We have to know that also the e-banking system didn't always work at the beginning and had a lot of problems. It is a process of increasement which did of this systems efficient ways to do things faster and eaier. Mabye an electronic voting system would do the same.
