The woman said it's true that we humans make often make mistakes if we vote per hand. But why she also said why can't we really trust the computer? Because the computer are progrommed by us humans. So the computer can also make a mistake. If for example the computer has an error it could be thousands of votes are lost. But she said also that ist really difficult to count all the letters who wroten by hand. It's more easy to count the computer votes. She also said that an error is really rare, because only every 4 years it's a big voting and every year or twice it's a small voting. So she said finally it would be better to vote with the computer, becuase the chance would be so small that something can happen.
