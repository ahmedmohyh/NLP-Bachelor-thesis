One argument from the listening exercise is that eventhough computers don't make a lot of mistakes, they are still programmed by humans which make mistakes. Like mentioned before computers hardly make a mistake but if they do, they make huge mistakes. Also not everybody on the planet has the ability to use a computer, especially the old people are afraid of using such a technology. There are also people who just don't have access to a computer. Let's assume the US would use computers as a voting device. Many voters, mostly older people, wouldn't have the time to get used to it or couldn't trust it because they vote just two times a year.
In the text it is mentioned that computers would be great as voting devices. But than we will still have the problem that the people who aren't used to such machines wouldn't trust them and as a consequence they wouldn't go voting. In the US there are also people who don't have access to a computer, so they wouldn't go voting aswell. In the text it says that voters make mistakes, but if the people vote on computers and if the computer suddenly makes an error, than all the results would disappear and you would have a much bigger problem.
