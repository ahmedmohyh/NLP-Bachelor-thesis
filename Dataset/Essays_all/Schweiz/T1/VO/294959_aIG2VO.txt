The new voting system:

One major argument for the wish of a change in the voting system of the US are the human mistakes. All the ballots have to be counted by hand, therefor it is clear that in some point in time there will be made some mistakes. One solution for this problem would be "computercounting". The votes woult be taken by a computerprogramm. Voters would just have to click on their candidate's name and that's it. Nobody would have to sit there counting ballots for hours. But this programm is also "just" made by humans so it can also easily contain errors. And these would be defenetly worse than the two to three votes that could have been counted incorrectliy by a person. There could be thousands of votes that were counted wrong. Also there are still people who are unused to computer or don't even have one. But this problem could be solved easier than the fact that every programm needs to be tested and developed based on the difficulties thet showed up. In comparison to the normal use of for example the internet, elections happe very rarely. In some smaller citys even only every two years. So how is this programme supposed to be developed if it is used only this little? But never the less one should not just criticise this possible new way of voting because it contains also many positive parts for example the fact of speed while counting and that one can simply vote at home and so on. So personally I think it's worth a try or at least a thought!
