Voting system - which is better?

Human mostly make mistake in a voting contest. They miscount the votes and so the result is not exactly correct. Does the computer rate the votes better? If human miscount and make mistakes so can devices, which human made, also do. The miscalculation of human beings is about a few votes but what if computers miscount it would be enormous amount and sometimes some votes can also get deleted. They make bigger miscalculations and it could cause a completely wrong election. Computers are not any safer than humans are.

On one hand computers and technology have been improved a lot in the last few years but they are not perfect enough the overbeat a human being. The computers just execute what the admin says him to do. So computer can be easily manipulated, hacked, so it is not a question how good they are it is a question how much they obey the admins.

To enclose the hole thing humans are much better than the technology them allows to be. Human brains do not just do what they have they can on his own and can decide if it is correct to cheat for an example. The computer is dumb because it would be nothing if the human did not give them life in programming and creating them. I am not saying that we can not trust our own devices but we can not let them do everything for us. Human ratings are not only based on science!!!
