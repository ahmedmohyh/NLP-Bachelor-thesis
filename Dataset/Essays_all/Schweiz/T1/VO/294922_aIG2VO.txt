The text we read describes the problems of traditional votings. It says that the voting sheet is difficult to handle and that people often tick the wrong name. Using a computer would be less complicated. But the presentation we heard says that computers are only easier to use for those who are used to work with a computer. For people who never use computers, computerized voting machines would be hard to use.
Also, the text criticizes that the votes are counted by humans and that it is impossible for humans to never make a mistake. And if a mistake gets discovered, you have to recount all the votes, which is very long and expensive. The presentation responses with the argument that computers are also programmed by human-beings and that computer systems must be tested and tested until you can be sure that there isn't any mistake in it. But in the USA, votes take place only every two years, and introducing the computerized system would take a long time. Also, mistakes in the computer system are often much bigger than the faults humans make. Thousands of votes could be miscounted or removed.
Finally the text says that humans trust computers in so many things, so why not in voting? But the presentation responses that counting on them is very dangerous, especially in important things like voting.
