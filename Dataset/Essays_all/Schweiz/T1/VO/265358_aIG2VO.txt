In the lecture they say even though the current voting system may seem inefficient, voting by computers wouldn't be any better. First of all, omputers can make mitakes too, as they are programmed by humans. And those mistakes are far worse because if there aren't any ballots, a recount is impossible. Also, not all people have or use computers, especially old people don't. As those are mostly the ones with poor eyesight,it wouldn't help them a lot. Some of them are not used to it so maybe the wouldn't even vote at all, which would lead to a decrease in votes. Lastly, banking systems are a lot more trustworthy, because they've existed for a long time now, and have always been improved. Nowadays, they are used daily, whereas the voting systems would only be nationally used every other year, and inside the states up to twice a year.
