I don't see any problem in voting with computer, a fear of technology is a rather bad excuse for not voting, because i'm sure everybody knows someone who can explain the people who can't afford a computor what they have to do. And if not you can just place in every votingstation a "specialist" of this system or just an ordinary person who understands just the basics of a computor and this person could explain it just as well.
The best part is that it's much more time efficient for the votingstation and the voters. Everything in computerized voting is just beneficial for anybody and if we would be comparing in the end the computer would do much less harm to the votes than a human mistake.
Even in the beginning, with the technology that we have to our exposal, it is pretty easy for a normal programmer to write such a programm. And if you want it especially safe, you just hire many prorammers and do a little contest of which programm is the best. I am sure that in other countrys there is a computerized system that works just fine, like all the goverment and information systems that everybody uses without a second thought.
The human has just too many flaws and the only faults of the computerized system will be that the humans will still press on the wrong name of their chosen candidate.
