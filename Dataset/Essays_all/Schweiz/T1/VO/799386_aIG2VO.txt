In the presentation, they said that the traditional election isn't used anymore. It is to risky to count all the votes by hand. In that way you make to much mistakes.
But they tell us that the computers aren't better. There are many people who can't afford a computer so they can't even vote.
Also especially for people who aren't used to computers,computer votes aren't a good idea. They don't know how to make their voting and cast the wrong vote. Some people are afraid to make a voting and don't even do it at all.
They say, if the counting by hand isn't good enough, then why should be a computersytem better, that was also made by humans. The program can also have mistakes. It could miss votes, misscount the votes or even remove some votes from the election. Everything is handled by the computer, so if there's something going wrong with the program, you can't see it.
But we know such programs are used dayly. At the beginnint they also weren't as good as now. The people in presentation say that maybe we could start to trust them because they are getting better and better.

The text tells us that they find the votings difficult too. If you vote by hand there are same troubles you can have with the computer. Some people cant find the right name because there are so many. Some can't ready it because of bad eye sight.
On the computer you can't touch the right buttom to vote for the one you want. The text doesn't trust the voting of the people itself, not the counting like the one in the presentation was worried about.
But in the text they really don't trust computers at all, while in the presentation the suggest to start trusting them now.
