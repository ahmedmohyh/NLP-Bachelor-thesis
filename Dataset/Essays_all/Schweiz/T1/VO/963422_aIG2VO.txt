Voting

The biggest points against the current voting system in the US are, that the system is ineffiecient do says the text. One of the biggest argument against that system is, that there can by mistakes durring the countig, because the officials must count the votes one by one and durring this work it can happen that the officals over see one vote or they make a mistake durring the countig. An that's why a computerized system is much more efficient, so the ciritcs from the text. In the audio they say that a computerized system can also make mistake, because the system is made by human so it's possible that human error appear too.
an other argument in the text is, that we already use and trust complex computer technology every day. In the audio they say that these programms are used every day, so in the early stages of these programms the erased all the errors and can evolve, but the votings are just twice so they can't improve fast enough that the system works fine after a short time. Also the say in the audio that there are people which can't use a coumputer, because they don't have one or don't work with a coumputer. So there can be errors durring the voting.
