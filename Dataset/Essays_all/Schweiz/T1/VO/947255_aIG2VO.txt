The text says that a new voting system is needed but the woman says that it's not suffisant because there is only one voting in 2 years in the USA. In the regions it's maximum 2 votings per year so a new system is not needed. But the woman points out another aspect: The people who aren't used to computers wouldn't be able to vote anymore. Some of them even have fear of technology. But the text says that there weill be an easy-to-use-touch-screen which everyone is able to use. 

The text also sees a problem in the inaccuraricy of the votings. First with traditionally voting it's easy to vote for the wrong guy because it's a long list of names and you need to make a small mark beside that name you want to vote for and the 2nd problem are the erros that occure while counting the votes. If there's an error a long and expensive recount is needed. But the woman says that if the program has an error, which is likely because humans write that program and human errors can occure there aswell, there is no way of recounting the votes or something and probably thousands of votes will be lost but the text says that computers are perfectly accurate.
