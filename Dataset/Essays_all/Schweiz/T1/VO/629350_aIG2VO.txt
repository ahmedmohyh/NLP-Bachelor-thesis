So first off, the text seems to think that humar error is a problem with traditional voting. This just means that a person can miscount, missout or skip a vote while counting up all the votes. The listening however gave told us that mistakes can occur with computers aswell. For example bad software design could cause very big problems. It was also mentionend that traditional voting gives us a actual physical copy of the votes, while computerized voting could potentionally delete everything and be unrecoverable. 
Another point the text has, is that a computer is easier to use for the voter. This is because with traditional voting, a person can tick off the wrong person because they have bad eyesight or something like that. However a computer could magnify your vote, and provide an overall more user friendly voting interface. But the listening shot down this point due to the fact that computers are not as easy to use at it seems. The main reason is because not all people are technologically inclined yet, so people might not be able to understand how to vote. Another thing is, computers are expensive which means some people might not be able to afford a comptuer and therefore be discouraged from voting at all.
As for the point about how computers are used for sensitive thing like baking, while this is true, the listening tells us that voting only happens once a year. Online banking stuff happens thousands of times a second, however it is only scarcely voted. This obviously means that banking systems are a lot more advanced and have been evolving for a much longer time. They too have had their ups and downs. Having to go through trial and error in the field of voting, is not reallly a viable option.
