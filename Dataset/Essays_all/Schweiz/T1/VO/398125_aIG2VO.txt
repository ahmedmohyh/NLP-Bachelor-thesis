There was a discussion about voting by computer or the traditional way. The problem with the classic voting system is, that people with bad eyesight might won't see the names of the candidates. That's a reason why people vote for the wrong person. If there were computers just in front of every voter, they could read everything clearly and easily. So they would vote correctly. But it's dificult for lots of elderly to use computers. Especially when they aren't used to technic. An other view was that human who have to count all the ballots weren't countig without errors. It is kind of impossible, that's a reason for being on the side of the computers, because people don't think that technic is able to make mistakes. Is that true? Computers are made by humans, if there's a small fault in their system, it would be possible that a thousand ballots are missing and nobody would ever know. You might think that other systems like banking tractions are as trustworthy as the new voting system, but the banking tractions are used every day, so the owners were able to delete errors. The voting system would be used  once a year, it's much more difficult to build a system without errors, when there was no possibility to practice one time. We don't know how the system would suit the USA but maybe they should give it a thought.
