, I agree with this statement, because especially today, where the kind of advertising, that is showed, isn't really childfriendly. As an example, little time ago my little sister and I watched a kids film on a regular channel and suddenly a advertising about sex toys came up.


 Of course they didn't know what this kind of toys are, but honestly it is a shame, that the television allows that. Kids ask questions, if they didn't understand  something, so maybe the parents won't tell them, what it is, but the bigger brother could explain them really well, what the practices are, that you do with these toys.

 Through this they get much more involved in things, that are subject of grown-ups. 

The whole fashion and cosmetic advertsing is also a huge problem. 

The skinny, "beautiful" models present their products in a sexual way and talk in a seductive voice.

 This can lead especially girls,but also boys, to think that this anorexic women or muscle men are the beauty ideals.

 Because they are in an age, in which they are really manipulative and don't think for theirself, they are likely to  take over the opinion of the people and things, that are around them or are shown them. 

They want to be just like the models, that are in television, so skinny, so trained, so beautiful.

 But to reach such an supernatural body image, they have to lose unhealthy weight, which is achieved trough eating disorders, and of course photoshop, also it can lead to psychic problems and suicide, because they didn't see themself as good enough.

In general children shouldn't waste time on electronic devises, which aren't the real world. They learn much more about a good life, when they are in the woods or playing games with their friends.

So they learn to socialize and to respect each other. 

This are two much important points to have as happy, self-employed and honest grown-up.
