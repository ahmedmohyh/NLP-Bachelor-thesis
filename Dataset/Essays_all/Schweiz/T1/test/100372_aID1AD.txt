I think these argument would sure make sense if you want to protect your child against the capitalistic system we`re living in. 

But it honestly makes no sense to let your child watch Tv if you`re against advertising. 

Further it doesn`t really makes a different if the adverstising is directed toward a two year old girl or a 85 year old man, in any case the young child will get influenced by commercials. 
The only difference is the way of how the child gets influenced.

Another argument against this statement is, that not only the advertising in television influences the children.
In fact the show they`re actually watching is far more influencing, than the commerials. 

But in the other way you have say that this can be really bothering young parents, when their little son is coming downstairs and all he want is a new playstation because the television said only cool kids got playstations. 
Sure you want your child to grow up without tv, but sometimes also the best mom needs a pause and places her son near the television so hes calm for a while.

My opinion is, that this statement doesn`t really makes sense. 
If you want your child to grow up without beeing influenced by tv commercials, you don`t even buy a television.
 In fact, you can buy your child an MP3 so it can listen to good music witch is much better and as highly entertaing as Spongebob Squarpants.
