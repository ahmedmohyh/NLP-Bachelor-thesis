In general are memoires described as pretty unreliable sources, but in the case of the memoire of chevalier, they say it is a pretty reliable source in therms of European Society at that time even though he was such a contoversial figure. In the text the events of the Chevalier are described and viewed very sceptical whereas the listening relies the negative things again that we can read in the text. The text says that Chevalier, was considered as very wealthy and rich but the author denies this statement because sources say that he had to borrow money from the governement. Now in the listning they say that he had to borrow money even though he was rich, but they give a reasonable explenation for it. They say that it took some time for his money to arrive and in that time he had to borrow money from the bank. The second point they mentioned of Chevalier was, that he knew Voltaire and that he had a conversation with him. Both sources, listening and reading, agree that he knew him but in the text they are again critical over the conversation that Chevalier made public, saying that couldn't even remember a conversation this presisely. The listening is explaining it, by saying that he wrote everything down the evening after the meeting. The third point was his stay or in this situation his escape from prison and the text claims that he hadn't climbed through the ciling because his famous friend could have just bribed him out the listening relies it agin.

In general does the listening give more information and explains the situations more detailed. But the text and the listening still explain the same things that Chevalier did, just in different ways. The listning is keeping his good image up, whereas the text is sceptical if these thing have really occured like that.
