When the Chevalier lieved in Switzerland, he spent a lot of money on partys and gambling. It's told that he had been very rich. But in Switzerland he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Critics say that if he really had been very rich, he wouldn't have needed to borrow money. But the women before told, that the Chevalier just run out of cash because it needs a lot of time until the money cames to him.

Second example was that he wrote in his memoire about the conversations between him and Voltaire. Critics say that it's impossible to remember exact phrases of conversations held many years earlier. But today we know that the Chevalier wrote down everything of the conversation in the evening after they've talked.

Third situation were the text and the women aren't agree is about his esacpe from the prison.Critics say that his esacpe through a hole in the ceiling is just made for enjoyable reading. But shortly after he escaped, they had to repair the ceiling. 

In the end we aren't sure about the accuracy of the memoire. There are always some pros and cons. It's not easy to find evidences, who would explain a lot, so many years after he had lived.
