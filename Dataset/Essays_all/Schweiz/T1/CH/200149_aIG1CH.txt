In the presentation they have given many arguments that proof the truth of Chevalier de Seingalts texts. For example they have mentioned that Chevalier had lots of loans during the time he spent in Switzerland. But that does not mean that he was poor at all, because he had to sell his things in order to get some money which took some days to process. During that time, since he had no intention on waiting and doing nothing, he took some loans from merchants to continue his gambling.
Another point mentioned in the text was the incorrectness of Chevaliers talks with Voltaire. But in the speech they say that Chevalier took notes every night after talking with Voltaire and that there is evidence that he always used these handwritten notes to include them in his memoir.
Chevalier also accounted in his memoir that he had escaped from a notorious prison in Venice through the roof. Many critics claim that he has just bribed himself to freedom and didn't escape like a hero. But other prisonners had way better connections to important people than Chevalier and they were not able to bribe. And old Venician documents quote that they had to repair the ceiling of the prison cell in which Chevalier was in after he had left the place which is a proof that he really did escape from the prison using a piece of metal to dig a hole into the ceiling.
