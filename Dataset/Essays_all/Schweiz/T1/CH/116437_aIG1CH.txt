Chevalier de Seingal lived in the eighteen century and wrote a book recounting his life. But many people think, that he invented many events in his book so that his life seems more exciting. Critics are arguing that Chevalier de Seingalt wasn't able to be rich and live in welth because he had do borrow money. But he was gambling and when he won the money he had to turn the paper-money into real money because with no fluence money he wasn't able to buy something. So he had to borrow money from other people until he had his own. One day he met a famous writer called Voltaire and he had written down a pice of converstaion between him and the writer, but critics claim that it is not possible to write down a conversation as exactly as he does many years later. So maybe he had a notice where he had been written down the conversation and later added it to his memoir.  He also escaped from a prison in venice, as written in his memoir he escaped over the roof by making a hole in the ceiling and climbe through it. Critics are saing, he won't be able to escape the way like that, is more likely that, one of that many politically well-connectet frends he had in venice, helped him to escape. Many of other prisoners had much more muscles but were not able to escape, so maybe the storie with the escape trough over the roof is possible but alos the version of beeing helped by one of his friends.
