The text and the presentation are the complete opposite of each other. The Text is really negative and claims that the chevalier is a liar. The presentation is really positive about him and  there is a possible explanation to everything in the text. But who is he? The chevalier was a person who lived in the 18th century. He met a lot of really famous people and wrote down a long memoir about them. Thats how he became a valuable historical source. However there are people claiming that he invented parts of his story so it would sound better.
 So first of all there was the story of the chevalier living in Switzerland for a while. He spent a lot of money on gambling and parties, like a rich. But there are documents that prove him loaning a lot of money. So the question is: was he really rich? Yes, but he had a lot of properties, which he had to sell first in order to get money. That took a while, so he had to get money for the mean time. So he wasnt poor at all. 
 The second episode was about him controversing with voltaire and writing a memoir a few years later about it. There are really specific details in his text, which, as critics claim, cannot be memorized for that long. But he took notes after every single conversation and friends of his can prove that.
 The third and last episode was about his time in a prison in venice, which, as he claims, he escaped from through the ceilling. Critics claim that cant be possible and that because of his connection to a lot of people, somebody could have offered a bribe. But there were a lot better connected people in the prison, which werent freed, so why him? Also after his escape the ceilling in his room had to be repaired. I dont think that is a coincidence.
So now  the question is if the sources of the presentation are real or not. It all depends on that.
