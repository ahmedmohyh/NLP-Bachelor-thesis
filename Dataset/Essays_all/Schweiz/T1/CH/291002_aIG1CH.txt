The Chevalier Essay
In the Text they talk about how rich the Chevalier really is but they also tell that he had to borrow money. So why did he need to borrow money? The answer is that he firs thad to get the money and that always took him a few day. In those days he had to borrow the money and paid it back as soon as his own money arrived. Also is mentioned in the text that he wrote down conversations with him and the writer Voltaire but Critics are worried aout the accuracy of the conversations. Otherwise its told he always took notes after his conversations or worte the conversation down and kept them for years so that he could use them for his memoir. And now to the last thing out of the text the escape from the prison in Venice. He claims that he broke out with piece of metal und through the ceiling. Sound like a great story but how true is it. In the hearing exercise we hear that in the same prison were other people with much powerful friends than the chevalier had but the also talk about the that they had to repair the ceiling after he came out of it. I think the critics have some good arguments and they are good explained to but the only thing we go left from him is his memoir. So every one has to choose with story you want to believe.
