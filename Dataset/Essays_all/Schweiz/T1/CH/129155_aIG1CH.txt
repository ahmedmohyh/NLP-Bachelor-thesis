The memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt is an extremely valuable historical sourse about european society in the 17-hundrets, althoug people argue about the validity of his memoirs. Some say, he was as famous and influential as he made himself seem to be in his work, other say that he invented or changed most of the events he wrote down in order to increase his status. Critics claim, the Chevalier had borrowed money in switzerland to spend it on parties and gambling. The Chevalier's defenders argue, that he just didn't have any money on him at time because he owned real estates, which he had to sell before he could use the actual money. Another conflict of opinion is his escape from a prison in Venice. In his memoir, the Chevalier wrote, he had to make a hole in the ceiling to escape. That story led to investigations about that ceiling. And a document was found in which the reparation of the ceiling was mentioned. The supporters of the Chevalier-memioirs see that document as a proof for Chevaliers truth-telling, but Critics find, that he could've easily bribed a jailer.
