In the text it is written that the Chevalier was wealthy and in fact he was but in the speech the people questioned its truth. The Chevalier explained that he had a great amount of money and if he had spent all he had with him on gambling and parties he had to borrow money until the next package of his money arrives. But in the text it is written that it doesn't make sense that he had to borrow money if he was that rich. The truth is that he borrowed the money just for not being out of money. He paid it all back. Further on in the text we read that it is correct to say that he escaped out of jail due to a bribery. It is wrong that he damaged the roof and making a hole in it. It is more likely that he could do a bribery beacause he had good friends which had contacts to the higher polititians. But in fact he wasn't the only one in jail who had contacts. There were even people which had better contacts so they more likely to bribe one of the jailers. They didn't so it was more difficult for the Chevalier to bribe someone. The more possible answer is the one which is in the text. He must have damaged the roof and escaped in that way.
