The speaker tries to show, that even though some people think memoirs can't be fully correct, the one written by Chevalier de Seingalt, is quite accurate. She even goes so far to say that it's a reliable historic source. The text leaves no doubt about the usefulness of the source in understanding life in the eighteenth century. However it doubts the historical accuracy. One example given is that Chevalier lived a very oppulent life whilst in Switzerland. This is undisputed, together with the fact, that he spent huge amounts of money on parties and gambling. The text states that he had to loan money regularly and questions the accuracy of his finantial status. The speaker quite eloquently wipes this doubt away, by explaining that his wealth was in form of property and not cash. If he ever ran out of money, he had to sell property. This money took a while to arrive, so to compensate he had to loan money till it was ready for him to use.
Another example is that he describes his discussions with the author Voltaire very accurately. Critics say that this is impossible, as there was a long time gap between meeting Voltaire and writing his memoir. However the speaker states that he wrote down the conversations immediately afterwards in a diary. This he could use whilst writing the memoirs. The last, but definetly most exciting question is, if he really managed to escape a prison in Venice, by using a piece of metal. The text says that this was merely added to the memoirs for enjoyable reading. Critics also believe that well-connected friends of his bribed the jailers to free him. According to the speaker, recently one found a document stating that after Chevaliers escape one had to fix the ceiling. This would be a reason to believe his adventurous story.
