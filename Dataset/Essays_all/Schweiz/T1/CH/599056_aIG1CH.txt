The chevaliers life - two different versions

The first controversial point is that while he lived in Switzerland he gambled and make a lot of parties. He was a wealthy man but he had to sell his land to get money to pay with. This took a lot of time and that's why he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. In the text are doubts about this because when he had been such a rich man he wouldn't have had to borrow money from anywhere.

The second story is about his conversation with Voltaire. Critics say that it is impossible to remember the conversation with Voltaire as exactly many years after it when he write his memoires. In fact he had made very good notes of the conversation. So he could rewrite it very accurate even many years later.

The third point is that he was able to escape the prison in Venice, Italy. He escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The other version is that he bribed the jailers to free him. This is wrong because other prisoners had better contacts to the jailors and weren't able to escape the prison.
