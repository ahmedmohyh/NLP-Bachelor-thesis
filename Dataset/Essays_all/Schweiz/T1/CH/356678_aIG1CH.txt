Critics claim that the memoir of the Chevalier cannot be true. Their first point is that he was not rich in Switzerland because he borrowed some money. But in the video it is said that in fact, he had money but could not spend it. He had to wait for it to become real money. In spite of the time he had to wait, he just borrowed some money to use at parties.
The second point is that he is not able to remember conservations with Voltaire he had many years ago. But after every time they had talked to each other the Chevalier got into his room and took some notes. His memoir relied on them. 
The third point is that have not escaped from the prison in Venice because it is very unlikely to get into freedom through a hole in the ceiling. He had a lot of influent friends who could have set him free. As a consequenze many other prisoners with even more influent friends should have escaped as well, but they did not. In a police report one can read that the ceiling after his escape had to be repaired, too. Why would they have done this if he has not escaped this way.
As a consequenze, his memoir is a reliable source to use for history research.
