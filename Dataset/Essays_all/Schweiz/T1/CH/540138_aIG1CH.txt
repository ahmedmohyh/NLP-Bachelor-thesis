The Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life in the 18th century, which is today used as a historical source about the society in this time. But there are a lot of critics. Some people say, that the Chevalier invited some events to make his life more exciting. For example in the text they say, that he pretended to be very wealthy, but at the same time, he borrowed money from someone else. 
The Chevalier also said, that he escaped from a prison in venice, but it is nearly impossible to escape from there. Some other man, who were a lot stronger than he is, tried it before and failed. But something that speaks for the escape is, that they had to repair the ceiling of the cell he was in after he was in there. 

The critics also say, that it is not possible to remember exact phrases of conversations that happened some time back, but on the other hand, the Chevalier claimed, that he wrote down every converstion as soon as he got home. Noone is really sure, what he or she should think about the Chevalier, because there are some events that speak for, and some events which speak against the things, which are written in the memoir. 

Unfortunately I can't compare the text to the audio, because i couldn't barely hear anything, eventhough I tried to turn up the volume.
