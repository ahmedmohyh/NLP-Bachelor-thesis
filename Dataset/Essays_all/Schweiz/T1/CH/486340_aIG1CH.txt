In the spoken text, the main point is that Chevalier's memoir is true. But in the written text, it's said that he invented many parts of his story.
The woman said, that Chevalier was not poor, but he had to sell his posession to get the money. He didn't have much cash. But in the text is said, that he had to borrow huge sums of money form a Swiss merchant. 
An other argument is, that Chevalier explained in his story that he wrote down his conversations with Voltaire each evening and so, he could remember most things of them. In the text it's not mentionned that he worte it down right after the conversations and it's impossible to remember everything of these conversations so many years later. 
The last point is that in some good sources, it's written that not long after Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice, the roof of his room had to be made new, and so, it's obviousely that he escaped through the roof and not because of his connections.
