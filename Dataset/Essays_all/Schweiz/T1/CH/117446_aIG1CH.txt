In this presentation they went after those critics mentioned in this text. They said that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt was very accurate. Only because he was borrowing money doesnt mean he was poor he just had to borrow some money while he was waiting for his money to come. 
She also claimed that in the he was conversing with Voltaire but not as claimed in the text he wrote just in the night after but then he just kept those text to himself, and then after years he released them. 
The third point she claimed to be accurate was the escape of the prison. She based her argument on the knowledge that theother prisoners had much more connections and who knew much more infuential people than him didn't manage to escape. She also said that his ceiling had to be repaired wich is a clear evidence that this must have been the truth. 

The text and the presentation are clearly telling the opposite and we as objective readers can not decide wheter one or the other might tell the truth
