chevalier and his memoirs are full of adventures and also his life, but a lot of poeple question it if his life was as in his memoir a lot of critics argue that he must have been lying all the time and wasn`t accurate everytime.

The first point is the wealthy life that the chevalier had in switzerland. In the text the claim that had to borrow money from swiss merchant this is correct but that doesn`t mean he was poor. He had to sell things to get his money and in the time he was sell he borrows money until his money arrives from the selling of his belongings.
The second point is the conversation with Voltaire, he actuelly had a conversation with him but it was written down much later at that time when he spoke to Voltaire but when they were talking Voltaire took some notes right after it but he has written it down later.
The last point is about the doubt that chevalier break out of prison in his memoir it said that he breaks out of the prison by breaking the sceiling and escaping on the roof, critics claim that, they believe he must have bribed his way out of prison. And could be actually true but he was the only that could do it even other poeple had better connections than him. And after he left the prison they had to repair the sceiling so it really could be that Chevalier broke out of prison.

Even if accurate or not thank chevalier we can look a little bit in the Past.
