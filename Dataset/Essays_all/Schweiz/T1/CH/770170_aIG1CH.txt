Chevalier may be a very controversial person. But there are evidences which proof that there are things which are true even if some critics say it can't be true.
For exemple his wealth, there are historical evidences that Chevalier, while living in Switzerland, spent huge sums of money. And if he had no more money, he borrowed some money. That doesn't mean he was poor. He just wasn't mature enough to use it properly.
 Also there is no need to doubt the conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Critics say that the conversations, which are written in the memoir, have been written many years later. But that's not true. Every night he wrote down every conversation between him and Voltaire. There is also no need to question the escape from the prison. There may have been people with higher contacts,, but there was a hole in the ceiling which they had to rEPAIR.
