There are three different opinions about the life of the chevalier. He lived in the eighteenth century, so we can't say exactly which theorie is true or if there is a theary true. But now I'd like to present you shortly the three different theories.

In the first theorie they say, he was a poor chevalier, and that he spent a great deal of money for paries and gambling. They think to know, that he was poor, beacause, he waited for the money to arrive.
The second theorie says, that he wrote each night all the memoires of the day down, what means, that they must be true. 
The third theory is about he escaped really from the prison or if the story isn't true and just invented to make the story more enjoyable for reading.  The people who are thinking, that the story isn' true say, that there where many other men, which had more dangerous friends and that none of them ever broke out. The others are argumenting, that the seeling of his room had been repaired.

However, it's an good story, of which we cant't say if it's true ore not, but however its a good story.
