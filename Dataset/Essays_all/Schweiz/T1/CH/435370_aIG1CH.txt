In the presentation the speaker is on the side of "chevalier". There are three arguments and she let us know how all these things that were written in the memoir  could happen. The first argument was about the wealth of Chevalier in Switzerland. The woman explains that just because Chevalier borrowed money it doesn't have to mean that he was poor. Actually she said that is was normal to do so. He sold lots of things and he converted it to cash, that's how he made money. He just borrowed money while he was waiting to get his money. In the text it was written that because of the borrowing, people think he was poor.
Now to the second argument, in the text was mentioned that it was impossible for Chevalier to remember a conversation with Voltaire which it was held a few years ago. But the speaker objected that Chevalier had written important things down about the conversation he had with Voltaire right after it happend and he kept that paper until he wrote the memoir, so he could write down exact things about the conversation. 
Further to the last argument, Chevalier wrote about his escape from the Venetian prison and how he did this with a piece of metal. In the text it's said that it's unlikely to escape from a prison with a piece of metal. But in the presentation the speaker told us about how the Venetian government had some documentary which tell us about how a whole in the ceiling had to be repaired. And that's evidence enough for them that Chevalier escaped through the ceiling and there were no rich friends who helped him out.
