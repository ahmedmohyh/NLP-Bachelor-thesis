In the written part it says about the partying and gambling in Switzerland. The Chevalier wrote about his exiting life here and how rich he is. Now critic think, that all he wrote was untrue and he just invendet these adventures to make his life more exiting. In the hearing part it says nothing about him telling invented stories. An other difference is the end. In the written part it tells very quickly that he was in prison and that he wrote about escaping the prison by using a medal piece. But also here critics claim, that they think he invented that part because there was no fpund piece of medal. In the hearing part it tells us about the medalpiece and that the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape of Chevalier.
