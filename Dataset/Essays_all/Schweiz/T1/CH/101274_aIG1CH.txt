In both sources were doubts about the believing of Chevaliers memoir. Here are some examples.
While he was living in switzerland he spent a lot of money for example to partys. So he couldn't be poor when he was able to spent so much money. But the speaker in the listening said that he would be poor and needed to borrow money. When you're reading the text, there is written that he would be wealthy. But the doubts were because someone had surfaced that Chevalier had borrowed a lot of money but why he did that? A rich man doesn't have to borrow some money. 
Chevalier also wrote down every conversation he had. But it's also impossible that he remembered everything about it. The author from the text said that the conversations with Voltaire couldn't be possible because he had written them down some years later. So could he really remember every word of them?
In the listening was also the doubt that he could escaped from the prison and other prisoneers not. The others had some more powerful friends to get them out than Chevalier. Why was it possible for him to escape? But in the text is written that he escaped by using a piece of metal although he had some well-connected friends. It's more likely that his jailers or friends helped him to get out.
