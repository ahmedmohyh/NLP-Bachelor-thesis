Before you or the critics claim about some thing you need to know the hole story of it. You can not say something about other if you does not know all of it. Like this statement: "Don't judge a book by its cover."

Actually he was rich, but he spent first his money and after that he sold his merchant. That was the reason he borrowed some money, becaue it needed some day until the money arrives.

The conversation with the famous wirter Voltaire is also true. You ask why? He made notes about the conversation and hold them for many years with him, so there is no doubt about it.

You need more to research about the history in prison of Venice of Italy, because it needs some information to find the truth behind the story. After he escaped from prison the prison needed to fix his cell. So why would the fix it you ask? It is because Chevalier destroyed it to get out of it. And other people in prison had more powerful friends than Chevalier and even they could not bribe the officers, so it is true that he has escaped.
