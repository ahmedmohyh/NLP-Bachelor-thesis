The Chevalier wanted to write down the advenceres and the conversations he made with famous people like kings and writer. So he decided to write a memoir that became famous in the 18 century. ut most of the people claim that the Chevalier distorted or inventd so many events. there we can also read, that he was very rich,that he had a conversation with Voltaire and that he escaped out of the jail. 
There are some proves, that they are wrong. in one memoir it says that when the Chevalier lived in swiss he spent much money on partys. But they found out, that he borrowed money from other people what means, that he wasn't rich.Because the conversation was many years before the memoir was written, it was impossible that he can remember every single word from the conversation they had. 
In the memorial the Chevalier said, tha he escaped out of the jail by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. But it is more thinkfull, that some politically well-connectet friends from him from the Chevalier helped him to escape out of the prison in Venice.
