In this essay I will write about the different between the text about Chevalier de Seingalt, who livved from 1725 to 1798. At the end of his he wrote a long memoire recounting his life and adventures.
First let us talk about his poorness. They say he invented some parts of his life to make it more glamorous.In the text they say if he have been rich he wouldn't had to borrow money. In the audio they say he only hadn't get his money now. He just waited forit to get it and thats the reason why he had to borrow money.
Another part in the text is about his friend Voltaire.In the thext they say that he worte exact phrases from extended conversations held many years ago. In the audio we hear that he wrote every time when he met Voltaire the conversation down. So he was able to recount the conversation that good.
The critics say that he didn't escaped out of the prison. It is more that he had a number of politically well-conected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. The ones who likes him say that in this time it was normal to escape from prison especially in that prison.
