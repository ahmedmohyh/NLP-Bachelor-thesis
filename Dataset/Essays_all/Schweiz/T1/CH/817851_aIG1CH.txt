The woman lecturing said that Chevalier's memoirs were accurate and a reliable historical source whereas in the text above it says that some critics doubt the accuracy of his memoir. 
Responding to the three examples, the lecturer said concerning the first one that just because Chevalier had to borrow money from a merchant, it doesn't mean that he was poor. Often he just had to wait to get the money from his businesses but he was still wealthy after all. So when he asked for the loan of the merchant he just didn't have any cash available. 
Concerning the second example saying that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire couldn't have been so accurately described in the memoirs, the woman stated that Chevalier always used to write down the conversations, or at least what he could remember from them, after they had taken place and that he apparently kept these notes for many years. Friends confirmed seeing him with journals and notes often so the story could be true. 
Finally, to the last example, the lecturer claimed that other prisoners in Venice did also have many influencial friends, even more than Chevalier. However, they didn't manage to escape while he did. Another fact to justify his story saying that he broke through the ceiling and climbed onto the roof, is that the ceiling had to be repaired after he left the prison. And why would that be necessary if he didn't make a hole in the ceiling just as he said he did?
