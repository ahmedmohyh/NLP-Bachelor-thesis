Chevalier wrote a biography about his life and adventures. In the hearing the woman said that when Chevalier was in Switzerland, he did borrow money but only because he was waiting for his money to come. That is weird because he could have just stopped gambling while waiting for his money.
About the conversations with Voltaire, the critics say that Chevalier could not have remembered the conversations as clear and long as he did. But the woman said that there are proofs that he wrote most of the conversations down the night they held them.
When he escaped the prison in Venice through the ceiling critics say that this is just what readers want to hear and that his friends probably offered a bribe to free him. But the woman says that after Chevalier escaped, they had to repair the ceiling, why would they have to repair a ceiling that wasn't broken? And she said that other famous prisoners had many more wealthy friends.
