Chevalier de Seingalt a true adventurer or a simply stroryteller ?
.
Chevalier de Seingaltlived during the eighteenth century and wrote quite a long memoir recounting his own life and adventures. However there are quite a lot doubs about his way of telling his life. 

In the first text part we mostly have a negative view of him. It's certainly true that he lived quite an exciting life but the first text claims that he made his life more exciting than itreally was. 

The Audio takes the other side. It explains that it was cerntaily possible to have lived like chevalier wrote it down. Maybe to explain it better i'm pointing down some highlides of his life.

First Chavalier wrote that during his stay in Switzerland he lived  an luxury and in some way a partylife . Now the written Text says that he was not as rich as he told because of the fact that he bowwoed quite some money from a Swiss merchant. On the other hand the Audio tries to explain that the business of Chevalier was build in selling stuff. So it was not possible to get the money from one second to the next. So it's possible to take loans and still be enormously rich.

Another example was the escape from the notorious prison in Venice. Again claims the text that such a daring  escape would not have been possible and the story was just made up for show. It was more likely that he bribed to get free. like always has the Audio an explanation prepared. They think that it was possible that it happened like this because there were some othe much more rich and influencable people who couldn't bribe the prison and just after Chevalier escaped they needed to repair his prison cell.

Today nooone knows what really happened druing Chevaliers life. If ithappened one to one or if it's more a fairy tale. But it's certainly true that his life was mesmericing in boths ways because still today we are asking us about it.
