In the Text, I've read, I've seen a lot of doubts about the Chevalier and his long memoir written down. in the presentation, I've listened to, they try to say, that everything he had written down is true, and they show us why. In the text one doubt is, for example,the memoir of the conversations. They don't belive that he could have memoired all of these conversations, and that he has invented some of these. In the presentation then,they explain us why it is possible, that all these conversations were true. they told us, that he had alwayswritten notes and a journal, in which he had also written down, some conversations. Another doubt, in the text, is the escape from the prison in Venice. The text says, that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. In the presentation they give us again an axplanation, that the escape, probably was true. Te explanation is, that others in the prison had had more "friends" like him, and they hadn't escaped. also in a document, stands, that they had to fix the ceilin from the prison-cell the Chevalier had lived, after he had escaped, why should they had fixed his ceiling, when he hadn't escaped, and had broken it?

although you can say, every doubt, the critics have, in the text, is explained by the conversation
