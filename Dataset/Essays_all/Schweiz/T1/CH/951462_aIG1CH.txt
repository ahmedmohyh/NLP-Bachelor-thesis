One argument in the Speech is, that Chevalier is poor, but in the text, the say, that he is very rich, because he spent a great deal of money and he met famous people, for a poor person, this is not possible. Once, Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice, this is in the speech and the text, but the way of how is different. The speech says that Chevalier lived in Switzerland and earn many money. He write, how he did this in his memorials, but criticers says, he can not remember about the correct phrases, that he says, so they think, it is not right. The text says either, that Chevalier is a very controversial person, and nobody knows, what is true and what is a lie. In the speech this is not very important. For the person who speak, he's a figure with a special life, but not that it is a fake life. He notes the memoriel himself, so you can not know, if it's true, or if he would beeing in a better view and to make it more intressting.
