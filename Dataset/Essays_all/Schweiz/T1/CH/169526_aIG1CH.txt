In the presentation give reasons ,about the three main examples that were brought up by the text to hardly be representing the truth and therefore not being a relayable historic source, that those could have very possibly been accurate and veritable.

The first example the text provides is that he couldn't have been rich if he had to borrow money from a merchant to pay for the parties n stuff he did in switzerland. The argument given in the presentation to contradict said assumption is, that as a merchant you buy and sell things for it could have been the case that his money just hadn't arrived for several days and that's the reason why he had to borrow money.

Second argument being that the Chevalier wouldn't have been able to reconstruct the conversations he had with Voltaire as accuratley as he had in his memoirs. The speaker in the presentation on the other hand suggests that this could have been possible becouse the Chevalier was known to have taken detailed notes of his conversations and stored those so he has probably taken those notes as reminders in his memoirs. And that's how he was able to accuratly report the conversations.

The last point in the text is that the Chevalier didn't really escape the prison by digging a hole into the roof but rater by bribing his jailers also using a number of politically influenceful friends he had in Venice. But the presentation brings up that there were at the time prisoners in Venice with way more powerful friends than the Chevalier and that the "seiling" of his chamber had to be renewed after he had left the chamber.
