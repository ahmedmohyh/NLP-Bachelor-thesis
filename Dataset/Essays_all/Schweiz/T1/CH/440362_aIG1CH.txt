Chevalier was a figure. At first I would say, in the hearing the speaker said, Chevial wasn't poor. I think he had wealth, but the thing is: he often runs out of cash. 
The second thing I would say about the hearing is the following: Chevalier was a man, who spoke much and so he had different conversations with different people. He met many famous people, including kings and writers. When he met these people, he talked a long time with them. Chevalier had to know everything about this famous people. After those conversations with this people, Chevial wrote down everything he can remember about the conversation. And at this moment the memoirs are alife. 
At third the speaker said, Chevalier was a figure, who hadn't powerful friend. I think he was often alone after he wrote the memoirs.
