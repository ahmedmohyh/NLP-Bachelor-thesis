Some critics doubts that everything in the memoire is accurate. And in the presentation they just have an opposite opinion.
For example: Chevalier claims that he lived very wealthy in Switzerland, but if he was really that rich, he wouldn't even have borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But the presentation says that Chevalier has sold many things and for the money to arrive back, he had to wait and borrow some money. That doesn't mean he was poor, he just had a business.
The critics say that it's impossible to remember every word from the conversation and write it in the memoire, because the conversations was held many years earlier. The presentation says that Chevalier remembered every word from the conversation and had written it down as soon as the conversation ended. And that he has kept the papers to put it in his memoire.
The critics questioned also the event in the memoire when Chevalier escaped from a prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
