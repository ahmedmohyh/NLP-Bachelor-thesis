Many critics don't believe Chevalier de Seingalt. But why would he lie? Well, it is not proved that he really is a liar and in fact there are more sources that are telling us he says the truth then giving us doubt about the accuracy. Chevalier told us that he has had a lot of money while living in Switzerland but critics don't believe him because sources are telling us that he had to borrow money. But that doesn't mean he was poor. Someone who borrows money isn't poor aslong he can pay back all the money he borrowed. 
Critics also don't think it isn't possible to escape from the prison in Venice. But we know that the prison had to change the ceiling in his cell. Why would the prison have to change it if wasn't broken? That tells us Chevalier has to tell us the truth about his escape.
There is one more point. The converses between Chevalier and the famous author and philosophe Voltaire. Chevalier has said that he wrote down everything he could remember from the conversations between him and Voltaire right after the evening. It has to be quite accurate if there were only a few hours between the conversations and the writing down. 
Its good that people are questioning things and happenings and don't believe every thing the read. Because sometimes it really is just false and it would be a pitty  if people now would think it's true. It's important that our image of the, for exemple, eighteenth century stays accurate and true, and we don't learn or teach wrong things. Imagine someone telling things like "people in 20th century lived in villas" or "everyone in 20th century wanted to destroy the earth" it would just be a lie:
