In this text is says that Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his live and adventurs at the end of his live but  the referee in the text we listened to said that he wrote down everything he could remember of the conversaitions during the day he wrote down at night. So it is sais something diffrent. 

Also in this text it says that critics thus argue that if Chevalier had really been very rich he would not have needed to borrow money. But out of the Text we listened to we know that he sometimes had to borrow money because he had to wait for his money to arrive. So it is clear that he had a lot money and that it is wrong that he was poor . If he were poor , he could not spend so much money for parties.

In the text and also in the text we listened to it says that he escaped from the prison. But there are mentioned two diffrent reasons. The referee said that something was wrong with the seiling in his room and that it has to be repaired maybe thats a way he could flee. In the text witch is written down it says that he had good contacts and they helped him to flee but that can't be the reasion that he escaped because it says that the other people in jeal also had good contacts but no one of them could ever flee like he did.
