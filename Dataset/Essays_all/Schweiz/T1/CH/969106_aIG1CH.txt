The Chevalier

In the text and in the presentation they both said that when he lived in switzerlandhe spent a lot of money for big paties and gambling. But in the presentation they said thathe needed to lend money from someone because he had to wait for the money he won or things like that and in the text there are just written that he had to lend money from someone. Another point is that in the text it is written that it could be wrog that he met Voltaire but in the presentation it is said that he met him every night and avter each conversation the Chevalier wrot down things that he remembered and it was saidthat whoman who lived with the Chevaier knew about the documents who he wrote. Another point is that here it is said he have escaped from prison by using a piece of metal and in the presentation they say he broke out with the help of some of his political friends but they said too that after his broke out they had to rebuit his whole call and thats a sign that the story with the piece of metal could be true.
