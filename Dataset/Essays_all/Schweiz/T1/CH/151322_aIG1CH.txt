The three subjects of the text are also mentioned in the listening part. First, the woman talks about the finances of chevalier. When he was in switzerland, chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. He had the money, because he had a lot of landparts to sell, but until he got the money from these sellings, he borrowed themoney from someone else, so it looks like he was por and had to borrow the money all the time.
The second thing explained in the listening is, that Chevalier wasn't necessarily a man who could memories some things extremely well. After every meeting with Voltaire, Chevalier wrote the main things down. Many years after, he only needed to read these notes and knew, what thy were talking about. This way, it seems like Chevalier could memories a lot of things.
The third thing mentioned is the escape of the prison. Chevalier sais, that he escaped with a piece of metal trough the ceiling. Some important men from Venice said, that the ceiling in chevaliers room ad to be repared, so the story could possibly be true.

The text says, that Chevalier really was poor, because Critics are shure about that if Chevalier really had the money to gamble, he didn't have to borrow any money from others. In the listening part, you can hear an argument, why Chevalier was rich but should borrow money anyway.

Another thing that is different, is that in the text, you get the impression, that it is impossible for Chevalier to memories so many things of the conversations with Voltaire. In the listening, you hear the explanation: Chevalier is not extremly good at memorising, but he is only beeingclever.
