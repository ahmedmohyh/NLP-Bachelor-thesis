In the text is written that if Chevalier had been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. But they foreget a very important aspect. He had wealth, but he has to sell things first and wait than for his money to arrive. In this waiting time he wasn't poor, but he had no fluent money. Logically in this time he had to borrow it. Also the author from this texts doubts about the accuracy of the memoir because he couldn't have captured the conversations with Voltaire accurately. But there is a logical reason why he knew everything also many years later. He remembered the conversations because he made notes in the evening after he met and spoke to Voltaire. And when he wrote his memoir he looked at this notes again and copied them.
Also it's not true that friends in Venice offered a bribe and he never escaped the prison. Because in this prison there were people who had even more powerful friends  and they couldn't get out. Also a document exists which says that the ceiling from Chevalier's cell had to be repaired. Why would it has to be repaired if Chevalier didn't make a hole with a piece of metal?
