Chevalier de Seingalt had a memoir, in which he spoke of his fanastic life and his adventures. 
There are three points that are mentioned in the text, as well as in the lecture. And they do have their diffrences. The first point tells of his roaring years in Switzerland, the text points out that Chevalier was poor and had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But the lecture tells us that even if other people had to lend him money he was not poor, he threw alot of parties and made money through gambling. But until the money arrived from the transvers he had to borrow money. That does not mean he was poor. The second point tells us about the conversations between him and Voltaire, and these conversations took place but before he was writing his memoire. After every evening he would write down the conversations into journals and would recall them later on in life when he was writing his memoire. His friends and people who were around him could confirm that he did use alot of old notes when writing the memoire. The last fact in the text talks about his notorious prison escape in Venice. Sure Chevalier had a lot of politically well-connected friends, but some of the prisoners that better and more influencing and powerful friends. Old docuemts tell the story that the prison had to repair the roof of the cell Chevalier was staying in. And this story does  add up to the one in the memoir and not to the one told in the text, that the jailers were bribed.
