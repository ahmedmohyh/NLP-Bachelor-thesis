The Chevalier wrote his memoir and not everything was true. The Chevalier spent much money for parties. He wasn't become a controversial figure because he met many famous people, including kings and writers. . The Chavaliers memoir has become a valuable historical source about the society. He made parties because he liked it and not because he wanted to make his life seem more exciting and glamurous than it really was.
They never talkes about that the Chevalier borrowed money.
The Chevalier didn't record the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire, he wrote down his memoirs each night.
The Chevalier escaped from a prison. But it isn't clear if he escaped from e prison in Venice.
But I want to say that I can't remember anything what this nice Woman said in the speak before.
