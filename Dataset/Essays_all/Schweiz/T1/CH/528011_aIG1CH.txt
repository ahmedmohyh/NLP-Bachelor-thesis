The listened text was parted in three different parts. I missed the start so I did not understand the first one because my headphones did not work. 
In the second part we had to listen to it is said that the Chavalier had contact with Voltaire.It is undoubtly true that he had but in the listened text it is said that he went to Voltaire every day, which seems to be not true. 
The third part is about an escape from an Italian prison using only a piece of metal.The text says that it is not true an it is more likely that one of his politically well-connected friends had offered a bribe. but even though, there was found a damaged cell in the prison in Venice. It is likely that the Chevalier damaged it. Why else should a cell in a prison be damaged? In this point the read and the listened text do not say the same.
