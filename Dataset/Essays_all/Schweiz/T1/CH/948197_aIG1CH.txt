In this essay I will be wiriting about the argumentation from an audio I've heard about and the text the Chevalie. Both sources contain the information that Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures. It's questionable if this source is reliable or controversial. During his stay in Switzerland he claims to be rich. However it'sknow that he borrowe money. The question comes up, why did he borrow money if he was as rich as he describes in his memoir. The audio's explaination is simple. He borrowed money because he rain out of cash but not money. Second aspect that was mentioned: Both resources are sure that Chevalier conversed with the famous writer. However the text is skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that were written down by Chevalier, because of the timespan that is inbetween the conversation and when he actually wrote the conversations down. The audio knows that this is a reliable source, because there is evidence which confirm the notes that he was writing from time to time. The last aspect that was discussed is the outbreak of the prison.The text says that this was only possible due to his good connections in the prison. The audio tell that there was someone elso who had better connections and wasn't able to breakout. The audio didn't give closer information about how it was possible for him to get out of the prison but they talk have evidence that the sealing in the room he was staying in had to be replaced.
