The Chevalier de Seingalt was not as rich as the text says. In reality he was very poor. He did not borrow any money from a Swiss merchant. He had to sell his owns to get to money. When he was in the prison in Venice, he did not escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. He just had some powerfull friends who helped him out. He also did not invent many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamerous than it really was. He even did not have the money for that.The critics are right when they are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himselfand the famous writer Voltaire. He even did not meet him.
