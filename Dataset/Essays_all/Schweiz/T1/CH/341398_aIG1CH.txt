The first argument which wasn't correct in the presentation was his accuracy of memoir. It was told that he wrote notes every time he met famous people. In the text there is another statement: Crtitics are skeptical because they claimed that he distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exiting. 
Another Argument is that in the presentation has been an argument that he borrowed money in Switzerland for some other reason, not because he was poor. And in the Text critics said he borrowed money all the time which is an argument that he was. 
In the presentation it was also said that he escaped in prison with a piece of metal. It was mentioned that the seeling had to be repaired so he took the chance to escape because it wasn't secure enough. There is another explanation in the text: The Chevalier wasn't able to destroy the seeling. It was rather that jailers were bribed to free him.
