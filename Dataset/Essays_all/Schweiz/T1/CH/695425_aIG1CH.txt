Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his experiences in his life. He has known many famous people. Today it is shows how the 18. century worked. But some people don't trust the memoir. They think it isn't possible that he has known so many people and that he has seen so many adventures. So maybe he just wrote some things to make his memoir more interresting.
For example a conversation with Voltaire. He has written this conversation many years later. So it isn't normal to recognise the hole consersation. An other story is how he has escaped from a jail in venice.
