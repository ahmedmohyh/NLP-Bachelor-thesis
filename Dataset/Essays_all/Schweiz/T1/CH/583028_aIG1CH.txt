The chevalier de Seingalt had a very interesting life, so he wrote a long memoir recounting his adventures. Some doubt were raised about the accuracy of the memoir, but can these critics be believed?

One of the critics was that he, himslef claimed as being very weatlhy, had borrowed huge sums of money. But this wasn't a real reason of him liyng because most of his assets weren't fluent, so he had first to make debts until he got his money fluent. 

Later on, he wrote a lot about all his conversation with Voltaire. It is proven that Voltaire and the Chevalier met and talked, but the accuracy of the records in the memoir is doubted. However, the Chevalier says that each night, after the conversation with Voltaire, he wrote everything down about what they talked. There are also witnesses whch comfirm of seeing him using notes for his memoir.

But the most doubted incident is his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. He claims to have escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics find this escape too daring and too excinting, more likely he had to be bribed free by one of his wealthy and important friends. But old documents from the prison in Venice state that the ceiling in a cell had been repaired, not long after his escape.

So over all, these critics aren't true, and they have no real reason to doubt him.
