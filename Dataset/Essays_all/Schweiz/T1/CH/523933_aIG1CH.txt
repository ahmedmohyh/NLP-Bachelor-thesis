This text looks very critical at the memoir of Chevalier, showing the points in his memoire that are possible not true, par exemple that Chevalier was a rich person, but needed to borrow money. In the speech the speaker tries to argue why the points that are criticised still are probably true. She says that someone first has to borrow money tto invest, before he can have profit and become rich. About the critics that Chevalier couldn't wrote the conversations with Voltaire many years later exactly down in they were spoken, she argues that he probably made notes directly after the conversation and kept them until that point were he was writing down his memoir. Critics also say that his dramatic escape fromt the prison was probably a lie and he just used his influence and mighty friends to became free. The speaker says that in the log of the prison it's noted that they had need to repair his ceiling after the escape, so probably he really broke it. Of course it is possible that his "mighty friends" had manipulate this log. On the other hand, nobody else (other people had mighty friends to) could escape out of the prison.
This text and the speech is showing that it is not allways easy to know exactly what happened in history, so we must be careful with all that we read.
