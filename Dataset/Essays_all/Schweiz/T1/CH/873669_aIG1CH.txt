The presentation and the text speak about the truth of the menoires of Chevalier. In the presentation they say that no memoire can be totally correct and  so is the one of the Chevalier for his criticers who wrote the text. For example in Switzerland he have to borrow money because of the parties he've given. In the text they say that he was so rich he don't have to borrow money. Also the conversations with Voltaire have to been seen critical. The text refuses that he have ever met Voltaire but the presentation has an other opinion. They think he have met him. Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice is quite intresting too because critical think he escaped with the help of the jailers who were bribed to free him. On the other side of the argumentation the presenter says that he haven't had so much money to buy him free nor does he have friends which are influential enough to offer a bribe but there are documents of the prison for renovating the celing from the place where Chevalier have stayed. They think he escaped the way he have written in his memoires. All in all the are different point of views and the text and the presentation are representing two different siedes.
