Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived between 1725 and 1798, is a person about who the opinions are pretty diffrent. Or more specificly about his memoir.
In the presentation its said that eventhough the memoir is really detailed it is accurate and not invented just to make his life look more exciting. 
They explain the fact that Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money in Switzerland that although he was rich it took some time to sell things to get money. So he needed this borrowed money as "starter". 
In the presentation they also say that when Chevalier met Voltaire he wrote every night their conversations down immediately. People who knew him confirmed, that he often wrotes conversations down. But critics claim that it would be too detailed.
Also for the story about the escape out of a prison in Venice the presentation has proves. While critics think he didn't escape through a selfmade hole in the ceiling but a friend of him bribed a jailor to free him, the woman in the presentation says that there were prisioners with much more powerful friends than he had, but none of them got free. They also claim that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after Chevalier left the prison.
