The woman explained the critics in the text. Chevalier wrote a memoir recounting which is an important historical source today.But critics say that he invented things. The first point of the doubts was that he invented to be rich in Switzerland and would have gambled a lot. But in reality he borrowed money. The woman explained that borrowing money doesnt mean you are poor. The other doubt was his conversation with Voltaire. The text critizes he couldn`t wrote the conversation down after such a long time. But the woman said friends of him told that he has always made notes after the conversations. So it could be possible that the historical source is correct. The last doubt in the text was the escaping from a prison in Venice. The text says that he used a metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climed through the roof. But critics claim it was more likely that his jailers were bribed to free him. The woman said that other prisoners had more powerful friends and couldn`t get out of jail because of that. An other point is that there are old documents from the prison in whichs is written after Chevalier`s break out they needed to repair the ceiling. The text in genral points out critics at Chevalier`s memoir recounting and let the people doubt if it is relly true what Chevalier has written. The speech of the woman tries to improve this critics. She gives for every doubt a logical explanation.
