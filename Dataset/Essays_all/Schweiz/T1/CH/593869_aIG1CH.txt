The text about Chevalier is very critical. There are some sentences that question that the things written in his memoir are true. But in the listening part, everything gets explained and seems to be true. The listening part is kind of an answer to the text and it wants to convince everyone that Chevaliers memoir is totally true. The text for example says, that Chevalier couldn't be rich, because he borrowed considerable sums of money. In the listening part, there is a good explanation for that: Chevalier got lots of money at the payday, but he immediately invested his money so that he didn't have any money left for living. He had to borrow some money and wait until he got his money back and then he invested it again. An other critical aspect that got explained are Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire. Chevalier wrote these conversations down many years after they have met. The explanation is that Chevalier took notes of his conversation and waited a few years to write them down. He could take all the important parts out of his notes, and everything beside them aren't necessary to be exactly the same as they were said when they met.
