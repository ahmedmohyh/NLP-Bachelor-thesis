The arguments of the spoken text do not accept those from the written text. The speaker gives facts for the accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir which answer the things the text tries to complain about it. The first argument is about the money Chevalier has borrowed. They respond to the texts argument that he had to borrow money first in order to spend it properly. In the text it is said that the fact he borrowed money means he didn't have any money left after spending it on parties and gambling and that would mean he was poor. Then the speaker says that every night after Chevalier had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire he wrote down everything he could remember. Some years later he summarised his notations and wrote it down into his momoir. Even though it is impossible for a memoir to always be correct these notations should be quite accurate. The text though claims that it wouldn't bepossible for Chevalier to remember every single phrase they had spoken together several years ago. The text doesn't mention these summaries he made every night according to the speaker. Finally we're coming to the third and last argument.The written text tells us about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. It says that he had politically well-connected friends in Venice. The speaker thoughsays that other prisoners had way better connection to get a bribe. Old venician documents claim that the ceiling had to be repaired.
