The memoir, which was written by Chevalier, is a valuable historical source about the european society during the eighteenth century. 
Critics think that some events are invited so that his life seems more exciting. 
Chevalier lived in Switzerland for a while. He said that he was very wealthy and that he spend a lot of money. But critics say that he had to borrow money so he couldn`t be that wealthy. But as we heard, Chevalier was waiting for his money. While waiting, he had to borrow some money.
In his memoir, Chevalier wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. Critics say that it isn`t possible to remember the whole conversation. But witnesses who lived with Chevalier confirm that he always wrote some parts of the conversations down.
Chevalier wrote about his escape from a prison in Venice. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and escape through the roof. Critics say that his jailers were bribed to free him because Chevalier had some politically well-connected friends who could have helped him. But after he escaped, Chevalier's cell had to be repaired, so it could be that he actually escaped trough the roof.
