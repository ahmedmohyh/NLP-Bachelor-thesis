Critics are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir. But there is evidence that each night he wrote everything about his conversations down. But it could still be inaccurate because he could also have written false things down on these nights. But on the other hand it is also possible that all this informations are true. 
Critics have questioned the memoir's accout of the Chevalier`s escape from a notorious prison in Venice. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and clibming through the roof. It is proof that other prisoners had quiet good connections with politically people but they could not escape the prison. But it should be the thruth because there is evidence that after he escaped the ceiling had to be repaired because there was a hole in it. If he would have had politically well-connected friends in Venice and they would have bribed the jailers to free him, the roof would not have been damaged. 
In Switzerland he was wealthy because there was a part he had to sell. He had to borrow money because on this point he did not have enough money to buy everything. But after he could sell it he could have been rich and then he could give the money back he borrowed.
