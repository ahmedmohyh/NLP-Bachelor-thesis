Chevalier
One argument of the women from the presentaion was about his time in the prison in Venice, Italy. In the text we see that critics have already questioned his escape from his cell there. Also the woman of the presentation talked about an escape. She said, that the prison in Venice had to repair his room when he was away. So it seems possible that "he claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing though the roof." (Chevalier, line 12-13) Another point is the thing with his money. Was he really rich? In the text they say, that he can not be rich if really had to borrow money. But in the presentation the woman talked about that "to borrow money" must not be a sign of poorness. He also can borrow money although he is a rich man.
