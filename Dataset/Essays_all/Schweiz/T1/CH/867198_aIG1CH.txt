Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725- 1798 
The chevalier wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. But there are many that be criticised. 
1. Lone for the menagued:
The Chevialiers had a lot of money but  you can only have a lot of money if you sell much. Thats what the Chevialliers did. And if they didn't had something to sell they borrowed something and selled it. 
2. Each night the Chevialiers wrote down what their experience where. So you could see many years that they would have regular notes. Critics think that Chevalier and the Voltaire never had a conversation, because you can't write a conversation precice many years after a conversation.
3. About the prison break from Chevalier. Many of the critics question that, because it isn't really possible to dig a hule by using a single piece of metal. If you want you can try that but I think it doesn't really help you. Some think that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him.

It seems the storry of Chevalier de Seingalt has many things that is sceptic with the true. Honestly it is also a long time that he has live on the this planet. I think that's why many things aren't really logical for us or the critics to understand. But I think that this done really terrible things, because if he didn't existed he wouldn't be so famous.
