Chevalier (1725-1789) must have had a very nice and enjoyable life if you read his memoir about his life. Apparentyl he had a great time in Switzerland, a good conversation with Voltaire and a adventure in the prison in Venice. All this experiences he wrote down. His memoire become a valuable historical source about the European society because of his conversations and meetings with famous people. But because of his very special life, there are mny critics.

This critics are just shortly named in the Reading and sometimes explained. But in the Listening they were discussing about th critics and were looking for some doubtful reasons and explanations. For example the conversation with Voltaire. In the text they were discussing about if Chevalier and Voltaire have ever met. Because they said that it's impossible to remember exact phrases. But anothre pint was the prison story. About this one the text and the hearing explained that he didn't escaped by help from a piece of metal but therefo with more powerful friends. Also the hearing talked abou the cealing of his prison must have been repared.
All in all there are many stories and it must be very difficult t find the truth.
