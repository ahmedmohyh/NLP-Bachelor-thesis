The Chevalier de Seinegalt wrote a long memoir recuting his life and adventures. You can't be sure if everything is correct. But the most statements aren't so exact, so he wrote more at the whole thing than all the details.
That he had much money in Switzerland that's wright and also that he was wealthy. But the thing with the Swiss merchant is very difficult to understand. It isn't the right explenation "The Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money", because he had to. He has to wait for his money. 
Each night if he talked to someone he might wrote it down, so he may not  wrote the whole thing out of his mind. He kept all the things he wrote about the conversations for many many years. 
It's possibly right that he escaped from the prison. The Chevalier had many freinds. And it's also proved that the covernment had to repared the ceiling of the Chevaliers prison room.
Finally, the most things about the story, so how the Chevalier live, are the truth. But might not all of the details are exact, so now and then he imagines something that is more exciting or more like an adventres, that it was.
