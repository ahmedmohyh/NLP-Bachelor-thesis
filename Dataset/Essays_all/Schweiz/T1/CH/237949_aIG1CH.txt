Both sources said that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt has become an important historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. Both agree that he had good contacts with famous people, for instance with the writer Voltaire. But it seems that he invented may things, so his life seem more exciting than it really was. In the listening and in the reading souce they doubt the  truth of his memoir. His memoir in which he wrote that he was very wealthy contradict with the fact that he had had to borrow money. Moreover he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. Both sources believe that he knew him well but Chevalier wrote this coversations down many years later after he had had them and they sources don't believe that he was able to remember the exact words. The written source questioned that he escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal as it is written in his memoir. The sorce said that it would be more likely that his politically well-connected friends bribed the jailers to let him free. In the listening they didn't doubt his memoir. They said that it wasn't possible to brib him free because other men in the prison wasn't able to get themselves free
