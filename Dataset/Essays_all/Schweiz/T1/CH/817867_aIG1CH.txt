Chevalier' s memoir

The arclie about Chevalier's memoir in which the autheur recounted his adventurous life is a valubale historical source about society in the 18th, because Chevalier met many famous and important people.But did he always being writtng the truth?

Some historains claim that he invented and distorted things.The article says that he claimed while he was living in Switzerland that he was very wealthy. but in fact it is known that he spend al lot of money on parties and gambling. Also this is not true. That even says the record too, but they either mean that a time whil he was living in Switzland he had really no money, because his bank did not send him it. 
The two sources are also agree that the critis about the conversation records with the famous french writer Voltaire are not as exactely as thex should be. Atlthough Chevalier had written down every conversation with him just after the end, as he said, there are some evidences which profound that he must had written them down some years later, because some histroical dates were not true.

Eventually they agreed togethe that they can not use this historial soucre anymore, because it is not excately enough.
