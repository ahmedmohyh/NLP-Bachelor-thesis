In the presentation the woman spoke about the good memoir of the Chevaliers. Every person can remember some things but it isn't possible to remember every event like it's written in the text. So it isn't possible that they wrote every single event on a paper. Another critic is that even though they have to borrow money it doesn't says that the Chevalier aren't rich. There are rich people who need to borrow moeny too.The woman critizcies that they were other insults which were stronger than the Chevaliers. So it is nearly impossible to escape from the prison and to build a whole in the wall with a piece of metal.. Anyway if they really broke out, the prison had to be repair the whole in the wall and there are no proves founded for this reperation. So there she agrees to the text.
