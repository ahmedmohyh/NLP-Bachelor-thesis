The reading refered mostly all of the arguments against the text of the chevalier, his memoires: 
Firstly the thing about his life in switzerland: In the text it says that he is "poor" because he needed to borrow money from others, because he made huge parties and to too much gambling. But in the reading she said that he just borrowed the money to wait for more money and this is not poor.$
Secondly the thing with the talk to the famous writer Voltaire: The text said that not everything of this is true because he has written his memoir long after this talk. But the reading said, he made notes about this and kept them for years and afterwards used them, while writing his memoires.
The third thing was about a prison escape in Venice: The text said that he has written, he escaped with a small piece of metal trough the ceiling and climed up on the roof. But the text thinks, he had enough powerful and politically well-connected friends on the outside to bribed the jailers to free him. In the reading, the woman said, that in some text of the city was written, that after the Chevaliers escape, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. So it is clear that he had to escape on the way he discribed.
And other prisoner at the same time had more powerful friends then the Chevalier, but they have rotten in prision. This is an other point for the reading of the woman.
