In the presentation the women wanted to see wheater the arguments that doubt the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir are correct or not. In the text there are three important arguments that doubt the accuracy. Chevalier had an addventurous life and whe wrote it down in his memoir. In there was written that while living in Switzerland he was wealthy and had a good amount of money. While the text consideres the fact that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant is an evidence for the falseness of his text, the women states that in Switzerland he spent a great amount of money for gambling so when he ran out of money, he simply had to borrow even more money. She says that the fact that he borrowed money can not be taken as a proof that he wasn't lying and with that doubt the acccuracy of his memoir. The second argument mentioned in the text is about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. The text states that Chevalier couldn't possibly remember these conversations in detail as he wrote them down in his memoirs when the memoir was published years afterwards. In the presentation the woman contradicts the text, she points out that Chevalier himself said that every night after the conversations with Voltaire he wrote down as much as he remembered to keep it for later. He also had lots of diaries and notes that helped him write his memoir. Last but not least there's the argument that doubts his escape from a prison in Venice. Chevalier himself claims that he was able to escape with a piece of metal that he used to make a whole in the ceiling. The main point from the text why this coulnd't be true is that he had many well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bride. On the other side the woman states that in the prison were a lot of people with even more powerfull friends, so why weren't they able to escape and why had the prison to repair the ceiling in Chevaliers cell after his break out when he was actually released?
