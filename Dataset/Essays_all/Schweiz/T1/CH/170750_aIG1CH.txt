When we today read memoirs we also have to keep in our mind that not everything in a memoir is correct. Chevalier de Seingalt wrote his memoirs based on his life and the adventures ge went through. The first text gives us three specific examples from his memoirs. The first one was that he was a wealthy merchant in Switzerland, the second that he had a conversation with Voltaire and the third that he escaped from a prison in Venice. All three were denied because they just seemd impossible but the listening gives us some answers.

We know that Cheavlier was a merchant who spent much money on parties. Therefore he had somehow to get his hands on money. In the text above they said that he had borrowed money but just because one has to borrow money it does not mean he is poor or rich. He also got his money from working as a merchant with selling and buying things.

A reliable source for the second were his own memoirs. A valuable ressource were his own memoires. And that is the point. He wrote them down as soon as possible. Even though they disappeared for a while he still got them back years later and wrote his memoirs according to what he had written.

The last one we discussed in the text was the escape from the prison in Venice. According to the text source he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and escaped through it to gain his freedom but this explanation seemed wrong in the first place since Chevalier had some friends with money and the power to free him. On the other hand other prisoners had even wealthier friends with much more power than Chevalier's friends but they did not get their freedom back. One last evidence was also that they had to repair the ceiling after his ecape.
