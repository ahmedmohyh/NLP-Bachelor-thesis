The momoir of Chevalier de Seingalt has got a lot of criticers. His memoir is written in 3 episods. The first of them tells us that he had lived in Switzerland and that he was very wealthy but on the other hand he had to borrow a lot of money at a Swiss merchant. Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gamblin and so it comes that he often hadn't got money anymore. Critics said that if he had been that rich, he hadn't needed to borrow money. But thereis also en argument against this statement. You have to be rich enough to borrow some money, otherwise the Swiss merchant wouldn't allow you to borrow money that often, this leads us to the point that he can not been that poor so as critics says. 
An other point that is often discussed, is his meeting with him and the famous writer Voltaire. No one saw them togheter so no one doubts that the two really met. But it could also be that the famous writer Voltaire just didn't want to get seen with Chevalier, and so they met at secret places, where no one could see them thoghter. He also written the conversation down so he can remember the exact phrases years later.
The last point is about his escape from the prison. Chavalier claimed that he escaped only by using a piece of metal, but it is more likley that he escaped with help of his powerful friend. On the other hand there were a lot of other people with even more powerful friends in prison but they couldn't escape. So as we see there are isn't just one opinion about this topic but the truth will never comes out.
