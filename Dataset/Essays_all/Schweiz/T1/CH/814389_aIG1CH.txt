The story of the Chevalier de Seingalt is controversial. Nevertheless it's said to be accurate. His memoir actually is reliable. 

In the text it's said that he wasn't rich because he borrowed money while he was in Switzerland. However, he actually was really wealthy, he just could't use the money all the time. Because the reason of his fortune was his property, property that you have to sell first to get money out of it. Which certainly doesn't mean he was poor.

The second point were the critics about the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire. The critics say that it's impossible to have accurately captured these conversations because they were written down years after they happened. Anyways, people that knew the Chevalier, claim that he always had notes with him while writing the memoir. Apparently, after the conversations with Voltaire, he went home and wrote down everything he could remember the same evening. Besides he took regularly notes of his live. 

The last thing critics said to be inaccurate was the Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. They believe he probably bribed some of his politically well-connected friends to get him out. Which doesn't make that much sense because, while the Chevalier was in this prison there were other people there, with even wealthier, more powerful friends. These people could't escape so it certainly doesn't make sense that the Chevalier escaped because someone bribed the jailers. By the way, after the Chevalier escaped, the ceiling of his old prison room had to be repaired. Why would they have to repaire it if he hadn't made a hole in there?

After all these arguments should be enough proof to show that the Chevaliers memoir is a reliable, historical source.
