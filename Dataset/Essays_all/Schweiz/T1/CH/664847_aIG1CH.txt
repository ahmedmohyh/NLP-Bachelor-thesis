Chevalier was really rich, even known he had to borrow a lot of money. So he was in Switzerland with a certain amount of money available, that he spent on gambling and parties like it's told in the text. After some time, he had no money left but at this time in the 18th century, there were no bank stations were you could just get some money of your account. So he needed to order some money from his account and till he had his money, he needed to borrow some. So this was a plausible explanation.
For the second controversial, there is a really simple explanation. After every day he talked with Voltaire, he wrote down everything he spoke about with him. Maybe even the exact phrases. So it was well possible that after a few years, he had the idea to take these conversations with Voltaire into his memoirs and with his accurate notices, he had no problem to rewrite their exact phrases they said a few years ago.
The escape from Chevalier was the hardest thing to believe out of these 3 stories. Simply because it's never easy to escape a prison, especially in Italy. The fact that made it hard to believe was, that he had some connections with important people, but they were nothing compared to the connections other people in the prison had, that couldn't escape. But in fact he didn't need any connections. He only needed a peace of metal and the fact that the prison in Venice needed to repair the roof shortly after the escape of Chevalier. So this was actually possible as well, even if it could well be just for enjoyable reading.
To conclude, everything Chevalier wrote could've been invented and not the truth, but the fact that everything that was mentioned in the text above can be explained plausibly, leaves the scepsis alone, without the readers.
