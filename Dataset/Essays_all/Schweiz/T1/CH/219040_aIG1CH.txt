Even though it was clear that he had to borrow some money of a swiss merchant, they were sure he wasn't poor. They're argument was that he actuel had the money but he didn't want to spend it in parties and gambling. But in the text it is said "he was very wealthy" not just wealthy. So if he really had so much money it wasn't needed to borrow any money. The second argument had something to do with the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier. They said he had wrote down everything he could remember in the night after they spoke to each other. In the text there was never metioned any note of him. It's not sure who's right and who not if they don't find them or couldn't prove that the notes existed. And at the end there was the problem with the escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. The writer or the writers of the text think it's possible that could escape because of his friends there. But the women says it is known that they had to repair the ceiling because there was a hole. And the second reason for their opinion  was the fact that other people had even more big friends in Venice but they couldn't leave the prison.
