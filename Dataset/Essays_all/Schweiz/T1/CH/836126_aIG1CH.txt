So, in the text you can read the criticism of the people towards Chevalier de Seingalt about his self-written memoir. The text says that Chevalier lived at some point in his life in Switzerland and was very wealthy. He spent a lot of money on parties but also on other things. Critics don't believe that Chevalier was a rich man, because he had to borrow sums of money. Maybe it's true that he had to borrow a huge amount of money. But if your loan doesn't come regulary and you spent a lot of money once at a time, then it's true that you may have to borrow some money. But that doesn't mean that he was poor. Not everyone who is in need of money is automatically poor.

Second, people don't believe that Chevalier ever mets the writer Voltaire because Chevalier presented the memoir many years after he had met Voltaire. So critics doubt about the truth of the conversation he had with Voltaire. But Chevalier and Voltaire had met each other. Chevalier just wrote down every word he had remembered at that time. After that, he hide it for a long time for himself after overthinking it again and put it in his memoir then.

And the last thing, critics also doubt about the escape from a prison in Venice. He escaped the prison by using a piece of metal it says. But the government of Venice told that they had to repair the wall of the ceiling from the room of Chevalier, where he had been in the prison, so why should he lied about that? Chevalier didn't lie about his escape.
