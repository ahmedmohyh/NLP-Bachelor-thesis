The presentation about Chevalier de Seingalt was telling about his written memoirs. The presenter explained that no memoir could be completely accurate. So also Chevaliers story about his life and adventures wasn't absolutely exact but although it is an important source for European history. 

While Chevalier was living in Switzerland he was wealthy but he had not a lot of cash. Therefore, he borrowed money from others but that doesn't mean that he were poor. In the text is written that Chevalier hadn't a huge amount of money. As consequence he had to be poor. 
Chevalier records the conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Right after the meeting Chevalier did some notice and only years after he used them for his memoirs. The text doesn't point out this information.
Chevalier didn't escape from a prison in Venice and the presenter also explained what had happened in reality. But the text tells not more than a possible situation and how Chevalier could escape. 

So the presentation gave us much more information about Chevaliers life than the text.
