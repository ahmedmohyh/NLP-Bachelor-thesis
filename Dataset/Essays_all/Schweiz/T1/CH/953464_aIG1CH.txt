The three episodes which Chevalier wrote in his memoir to recounting his life and adventures can`t be true. I will explain this to every of this three episodes.
The first episode is about that Chevalier said that he lived in Switzerland and that he was rich. There he spent alot of money but he borrowed this money, so he can`t be rich. The men who told the presentation said also that Chevalier can`t be rich because of the fact that Chevalier must have sell first when he really lived in Switzerland because it's normal there and so he can`t borrow money from another person. The second episode is written about that Chevalie wrote in his memoir that he met the famous writer Voltaire and had a conversation with him. But this also can`t be true because he had this conversation years ago and can't know all the things exactly they talked about years earlier. In the presentation it's said that when this episode is true he had written everything down but there were never found notes about this talk between them. And last but not least the third episode is about the critics questioned that Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice, Italy. In the presentation the men who talked said that it can't be that Chevalier escaped from the prison because there where other prisonniers who had more friends who helped them and Chevalier hadn't them. That was another lie from him.
