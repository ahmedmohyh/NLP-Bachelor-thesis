The text is more controverse to the Chevalier whereas the presentation gives explenations and secures the truth of the Chevalier's memoir. At the text it is written that the Chevalier might not have been rich because he had to lend money for his partys. The presentation says, it takes a while to change wealthy to money and until he got the money, he must have lent it. The presentation claims that the Chevelier could possibly have broken out of the prison in venice, because afterwards they had to repair it. It was well known that the Chevalier ever carried something to take notes with him. So if this is true, He could have written down his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire and still have had access to it years later. The text tries to explain this phenomenon with knowing a conversation many years later, if it was interesting. It is also known, that he might have imagined his memoire, based on happened things, like the text says.

The memoir of the Chevalier will rest a mistery and if it's not true, it might be enjoyable to read.
