In the Presentation the speaker was disapproving with all the critics from the text. To each critic she found one other source which supported her mind set or just thought of an excuse herself. She disapproved with all four main points of the text, being Chevaliers accuracy, his loan, his conversation with voltaire and his escape from the prison.
Because it is such an controversial topic, it isn't enough when one tries to doubt critics based on one source, because in the end those arguements are as strong as those of a critics. One has to research alot and quote many sources before making such bold staements. 
The speaker in this case didn't sound objective, it sounded as if she was trying to defend Chevalier while lacking facts. Thus ending in simlpy criticising the critics. Someone who is discussing or presenting a certain topic, should atleast stay neutral in the beginning and state the facts as they are, before combining puzzle pieces which don't necesairly fit together.
