In the presentation we heard they talked about his life who he met, and what he did. In the text ther is written, that critics dont belive that he wrote a memoir about a famous persen because the conversation they had was many years ago but in the presentation they said, that he kept it for this long time. they they also argumented that he was poor also if he lived in switzerland. And they also said, that he went to prison in Venice and there he didn't escaped but political-friends of him helped hi out. And the critics just found an other point to question: if the memoir is relly real or just an invention of the Chevalier. It's like in the presentation they talk how his life really went and in this text there are just critics who didn't even know what happend but to own money they'd do everything, also lie. Well every critic has to lie, altough it's not interesting to read. The Chevalier was a poor writer who came into prison because he didn't follow the law. That'swhat they said in the presentation but in that text they said, that he was rich and he would not have needed to borrow some money.
