Many parts in the reading express something other than we heared in the presentation. In the reading is written that Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure. He had met many famous people in his life and. He concluded all his adventures in a memoir. Many critics claim that half of the memoir has been invented or disorted.

First of all, Chevalier writes in his memoir that he was very wealthy and spent a large amount of money on parties and gambling. But critics claim that Chevalier was not very rich in reality, because some sources prove that he had to borrow money from other people. Compared to the presentation that we heared, this is not true. Chevalier just had to borrow money because he was waiting for his new money to arrive.

A second point is that critics questioned the memoir from Chevaliers stay in a prison in Venice. He writes that he could escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics are not sure about the reality of this happening. They point out that Chevalier had mamy well-connected friends that could have gotten him out of prison easily. But on the other hand, points for the reality of this happening are, that other prisoners had well-connected friends too, but none of them could just get out of prison. An other argument is that after the escape the ceiling had to be repaired. 

To conclude, the arguments have many different sides. It is possible that Chevalier lied much about his life in his memoirs to make it more interesting. But some proves show, that it could have been true.
