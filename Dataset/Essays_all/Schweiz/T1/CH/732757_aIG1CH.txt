The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt became a very important and valuable source about European society, since he met many famous people such as kings and writers. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of his memoir. Evidendence shows, that that the Chevalier had to borrow cash from a Swiss merchant until his own earnings have arrived. Other critics argue that the Chevalier was welathy indeed and he had no need to borrow money. Critics also have doubts about another part in his memoir where he records the conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltaire because it was written many years after the vonversation occured. Critics also point out, that his escape from a prison in Venice didn't take place as he described it in his memoir. They say it is more likely that he had bribed other jailers to free him.
