Chevalier was a historical person but some people had doubts about his memoir. The first argue was that while he was living in Switzerland he was very wealthy but the critics didn't believe that because he spent huge sums of money on parties and gambling. In the presentation they had a explanation for that it is because when you spend so much money you will have to borrow sometime money but that doesn't mean that he is poor. Maybe he had not all the money at that place and he had to borrow some from a merchant.Why shouldn't the converation be true? He wrote everything down and kept it secretly in his office, why should he change the truth? To the escape of a notorius prison in Venice. The first fact is that he escaped from a very safe prison. Then the second is following, that he had to escape over the ceiling because it was said that after the escape the ceiling had to be repaired. And the third fact is that very powerful people who wanted to escape failed by using help from people outside the prison to bribe them free.So these facts are saying following: that is very likely that he escaped from the prison by only using a piece of metal, to break the ceiling.
