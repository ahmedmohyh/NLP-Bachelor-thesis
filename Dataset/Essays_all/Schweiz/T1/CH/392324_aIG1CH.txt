The following text should compound the life, as written in his memoirs, of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798). However there are parts that seem not to be very accurate about how his life and the events that it contains actually took place but this is to be debated. I'm going to give a objectiv view about three points that are mentioned in his memoirs but are discussed heavily by critics. First of all he wrote that while he was living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy and could spent a huge amount of money on parties and gambling. However there is recently shown evidence that he had to borrow money from a merchant. But this does not necessarely mean that he didn't had the wealth he described because if he gained the money out of merchant and with other transactions, he'd always had to wait on his money to arrive and maybe he needed some in the meantime. The second example are the discussions with the worldknown writer Voltaire: In his memoirs there are these discussions written down word by word. Ciritics now say that it wouldn't be possible to remember exactly what the have been talking about and every word. However people knowing Seingalt mentioned that he had been taking notes in a lot of events and used them to write the memoir.
The third point is the story of the prison in Venice. He claims that he could escape trough the roof after using a piece of metal to create a hole. Critics say that he had friends in high position, which bribed the jailers to free him. Very interesting is that in the same prison there were people with much higher classed friends than Seingalt which weren't released. And the absolute best part is that the prison's ceiling had to be repaired after he escaped.
