The speech was quiet critical towards the text. They said that Checalier`s life was probably accurate and that they had relieable sources. The speech was seperated in three parts. Each argument relied on an other part of the text. The first part was about the Chevalier's wealth . They said that he was not a poor guy, because he had parties and gamblings who costed a lot of money. If he did not have enough he would borrowed it from a Swiss merchant. The second point was about the memoir he wrote with Voltaire. In the text it says that he could not capture these conversations accurately. But in the presentation they say, that Chavalier had written down notes in his journal each night. So when he wrote his memoir, he had his caputred notes. And the third point was about his escape from the prison in Venice. Now a day, it is known that there where other prisoners who had much more powerfull friends who could help to escape fom the prison. They also question the fact that the ceiling had to be replaiced when in the text it sais that some friends of Chevalier were bribed to free him.
