The text and presentation was about a man called Chevalier de Seingalt who lived in the 18th century. He wrote a memoir to record his lifeand it was extremly detailt. Even though it is a valuable historical source critcts claim that he invented some parts to make his life to seem more exciting as it really was. 
They critic the fact that it has so many details, that you usually couldn't really remember. In the presentation they say that he could have written journals to keep thing in mind and that he could have relaied on them to write his memoir.
There are two points in the text and Presentation that they critict most about. 
The first thing they critiscised was the fact that Chevalier might not have been that rich as he claimed during the time he lived in Switzerland. He partied and gambled alot and hat to borrow money. They questioned that fact because it's not really clear what reason a rich person has to borrow money. On the otherhand the woman in the presentation sais that he could have been rich but hadn't had the money in cash more in objects and to get actual money he needed to sell things. And it took a while to sell those things so he borrowed money to have it right at the time.
The second thing they critic in the text is the fact that he recorded a conversation with Voltair. They don't doubt that he actually met him but they don't belive that any person can remeber a conversation so detailed.
The women in the presentaion says that he may have journald and he could have wrote parts of the conversation in his journals and kept them for many years and used them for his memoir.
