The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote memoir about his life, however scientists don't agree if this source is really reliable. As they suspect he tended to exaggerate and invent things to make his life and adventures even more impressing. For instance, Chavalier wrote that he was very rich when he lived in Switzerland,however there is evidence that he borrowed a loan from a merchant. Now one can question if that necessarily means he wasn't rich. He spent a lot of his money for parties and gambling. As he first had to get money before he could spend it and gain more of it, it doesn't mean he was poor when he stayed in Switzerland. In addition, he knew Voltaire and wrote their connversation down in detail. But as this was many years later than they really happened, they cannot be that precise. However there are witnesses which confirm that Chevalier wrote their conversation down as accurate as possible each night after he had met Voltaire and he later used his notices when he wrote his memoir. The third questioned event is his escape from the prison in Venice. The Chevalier himslef wrote in his memoir that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling of his cell. Some people think he just invented this story to make his memoir more attractive. They claim that his jailers and friends helped him to bribe instead. However, in the prison documents is written that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after Chevalier had broken out. Which can be concerned as an evidence that his story is true. In conclusion, the opinions of the reliablitiy of the memoir as a hisorical source
