The fact that Chevalier de Seingalt was borrowing money from a Swiss merchant but at the same time it was known that he speant a great sum of money on parties is very controversial. At the same time, why should it be wrong? As mentioned in the presentation, Chevalier perhaps needed the loan from a merchant because he wasran out of cash while spending it for parties. Another very important point of the presentation is that Chevalier was only keeping exact conersations because he was writting every evening about it in journals or notes. Therefore it's very likely for the memoir to capture these conersations.On the one hand, having doubts that Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice is understandable because he was boasting about his life, on the other hand one must mention that they reported that they needed to fix the ceiling in the room of the prison were he was staying.
