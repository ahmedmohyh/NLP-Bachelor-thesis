In the text below it's said that some critics think the Chevalier has invented some stories to make his life seem more interesting. In the presentation I heard it's said that we human being can have a good memoir and even when years are passed away, we can remember the stories we have gone through. Our memoir has a good accuray.The critics also say that he was poor because of the borrowed money, but that isn't true too. The chevalier has gone on so many parties that he spend a lot of money and then borrowed money of an Swiss merchant. Of course after a big party you don't have that much money anymore and that doesn't mean that you are poor.  Another critic is that it isn't believed that the Chevalier has escaped from the Venetian prison. The argument against this is that  other prisoners had more powerful friends than the chevalier had, so it's more possible that others had escaped from jail than he. It's also said in the oral exercise that workers from jail had to repair the Chevaliers room after he escaped, so why should they repair his room for no reason?
