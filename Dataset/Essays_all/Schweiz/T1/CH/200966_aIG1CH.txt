The text claims that Chevalier had borrowed mone, eventough he was wealthy and spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling, because he wasn't really rich. In the hearing they explained it that Chevalier had borrowed money as he was waiting for his money to arrive. Which means that he sold some of his own occupy and while waiting for his money to arrive, he borrowed money so he could live his life. 

Another thing critics are skeptical abut is the accuracy of the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire because the conversations were really accurate but the memoir was written many years after the conversations. But it could be very possible that Chevalier wrote these conversations down and used them by the time he was writing his memoir. This would explain perfectly why Chevalier remembered the exact conversation years after it occurred.

The last thing the critics are critic about in this text is the prison escape in Venice, Italy. Chevalier claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, so he could climbe through the roof. The critics claim that the well-connected friends of Chevalier bribed the jailers to free their friend. Against this statement speaks that shortly after Chevalier escaped from prison, his cell had to be repaired as there was a hole in the ceiling.
