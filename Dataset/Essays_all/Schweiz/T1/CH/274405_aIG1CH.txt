The text of the Chevalier de Seingalt was very critical to his memoir. But the speaker gave a lot of evidence that the critics weren't right. For example, the speaker said that he could also have been rich and a merchant which earned money by selling things to get some money. So in the meantime he sometimes had to borrow some money from friends but he was not poor at all. In the text there is only written the fact that he did spent a lot of money on parties and that he had to borrow money.

Also his records about the conversation with Voltaire were critisiced much whereas the speaker told that the Chevalier took notices of this conversations every night and kept them to consult them later for his memoir. Always when people write down their impressions and experiences there is also a personal factor in it. It is a document too and if you have only this documentation you can't evidence it either.

About the last story with the Venetian prison you can say that it surely was something nearly unbelievable but if you can't really give evidence that it was not like that, you should accept it. In addition the woman on tape said that there had been other prisoners with even more influencing friends than he had which weren't able to escape. There are old Venetian documents in which is written that the ceiling of the prisoners room in which he had been imprisoned had to be repaired some time later! 

It's possible that a lot of facts in this memoir are true. But it's never false to be critical, because also the thoughts of the talking woman could be wrong!!
