The Audio is the answer on the critical text above. The memoir of Chevalier is claimed to be a great historical source. But its not clear if he invented some stories. The first controversie is about his life in Switzerland. He claimed to have lived a wealthy live there. It's proven, that Chevalier spent huge amount of money on Parties. But Chevalier often had to borrow money of Swiss merchant. That leads to the conclusion that he couldn't have been that rich. In the Audio the woman means that when someone sells a bit of land, the money won't come immediately. So Chevalier could've needed the money during the time he had to wait for the money. The second controversie is about his records of the conversation with Voltaire. Critics state that it's impossible to remember a conversation in every detail and surely not years after it. But because of the fact that many friends of chevalier state that he always made notes on the conversations with Voltaire immediately after, it could be possible to write down the conversation accurately. The thrid controversie is how he escaped the prison in venice. In the memoire he writes that he escaped the prison by making a hole in the ceiling. Critics claim that it would make more sense if he just got bribed by his powerful friends there. But because of the fact, that many prisoners there would've had friends who are more powerful the Chealier's. So it would make no sense that Chevalier got bribed and the others not. Also because the ceiling of Chevalier's cell had to be repaired after his escape, Chevalier's words could be true.
