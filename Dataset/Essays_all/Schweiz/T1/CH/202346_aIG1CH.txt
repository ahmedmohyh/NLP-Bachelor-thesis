But the lecture told that Chevalier took many notes, so he could simply copy the notes and doesn't had to remember the dialogs.
The last point was that Chevalier wrotes he escaped from a prison in Italy and it's an agreement that he was in the prison. In the memoir is is an adventure how he  But the text means that influent person took him out of prison. But in the Audience it's told that other prisonners with connection to important person doesn't get to escape. The room of prison needs also reperation after the escape of Chevalier.
