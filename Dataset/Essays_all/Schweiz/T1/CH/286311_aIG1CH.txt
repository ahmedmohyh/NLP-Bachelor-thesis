The accuracy of the memoir of the Chevalier is a big subject and is critized of many people. First we have the topic of his live in Switzerland. The Chevalier was very wealthy, but he had to spend a lot of money for his parties. And also after his parties he had to wait until his money came to him so he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But after that he got his money back. That isn't called poor. It is just a bad management of money on his side.
Second the conversations with Voltaire. It was said that he had wrote down each conversation they had in the same night. So it is possible to read so many details of each conversation in the memoire. And he also regurlarly consolted his notes. 
Third the escape of the prison. In the prison in Venice, there were many friends of him that had a lot of power. And after he had escaped the sealing of his prison had been repared. So why should have they build a new sealing right after he escaped? That couldn't just be by accident.

Maybe there are some points in his memoir that are right but the author just tried to make them more entertaining for the readers. Like that the truth always gets a little bit lost in history, just because some authors try to rewritte the truth.
