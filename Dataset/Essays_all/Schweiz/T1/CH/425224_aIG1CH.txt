In the text, critics say, that Chevalier wasn't as rich as he wrote down in his memoir. They are sure, that he borrowed money from a Swiss man, if he had been rich, he wouldn't have done this. But in the audio we heard: Yes, he borrowed money, but he did, while waiting for his money to come to Switzerland. So the critics are wrong...
The critic about the conversation with Voltaire isn't very strong. they say, that Chevalier couldn't remember the conversation that good, because it was long time after the conversation really happened. Really? He spoke to a very famous and intelligent person, so he obviously could remember the conversation. That's absolutely normal! We see, the critics aren't very succesful to this point.
The third thing they criticised, is about his escape from the jail in Venice. They say he lied about it and made the escape more spectacular than it really was. I'm honest, I didn't understand the contraargument to their version, but I'm sure, there was one. So we see, maybe Cheavlier was a true man, who didn't lie about his life.
