The oral presentation states that Chevaliers memoir is a reliable source of information about the European society in the 18. century because of the evidence stated. This includes the fact that Chevalier was borrowing money because he was selling houses and that needed some time to transfer the money and because of that he paid his big parties with the money he borrowed from a swiss merchant, which is a quite realistic. The second argument is that Chevalier recorded most of his conversatons with Voltaire the night after he had them with him and so these conversations should definetly be mostly accurate and true.  It is also recorded that Chevalier wrote his memoir with the help of notes and journals, which gives this argument nearly no room to contemplate. For questioning that Chevalier broke out of prison on his own with the help of a pice of metall, it is recorded in the goverments archive that the cell in which Chevalier stayed had to be repaired soon after ho had broken out so that is evidence for the fact that he broke out on his own and not with bribing anyone like his fellow prisoners who had even better connections in Venice than he had and failed on their attempt to break out. The written part was way more critical and it was missing a lot of information to make it seem like there was no evidence for all of the things he wrote.
