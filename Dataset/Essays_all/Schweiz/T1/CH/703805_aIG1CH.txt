In the presentation they say the chevalier ran out of money so he had to wait for someone who gave him money. But in the text passage they wrote that the chevalier had to borrow a lot of money from a swiss merchant. There are also some difference about the prison-story. In the text passage they say that he got out through the ceiling and climed the roof. But in the presentation they said he escaped differently but after he escaped the prison they had to fix the ceiling of his "room" but they didn't know what really happened to it. Another diffrence betwenn the presentation and the text passage is the story with voltaire. In the text passage it says that the conversations were written down many years after the conversation acctually occured but in the presentation they said that the chevalier wrote evreything down right after he had disscused something with voltaire. So most of those things don't have that big of a difference but still there are some and I think after years the story changes more and more.
