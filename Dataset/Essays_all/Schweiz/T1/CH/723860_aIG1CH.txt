Firstly the woman in the listening had a look at the situation Chevalier had in Switzerland. She said that although Chevalier had borrowed money and used it for partying and gambilng it does not mean that he was poor. In the text they say that because of the borrow of the money Chevalier can not be as rich as it is said in his memoir. 
The second point it is about the conversations Chevalier had with Voltaire. In the listening the women said that Chevalier wrote down what he could remember about the conversations every night and that he regularly made notes or wrote into a journal. In the text instead it is said that Chevalier can not have reflected all these conversations because the memoir was just made a few years later.
The last theme was the escape from the prison in Venice. On this point the presentator in the listening said that other prisoners had much more powerful friends then Chevalier had and these did not escaped. It was also proofed that the room, in which Chevalier was during his time in jail, needed to be repaired. Aigain in the text the writer is against Chevalier and says that Chevalier can not have been escaped on his own, just because he had a few powerful friends.
