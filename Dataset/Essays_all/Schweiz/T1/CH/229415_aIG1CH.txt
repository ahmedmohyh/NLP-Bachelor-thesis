This essay is about the claims of lack of credebility in Chevaliers memoir. The first argument on the critics side is that he said he was very wealthy while living in switzerland but then had to borrow money. That is kind of an opposite. But here the other side explains that he just had to borrow until his own money arrived which happened to be a few days. 
Secondly he wrote exact phrases from conversations he had years ago. The critics say that this is not possible. Obviosly this is true.You cannot remember long conversations you had years ago. This claim is explaind with: He wrote journals. It is very simple. After every conversation with Voltaire he wrote down what he remembered. In this case he could easily wrote the exact phrases. 
The last argument on the critics side is that he could not possibily escaped prison the way he said. He must had help from his connections on the outside. This claim is explained as well. First of all other prisoners had even better connections and could not escape while he did. And secondly the ceiling of his cell had to be removed. So why would they have to remove it when he did not escape using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling?
