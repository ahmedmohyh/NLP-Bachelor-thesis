The chevalier is as the text says a person who wrote an important source, his memoir, about the european history. But now there are doubts about his memoir. 
In the text they say that the chevalier had a big amount of money. Now there is evidence that he borrowed a lot of money. The presentations tells me the same. The text and the presentation agree that he spent much money for parties. The chevalier does not seem to be rich with this action.
Secondly the chevalier wrote down that he knew the famous writer Voltaire and that they talked together regularly. The text claims that the chevalier invented many phrases of their conversation. That is because the time he met Voltaire and the days he wrote his memoir there are many years in between. So the critics agree that it is not possible to memorize all the phrases Voltaire said. 
The last point is about the escape from the prison in Venice. The text and the presentation do not have the same opinion. The chevalier claimed to have escaped from this prison on his own hands. But the critics from the text just mean that this would be an interesting story people would read. They think that as the chevalier had a lot of friends in Venice a bribery to get him free took place. But that stands in contrast to the hypothesis from the presentation. They claim that other prisoners had more friends than he had and the also couldn't escape with a bribery too.
