In the lecture they say that Chevalier was a wealthy man living in Switzerland. Like in the text he spent a lot of money on parties. One time he ran out cash, so he had to borrow money. But that doesnt mean that he was poor. In the lecture they also talk about Chevalier having conversations with Voltaire. Every night Chevalier wrote down what he remembered from the conversations. There were a lot of things he wrote. So its not untrue that that he really had the convrsation 
And what was the whole thing with the escape from the prison? In the lectue they claim that he really get out of the prison in Italy. But they question one thing. Actually its really hard to escape from the prison and why would the people working there repair the ceiling months after he escaped? But its true that he had a lot of politically well-connected friends in Venice.So he could get out there with the help of this people.
