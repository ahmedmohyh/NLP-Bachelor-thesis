Critics have raised doubts about the happenings in Chevalier de Seingalts memoir. They claim that he distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting. The following three happenings have been doubted and argued about. 

Chevalier claims that while in Switzerland he was very wealthy and spent a great deal of money on partying. According to evidence that has been found, he had borrowed lots of money from a Swiss merchant. So how could he have been rich? In the speech it is explained that the only reason he had to borrow money was because most of his money was in the form of properties. For him to convert the properties into cash it took a while and in the meantime he had to borrow money from the merchant.

The second thing that has been criticised is the accuracy of the conversations with him and Voltaire. Critics claim that the conversations aren't completely correct because the memoir was written years after the conversations had happened. In the speech it is explained that after every conversation the Chevalier had had with Voltaire he wrote it down right away and took notes. And his servants confirm that while writing the memoir he was using these notes. 

Lastly, the critics argue about the happening in Venice, when Chevalier allegedly escaped from prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof. They claim that it is more likely that his politically well-connected friends bribed the jailers to free him. In the speech it is explained that there were a lot of prisoners with way more powerful friends, yet they didn't get freed by their friends. Also according to governmental documents the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after his escape.
