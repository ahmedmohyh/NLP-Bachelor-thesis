The text claims that the memoir written by the Chevalier isn't very accurate as it contains many invented events to make it more exciting. The listening says that no memoir is absolutely correct, but this one's very accurate.
The first thing the text claims is that the Chevalier wasn't actually wealthy but borrowed the money from a Swiss merchant. The listening explains that because he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling he ran out of cash quickly. In these situations he had to borrow some cash from a merchant, but he paid it all back later, so he was a wealthy man.
The second thing the text claims is, that the conversations written down in the memoir can't be correct as the memoir was written many years later than the converstaions had actually took place. But the listening says that the Chevalier had written down all these conversations immediately after they had taken place. So he could take these notes to write down his memoir. 
The third thing were the text and the listening disagree is the Chevalier's escape from the prison. The text doesn't believe the story and claims that it is invented to make it more enjoyable to the readers. But the listening says that the story is true. There are government documents of the prison that say thet the ceiling of the room where the Chevalier had been, had to be repared immediately after his escape.
