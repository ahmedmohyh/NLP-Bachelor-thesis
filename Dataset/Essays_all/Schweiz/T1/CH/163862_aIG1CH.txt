In this presentation we were told by a woman that his memoirs are pretty accurate and in particular she claimed that they were also reliable. She tackled three three cases. First of all she brought up a very reasonable reason for the money Chevalier had to borrow while he was living in Switzerland. She states that he owned land and whenever he ran out of money and he urgently needed it he just sold a piece of land. However this money couldn't be delivered immedialtely because it took a little longer to send the money back then than today. So he basically had no choice than to borrow money. 
The second point she mentioned was the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. We know from some sources that Chevalier wrote down most of what he still could remember the night after the conversation. Years later he figured that he could copy it as a memoir. So that contradicts the fact that he wasn't accurate. 
The last point she tried to explain was that he wasn't able to bribe the jailers because simultaneously there were prisoners with way more power. Additionally, they found a ceiling that was damaged so it had to be repaired. Very suspicious that Chevalier was responsible for this as well. His writings suit with the facts. 
All these arguments sound very reasonable and it seems that there's no doubt anymore about his writings.
