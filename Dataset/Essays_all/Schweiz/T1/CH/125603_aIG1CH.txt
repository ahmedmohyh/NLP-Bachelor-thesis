The text mentions three arguments that the memoir of the Chevalier (which is important for the history of the European society in the eighteenth century isn't very accuracy which are negotiated by the presentation.
The first argument written in the text is that the Chevalier write in his memoir that he was living in wealthy in Switzerland. But one found out that he borrowed much money from Swiss merchants and he was rich wouldn't have to borrow money. The presentation says that the Chevalier have to sell things first to become wealth so he had to borrow money first to pay it afterwards back to the Swiss merchants when he becomes wealth.
The second argument written in the text is that the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire aren't true because there are no doubts that the Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed Voltaire. The presentation says that he wrote after this conversations all down he could remember and this is proved because he said it to other peoples so he must have met Voltaire many times, if not he had invented every evening a new part of his story.
The third argument is that the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling cant't be true. They point out that the Chevalier had many well-connected friend who could have offered a bribe. The presentation says that it is proved that the prisoners had to repair the ceiling of his room after his escape. Why should they repair his room if he didn't escaped throw the ceiling? The presentations says as well that many others who were in this prison had more powerful friends and are still in the prison.
