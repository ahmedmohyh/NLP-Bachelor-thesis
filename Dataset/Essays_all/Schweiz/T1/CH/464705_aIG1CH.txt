Chevalier de Seingalt, had to be a famous person in the 18th century. His memoir got a important source, but today there are a lof of critics who do not believe Chevalier in all of his points he wrote about. So they showed their doubts in different ways. In this text I will compare a presention and a text of two different people. 
 Both people has a lof of same points of what they think is not right. One of them is the fact that Chevalier shout have been rich while living in Switzerland, but the writer of the text says that he had to borrow money. 
 An other thing they were argumenting about is his escape of prison in Venice. Chevalier wrote that he escaped trough a hole in the ceiling, but the person of the presention claims that the room had to be remade after his escape and so we can accept that his escape has been a different way. The autor shows some doubts in this story as well, but he thinks a connection in Venice had helped him. So both critics do not believe in the story of the escape from prison of Chevalier. 
 In the end I can say that the life of Chevalier de Seingalt had to be special, but I am the same opinion than this both critics, that he changed some points in his momoir compared to his real life. There are some good facts that let us think this way.
