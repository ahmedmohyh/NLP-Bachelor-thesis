There are some critics who say that in the memoirs of the Chevalier not everything is true. It says that Chevalier borrowed money so the critics hink he was poor but in the people defending Chevalier say that he isn't poor just because he borrowed money back then a lot of people did this. Because getting money back took a long time. there is nothing special about it. They're skeptical about the truth treating the topic of the conversations between Voltaire and Chevalier. Critics have the opinion that it's impossible to rember phrases from  a conversation which took part years earlier. But Chevalier said that he wrote everything down the night after the conversation. The third topic critics question is his escape from the Venitian prison. Because they think that the story about the whole in the sealing is invented pecause he had well-connected friends there who could have helped him by offering a tribe. The defenderw of Chevalier say that they had to reapir the sealing, that means if he didn't escape that way why should they had to do that? And there were prisoners with better connections than Chevalier so why didn't escape they?
