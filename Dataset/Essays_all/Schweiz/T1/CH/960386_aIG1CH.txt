There were three main points in the presentation. The first point was the question about the loan from the chevalier. He was a very rich person and he spent a lot of money for unnecessaire things. But in the text is written that, he borrowed some money by a swiss merchant, that detail was not given in the presentation. The second part of the presentation was the meeting and conversations with Voltaire. Some critics says that this is not the truth, they said that the Chevalier and Voltaire have not ever met each other. But the women told that it gives some evidence that this two persones have met each other. The Chevalier wrote this meeting in his memoirs. Last but not least the third point. The escape from jail. He had gone to prison but he was able to escape. Unless he have not had powerfull friends as it is written in the text.
