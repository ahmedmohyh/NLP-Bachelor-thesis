Chevalier wrote at the end of his life a momoir about himself. Chevalier claimed to be rich and when he was in Switzerland, he spend a lot of money on parties. But in the text it is said that he borrowed a lot of money, so he couldn't have been a rich person. Chevalier also wrote in his memoir that he had some conversations with Voltaire and that he had made notes of their conversations. In the text it is written that some critics say that he would have published his notes about their conversations earlier if it was true that he spoke with Voltaire and that no one could remember a whole conversation after so many years. In the presentation it is said that he escaped from a prison in Venice (Italy). This story seems to be true because his ceiling in the prison had to be repared after he escaped. But in the text we see that he probably didn't escape without any help. He had well-connected friends in Venice that could have helped him.
