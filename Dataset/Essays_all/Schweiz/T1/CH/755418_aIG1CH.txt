The Chevalier

To summarise what the lecture was about we have to look at each part of the story sepperately and also compare it to the text.
In the first part there is an introduction. It is said that such stories about someone's life are rarely 100% true. You can't be completely accurate. But it's said that the story of the Chevalier de Seingalt is pretty accurate and reliable. 
The first part of the story itself is about his wealth. They say that although it's true that he had borrow money from time to time, he wasn't poor. They say that his wealth was in form of things he had to sell before he had cash. It is correct that he partied and gambled alot  in switzerland and it's also correct that he borrowed money, but only because he didn't have cash with him. 
The second part is about the conversations with Voltaire. He said he met Voltaire and that he had a conversation with him.The text says that this can't be true or at least that it didn't happen as the Chevalier says, because it is very detailed and very precise. The reason why they think that way is that you can't keep in mind a whole conversation that accurate. The lecture though says that it is proven by people which were friends with de Seingalt in his older life that he had written down everything he could remember the night after the conversation. He refered to the notes and reconstruated the conversation upon the notes he had taken that night.
The third and final part is about his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. The text says that it's most likely that he got help from "friends" in the jail. They say he only wrote it to make the story more interesting. The listening says that the Jail admitted that they had to fix the ceiling after the Chevalier escaped. Why would they have to repair the ceiling if he had just escaped like that.
