Chevalier wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures. He met many famous people but his life seem more exciting than it really was.His stories became a important topic in the European society.

But his textes were not  very accurate. He exaggerated or lied in his memoirs. For example he said that he was a poor man but he lived in Switzerland and spent a lot of money. This is not a very poor life I think. Chevalier wrote about the meeting between Voltaiere and him. Critics do not belive that they met each other. Chevalier wrote this conversation many years later. He could not remember those phrases exactly. Chevalier claimed that he eascaped from a prison in Venice. This is a bit suspicious, because he had many friends there. So anyone could buy him free. 

Critics think that he wrote stories like this to make the reading more enjoyable. But not everything is true in his memoirs.
