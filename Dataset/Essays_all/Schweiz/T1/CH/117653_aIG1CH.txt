In the text there's criticised the trustworthy of the Chevalier's memoirs. It is said, that he can't have lived the life he writes about. The first point mentioned is the period, when he lived in Switzerland. He was wealthy then and spent a lot of money on gambling and parties and to do so he borrowed huge sums of money from a merchant. Critics say that if he really was reach, he wouldn't have had the need to borrow money. In the presentation there is an explanation to this: the Chevalier just had to wait for his money to arrive, and because of this he must borrow money from a Swiss man.
There's also the answer to the question how the Chevalier could reproduce many years later his conversations with Voltaire. We know that the Chevalier each night wrote down, what he discussed with Voltaire and when he wrote his memoirs he used these notes.
So what about the escape from the Venetian prison? The texts criticises that the Chevalier escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling of the cell. He rather would have used his contacts to mighty people outside the prison. Actually there were some even more powerful people in prison and they weren't able to get their freedom through their contacts. Also there is a report about the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell being repaired. The lecturor from the presentation wonders, why this ceiling should be repaired, if there was not a hole inside.
