The Chevaier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. Toward the end of his life, he wrote a long memoir of his life and adventures.It has become a valuable historical source about European society in the 18. century, however, some critics have raised doubts about its accuracy. The first of the three episodes mention the Chevalier claiming to have been very rich while living in Switzerland, and it is known that he spent a lot of money there on parties and gambling. The evidece, however, recently surfaced that he had borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Thus, critics argue that had the Chevalier really been that rich, he wouldn't have needed to borrow that much money.
The second topic critics are skeptical about is the accuracy of the conversations recorded in his memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Critics complain the memoir cannot possibly capture the conversations with such accuracy, since it had been written years after the conversations had occured. There is an explanation for this as well. The Chevalier had claimed, in his memoir, thateach night he would write down the conversations he had with people and stored them safely so he could use them later on, as he did.
The third topic concerns his escape from a prison in Venice. Critics don't believe his story about breaking out through the ceiling, they think he bribed the jailers. However, more powerful and rich men haven't escaped through well-connected friends, plus the ceiling of his jail cell had to be repaired after his escape.
