Well in the text they have a more negative opinion to the Chevalier de Seingalt. A lot of aspect that they were disscussing in the text were countered with some other arguments from the women that hold the presentation. The text described the Chevalier de Seingald as a liar, who just wrote stories to impress people and  hoping that his life looks like a adventure novel. 

One example was when he was in prison. In the text they wrote that he bribed some guards or jailors, But the woman claimed with evidence from old venician documents, that he made a hole in the sealing and escaped from prison. an other ponit is that the chevalier claimed that he was rich, but he just borrowed the money from a swiss trader. 

The text sees the journal more as a joke and it describes the Chevalier de Seingalt as a fool wich is afraid that the future will forget him. But the women sees it as a important historical artefact and for her the Chevalier de Seingalt was and is a heoric person.
