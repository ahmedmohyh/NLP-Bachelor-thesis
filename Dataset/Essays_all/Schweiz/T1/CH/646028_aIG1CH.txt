A lot of people think that Chevalier was a poor man. But he wasn't. He was a farmer an he has to do hard work for his money. Because of tht he didn'dt have a lot of money. Another critics is how could the Chevalier remember of the conversations with Voltaire. His memoir,in which he told the whole conversations with Voltaire, he has written many years after. A cons is that Chevalier had written these conversations down after the it and a few years ago he could read his notes and rephrase it in the memoire. Then is there the mythos with his escape out of the prison. The people says that he weren't escaped out of the prison through the ceiling. It is unthinkable. They say Chevalier had had someone who had helped him to escape. But you can see that the ceiling of the prison was repaired and why should they repair a intact ceiling? There are lot of arguments which are contre these these.
