In the text is mentioned that there are many critics who think many parts of the Chevalier's memoir isn't true and they give arguments to proove their oppinion, for example they say that he couldn't be a rich man because he needed to borrow mony while he was living in Switzerland or that no normal person could keep difficult conversations for many years and they also question his escape with a piece of metal trrough the roof of the prison in Venice. They think the jailers would have just let him go because he had some good connetions to friends in Venice. But the woman who spoke at the presentation is defending the Chevalier. She's explaining that the Chevalier spent a lot of money for parties while he was in Switzerland and he needet to borrow money because of this. She also says that he made notes every evening after he had a conversation with Voltaire, so he could have kept all these difficult informations for so many years and for the last point she mentions that in the prison of Venice were a lot of people who had more connections to rich guys living in Venice and they never got out of the prison and it's known that they needed to repaire the roof of the prison so she belives that the Chevalier is mainly telling the truth.
