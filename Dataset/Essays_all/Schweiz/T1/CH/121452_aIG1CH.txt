The Chevalier's memoir

The woman said in her presentation, that the chevalier's memoir was indeed a pretty accurate and reliable source. Other than the critics in the text, who say, that the Chevalier was really poor and had to borrow money, because he didn't have any at that time.

The woman claims, that the Chevalier actually was rich, but he had to sell things to get the money that belonged to him. So while he was waiting to get his money, he just borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant, so that he could continue gambling and having fun and he wasn't poor at all like the text sais. 

The woman also mentioned, that the chevalier didn't make up any part about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire, like it's mentioned in the text. Instead, he had written down everything that they talked about in his journals, immediately after their conversations. There even were evidences, that the Chevalier referred to many of his notes and journals while writing his memoir. 

And lastly the woman also said, that there were other people in the prison, that the Chevalier had been to, that had way better connections than he did. So it would have been very unlikely that he could have escaped with the help of his friends, like the critics in the text claim. There even are actual reports, that the ceiling in the Chevaliers room had to be repaired immediately after the Chevalier's escape. And why would they have to repair the ceiling, if there wasn't any damage? 

All in all, the woman believes in the Chevalier's memoir and looks at it as an imported and reliable historical source and the critics in the text claim, that most of the memoir is made up and that the Chevalier just made things up, to make his life seem more exciting.
