"Chevalier"
Whle the written text about the Chevalier is very critical and tries to disprove certain points from his memoir the woman in the lecture tries to prove that these incidents did really happen. Both texts claim that the memoir is a valuable and reliable historical source about European society in the 18th century however the written text doubts its accuracy. The text says that the Chevalier lied about being rich while living in Switzerland because he had borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. The lecture states that loaning money does not necessarily mean that the Chevalier did not have money of his own but when he had just sold something he ran out of cash and had to borrow some to be fluent again. The second point that the text wants to disprove is that the Chevalier wrote down the exact words of the conversation between him and Voltaire since he wrote them down several years later. The lecture claims that it is still possible that they had held that exact conversation because the Chevalier made notes about them right after they were held and kept them in journals wich heconsidered while writing the memoir. The last point the text critizises is that the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice on his own. It says that he must have escaped with the help of his several political connections. The lecture on the other hand argues that he had help from some important friends because none of the other prisoners got help even though they had more influencial friends and a police report from Venice states that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. The memoir claims that he had made a hole in the ceiling by using a piece of metal.
