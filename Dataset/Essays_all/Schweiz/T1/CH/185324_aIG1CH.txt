Chevalier was a once famous person. He is supposed to be "famous" because he met many famous people, like kings and writers, on his adventures. Even more famous is his memoir though. In his memoir, he had 3 main topics.

The first topic describes his whealth. His memoir says that he was a wealthy person. Even though, many believe otherwise. For instance, its known that he even had to borrow money as he was in switzerland. Because of that reason (any many others which are following) quite a lot of people thinks that he is lying in his memoir. Sure there are some people who think to know the truth. They say: "He had to borrow money because he hadnt much money, no, he had many valuable things, which he had to sell. Because he had to find a buyer first, he needed to borrow money. 

Another main topic are his conversations. Especially his conversations with Voltaire. He had many conversations with him. Its known though, that he had those conversations years or even decades ago. Can they be taking as truth or are they lies? On this topic aswell, there are people who think that he wrote those conversations down, they days/nights he had 'em. 

His third main topic was his escape out of a venice prison. He wrote down, that he made a hole into the ceiling. Well it is quite entertaining to read that, but in reality he probably had bribed some politicians, he knew. But there are on this topic aswell some people, who think to know the truth. As the previous times aswell, they believe him. This time they got some evidence though. The venice prison he escaped out had to repair his ceiling. "Why would they need to do that?", "He had to escape out the ceiling", they say. 

To sum it up. It^s not possible to say whether he lied or told the truth. Even though his memoir is quite entertaining and because of that, worth reading!
