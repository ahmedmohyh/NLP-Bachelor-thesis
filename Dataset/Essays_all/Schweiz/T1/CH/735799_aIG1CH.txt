The first contradiction is that people claim he was poor but maybe they did not know that he was the occupant of a bar and that he sold his own things. In the audio they consist on the fact that the meeting between Chevalier and Voltaire really had happened, unlike in the text where is written that they did never meet each other.
About his escape from the prison there are the opinions igual till the fact that in the text is written he had a number of friends but he actually did not have a lot accoding to the listening part. He escaped throug the ceiling, yes, but did he then escape through the roof?
