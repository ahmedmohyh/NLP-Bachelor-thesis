Chevalier

Many critics accuse Chevalier's memoir to be partly invented or distorted so he could make his life seem more interesting than it actually was. 
For instance, while he claims to have been very wealthy while living in Switzerland in his memoir, it has come to light that he had actually borrowed great sums of money from a Swiss merchant. While critics argue that this must mean he probably wasn't that wealthy at all, you should also consider that him borrowing a loan might result from him having his wealth mostly from *non-fluid* means. That means he didn't always have cash, so he had to borrow money for his parties and gambling.
Another example critics use is his conversations with Voltaire. While they don't doubt that Chevalier and Voltaire met and talked, they say his memoir couldn't be accurate, since it was written years later after these conversations and that he couldn't possibly have remembered all the exact phrases. But it has now come to light that Voltaire took notes almost every evening, listing whatever he talked about with the people he met. This made it so that he could write a quite accurate memoir even several years later.
Critics also often doubt Chevalier's escape from the Venetian prison, since he claimed to have dug a hole into the ceiling and have gotten out that way. They say he probably just bribed his jailers to free him and his story was just for enjoyable reading. It came out later though, that the ceiling of his jail cell had to be repaired later, making his story more believable. Also, nobody before him had ever been able to bribe the Venetian prisons jailers.
