He lived in Switzerland and was a rich man. Most of his time spending in switzerland he went to parties and gamblings. He definitely lived  wealthy and somehow he was an important businessman. Of course he had some connections whith other marchants which were quit useful. But anyway his critics always remind of his money borrowing from other marchant. They also pretend that if he really was such a rich man he had not to borrow any money from others. Another confusing story about him is his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. They are not any clear facts that this conversation had really taken part. Apart from this he wrote down this conversations for years later and honestly, who is able to think about an  conversation in the past that exactly like he did.  it is possible that nothing from all of this is real. there are chances that this is just a big lie. 
Chavelier also wrote about his escape from a notorious prision in Venice. He showed us in his books how he made a hole in the ceiling just with a piece of metal. But the point is, if he really escaped in this way he would not spend at least one word about this. He maybe just pretend such an escape and in reality the jailers just free him. A very important fact is that the whole family from Chaveliers were well-connected in Venice.
