The text critics the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt a lot. But this critics aren't all correct. In an interview I'v heard a critic about the critic.

"Critics thus  argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money." After the interview I can say it is true that Chevalier had to borrow money, but just because "he spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling". He earned a lot of money but first he had to wait until that money was sent to Switzerland. So we can't say someone - in this case Chevalier - is poor when he borrows money!

The next critic-point that Chevalier wrote in his memoir a conversation he had hold many years before with Voltair can't be word by word rightly is also not a true statement. From other texts we know, that Chevalier, after his conversation, wrote every evening all words he told with Voltair he could remember down.

The last critic on Chevalier's memoir urge that Chevalier can't have escaped from "the Venetian by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof." 

They say he just brought that in his memoir that his life seemed more exciting than it really was, but after that interview we can say this is incorrect.
