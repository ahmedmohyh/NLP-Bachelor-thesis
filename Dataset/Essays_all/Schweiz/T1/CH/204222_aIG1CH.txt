Like the person himself, the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is controversial. It is still used as a valuable historical source about the European society, but critics have raised doubts. 

One of their doubts is about the time the Chevalier lived in Switzerland. In the memoirs he stated that he was very wealthy, but recently evidence has surfaced that he borrowed big sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Why would he have to borrow money, if he was so rich? 
One reason could be that he hasn't had all of his money with him. He always spent large amounts of his money and needed to get more. In that time he had to borrow, because he still waited for his own money to arrive. 

Critics also claim that his conversations with Voltaire wasn't accurate, because no one could recall conversations in a so exact way, therefore, the Chevalier must have made many things up. There are evidence and people who claimed that the Chevalier noted everything after each conversation with Voltaire in a seperate notebook. In that scenerio it is possible to recontruct conversations accurately. 

His prison break from the Venetian prison is also a controversial topic. The Chevalier claims that he had escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics however say that it was more likey that the Chevalier had bribed the jailers, but they were much more powerful prisoners held in the prison that time and no one of them had succeeded in bribing the guards. Another clue is that the cell of Chevalier was repaired after his escape. Why would the prison repair his cell if he had escaped by bribing the jailers?
