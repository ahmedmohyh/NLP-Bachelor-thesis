In the text is written that Chevalier was not as rich as he writes in his memoire. It is known that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. But logically, a rich man does not need to borrow money. On the other hand, in the listening, they give another reason for borrowing money from a Swiss man. They argue that Chevalier had to borrow the money, because he could not make his earnings from his business into money in a very short time. So he borrowed the money manage his life from the first moment in Switzerland.
 Than they criticize the conversation with Voltaire. It was partly invented. But in the listening they say that Chevalier took notes from the conversation and wrote   
the memoire with these informations.
In the essay they think that Chevalier could not escape the prison without the help of powerful political friends from Venice. But we know that Chevalier had less powerful friends than other prisoners who could not escape. So he had to escape in another way. Probably he managed to escpe through the ceiling, because it had to be repaired after his escape. So why did it have to be repaired when he got help from politicians?
