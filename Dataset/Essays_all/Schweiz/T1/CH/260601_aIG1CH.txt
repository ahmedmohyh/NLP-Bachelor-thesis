Chevalier de Seingalt, a historical figure from the eighteenth century, is now critised about his lifeexperiences.
First, it is questioned if he really has been a wealthy person when he lived in Switzerland, because as it's written in the text, he should have borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant. But there's a theory that he just had to wait for his money to arrive.
Second, there are sources that confirm that Chevalier had connections to Voltaire. A whole conversation has confirmed this fact, but the text questions that someone can regive exactly the same sentences that were told. But we get to know that Chevalier has written down this conversation in his diary just after he met Voltaire. So it wasn't written down after a couple of years later. 
At least, on the one hand it says that Chevalier escaped from the Venetian prison by "using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling" what is doubtet because we know that Chevalier has had a lot of powerful friends in Venice that could have brought him out of prison. On the other hand there's the fact that the ceiling had to be repared and that in the same prison have been other people with more powerful connections to the outside but couldn's escape prison.
