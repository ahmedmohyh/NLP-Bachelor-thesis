The lecture about Chevalier de Seingalt's memoire refers to the text on top. The lecture holder is convinced that the memoire is credible and an accurate source. To prove her point, the lady takes up every point critized in the text and defends it with a counter argument.

The first story mentioned is about Chevalier living in Switzerland and beeing a wealthy man. The lecturer states that just because he took up loans, it doesn't mean that he was poor. His wealth was just in form of property which he had to sell first to recieve cash, which he eventually used to gamble with. While waiting for the cash, he had to take up loans.

The second point critized in the text is about the conversations with Voltaire. The text claims that it is impossible to remember the conversations exactly, because the memoire was written long after the encounters took place. In the lecture though, the woman explains that Chevalier wrote down what he remembered of the conversations every evening. Considering this, it is plausible that Chevalier wrote exact dialogues in his memoire, because he took his notes to hand.

The third and last point in the text is about Chevalier escaping from the prison through the roof. The text does not think that this "daring escape" really happened, rather the jailers were bribed to free Chevalier. In the lecture, it is mentioned that other men in the prison had far more powerful friends and they could not bribe themselves out of prison. Also in a book of the Venetian prison, it is stated that soon after Chevalier's escape, the roof of his former cell had to be repaired indicating that he had in fact, climbed out.
