The writing says that chevalier couldn't escape like he said he did, because it was just not possible. They said that he escaped by having good connections.
The woman said that there is an evidence that he escaped by using a piece of metal, because they had to fix the ceiling after Chevalier escaped out of the prison.
Another point was that the Chevalier was very wealthy, while he was living in Switzerland. The writing and the woman said that it was true, but the critics in the writing said that he invented these storys. But there is an evidence that he spent that much money. Because he borrowed money from a merchants. The woman argued that he had to borrow money, because he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. 
The third point was the accuracy of a conversation between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. Critics saif that no one could doupt that they had a conversation.
