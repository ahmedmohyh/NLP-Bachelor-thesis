In the presentation about the famous Chevalier de Seingalt, the women talked about that he wasn't a poor man. He wrote about adventures and his life.
Especially in Switzerland he spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. And he never needed money from others. He was an independent man.

One point which wasn't like in the texte was the one about the conversation with Voltaire. In the presentation she said that Chevalier wrote everything  in the same night down in his book. But then we can read in the texte that it wasn't so. There can we read that he wrote all many years after the conversation down. Because of this a lot of people thaught that he was a lier.

Also the story when Chevalier claimed that he has escaped the Venetian prison by just using a metal to make a hole in the ceiling and later he climbed through the roof could be e lie. Because critics said that de Seingalt bribed the jailers to freem him and he wrote the other version of the story just for making the book more interesting. When we compare the story of the texte with the presentation, we mention that a lot of people said Chevalier hasn't so much power of friends like others. They say also that the other persons with more power of friends (outside the prison) couldn't come out of it, or the jailers didn't let them out.
