Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) worte improtant texts during the time he lived wich are today very useful sources. But there are some critics about the accurancy of his textes.
For exampel when he was in Switzerland he had to borrow money althugh he told that he was very welathy. Well, this cuold be beacuse he had to sell his gods first and then he got the money. So it could be that he had not cash money anymore and had to borrow money although he was not poor.
There are also doubts about the accurancity of his texts about his meetings with Voltaire because he wrote this text after several years. But on the other side people say that he worte every night some notice and beause of that the text are accurate.
That he escaped from zhe notorioous prison in Venice withthe by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof sound for many exerts a little bit to adventures. They think that Chevalier escaped with the help of his politically well-connected friends who could have offered a bribe. Other people that other prisioners had mor well-known friends and coulden't escape. Hes room also had to be repaire after his flight so this is also a argument for his adventerous flight
So Chevailer was a important man so that we can understand more about that time when he lived althoug not everythimg might be exactly true.
