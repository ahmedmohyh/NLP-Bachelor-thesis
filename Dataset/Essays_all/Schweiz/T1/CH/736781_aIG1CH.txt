The critics arguments are for the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir. First she said, Chevalier wasn't necessarily poor, only because he borrowed money. Chevalier spent his money on gambling, borrowed money, while waitinig for new money to arrive. It's a concept of moving money, doesn't mean he had none.
The second argument which was mentioned, was that Chevalier actually worte down the conversations at that night and kept them years later.
The third argument was, that shorty after Chavelier escaped, the ceiling in the prison had to be repaired. 

In the text it sais, that Chevalier must have been poor, if he lent money. However Chevalier always earned new money by gambling. You lose something and win something. The text claims that it can't be possible to write exact conversations which have occured years ago. The presentation contredicts this,by saying, that Chavelier wrote them down and stored them. So it is possible to have an accurate conversation, eventough written later. Chavelier just transcripts the information in a later timeperiod.Chavelier didn't have the strongest friends in prison. Because of this evidence, the stronger ones couln't have helped him in this situation. There was even evidence that he escaped through the ceiling: the ceiling had to be repaired shorty after the escape.
