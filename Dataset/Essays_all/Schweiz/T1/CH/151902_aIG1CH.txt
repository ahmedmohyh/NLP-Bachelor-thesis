The Chevalier was a controversial figure, who wrote a memoir that was doubted on its accuracy. He lived in Switzerland and was really wealthy, since he was a gambler and went to parties a lot, he spent most of his money there. Then he needed to borrow money form a Swiss merchant and critics argue, that he propably wasn't that rich if he had to borrow money. But in fact, he was just waiting for his money to arrive.
They also question the accuracy of the records of the conversation, that Chevalier wrote down. In the lecture they explained, how he managed to write everything down so accurat. While they were talking, the Chevalier took notes about the conversation all night long, so there is no doubt, that the accuracy is real. He also kept these notes for many years, meaning he could just look up phrases many years later and write them into his memoir.
The last point also has a logical reason, many of the prisoners had way more powerful friends than the Chevalier and could have broken out if they wanted to. Just after Chevalier broke out of jail, the prison cell he stayed in had to be repaired at the ceiling. So there are logical explanations for every doubt people have made.
