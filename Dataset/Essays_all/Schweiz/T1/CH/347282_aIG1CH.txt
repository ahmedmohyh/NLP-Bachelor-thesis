The presentation about Chevalier contains many arguments in favour of the stories which he claims being true in his memoir. At first, Chevalier being rich is a question which cannot being proven right or wrong, however, the people who claim his stories being reliable say that even though he had to lean money he was not poor at all. He just spend much money in Switzerland with gambling and when all of his money had been spent, he had to borrow some money until his sort of "new money" arrived. But here, as we see, the opinions about Chevalier begin to split: Someone who is wealthy does not have to borrow some money, says the opposition in the written text. And it goes on: In his memoir, we can find multiple conversations which he as he claims had with Voltaire. Even though he wrote them down many years after having met Voltaire, the conversations can still be very accurate - thinks the proposition. He kept many note books in which he wrote down many things he experienced right after he saw or heard them, so he could refer to them while writing his memoir even many years after he had the actual experiences. However, the opposition does not say anything about those note books and just argues against with it not being possible to remember things exactly when many years have passed. 
As a last point, Chevalier even writes about a prison break which he commited in Venice. The presentation argues in favour and says that the jailers could not have been bribed because there were many people with more wealthy friends so it could not be that Chevalier would have been the only person bribing the jailers. Also, the ceiling is told to have been repaired after Chevalier escaped which would not be necessary if he just had bribed the jailers. In the written text we can just read that the story would be very enjoyable to read for sure, but it is not true.
