Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. In both, text and presentation, it was said, that his memoir has become a valuable historical source about life in Europe in the eighteenth century, but the text is much more critical about the events Chevalier wrote about in his memoir.

The first topic in his memoir that was talked about was the time when he lived in Switzerland for a while and spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. Chevalier wrote that he was wery wealthy, but in the text it's said, that this can't be because otherwise he wouldn't have had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. In the presentation they say, that the fact he borrowed money didn't mean that he was poor, because even rich people somethimes have to borrow money to invest in something that brings even more money.

In the text the critics also complain that the memoir can't capture the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire accurately, because Chevalier wrote the memoir many years after the conversation and he couldn't have remembered every word they said after so many years. But the presentation says that the conversaton were captured accurately, because Chevalier wrote down everything directly after the conversation and kept his notes until the time he wrote his memoir.

Chevaliers escape from a notorious prison in Venice is also held as not true in the text, because the critics think that it's more realistic that some well-connected friends of Chevalier offered a bribe to the jailers. The presentation says the opposite. They believe, that his escape happended the way Chevalier described it, because the ceiling in his cell had to be prepared after his escape.
