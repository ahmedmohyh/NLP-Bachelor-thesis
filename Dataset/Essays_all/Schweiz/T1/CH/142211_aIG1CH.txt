In the text they doubt that the memoir is accurate but in the lecture they claim that Chevalier actually took a lot of notes and wrote diaries, so a lot more might be actually correct that the text assumes. For exemple they believe on both sides that he conversed with Voltaire, in the text it isn't believed that the conversation was exactly how it is told. In the lecture they said that Chevalier wrote down notes about his conversation with him right afterwards. The memoirs is apparently a reliable soure, which is absolutely much more doubted in the text. They don't believe that he was rich and wealthy in Switzerland but in the lecture it is said, that he spent a lot of money on parties and other activities he enjoyed. Yes, at a time he borrowed money from his friends but not because he was poor. Only because he had to wait for it. It is discussed if he escaped from prison in Venice, on both sides it is said that he could have made a hole in the ceiling and in the lecture it is even confirmed that afterwards in the room, where he had apparently stayed the ceiling had to be fixed. The second option could have been that his friends offred a bribe to free him but the lecture disagrees because the friends of the rest of the prisoners were much more politically well-connected but they were never bribed out. So this is quite controversial but still in general they talk about the same actions just the details are distinguished.
