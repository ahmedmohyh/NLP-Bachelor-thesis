As mentioned is the text there are suspitions that not everything in Chevalier's memoir is true, how ever in the listening there are posslible reasons for the memoir beeing true. The first point is that he apparently claims to be very wealthy eventhough it has been proven that he had to borrow considerable sums from a Swiss merchant. According to the listening he was was very wealthy, how ever he keept his money in stalks. Beacause of that he couldn't always get his money imediately. Thats why he had to borrow money in between his waiting.
Another point is that he broke out of prison by making a hole in the ceiling. The text claims it's more likely for him to have bribed the jailers to get him out. In the listening it was mentioned, that other prisoners had better connected friends than Chevalier and they didn't get out of prison as easily as him. In old documents there was also a report of a repair of the ceiling in the prison Chevalier was in. Why else would there be a reason to repair the prison's ceiling, than Chevalier cutting a hole into it in order to escape. 
People who knew Chevalie,r claim to have seen him writing his memoir with the help of old notes and journals. This is supposed to prove that he always had correct information present while writing his memoir.
