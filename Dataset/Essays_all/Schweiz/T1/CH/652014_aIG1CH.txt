Well first of all everyone tells stories about themselves which aren't really telling the truth to make their lives sound a little more interesting.
The woman who just gave me the speech about him not being poor is right, I mean he just had to wait for his money to arrive in Switzerland, in the country he lived in back then. That explains why he needed to borrow money from somewhere because of the fact that his money didn't arrive in time. He also had to sell his property at first anyway. So I doubt that he was rich. He was wealthy but he had to work on it and start from the beginning. But in the text they claim that critics say that he was a super rich and he didn't need to borrow money from anyone. 
The woman also said that in the end of every conversation with the famous writer Voltaire, he went home (or somewhere else) and made a lot of notes about what they were talking about. Then in the end of his life he was able to use those notes to write his memoir. That explains why he was able to be so accurate with his memoir. But maybe he did add some things in to the memoir to make his life, as I said in the beginning of my essay, sound a little more exciting. 
Now let me explain what the woman said in the dialogue about the escape in Venice. She said that there was a hole in the ceiling after the Chevalier escaped. The people in the prison had to fix that hole. So it's pretty believable to me that the Chevalier escaped by digging a hole in to the ceiling and climbing out the roof. But maybe he did ask for help from his friends that are by chance politically important. Who knows.
