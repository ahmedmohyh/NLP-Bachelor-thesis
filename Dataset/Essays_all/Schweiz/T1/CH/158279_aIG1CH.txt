Some critics doubt about the accuracy, but well a lot of things you can just check and there are like little evidences for some things in his book. 
He wasn't poor in Switzerland, he just had a special way of making money, where he sometimes had to wait a few days until he got more money. But all the parties and all the gamblings are evidence enough to show up he had a lot of money, which wasn't borrowed - and by the way - who would lend someone money who just spend it on partying and gambling?
Now to the conversations with Voltaire, he aleady made notes right in the nights after they met and tried to write down everything he could remember - exactly these notes he just kept for many years, before he wrote them down in his memoir.
Last but not least let's talk about how he escaped from prison; YES he did escape with a piece of metal through the roof and there was no connection to any "friends" in politics, there are 2 evidences for that. Number one: After he escaped the prison, they really had to repair the roof, you can read that in some old acts. Number 2: Some other persons in jail had even more powerful friends in the politics, but they never came out.
So over all there is no reason for all these doubts.
