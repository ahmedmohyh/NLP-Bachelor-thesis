The lecture about Chevalier makes some very interesting assumptions which don"t necessarily correspond to the information given in the text about him. In Chevalier"s memoir there are three different claims the text states to be false, the lecturer on the other hand states to be true.
First of all the lecturer claims that one isn"t necessarliy poor if one borrows money. At that time it would take a while to convert assets into money, so naturely he must have had to borrow money at times. The text however claims that the merchant"s loan is proof of Chevalier"s poverty.
Secondly Chevalier documented some interesting conversations he held with Voltaire, which according to the text couldn"t possibly have been remembered after a such long time span for he wrote his book years after his actual conversation. The lecture on the other hand states that Chevalier took notes in the evenings after their conversations and refers to them in his memoir.
Last but not least the text claims Chevalier was more likely to have bribed his way out of prison, while the lecure sais that even more powerful people than Chevalier weren"t able to escape prison through bribery and therefore his prisonbreak probably did take place. What"s more, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired afterwards which is proof that his escape through the ceiling could havw very well been real.
