There has been a lot of controversy going on in the case of the Chavelier de Seingalt. He is known to be a controversial figure born 1725 who has met a lot of famous people in his life and who became a valuable historical source. However, there have been debating people about how accurate the information is about his life. For instance it is said thet he had a glamorous life and did not have to worry about money. But then others seem to make conspirasies about how much money he really had. Was it really his or did he feel the need to borrow it from friends? 
An investigation also shows that it is not quite clear if he really did interview the famous writer Voltaire since it is believed that Chavelier wrote down his notes long after the interview took place. 
The probably most famous conspiracy theory about Chavlier is about how he managed to get himself out of jail. People have been doubting if the story is true in which he destroyed the ceiling and got himself out of there. Many critics say that it is really unlikely that something like that happened. There have been other prisoners in jail who had an even better possiblity to free themselfs by bribery but who did not manage it. So why should have Chavelier managed doing so? 
There is many controversy and everyone seems to believe something else. To find out the truth seems to be a lost cause.
