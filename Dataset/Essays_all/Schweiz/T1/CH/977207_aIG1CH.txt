In every lie there is some truth. An old german saying says that and it is the same with the Chevalier de Seingalt. In his memoir he wrote about his wealth, his conversations with a famous writer called Voltaire and a prison escape. Many question the accuracy of his memoir because of many reasons. That however is not true. Chevalier de Seingalt wrote very accurately about the events he witnessed.
First he describes his conversations with Voltaire and even though he wrote the memoire several years later, Chevalier is known to have made notes after conversations like these. If he kept his notes until he wrote the memoire beeing accurate would have been be no problem.
After his conversations with Voltaire things get more interesting as he writes about his life in Switzerland and how he gambled alot and went to alot of parties. He borrowed money to do so and he might have done that not because he is poor but because he had to wait for his stuff to be sold. He only sold some of his belongings and during the time in which he didn't have enough money he had to borrow some. That does not make him poor.
And the last event described in the text is about a prison escape in Venice. Critics say that his politically well-connected friends in Venice probably got him out of that prison. However there were alot of other prisoners who also had friends like Seingalt had and they did not get out. Also the roof of the prison had to be repaired shortly after Seingalt escaped.
This brings me to my conclusion that Chevalie de Seingalt said the truth about his life and adventures. This also makes his memoir a valuable historical source and his life-story all the more interesting to read.
