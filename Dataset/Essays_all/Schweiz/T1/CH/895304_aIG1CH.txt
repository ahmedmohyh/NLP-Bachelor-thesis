Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life. In his memoir there are three stories, wich are discussed in the text and the oral part. First that he was very wealthy whlile living in Switzerland, than that he had a conversation with a famous writer named Voltaire and that he escaped from a prison in  Venice. In the text there are skeptic critics. They doesn't really believe these stories."He haden't that much money, didn't remember the conversation and every phrase they said and werent able to escape from the prison in such a daring way." But in the oral part, the women wants to prove the opposite. For the first example she said that its proved that the Chevalier spend a great deal of money on parties and gambling. She said that after that he sometimes had to wait for new money and had to borrow it until this time. But he alwys had the money after a while. For the second story, that he had a conversation with Voltaire, she just said that he wrote down ,everything he remeberd about this night and the conversaition, the next morning. And last but not least the story of Venice and the escape from the prison . She said that there were documents of the prison, wich said that the cell of Chevalier, after he used it, had to be repaired. That prooves that he escaped the way he wrote it down in his memoir, with a piece of metal.
