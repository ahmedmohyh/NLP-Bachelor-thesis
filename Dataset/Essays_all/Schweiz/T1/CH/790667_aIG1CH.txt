Chevlier:

1. In the listening: in Switzerland the Chevalier waiting for his money and he has few money, which he borrow. And the text describe that the chevalier spent a lot of money for gambling and it's written that the Chevalier would not have needed to borrow money.
2. In the listening: She told me that the Chevalier worte down everthing he can remember and she is sure that he knows a lot of things about their meeting. And in the text is written that the Chevalier can't remember exact phrases because this is impossible. So the woman is sure that the phrases in the memoir could be correct and the people who wrote the text aren't sure.
3. In the listening: During the escape he get more friends and in the text is written that the Chevalier had a number of politically well- connected friends in Venice.
