So here we have to parties. One partie basically says that Chevalier's memoirs isn't accurate and the other one is saying that there is a deeper truth behind it so therefore it is accurate.
To make it easier for me to write I'm going to refer to the partie which said itisn't true as Contra and the other one is going to be Pro.

So the first thing Contra is bringing up is that he actually wasn't rich because he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss marchant. Now Pro says that him borrowing money isn't evidence for his poverty. They say, that he had to wait until his momey arrived and because he still needed money during that time he siply borrwed it. I can't go much more into detail because I couldn't pay more attention (the headphones were to loud).

Next argument from Contra is that hetechnally couldn't be able to recall all the conversations he had with Voltaire, since they were held many years before he actually wrote them down. But Pro has proof that he actually could. Many people who lived with him confirmed, that he wrote a lot into his journal. I'm not sure if Chevalier said it or someone in his life, but he wrote down each conversation he had with Voltaire later that day at night time. So therefore he didn't had to remeber all of them but he just could back to his notes and copy them.

And last but not least Contra says that he did not leave prison because he (how he said) made a hole in the ceiling. It was because he had influential friends in Venice who got him out of there... And once again Pro has something to say about that. They say that he actually escaped prison, since there were so many other prisoners who couldn't leave prison eventhough they had even more influential friends. And the other argument would be that Venice had to repair the ceiling of Chevaliers room after he left. Now why would they do that if it wasn't reallynecessary?
