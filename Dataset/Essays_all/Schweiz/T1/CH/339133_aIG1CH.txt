The life of Chevalier de Seingalt has many mysteries and unbelievable stories. At the end of his life, he wrote down his memoirs are a valuable historical source about european society in the eighteenth century. But critics question the value of the memoirs. The accuracy of them isn't high enough in their opinion. In this essay, some of the critics points will be compared so some facts about Chevaliers life. 
First of all, many people question his claims about his richness. In Switzerland, he spend alot of money on parties and gambling. But it evidence says that he borrowed high sums of money from a swiss merchant. Why would a rich person do this? As he spend the money, he had to convert his assets into liquid currency. But this process takes alot of time, so to spend money in the meantime, he had to borrow some from the merchant.
Another controversial point are the written conversation of Chevalier and the writer Voltaire. The critics say that the conversation couldn't been captured accuratley, because the writing of them happend many years after the time of the meetings. But it is known that Chevalier held alot of notes. Friends knew he wrote down alot in them, so it is highley likely that after such important conversations, he noted everything preciesley and relied on them while writing his memoirs. The last critical thing is his escape from a prison in Venice. While he stated that he drilled a hole into the ceiling with a piece of metal, the critics claim  he used bribery trough political connected friends. But other inmates had alot better connections than Chevalier and they couldn't escape the prison. Documents prove that the ceiling of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired after his stay. These points prove the possibility of Chevaliers version.
