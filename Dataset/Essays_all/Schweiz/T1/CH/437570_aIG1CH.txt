Memoir has changed during all this years. It is said that Switzerland is rich but at first you have to sell to get money. So rich is a word what meens you have much money but at first you don't have that much money so you have to do something to get this money. The Chevalier for example is also rich but he spent that much money for parties that he had to borrow some money. So the question is: is he still rich although he had to borrow money? 
Chavalier also wrote in the memoir that he had spoken with a famous writer named Voltaire. He wrote down the conversation many years later so many people don't believe that this conversation really happened.
Chavalier had written down that he escaped from the prison when he said he will. He used a piece of metal to make a hole. But there's nobody who sais that this is write. It's interesting to read something like this but you don't know if it's really true. It's possible that the jailers let Chevalier free from the prison.
The point is that there are many sides of view. Some people sais that the whole memoir is imagined and other people think that this writing is true. But nobody is really true what the truth is. The memoir is many years ago so there are no people who still lives from this time who could say whats right.
