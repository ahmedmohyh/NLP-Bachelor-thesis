The text questions the correctness of the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt. Has he really written down memories from his real life, or had he lied to make his life seeming more exciting?
Firstly no memoir can't be fully correct, because no one's memories refere perfectly with the reality.
However the text questions the liquidity of the Chevalier in Switzerland. Well there are many reasons to explain why he had to borrow money. At this time he couldn't just go to the bank and take money from his account. He had to wait until cash arrived. And while he had to wait, he still had the desire to gamble and to make party. To fulfill his wishes he lend money from a friend, instead of waiting till new cash arrived.
Of course it's impossible to remember several conversations correctly after a few years. But imagine you've written down every thing you remeberd from it in the evening after. Well he said he did. But he didn't only say it, it's as well confirmed from some people living around him, saying they've often seen him walking around with the notes.
A third life mark in his life questioned about its correctness is his adventerous escape from a notorious prison in Venice. For many people it's not that easy to imagine making a hole in the ceiling with a simple piece of steel. The explanation that he just offered a bribe to the jailers seems more logical. But as a matter of facts the ceiling of his prison room had to be repaired after his escape. Why should they've done it with no reason?  As well there were prisoners much wealthier than he was, and no one of them escaped.
As a conclusion there are many well supported evidences about his memoir, but all of them seeming unlogical with the arguments supporting the correctness of the memoir.
