The audio claims that the memoir is pretty accurate. It takes of the critics from the text and try to explain why it`s correct what he write. The first critic with Chevaliers wealth in Switzerland was that how could he be wealth and have to borrow money. The audio said instead that he spended a lot of money at parties and this needs a lot of money. So he sells stuff and had to wait for his money. But in this period he also wants to go to parties so he had to borrow the money. In the second critics it said that nobody can remember the exact conversation after years. The audio said instead that Chavalier writes the whole conversation every evening after the meeting down in his diary. And his witness can confirm that he uses this diary to write the memoir. So there is a logic explenation for the exact conversations. To his escape from the prison in Venice in the audio it said that in this prison were prisoners with much better political connections, which weren`t bribed to free them. And the audio claims that the room in which Chevalier was had to be repaired soon after his escape. So there is evidence that the way he wrote the story might be correct.
