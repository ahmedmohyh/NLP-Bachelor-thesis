As in every other intressting story there are also in this story a lot of critics. In this Essay I will analyze this aspects that are critiziced based on a presentation i heard.
whealthy or not ? 
As the text says the Chevalier had to borrow some money but is a prove that he was poor ? No, it is not because in this time it was normal for rich people who went to partys and gamble that they sometimes had to borrow money and wait until they get their own money. But that does not mean that the chevalier was poor.
Are the conversations noticed fictional or not ?
It is a fact that the Chevalier met Voltaire but critics say that the memoir of the Chevalier were written and released years later so this captured conversations were invennted. But a lot of people say that he wrote down each conversation each evenig after the meeting with Voltaire.
Prisonbreak yes or no ?
Critics say that Chevalier had a lot of important friends in the politics so he got released be the gouvernement. But in the papers of the prison there is written that they had to renovate the ceilling after the Chevalier got free. And why should they renovate the ceilling if the Chevalier did not escape.
So in the end it is impossible to say what is true and was invented. Because both point of view seems true. What I can say is that something must be true about the story because otherwise I would not write this text. And if this story is just invented then I have to say that it is a really good story.
