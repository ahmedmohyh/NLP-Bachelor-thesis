Chevalier de Seingalt was a rich man according to his memoir he left behind. Though critics aren't as sure about its accuracyanymore since he borrowed money from a merchant. The land he owned and had to sell before he could use the money to gamble and party could explain this claim. The memoir gives us facts about conversations between the famous writer Voltaire and Chevalier which had been written down many years after they actually got together. Friends of Chevalier can approve that he took notes after every conversation with Voltaire which would made them indeed valuable. How he could escape from a prison in Venice just using a piece of metal is truly an exciting story to tell which raises doubts that it actually had happened. Since there were several other prisons in the same jail at that time with powerful friends and that the roof got repaired shortly after his escape would support his story and would make it to a historical important source.
