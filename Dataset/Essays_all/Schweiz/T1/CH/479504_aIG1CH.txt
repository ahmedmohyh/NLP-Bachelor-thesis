The text and the audio is about Chevalier de Seingalt. He lived from 1725 until 1798 and in his last days he wrote memoirs about his life. His memoirs are valuable because of its content. He knew a lot of famous people he wrote about for example Voltaire.Chevalier himself was rich and according to his memoirs he had a pretty adventerous life and this fact is actually the main problem about his memoirs because there are critics that says his memoirs can't be right. But there are also people who believe this text is totally reliable and accurate.

The first argument that people critizied is that Chevalier wasn't rich because he lent money by a Swiss merchant. But there's an argument that says he actually just borrowed the money because he was waiting on his money he would get from others.

The second critic was that he couldn't know the exact conversation he had with Voltaire. But others says he wrote everything down at the same night he had the conversation with.

Last but not least the third argument against the accuracy of this text was that he didn't escaped the prison. The critics says he had powerful friends who get him out there in a legal way. But there is an argument which says that there exist a document who proves he escaped from the prison in Venice.

In the end there are as many arguments which says the text is accurate as arguments which says the text isn't accurate.
