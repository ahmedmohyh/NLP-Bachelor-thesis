The Chevalier de Seingalt who lived in the 18th century,wrot a memoir about his life. But some critics say that he made his story more glamorous as it really was. So he wrote that he was in switzerland and spend much money on parties and gambling. But critics say that he wasn't rich, because he needed to borrow all the money. But on the other hand, there was a presentation in which was said, that the Chevalier may have borrowed the money because he had to wait for his money to come and payed it back later on, and this mustn't mean that he wasn't rich. but there was another point which the critics are skeptical about.
The Chevalier wrote that he has escaped from prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. The critics say that he had some connections and probably was offered a bribe. But in the presentation was mentioned that others with bether connections dedn't escape and that the prison had to repair the ceiling.
