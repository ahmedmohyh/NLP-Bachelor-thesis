Chavalier de Seingalt, born in 1725 was a important person in history but at the same time contreversial. He often claimed things , that happend in his life, wich were then claimed to be false. He claimed that while he was living in switzerland, he was a wealthy man, the critics however claim the exact opposite. They said that he acctually had to borrow from other people, but the truth is that back in the days, one nedded time for the money to be converted and while Chavalier had to wait, he had indeed borrowed some from the Swiss merchant, but he wasn't poor. The second thing people don't believe him is the accurancy of hi conversation with Voltaire. In his memoir he wrote down, the conversation he had with Voltaire at some point. He wrote is very detailed that some people thought i was made up and of course a lie. But people found out that he indeed had writen it down an that it was not a lie, becasue Chavalier was known to write many converstaion down, that he had with people. The third claim that Chavalier made was that he escaped prison in Venice. Critics of course said that it was impossible for him to do that, because other prisoners who had more power than Chavalier, weren't able to escape. But sources claim that after Chavalier had fled the prison, the ceiling of his cell had to be repared, wich proofs that he did esscapeof his prison cell.
Chavalier was a man who expirienced some great thing in his life, that for some people is absolutely impossible. That is why some don't belive how great his life was and called him a lair. Even though his life really was great.
