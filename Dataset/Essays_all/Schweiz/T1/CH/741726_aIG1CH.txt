Chevalier wrote a memoir which had information that somehow seemed doubtfull. Starting off with him having met Voltaire and them having a conversation , which he could somehow recall several years later, didnt`t seem to make a lot of sense. Despite that fact, there are critics which point out, that the memorie is possible to capture these conversations accurately. However there is evidence, that he had taken notes every single time they conversed, so it is indeed possible, that they had an accurate conversation. 
Then his escape, by using a metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, followed. They claim that it must have been impossible for him to escape the Venetian prison and that the only possible way to explain his escape would have been his politically well -connected friends, who offered a bribe to Chevalier`s jailers.Allthogh this might seem convincing, there are goverment documents, proving that after his escape they had to repair the ceiling of the roof, and that however does seem to make sense if he escaped that way. 
Then him living in Switzerland, and being wealthy but still somehow borrowing money didn`t seem to make a lot of sense. Because why should a wealthy man have to borrow money off others? The reason though why he did this, was because he had to wait for his money to get delivered.
