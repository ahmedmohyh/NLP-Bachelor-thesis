The lecturer had a different oppion of the memoir than the points mentioned in the text. For example she was said that Chevalier wasn't poor and only borrowed money because he was waiting for his other money to arrive because he had sold things. Due to the time waiting he had no money so he just went to a merchant to borrow some. The text however said that he was poor and had to borrow money because he didn't have any money.
Also it was mentioned that after talking to Voltaire he wrote down points of their conversation every evening. Then he kept his notes and used them to write his memoir a friend which lived with him confirmed this. The text says that it was not possible to have such detailed conversations in written form because the conversation had taken place years before. So it was said that he had invented new points to make his memoir more interesting to read.
Finally the lecturer said that it was true that he had escaped the prison in Venice using a piece of metal and she said that this was proven because the goverment had to repair the roof of Chevaliers cell shortly after he had escaped. Also she said it was not likely that he had bribed his jailers because other men had more power and hadn't bribed them either. The text however said the exact opposite it said that Chevalier was probably released after bribing and that it was highly unlikely that he had escaped with the piece of metal and then climbing through the roof.
To sum it up the lecturer disagreed with every point used in the text.
