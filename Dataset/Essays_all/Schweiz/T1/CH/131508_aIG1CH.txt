In the lecture the professor explains, why Chevaliers memoire is a reliable source of information. She proves the critical points, that are mentioned in the text, wrong:

First of all,yes, Chevalier was known for his gambling and his glamorous lifestyle. And in the case, that he actually borrowed great sums from this particular Swiss merchant, it was only because it took time to convert the assets he got from his gambling, into money. This proves, that he didn't need the money, because he was poor, but that he only needed it to restart the gambling-cycle.

On the second hand, the professor tells us about how it was confirmed by family members, that Seingalt wrote everything down after each conversation he had with the writer Voltaire. And not, as claimed in the text, many years later.  

And third, why Chevaliers escape from this certain italian prison isn't so unlikely: 
There were documents found about how the guards had to fix the ceiling of Chevaliers cell. This in fact proves, that he had to escape from prison all by  himself. And not with help from some jailers. Also there were many more captives in the Venetian prison, who had way more influential friends than Chevalier did.
