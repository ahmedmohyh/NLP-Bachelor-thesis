Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) memoirs are often used as historical source about the European society in eighteenth century. But the opinios about the accuracy of the memoir differ a lot. Some citics belive that all the events that he mentioned are correct and happend the way he said wether other critcs are a lot more sceptical about him. They belive in the theory, that de "faked" a lot of memoires just too become more popular. But let us build our own opinion about Chevalier. 

One of the most talked about happenings of Chevalier, is his lifestyle in Switzerland. In his notes he wrote, that he were really wealthy and could live just how he wanted too. But other sources showed that he often had to borrow money from other rich people. Borrowing money isnt what people do with a lot of money, right?

Right, but people who always had to wait a few days till the money arrives, had to borrow money. And that was the case of de Seingalt. He often went to parties and gambling so he often spent all of his money in a few days. So the other days, when he had to wait for his money arrived, he just borrowed money like evreyone else would do. 

This exaple is only one of the happenings where the critics differ in opinions. The conversations with Volontaire and his escape out of prison in Vince are for example also can be layed out in two diffrent ways. What the memoires of Chavalier shows, is that sources from passed times, can always be wrong and that we have to be careful of what to belive. Just always look at more that just one source, so you can be sure that what you are learing ist correct.
