The text above refers towards the concerns about the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt since, as said by the text, the actions of the Chevalier did not seem logic or true to most of its readers. However, the lecture we just listened to explains many different arguements why the memoirs of the Chevalier are reliable and accuarte. 
First of all, the Chevalier was known for his great events and amousing parties, yet he had to support his life style by borrowing money from a Swiss merchant. Experts claim that because of this he could not possibly be as wealthy as he says. Nethertheless, our lecturer explains that he was wealthy indeed, but due to his he had to wait a certain period of time until the money came to him. So, in order to finance his glamorous events he had to borrow money from  the Swiss merchant. 
Moreover, the doubts about the memoirs of Voltaire are immense. Although there are no doubts about Chevalier having met the famous writer Voltaire, experts still claim that the accuracy of the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire is not confirmed. Yet, there is prove that the Chevalier wrote down everything everyday he remembered of the conversation Voltaire and he had.
And to top it all, the break out from the Venician prison. While experts claim the Chevalier could have asked one of his many politically important friends in order to escape from prison, the lecturer talks about a document which shows that only a few days after the break out, the roof of this certain cell the Chevalier stayed in had to be repaired. 
Shortly said: there are many proves that confirm the accuracy of the geat memoirs written by Chevalier de Seingalt.
