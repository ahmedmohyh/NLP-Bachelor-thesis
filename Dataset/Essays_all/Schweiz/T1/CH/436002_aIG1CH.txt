In the text there were three main arguments, which tried to prove that the Chevalier invented the events in his memoirs. In her presentation, the women tries to find reasons why these doubts are not true and argues that the Chevalier was honest when writing his memoir, which makes it historicaly accurate. 
She starts off by saying that just because you borrow money, you don't have to be poor. She argues that he was a rich man, living in switzerland, and had to borrow money after he spend lot's on parties, which he paied back. This wasn't uncommon for the time in switzerland. 
Then she states that the Chevalier made notes after each conversation with Voltaire. His family also confirmed that he used these notes, which he had made earlier on in life, to write his memoir is accurate as possible. 
The last talking point is the Chevaliers escape from the Venetian prison. She argues here, that other prisoners had even more powerful friends but didn't escape. Because of this she thinks that the Chevalier told the truth about his daring escape. The day after he had fled, the roof of his former prison cell had to be repaired for unkown reasons. It probably had some connection to his escape from the prison. With these contra-arguments she wants to show that the Chevaliers memoirs are a reliable source for the history of the european society.
