1. The Chevalierwho was actually a very rich men needed to borrw money from a swiss merchant. The people who criticed the story of the chevalier said that it doesn't make sense that the rich Chevalier needed to borrow money. The counter argument is that he spended so much money in switzerland so he had to borrow some money. In this time it was impossible to have so much money with you because there weren't creditcards and stuff. So the swiss merchant borrowed him the money because he knew he will get it back.

2. The critics complain that the memoir's from the conversation with Voltaire can't be accurate. He wrote them years later down. But there are also simple counter arguments. The people said that he took notes from his conversations with Voltaire right after their meeting. So if Chevalier kept this notes for years it is absolutly possible that he knew exactlywhat they talked about.

3. The escape from the prison in Venice. The critics say that he didn't had to escape from the prison on this way because he got friends in Venice with much influence. The counter argument is that their were people in jail with much more friends than Chevalier. So maybe these friends just couldn't help you to get out of jail.

Chevalier is probably a good author. Sometimes he said untrue details but all in all there's a good possiblity that his memoir's are true.
