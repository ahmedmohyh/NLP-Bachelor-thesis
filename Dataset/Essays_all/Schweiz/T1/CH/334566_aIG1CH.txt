Chevalier de Sengalt (1725-1798) has written a memoire about his life and adventures. This didn`t seem very interesting but nowadays it`s a very important historical source. It was said that the memoire is not correct in every detail. One adventure of Chavelier was going to switzerland. He was very rich and spended the most of his money on parties and gambling. But all of the sudden he had to borrow money. It was said in the presentation that he had to borrow money because he was waiting for his own money and that would have meant that he wasn`t poor. But he didn`t borrow just a small amount of money from an Swiss merchant. The sums were very high. Another example is when he met Voltaire. He wrote the memoire many years after he had met Voltaire. Some people say that after meeting Voltaire he wrote everything down he could remember. But in the memoire were exact sentences which Voltaire should have said.
Chavalier also escaped from a notorious prison in Venice with a piece of Metal. He made a hole with that in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. The ceiling had to be repaired after that. But critics claim that he just invented that part. It would have been to dangerous to do it the way Chavalier did it. It`s more likely that someone of his politically well-connected friend had offered a bribe.
