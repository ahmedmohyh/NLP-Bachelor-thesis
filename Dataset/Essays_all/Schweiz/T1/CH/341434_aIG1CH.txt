Chevailer's memoir

Chevalier's history in confront of critics. Did he push his story to make it look more glamourous or is he just telling the truth?

The woman in the presentation, said that it is impossible to create an accurate and perfect memoir, but that the most things can still be true. In the text critics say that it is not possible that he was rich, because he had to borrow some money of a Swiss merchant. Only because he borrowed money doesn't mean that he didn't have wealth. In switzerland he had a lot of parties and gambling. For having money you need to sell properties and during this time he was living with wealth and having fun. So maybe he had to wait that this money was converted and so he borrowed some money to live his high standard life. 
Another critic is that it is impossible to write down a conversations like Voltaire and Chevalier's so detailled like Chevalier did. It is difficult to remember after so many years what you said in an conversation. But Chevalier could have taken notes during his conversation with Voltaire. His witness also said that Chevalier always consulted his notes and wrote everything down. So it is possible that he consulted his notes about the conversation with Voltaire to wirte it in the memoire.
The last critic is about Chevaliers escape of a prison in Venice. The critics say that he was politically well-connected and had a lot of connections with important people so that maybe a jailer was bribed to free him. But documents say that there were a lot of other more wealthy and well-connected people in this prison and they never were able to escape. Another thing is that documents say that the ceiling, where Chevalier's prison room was needed to be repared because there was a hole. So why shoulndn't he be escaped when there also was a hole that had to be repared?

There are a lot of doubts about his memoire but also facts which can confirm what he said.
