Often memoirs aren't completly true but in this memoir the chevalier things got some critics. His life wasn't that interesting to write a good memoir so it makes sense that part of the stories are invented. in the memoir is written, that he was whealthy during his stay in Switzerland but critics argue that he borrowed money. He has spent a lot of money just for parties. 
Another point is that we used many quotes in his memoir and it's not possible to know all of it many years after it actually happenend. And he didn't record them or something like that.
The last critical point is that many other well-connected persons were in this prison at this time and no one else could escape just because of the connections.
