The text was telling us about Chevalier, that he recorded the conversation with Voltaire, in the presentation she also told us that he wrote down the whole conversation with him. In the presentation she said that he has written it down to remember what they have spoken for years, but in the text critics told that can`t be possible because it was written many years after the conversation, and it`s impossible to rememer exactly the whole conversation and the exact phrases.
In the presentation she told that he was escaped from the prison. The text tould us also about the escape from the prison, but they dind`t think that he could escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole. They think more that he could escape by the jailers because they were bribed to free him. The Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered this.
