Critics are sceptical of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt because some events seem invented or glorified. Some of these critics seem uninformed of historical facts concerning Chevalier. For example Chevaliers lifestyle in switzerland. He claims to be very wealthy in his memoir but evidence shows that he borrowed alot of money from a swiss merchant. Critics argue that a rich and wealthy person does not need to borrow money and therefore was not as rich as he claims to be. But other evidence suggests that most of his wealth was land and assets which takes time to sell. He was spending alot of cash on parties and gambling. It makes perfect sense for him to borrow money because he was spending money faster than he would get it from selling his assets. Another event critics are sceptical about is the accuracy of the conversations with Voltaire recorded in the memoir. Critics claim that Chevalier could not possibly remember exact phrases from the conversation. What they do not know is that the Chevalier very likely captured the entire conversation in a notebook the same day he had it. Historical sources claim that the Chevalier often used notes and diaries while writing his memoir.
The third controversial event was his escape from a prison in venice. His memoir states that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Most critics think that he just bribed the guards since he had some influental friends in venice. They do not know that other people with alot more influental friends were kept in the same prison and never escaped.
