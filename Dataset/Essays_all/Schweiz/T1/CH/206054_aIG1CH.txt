First of all the text iswritten out  a negative perspective, because even thought the text in the beginning says that Chevalier's memoire has become a valuable historical source about European, it mainly has listed the things critics have saidand how they think the his memoire is not a reliable source. Meanwhile the presentation has a positive view on it and tries to explain the things that are questioned by the critics. For example the first argeument is that he claims to be wealthy while living in Switzerlandmeanwhilerecntly aevidence hassurfaced that he borrowed money from a Swiss mechant. The woman who is presenting the presentation comes up with the arguement that he was a buissnessman and needed a few days till his things were sold and that is the reason he got the money after a few days, The second arguement the critics  point on to is that he wrot down his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire years after he hd had the converstaion with him. But in the presentation there is claimed that he always took notes at night from the day that had just passedand also the had people who assured that he has notes while writing his memoire!
