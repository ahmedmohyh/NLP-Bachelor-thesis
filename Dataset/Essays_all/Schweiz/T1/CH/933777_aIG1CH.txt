Right at the beginning she summarised a little bit, like in the text, she told that he wrote a very detailed memoir of his life. She told about three points. The first one was, that he was very wealth while living in switzerland and that he spent much money on parties and gambling. I think she said, that he got the money by selling his house. But in the text it says,that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. And even if he had much money, he would not have needed to borrow money.
The second point was, that he wrote down very detailed conversations with a famous writer. Critics are not doubting him for not meeting Voltaire, the writer. But they say, it's impossible to remember exact conversations because he wrote down the text many years later. 
The last thing was the escaping out of a prison in Venice, Italy. She said,that he escaped with a little piece of metal. Like in the text. But she said, that most critics think, that he had contacts and that he could have escaped with the help of them. THis sounds also not possible because other prisoners had better and much stronger contacts and they couldn't escape from it. In the text it says, that it would be more realistic that the Chawalier bribed the jailers to free him. He had political friends in Venice who could offer a bribe. So he had very powerful contacts.
