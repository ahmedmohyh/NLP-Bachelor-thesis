The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, while very important historically, is not 100 percent accurate, critics claim. They mainly mention three points in which they doubt that Chevalier de Seingalt did not add a couple of his own ideas to make his life seem more interesting.

Firstly, they mention that Chevalier claimed to be very wealthy, but while living in Switzerland he had to borrow a lot of money from merchants. While this is true, you have to assess the type of wealth Chevalier possesed, which was mainly in form of goods such as houses. To actually liquidate his goods he had to sell them and until he got money he had to take up some loans.
The second point often mentioned is that his conversations with famous writer Voltaire could not possibly be accurate, as the conversations took place long before they were released in book form. However Chevalier used to always take notes of his conversations and many witnesses reported that he often consulted his notes.
Lastly, critics doubt that Chevalier truely escaped from a prison in Venice by destroying the cell's roof. They think that it is more likely that he used some of his powerful friends to bribe himself out of prison. This is not likely, namely because there were other more powerful peole held in prison who could not bribe their way out of it and it was mentioned in some documents that his prison cell's roof had to be rebuilt after he escaped.

To sum it all up it is likely that Chevalier's stories were true, all of the criticism can be rationalised and nothing seems impossible.
