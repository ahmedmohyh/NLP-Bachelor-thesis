Tn the listening were several aspekt showen why the text I've had to read can't be true to 100%.
In my essay I'd like to show you some exemples why it can't be true.
 
In the source there is written that Chevalier de Seingalt lived in Switzerland and had e great time, that he gave out a lot of money on partys and gambeling. That can be true but he also said that he was very wealthy. Of cours he wasn't a poor man but you mustn't be rich to live a nice live an go to casinos for gambeling. 
A other aspekt why the text can't be true in all his details is do following one. In the text is writen that the Chevailer has escaped from the prison in Venice. For escaping from the prison you must have some good friends who help you to can escape from this location. Ather prisoners had more powerfull friends than Chavalier had. So in this point I'm in the same opinion with the source. It's written in the story because it's more intressting to read this text.
An 3. aspect is that the storx were written down a view years later and it is impossible that you or he can remember Dialogs one to one.
