In the speech she said, that Chevalier were invited by many of people to parties and other events. But you need some money to go there, you have to be a part of this society to be invited, so Chevalier wasn't really poor. In the text they wrote that he was a poor man who had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. But he wasn't really poor. He had some people or friends who gave him his money. They were waiting to give him this money whenever hed needed some. 
The second point was the critic about the conversations with Voltaire. Some of the critics says, that they have never met each other, so the conversations are lies. But the speecher told something about some notices of Chevalier. So he wrote down everything after the conversations with Voltaire that he could remebered. As the speeker said, there must be some conversations and meetings because there are some notices. 
The last point that the critics were also skeptical about, were the situation in the prison in Venice. They are not sure about the escape. Some of them critized the story that Chevalier should have used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and then climbed through the roof. They think that Chevalier had well-connected friends which could have offered a bribe. The speeker haven't critized the escape with the hole in the ceiling. She had the argument, that the ceiling from the prison had to be repared. So there must be a reason for this reparation.
