Critics are sceptical about the memoir of the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire. He write everything down in his memoir after the conversation, so he can't remember the details of the conversation very well. But no memoir can be correct.
The second point is, that Chevalier escape from the prison in Venice in italy by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling so he can escape. But critics say that other prisioniers have more powerful friends who can help them to escape, but they couldn't escape.
