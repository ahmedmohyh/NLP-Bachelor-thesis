The text and the presentation both discuss the credibility of of the long memoir from the Chevailer de Seingalt, which is still used and seen as a historical source. The problem is that a memoir can never perfectly and objectively show us the situation of the past, because of the writers own influence to the text and his memory. It is said, that the Chevalier invented many things in his memoir like the escape from the prison or the big partys where should have spent all his money. 

The author thinks it can't be true that he escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through it. But it is known from the presentation that after his breakout the roof of his room had to be fixed. And other prisonners had much more powerful friends and didn't make it out of the prison. 

For the fact that his memoir isn't a reliable source because he wrote down the conversations long after they were made can't be true from the view of the presentation. It is known that the Chevalier regularly wrote journals and always took notes from his conversations. 

And finally the many parties which he is telling from and the wealth he lived in. We can take from the presentation that he had to sell things from his property to get his money and as this can't be done in a few seconds, he had to borrow some money from the bank.
