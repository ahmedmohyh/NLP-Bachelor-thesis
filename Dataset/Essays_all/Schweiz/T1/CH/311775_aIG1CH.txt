Chevalier
In the text it it is wrotten that Chevalier de Seingalt is a very rich person. But in the oral exercice it is said that he was a poor person. 
He was a rich person that is the reason why he didin't need money from a Swiss merchant. Also he not have needed to borrow money. But in the oral history it is said that he was a poor person. He has a lot of bars in Switerland and he worked there for win money.
In boths exercises he was in prison. He was a prisoner. But in the text it is written he was climbing to the roof because he want to go out. In the oral history that is not so.
In the text it is wrotten that he rememberd exact phrases from extened conversations held many years earlier. But in the oral exercice it said that he write all things that he can remembered. They doesn't say he remembered exact phrases!
