First of all,we know very good that the Chevalier wasnt poor at all. He spent huge amounts of money for parties and gabling. The only reason why he had to borrow money is because he had to wait for his already borrowed money from another person. As said he spent much money on fun things. So because he couldnt wait for the incomming money he decided to borow the missing money.
For the second thing it must be said that the critics only argue like this because they don`t know the whole story. Sure its quite difficult, not to say impossible to remember a whole conversation that took place many years ago. But the whole story is that the Chevalier wrote theirconversation down the same evening it happened. So he couldeasily write the conversation again down also 5 years later.
And the last criticism is not that wrong; it`s only used in the wrong context. The critics claim that the Chevalier payed money to get freed. But that cant be true because in the 18. century it wasnt anymore that popular to pay money to get free. Also we have today the writings of the prison guards which prove that the Chevalier digged a hole into the ceiling and escaped through this.
All these missunderstandings and criticisms happened because of an anvantage of knowledge which the people had who knew that the Chevalier was right.
