In the text it is said that Chevaliers texts are used as a historical source but in the text a lot of people ciriticise the memoires of Chevalier. In the english presentation a women says that all of Chevalier's texts were correct or mostly correct and so she told that the memoires are reliable.
The first point in the presentation were that Chevalier wasn't poor during the time he lived here in Switzerland. He had a lot of money but while he was waiting to get his money from gambling he had to borrow some to live.
The second argument were about his time with Voltaire. In the text it is said that Voltaire and Chevalier had met a long time before Chevalier started to write his memoires down and because of that it isn't possible to know exactly what they have talked. But in the presetation it was said that Chevalier always tried to remeber what they bot have talked and he also wrote it down. So it was possible for him to remember what he and Voltaire had talked.
The last argument ist about the escape out of the prison through the rooftop. According to the tet this isn't possible and that Chevaliers influence had got him free. But in the presentation it was said that in the same prison it had other prisoners with even more powerful friends and they couldn't escape. And it is reported that the rooftop had to be repaired back in Chevalier's days.
