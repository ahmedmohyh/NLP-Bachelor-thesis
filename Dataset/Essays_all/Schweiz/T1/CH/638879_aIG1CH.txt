The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life. To make his life seem more attractive he disorted or invented many events. 

The main advange is that he had been very rich and would not have needed to borrow money. He really loved to spend money in Switzerland for parties and gambling. In his Mermoire he wrote that he was during Switzerland very wealthy and had to borrow some money thats kind of weird because critics thinks he did not really needths money.

Moreover he wrote that he met Voltaire during night but Critics said that ther was not any meeting between them both. they think he invent that because he wrote the conversation after many years ago. That is plenty of time and it is difficult to remeber the exact phrases.

At last he said that he broke out of n Italian prison. This is also very weird because nobody instead he was able to break out and he had not that many concetion. Critics think that his jailer bribed to free him.

In conclusion I personally would say that the Chavalier invent some things to make his mermoire more intressting for the readers.
