Chevalie de Seingalt wrote his hole life down. Now the people are alot talking about him and his life, because he met alot of famous people(kings, etc.) He lived in Switzerland, and this time he made alot of glamurous partys. But first he hadn't any money, so he had to borrow some. In Switzeland he met this guy called Voltaire, he wrote the hole conversation down. There is also a story said that he was in Venice in the prison but escaped. Not alot of people believe that because he didn't the contacts for this. In the prison were alot of other people which had the contacts, but didn't escaped. It's more likely that his politic friends take him out of the prison. There a ig mistery about him because people don't believe that he could remind a hole conversation that's just impossible. It's more likely that he just wrote down it that way he wonna have it. But at the same time his memoirs are a valuable historical source about Europe in the 18. century. How ever it is important for the history, if it is true or not. We never wiljl find out that. 

I think that not the hole story have to be true, but it is still important, and can give us more specific information about life in 18. century. I think that he might didn't had this conversation that way, but simular. Maybe his wasn't that exciting but still not that bad.
