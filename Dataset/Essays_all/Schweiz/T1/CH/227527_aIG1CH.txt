In the lecture, it is meantioned, that Chevalier was a rich but had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, in the end it seems as if Chevalier was a poor guy. This stands in conflict with the listening, because there it says that Chevalier was rich, spent a lot of money but had to wait for a loan, to even spend more money. 
The margin between text and listening starts to get really big, when it comes to his conversations with Voltaire. In the text, it seems as they are not quite sure about if Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed, they rather disagree. They also complained about the fact that it is impossible, that he had written everything as accurate as it is down. But in the listening, it is mentioned that Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember the evening after the conversation. It would be possible.
In the end, there is another conflict. The lecture claims that Chevalier did not escape as he had written in his memoir. They claim that he could only escape because of his political connections. The listening also mentions, that Chevalier had some political connections, and also that they were quite high, but that there also were other prisoners with even higher connections and they were not bribed to free them. It also says, that his cell had to be repaired a short time after he had escaped, because there was a hole in the celling.
