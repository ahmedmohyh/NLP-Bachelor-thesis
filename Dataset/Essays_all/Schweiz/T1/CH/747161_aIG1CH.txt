In the presentation is said that Chevalier de Seingalt was poor. He tried to present his life as exciting and glamorous. But we read in the text that Chevalier is a really famous people. So he spent a lot of money to the parties and he is rich.
The second argument that Chevalier wrote his memories about his conversations with Voltaire is that he wrote every night his memory in a book. So it was possible to write after some years aboute the conversations. But in the text, there is some people who don't believe that CHevalier has such a good memory to write the exact coversation.
I think that the text has not the same arguments with the presentation. In the presetation is said that Chevalier escaped the prison beacuse he had politically well-connected friends in Venice. But it's not said that he used e piece of metal to make a hole in the ceilling. So he was bribed but not in this way.
