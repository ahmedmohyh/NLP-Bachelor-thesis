"Chevalier "

In the text critics say that the chevalier couldn't be rich, because he lent money from a Swiss merchant. But in the oral presentation they said that he didn't have to be a poor man, just because he borrowed money. Maybe he needed the money urgently and couldn't wait for his own cash, but he was waiting for it 
Another disagreement between the presentation and the text was, the conversation between Voltaire and the Chevalier. In the text they say that it isn't possible,    that the chevalier remembers exact phrases after many years. But in in the presentation they say that the Chevalier has written the conversation down after their conversation. 
The last disagreement ist thatin the text they say that he escaped from the prison in venice because of goods connection with friends who helped him. But in the oral presentation they say that this couldn't be possible because the others prisoner have also good conections and they couldn't escape. And the ceiling from the Chevalier had to be repared after his escapement. 
In fact the text say that the chevalier was a lyier and that he wanted that the people admire his live. But the presentation tell us that they think it's possipel what  the Chevaler writed down.
