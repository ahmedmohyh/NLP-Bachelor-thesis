Some critics are sceptical about the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir. But there are reasonable explanations that speak against the arguments of the critics.

Critics don't believe his story about the time he passed in Switzerland, where he spend a lot of money for parties and gambeling, because he had to borrow money from a merchant. But just because Chevalier had to borrow money, it doesn't mean he was poor. He probably ran out of cash and because it took a while to have acces to his own money, he had to borrow some.

They don't believe he had such conversations with him, but aqaintances of Chevalier claim that he made a lot of notes during his life which he also used to write his memoirs. That's the reason why his conversations with Voltaire are very detailed.

They think he managed to organize a bribery with the other prisoners to escape, because he knew a lot of people with a high position who could have helped him. But in his story he tells that he made a whole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. In the records of the prison it says that a whole in the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired.
