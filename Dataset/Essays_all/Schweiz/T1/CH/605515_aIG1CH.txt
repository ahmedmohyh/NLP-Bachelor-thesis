The text is about a controversial figure named Chevalier de Seingalt who wrote a long memoir about his parts of his life and theadventures and experience he made. Critics couldn't understand why Chevalier needed to borrow money if he had really been as rich as he wrote in his memoir. But the point is, Chevalier spent to much money on parties and gambling in Switzerland. But Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries on earth, people should know that. The fact is, he wasn't poor! 
Secondly Chevalier made notices about a conversation with Voltaire. They met and conversed a long time ago. Chevalier wrote in his memoir about this conversation with Voltaire. The phrases were written as the conversation had been yesterday. The phrases were so exact that people didn't know what was the truth.
The Chevalier also wrote about an escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. He hadn't as much friends as others in this prison and his cell was totally destroyed after he escaped.
The audio speech tells things about Chevalier more positiv than the text about him.
