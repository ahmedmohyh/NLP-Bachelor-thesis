No one could ever prove the absolute accuracy of the Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. But while some people criticize the reliability of his words, others have found answers to refute them. 
One argument against him might be that although the Chevalier stated in the memoir that, while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, a Swiss merchant lent him quite a bit of money. However, this does not mean that he wasn't rich. It is possible that he was just waiting for his cash and therefore had to borrow money from someone.
The second conversation point is that the Chevalier wrote down very exact sentences that he and Voltaire should have exchanged. The critivs argue that it is impossible for him to remember the phrases so accurately, but who says he did? The Chevalier says in the memoir that he took precise notes every night after talking to Voltaire, and his friends also stated that he often consulted his notes.
And the last big issue is that his spectacular escape from the Venetian prison seems a bit too spectacular to be true - which doesn't mean it isn't, though. It is argued that he had politically well-connected friends in Venice and that his jailers were probably bribed to free him. But there were a lot of fellow prisoners of his with even more powerful friends, and they never managed to be bribed out. And on top of that: If the Chevalier didn't escape by breaking a hole into the ceiling, then why do Venetian papers state that a ceiling in that same prison had to be repaired?

The accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir might be arguable, but is any memoir ever absolutely truthful? Can we - with no doubt whatsoever - even rely on our own memories?
