In the text, the main topic is about the critism on the Chevalier's memoire. In the listening part, they want to proof, that the critics are wrong.
Both parts are including the adventures of the Chevalier. In the text, they critizise the memoir of the chevalier, because they doubt the accuracy of the memoir.
Some reasons for the doubting are explained. The first one is talking about, that the Chevaliers claimed, that he was very wealthy, during the time he was living in Switzerland, but it is known, that he actually needed to borrow his money, and therefore had not been rich. But the second part explains, that he wasn't poore, so that he needed to borrow money. They say, that he borrowed money and payed it back after a certain time.
The second example is the conversation with voltaire. The critics say, that it is not possible to keep every single phrase in mind until the Chevalier oficially wrote it down many years later. The other side is convinced, that the Chevalier made notes during the conversation with Voltaire, and kept them. until he wrote it down.
The last example was about his prison escape. The Chevalier claims that he escaped by making a hole into the ceiling with a piece of metal. In the text, they believe, that the Chevalier escaped with the help of other prisioners. The "Pro-Chevaliers" say, that the needed to repair the ceiling of the prison after Chevalier's escape, and they think that fact is an evidence of his real prison escape.
