While the writer of the text tries to describe, that the famous Chevalier de Seingalt added some special events to make his memoir more exciting to read, the women in the text tries to verify these points with some historical aspects. 
The text says, that it is pretty mysterious that Chevalier had to borrow some money of his friend in Switzerland, even if he was a rich man. This argument is not right, because the Chevalier had to wait for his money so he had to borrow some of his rich friend. Both decribe, that the Chevalier spent a lot of money in Switzerland for parties.
The next aspect of the text was, that it could not be possible, that Chevalier was able to write down the exact conversation in his memoir, he had a couple of years ago. The women in the presentation tries to verify that Chevalier made some notes right after the conversation with Voltaire and used them for writing his memoirs. 
The last but not least point of the text is about the historical escape from a notorious prison in Venice. The memoirs say, that Chevalier de Seingalt destroied the ceilling and climed out of the roof. There are a lot of critics if this is really possible or not, but the fact, that after the escape the boss of the prison had to repaire the ceilling, makes a lot of doubts.
