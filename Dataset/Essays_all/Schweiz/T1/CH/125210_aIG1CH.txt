In the lecture I just heard, they were talking against this text. They started of with the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir. The text tells us about critics that have raised doubts about the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir. Where as the listening says, it is as accurate as it could be and that no memoir is totally correct. 
The second point was about his wealth. The text speaks about Chevalier allways claiming about his wealth while living in Switzerland. But that it is also known that he spend a great deal of money after borrowing it from a Swiss marchant. Further they say, that he couldn`t possibly be rich if he had to borrow money.
The listening in reverse is talking about him having a great deal of wealth in luxuries that he first had to change into cash.
Later on the text is talking about his conversation with Voltair that, for there opinion can`t be totally correct because he actually wrote it down many years afterwards. But the listening says, that he wrote down his conversation every evening, keeping them as close to reality as possible and just refering to his notes many years afterwards.
Now last but not least both sources talk about his escape from prison. Critics question it on a high level. Rather that he escaped his prison by making a hole in to the ceiling and climbing throug the roof, they think he was offered a bribe. According to the listening I heard this wasn`t quite possible. They say that there were many other imprisoners that had more powerfull friends and weren`t able to get a bribe. Also after Chevaliers fleeing they had to repair the ceiling in his cell. But why would they have had done this if his memoir wasn`t accurate.
