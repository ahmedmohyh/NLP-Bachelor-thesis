In the presentation they say that Chevaliers story is accurate, which is unlikely to read in the text given. The presentation always shut down the evidence which was given in the text. There are three examples.
 
First of all, they say that in Switzerland Chevalier spent a lot of money and when he had spent it he had to wait for more money to arrive, so he was not poor in the meantime. In the text it says that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant and was not as wealthy as it says in his memoir. 
Secondly, the conversations with Voltaire. In the presentation they tell that we can be pretty sure that Chavelier wrote down every conversation they made after having them. They even have people to confirm it. Altough these evidence, the text says that the conversation was written down many years after the conversation occured. So it is impossible for Chevalier to remember every little detail about the conversation he had with Voltaire. 
Thirdly, they have different opinions about Chevaliers escape from a Venetian prison. The text says that he escaped with the help of politically well-connected friends who offered him a bribe. But in the presentation it says that there were other jailers who had more friends in higher position and that there are gouvernement documents in which you can see that after the time of the escape they had to repair a ceiling. 

There are different kind of opinions about the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier. Some say it is accurate, some say no. Welle there are arguments on both sides and it is about you to make yourself an opinion.
