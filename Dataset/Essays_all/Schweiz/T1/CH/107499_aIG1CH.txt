They text claims that Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir. For example Chevalier wrote in the memoire that he was very wealthy while living in Switzerland and that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, but the text says that he borowed considerable sums of money ,so if Chevalier had been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. In the pressentation the women says that he spent so much money for parties and other things that at some point he didn't have money and must wait for his next money to arrive. In this time he borrowed money, but that doesnt mean that he is poor, because he only had to wait until his money arrived. Another claim is that he couldn't be possible to write the exact phrases of a conversation between him and Voltaire( a famous writer)  because he wrote the memoire a few months later. The presentation says that he always took notes a day after a conversation, so that he knew the exact phrases of the conversation between him and Voltaire. His wife later confirmed that.
