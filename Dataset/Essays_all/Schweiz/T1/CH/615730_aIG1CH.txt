There are three critics in the text about the accuracy of the memoir. In the oral presentation the speaker had doubts that the critics are right.

First, the speaker says that borrowing money from a Swiss merchant doesn't mean that someone is poor. Maybe Chevalier had his money somewhere else and had to borrow it to be able to give the parties. But if you borrow money, you normally plan to give it back soon. Also nobody gives you a lot of money if he doesn't know that you are very rich. 

Secondly, it is known that Chevalier made a lot of notices. He wrote down what Voltaire and he said in the conversations and kept these sheets over the years. So he was able to write down these conversations in his memoir with exact phrases.

Last, the speaker admits that of course Chevalier had a number of well-connected friends. But they wouldn't have been able to offer a bribe. Also the ceiling of the prison had been repared soon after Chevalier escaped. Why should the ceiling have been damaged? This shows that it is likely that Chevalier said the truth.
