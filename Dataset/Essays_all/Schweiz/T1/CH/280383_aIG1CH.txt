The Chevalier describes his life and adventures. He writes very beautiful about what happened to him, what he saw in his life, who he had met. But there are some critics that he didn't write exactly what happended to make his life seem more exciting than it really was. The Chavelier wrote about his life in Switzerland, that he was wealthy, rich and spent a lot of maney on parties and gambling. Now people can say that he didn't spend useful his money. But befor he could spend so much money, he had to work hard and wait for his money. The Chavelier also sayed that he saw and talked to the big and famous writer Voltaire, but anybody can say that's correct, because he wrote about this conversations many years later and the Chavelier couldn't remember exact phrases, sayed criticers. Escaping from the prison of Venetia seems not to be easy, but the Chavelier described his escape like an easy thing. He used a piece of metal and made a hole in the ceiling. Criticers didn't believe that, but after his escape, the police had to make a new room where the Chavelier lived, because of the hole in the ceiling. And if it was so easy, why would they had to make this room beautiful like before?
