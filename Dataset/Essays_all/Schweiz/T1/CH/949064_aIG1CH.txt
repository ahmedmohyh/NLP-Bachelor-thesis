The woman who made the presentation about the Chevalier talked about different points which are mentionned in the text. She explained why the critics are false.
The first point the woman talked about was, that borrowig money from other ritch people doesn't mean that the Chevalier was poor. She explained that sometimes you have to spend money before you can earn some new money, especially in gambling. The Cevalier spent a lot of money at gambling, and when he won, he often had to wait a few days until the earned money arrived. So he borrowed money from other people for that days when he was out of money. 
The second point the woman talked about was, that criticers mentionned that it is impossible that the Chevalier remembered exactly all the sentences famous people said to him. But the woman says that he often took notices right after he talked to those people, and he kept them. In his memoire he reffers to his noteces wich he took right after talkig to the people. 
The last point the woman talked about was, that there was a proove that the Chevalier escaped from the prison. After he left the prison, the ceiling of his room had to be repaired.
