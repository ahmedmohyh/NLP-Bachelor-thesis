While critics claim, that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725 - 1798) is distorted and that he has invented many events, there are also some evidents that prove that some of these claims might be false. 
First of all, no memoir is completely accurate. They all contain at least personal feelings, which the writer didn't necessary want to include. As for the claim, Chevalier was poor in Switerland; In his position, it wasn't anything special to borrow considerable amounts of money from the Swiss merchant, since he had to wait a few days for his money to arrive. Even if he spent his money on gambling and parties, he still must have hab a constant money source to be able to have that kind of life style. 
Another thing the Critics said, was that his conversations with Voltaire weren't entirely real. But witnesses saw him use notes, which he made after every meating with Voltaire. With them he was able, to write down a lot of details, even though he did it months or even years later.
Besides that, his memoir's account of his escape in a prison in Venice was questioned. There are documents, that prove that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. There were also other prisoners that weren't able to escape, although they had even more influencial connections to the outside of his prison.
All in one, his memoir is a very valuable historical source.
