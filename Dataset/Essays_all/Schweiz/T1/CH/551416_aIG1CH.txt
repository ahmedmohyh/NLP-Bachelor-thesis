After listening and hearing about Chevalier, I'm going to compare the text passage with the heard one and proof why the written arguments might be wrong.
Firstly, it is known that the Chevalier was living in Switzerland and had huge amount fn money which he spend on parties. Yes, the text is right that he had to borrow some money from a merchant. Well, it does make sense. First you need to have some money to have something what you can spend. So he went to the merchant and had to change money as in Switzerland there must have been another paying method as he was used to.
Next, the text says that Chevaliers memoire cannot be accurate because no one can memorize such a big amount of conversations and write everything down accurately. On the other hand there are witnesses who confirm that Chevalier used to write down some notes, maybe the whole conversation he had with Voltaire. This he used to do every night after having discussions with this well-know person. Witnesses also say that while writing his memoire he used to take his journals and his notes to write as accurate conversation as he could possible remember.
Last paragraph says that his escape from prison is only part of his fantasy to make the reading interesting. Altough it seems to be impossible for him to escpase, there is an evidenice in a register in Venice that writes about having to repair the ceiling in his cell during the time after his escape. This doesn't happen daily, does it?
