The arguments of the presentation say firstly, that Chevalier was not actually poor in switzerland. Instead he had wealth. He didn't borrow money because he hadn't any left, but simply because he was waiting for his money to arrive. Secondly has been told, that the conversation between him and Voltaire are so accurately, because he always wrote them down right after they've met and stored them for a long time. The last argument claims, that no other prisoners helped to free him, what is the opposite of what's been said in the text. The presentation says that the ceiling was broken, logically because he escaped that way, and they had to repair it. Why would they have to repair something that wasn't actually broken?
