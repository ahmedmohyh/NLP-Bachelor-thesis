In the first point they mention, that the Chevalier was not as rich as he said. But  in the listening they say that untill he owned his money from selling his land, he needed to borrow some for his parties. So he was not poor, he just did not get any at the moment.
Secondly in the conversation with Voltaire, they say that the historical person was often taking notes about his conversation and during writing his memoir he used those. They know this from other people living at the same time as him. So it is not that impossible that this conversation relly happened.
In the last point, they told that it is actually possible that the Chavalier eascaped. There where other prisoners who had much better connections and did not obtain a bribe. Also the roof had to be repaired in this time when he escaped, so there must be somebody who distroyed it.
