Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. His written memoir has become a very important source about the society in Europe during the eighteenth century. 
The first aspect in his memoir is that he lived a very glamorous and wealthy live. Critics say that he added a few events to make it more exciting. It's said that he lived extremely wealthy in Switzerland and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. Rumours tell us that he wasn't very rich anytime. He may borrowed sums of money from other people. That isn't such a good incidence for beeing rich. But the truth is unknown.
The second aspect talks about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. The critics agree with each other that not all the aspects in the memoir, wich is written down by Chevalier, can't be true. The case for that is that the piece is written down many years after it happened. Chevalier told that he had written down everything he talked with Voltaire in a journal. They think some items got lost with the time.
The third and last aspect deals with Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. He pretended that he had left the prison with the help of a piece of metal. He sais he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped through this one. Critics say that this isn't true. They say it's more likely that jailers helped him to get out. Old documents of the prison tell us that soon after the escape of Chevalier the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. That's a case wich speaks for Chevalier de Seingalt.
