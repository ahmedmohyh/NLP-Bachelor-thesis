The chevalier de Seingalt was not actually poor , he had to wait for his money, because it was a kind of a big deal to sell a property and reclaim the money for that. In the text it were described as he had to borrow money because he was poor. It`s actually controversial. He needed to borrow because he didn`t got the amount to finance everything on time. The conversation with Voltaire seems to be true as both aspects are on the same mindset. It is more kind a mistery what they actually talked about. The only persons who ever know about something are those two. The same thing is with the escaping from the prison in Venice, he escaped because not  of his powerful friends. Other prisoners also had even more powerful friends and they could be bribed. The point is the memoir overall is reliable but if we look at the accuracy everything is still an unclosed case.
