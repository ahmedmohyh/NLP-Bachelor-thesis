Many sources of this time aren't good enough to believe the content, but it is said about the history of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) that there are very good. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoire.The claim that the Chevalier has invented or disorted some of his experiences to make his live seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was.
