The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is one of the most valuable historical source of the European society but in the text the writer doubts the truthfulness of of the memoir. On the other hand the presentation believe in the accuracy of it.
In the Text it is said that he invented lots of events so the memoir seems more exciting. The Chevalier is said to be rich but he had to borrow money which raised lots of question why he needed to borrow money when he was very wealthy. In the presentation the say the Chevalier threw lots of parties and because of that he needed to borrow money until his money arrived. The text was also sceptical about the escape of the prison. If he was so wealthy and well knownamong people than why did he need to escape when the Chevalier's jailers could be bribed to free him. The representation responded that there were many who had more great friends than him but they couldn't get out. 
We have to agree that the representation and the text disag
