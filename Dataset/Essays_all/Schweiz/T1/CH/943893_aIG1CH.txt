In the text the subject was how the memoir of Chevalier de Seingatt can't be that acurate, as people found arguments against some events in the book. The presentation on the other hand, was about a woman who argumented against the text and proofed that those events still could be accurate. For example, in the memoir Chevalier wrote about him being wealthy and living in Switzerland, but in the text a contra argument is that evidence had recently been found, that proved he borrowed a lot of money from a swiss merchant. But the presentation said that he borrowed that money before he was wealthy, because he needed the means to get rich. 
Another point that is said not to be accurate are the conversations between Chevalier and his friend Voltaire. The text says that they are too specific. But family members noticed that Chevalier used to write into a journal, so it could be that he wrote the important parts of the conversations into his journal on the next day. Another event is the prison escape. In the memoir he wrote that he escaped through the ceiling. The text thinks that he had a lot influence in there so he could've also bribed himself free. But the woman in the presentation talked about papers from the prison that have been found, which proved that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier escaped. Also other prisoners had the same or much more influence in there but they didn't escape like him.
