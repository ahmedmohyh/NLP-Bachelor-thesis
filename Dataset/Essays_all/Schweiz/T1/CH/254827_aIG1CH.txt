Even though there is some controversy about the Chevaliers stay in Switzerland there is proof that he really borrowed money but also that he was able to pay it back?
Also about his conversations with Voltaire there is some proof that what he wrote down was in fact true. His friends stated that he wrote things down every night, so he actually had notes of his conversations with Voltaire, making him able to retell the story how it happened many years later. His friends confirmed that he referred to his notes and consulted his journals while writing his memoir and because of that it is very much possible that he knew every detail about his conversations with Voltaire. 
About his escape from the Venetian prison there are some counter arguments to the statement that he was bribed out of jail. It is proven that other prisoners had even more powerful friends than he did and if they weren't able to escape how was he able to escape with the help of less powerful friends? There is also proof that the ceiling above his cell had to be repaired after his stay there, which can only mean, that he was actually able to escape through the roof while he was imprisoned.
