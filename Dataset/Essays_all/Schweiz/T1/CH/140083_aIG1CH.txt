In the presentation she thaugt that his momoir is pretty accurate. She talked about 3 episodes, the first one happend in Switzerland, the second  one is about how he has met Voltaire and the last how he could escape from the prison. In Switzerland he has a nice life, he was rich and had no problems but he never told how he got so rich. The woman has some doubts about that because to get rich like this you have to sell something but he never told what he exactly did. The text tells us that the conversation  ^he had with Voltaire aren't accuratley because he wrote it many years later down. And for that duration he has some very exact phrases, and the mean that it isn't possoble to remember that for so long. However the woman said that he had wrote the conversaton the night after the real conversation down, and because of that it is pretty accurate. The woman asked her how he could escape because normaly the police would notice that theres something wrong. And when he could escape why havn't the others done that too. The others have actually more friend in Italy so it would be much easier to escape for them.
