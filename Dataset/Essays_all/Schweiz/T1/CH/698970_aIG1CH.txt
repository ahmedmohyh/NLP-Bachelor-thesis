Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived between 1725-1798, wrote a memoir of his life and adventures. At first his memoir would have been boring but through his life he has met some many famous people which made his memoir a historical source in the 18th century. But some people say that the memoir is not really true because some of the happennings were invented to show that his life was more exciting that it actually was.
For example the Chevalier wrote that he lived in Switzerland and while he was living there he was wealthy but he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. Well this was not really true because evidence show us that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. That means he was not that rich at all.
As if this was not enough the conversations between him and his writer were unaccurate too so the memoir is getting more unbelievable.
The memoir's account of the Chevalier's escaped from a prison in Venice, Italy. He escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say this action was invented to influece the enjoyness of the reader. It is more likely that the Chevaliers's jailers were bribed to free him so it was an another lie.
