Some critics claim that Chevalier has invented or distorted many events in his memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous, but here are some arguments wich proof that Chevalier was not writing down invented things.
Critics are saying, that Chevalier can not have been very rich in Switzerland, because he had to borrow money all the time. On the other side, there are people saying that he just borrowed money during the time he had to wait for his own money to arrive.
Secondly, critics do not believe that Chevalier was able to remember anything from his conservation with Voltaire, but it is also possible that he has written down all his notes about the conservation in the night after he met Voltaire and just kept his notes until he started writing his memoire.
Also the critics do not think that he really escaped from prison. In their opinion he just got offered a bribe. But if he would not have been escaped trough the ceiling of his room, why has the room had to be repaired?
To sum up, there are many points wich can be questioned. Also in the interview we have heard arguments wich can proof the truth of Chevalier's memoire.
