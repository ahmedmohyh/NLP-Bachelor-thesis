The text says that the Chevalier was poor because he spent his money on gambling and partying and he needed to borrow sums of money from a Swiss merchant. But in this presentation of the women it says that they aren't that sure that he was poor, because he couldn't borrow that much money to partying and gambling. They think he had enough money for himself, but he needed more money to do things he wanted to do.
The text also says that Chevalier met Voltaire and that they conversed, but we couln't know exactly what they talked about, because the memoir was written many years after the conversation. The woman says that they don't believe that Chevalier and Voltaire met, because nobody has any evidence that this meeting took place. Also the conversation was written many years after they met and it could also be that he invented this memoir.
The text also says that he escaped from prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The women is not that sure about this, because in this prison were lots of people, who also knew famous people and they couldn't escape from prison. It is impossible, because the ceiling was repaired after he escaped and how could it be repaired? So they are not sure if he really was in prison.
