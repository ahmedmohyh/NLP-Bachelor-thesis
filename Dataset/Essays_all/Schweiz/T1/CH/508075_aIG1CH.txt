Chevalier de Seingalt had a very valuable memoir. But there is doubt that his memoir tells the truth. Firstly it is bizarre that Chevalier had a wealthy life in Switzerland, but it is known he borrowed considerale sums of money from a Swiss merchant. In the presentation it is said that he could also have had a weath and borrow considerale sums of money.
Chevalier wrote about the conversations with Voltaire, but in this days critics found out that they have never met each other. The thing is, that it is never confirmed they haven't met each other. Also people doubt that he have escaped the Venetian prison, like he wrote in his memoir. People think it is more likely that his politically well-connected friends offered him a bribe to free him. In research they found out that people in this age hardly get offered a bribe, because it was very uncommon.
So maybe he some things seem rare but in fact there is an explanation for that.
