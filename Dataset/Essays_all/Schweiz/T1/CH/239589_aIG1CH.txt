Chevalier de Seingalt made  famous meomoirs. The memoirs of the chevalier almost seem too accurate to be true. How could he for example write down a hole conversation with Voltaire, wich happened years ago. But there is an other side, wich believe the stories Chevalier wrote. They stated several arguments wich of state that the stories are true.
When he was in Switzerland, he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Because he claimed, that he was very rich, some people doubted that a rich man would borrow money  But may be the Chevalier was in fact rich, but couldnt acces to his money. So he had to borrow some money until he could acces to his own. In the other story, he wrote down the hole conversation between Voltaire and him. It is believed that they met, but it seems nearly impossible to write down this whole conversation exactly how it happened after so much years. But it is proven, that Chevalier made several notions and wrote journals everyday. This made it  possible to write down the hole conversation exactly.
