Accoring to the lecture, the Chevalier's momoires are quite accurate and therefore  a reliable source fo historical research. 
The Chevalier  spent a lot of money on parties while living in Switzerland. He used to be very rich and wealthy during that time but he had to sell things before he actually got the money. This was the reason according to the lecture why the Chevalier had to borrow money during the time between he sold soemthing and took payment afterwards. But the text no the other side pointed out that the Chavalier could not had conducted such a confortable life as he described it in his memories, because he had to borrow "considerable sums of money" from a swiss merchant, which would not had been necessary for a rich person.
The texts also questions the accurancy of the conversations he conducted with Voltaire. The Chevalier had written hsi memoires about his meeting with Voltairs many years after it occured and it would not be possible to remember as many details as he did after such a long time. But the lecutre metions witnesses who confirmed that the Chevalier consulted notices, which he made during the night after the conversations with Voltaire, to write his memoires.
The lecutre also believes in the truth of his escape of the prison in Venice through a hole in the ceiling. It would have been proven that a short time after the Chevalier disappeared from the prison, the ceiling of his former room had to be repaired. But also in this point, the text doesn't belive in the Chevalier's memoires and asserts that he could only fled due to some powerful friends and bribery.

The text in general has a more enquiring caracter and questions more things than the lecture does. More critic's voices are mentioned while the lecture especially points the historical valuability of the Chevalier's memoires out.
