The Chevalier said, that he was very wealthy while he was living in Switzerland. The text says, that he borrowed money of a Swiss merchant, so he couldn't be wealthy. But if you borrow money, that doesn't mean you're poor. The text also says, that the conversation with Voltaire can't be captured accurately, because the memoirs have been written a long time after the conversation happened. In the presentation they say, that he had notes about the conversation, so he hadn't had to know the whole conversation by heart, because he had dis notes. The next point is the escape from the prison in Venice. He says that he used a piece of metal to make a whole in the ceiling. They had to repair the ceiling in prison after that. The text says that he couldn't escape from prison like that. But why would they had to repair the ceiling, if the Chevalier didn't really escaped like that from prison?
