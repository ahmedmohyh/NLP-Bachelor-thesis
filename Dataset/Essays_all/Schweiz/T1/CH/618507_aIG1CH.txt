There are three arguments: the first one is, that Chevallier spent a lot of time in Switzerland enjoying parties and spent a lot of money for these parties. But in the heard text, they didn't mention that he had to borrow the money he used to spend in Switzerland but that he had just a bar where he could go and get some money.
The second argument is,that he had many conversations with Voltaire and in the spoken text they said that he wrote everything down of their conversation just in the evening. But the written text says, that he wrote down the conversations with Voltaire many years after the conversations in his memoir, and so it isn't sure that everything is true, some parts are possibly invented.
Then the third argument is, that he escaped from the prison in Venice. The written text says, that he had politically well-connected friends in venice and they could have offered a bribe. But the spoken text said, that at the time when the Chevallier was in prison in Venice, the prison was repaired and so that's the reason how he could escape. Just because of unsuffisant attention of the policiers and because of the reparation works and not by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
