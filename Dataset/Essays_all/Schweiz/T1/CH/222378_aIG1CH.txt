Even if some critics have a different opinion, there is accurate evidence that tells that the memoir of Chevalier de Saingalt is indeed a reliable source. The following arguments point out in what way we can trust Chevalier's memoirs. 
When Chevalier was in Switzerland he must have spent a lof of money, which he owned but only in form of materials but not in cash. Diffrently to what the text says this suggests that this man owned money and was wealthy but simply had to borrow cash in order to be able to pay all the gambling and the parties. 
Directly after the conversation with Voltaire, Chevalier wrote down notes in order not to forget the discussed things. This stands in controversal to the suspiscion in the texts proclaiming that one cannot trust the notes of Chevalier written down many years after the meeting.
It also is possible for Chevalier to have escaped out of the prison as there is evidence that the celing above the place he stayed had to be repared. The bribing theorie that the texts refers to it not very likely for there have been many other wealthy people in the prison who had no chance of bribing.
