The Chevalier de Seingalt had written down all major events of his life in to his memoirs. Today his memoirs are seen as a reliable source for the european society in eightheenth century The memoir is very controversial as ther are a lot of adventures which at first don't make sence. So there are a lot of discusions goinig on if whether or not everything mentiond in his memoir is actualy true.

There are a lot of arguments standing for a Life that isn't as heroic as mentioned in his memoirs, but most of these arguments can be explained. For exemple the loans of the swiss merchant. Today one explains them by saying that these loans are only for a short period of time, because the wealth the Chevalier had wasn't moey but other acets. So he first had to sell his porperty and as he was waiting vor the cash, he got loans by the swiss merchand. 
The discusion he had with the famous autor Voltair seemed a bit out of this world, but there are sources that say that he held diarys, and that he had written down the hole conversation after having it. Other sources say he also used his diarys while writing his memoirs.
And for the Story in the prison, back then having powerful friends didn't got you out of prison. One can see that by looking at his pison mates, which somtimes had even more powerful friends as the Chevalier. Also there are sources that say, that the ceeling of his cell had to be repaired.
