The memoir of the Chevalier became a valuable source for European society. There were three important aspects wich are leading to the memoir.
The first aspepct is about the wealth of the Cevalier. Even though he wasn`t poor he still had to work a few days that he got rich.In the text he is considered to be very rich incase he doesn`t even had to work. The text and the presentation have some similar things. They are both sure about thatthe Cevalier had huge partys at his house. The text tells about a man who had to much money. The presentation is more likely to be more critics than the text.
The second aspectof the memoir is that he wrote each night about his dreams. Anything he could remember he wrote down in his notes, the memoir. 
The last aspect is escape from the prison in Venice.He wouldn`t even be able to escape but after he did they had to build a new ceilling. The presentation  is also critic about the escape because others wich had more power didn`t escape.In fact the text is about historical artifacts and the presentation is a critic about these artifacts.
