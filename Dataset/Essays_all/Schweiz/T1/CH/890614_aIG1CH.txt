The presentation gives us knowledge about the Chevalier's life. But in a different way, than the article does. The diffrence lays in the interpretation of the three examples. While the article sais, that it is not possible to be wealthy, when you need to borrow money from other people, the presentation claims that it is. Because as he was getting money, he might have had to wait till it got in his hands. So that in this time he had to lend money from Swiss merchants.
Let us look at the second example. It is known that the Chevalier has had a good memory, but none of them believes that it was possible for him to remember every sentence from the conversaitions. But in the presentation they believe, that those written conversations are true, because he had many journals where he could have written them in. The article doesn't even think about this possibility.They believe in the possibility of a meeting between those two persons, but do not believe in the 'rightness' of the written conversations.
At the third example the article thinks it is impossible for Chevalier to escape from a prison in Venice without well-connected friends, who would organize a bribe. But what has to be true, when believing in the presentation, is that the roof had to be fixed in this time. So thinking of this possibility, it may be true, that an escape through the ceiling would have been possible.
