On Chevalier's historical accuracy:
In the text it says that there are some doubts regarding the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir. The lecture critizises the statements from the text and defends the historical accuracy of the man's writings. 
For example it is doubted, that Chevalier was very rich while he lived in Switzerland because he had to borrow money from a wealthy merchant. For the lecturer, borrowing money doesn't mean the person was poor. It could have needed time to convert Chevalier's assets into money and in the mean time, he could have run out of money so he had to borrow some until he had received the income from his own business. 
It is also critizised, that the conversations with Voltaire recorded in the memoir couldn't possibly be accurate because they were written down many years after the actual conversations took place. So how could he have memorized it all for such a long time? The lecturers answer is: by taking notes. Time whitnesses have reported, that Chevalier would be taking notes after every conversation with Voltaire and that he consulted these notes when he was writing the memoir. 
The last point mentioned in the text is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. He could have invented this story, to make him seem more brave and adventorous although he was actually freed by politically influencial friends in Venice. To this the lecturer responds, that there were a lot of other prisoners who had similar or even better connections and who weren't freed. Also, old office reports from the prison record, that the ceiling in CHevaliers cell had to be repaired after he was gone.
