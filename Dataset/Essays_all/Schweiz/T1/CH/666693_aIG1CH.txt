The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life and adventures, yet, some people claim that some of the stories are not truth.This means that they found some adventures where they are saying, that it would be impossible that the story went like this. Peolpe against the critics point out some facts why it could be true, what the Chevalier wrote.

Firstly, the critics claim that the chevalier, when he lived in Switzerland, wasn't that rich because he had to borrow money from someone. "Eventhough you borrow money it doesn't mean you are poor!" This is what the people say against the critics. 

Secondly, the critics claim that the Chevalier wouldnt be able to remember the conversation with Voltaire because he wrote the conversation down many years aftherwards. They obviously think that he just invented the conversation. The people against the claims tell us that the Chevalier maybe wrote down the conversation so that he is able to remember it. 

The third claim is that he wouldn't be able to escape from a prison just by using a piece of metal. Actually the critics claim that he escaped by the help of friends because it would be impossible to escape by your own. Nevertheless there is even a argument against this claim. They say that the Chevalier escaped without help because there were people which had even more power and bigger friends and even they didnt escaped. Also the found a letter which contained that the champer of the prison in which the Chevalier was locked in had to get repaired after the escape. Why should they repair the chamber if he escaped by the help of his friends?
