It's said, that the Chevalier was supposed to be a rich men. But then this article starts to doubt this thesis. From what i've heard earlier in the lecture, i think he wasn't a really poor man. Because first it says that he used to throw patries and gambled, so he must have had some kind of money. Maybe he was in a trading business where it took a while for him to get his money so he had to borrow some, until his next payment. 
Also the claim that his memoires are all wrong and made up i think is wrong to think. What was mentioned in the lecture, was that every night after his conversation with Voltaire he went to his room and wrote into his journal. There were some people thatclaimed that the Chevalier used to keep journals and diaries for many years until he started writing down his memories into memoires. So there is a good possibility, that the topics and conversations he wrote down are true. Maybe not in every single detail but bits and pieces here and there. It's hardly possible to remember such thing as a conversation that happened many years ago into the smallest detail.
And the last thesis about the prison, i must disagree with the critics. From what it said again in the lecture, there were many other prisoners that had way more powerful friends and connectons, but even though didn't get bribed out.So it doesn't make any sense why the Chevalier would be the only one getting out. And as i heard, there is proof from some old documents that short after the Chevaliers escape they had to redo the ceiling, which puts automatically more credibillity into the escape theory than the getting out through powerful men one.
