Chevalier de Seingalt is a very controversial person and many historians argue about whether he is very accurate in his memoirs. Every arguement against him can be dischared and you can prove that overall he still made some very accurate statemens that help us today understand the society in the past. 
Many historians think that his memoirs are not accurate enough because he wrote them down after much time has passed. The presentation that clearly defended Chavalier made the statement that nobody can actually write authentic memoirs and that if you think like this then no memoir is really historically vailid. The presentation also told us that his friends conformed the fact that he was always doing notes in the evening after talking to people like Voltaire. He then used his writings when creating his memoirs which would make them more authentic.
Another thing that a lot of people think is that it would be impossible to escape from the prison through the roof and that Chevalier most likely bribed the guardes becaus he had powerful friends. This statement can be proven invailid because there is proof that after his escape the ceiling had to be repared in his cell. More than that it is also known that other prisoners who had much wealthier friends could not be let free from the prison. This fact is very curious because it would crash all the accusations that Chevaliers escape had to do with his powerful friends. 
The fact that Chevalier borrowed a lot of mony in Switzerland although he was rich is also perfeclty explanable. His wealth was only in his assets and he had to sell something first to get to money. The transactions always took a lot of time and that is why he was forced to borrow money from other people.

You can not prove the vailidacy of his statements but you also can not trust all the accusations he gets because they are based on events that were took out of a context.
