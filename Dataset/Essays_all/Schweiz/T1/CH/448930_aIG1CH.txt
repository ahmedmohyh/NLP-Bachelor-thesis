Chevalier wrote a long memoir of his life. In his life we came across differnt people and up and downs.  He discribed his life as glamours and exciting form the real typical life. He always took notes of each day he spent in his life. It's like vlogging nowadays. 
When he used to live in Switzerland, he spent a lot of money for paties and other sutffs. It menas he was really wealthy.But the money he used to spend was somehow earned by him and when he ran out of money he has to borrow it form other people. When people ran out of money they have to borror it or earn, so it doesn't mean that Chavalier was poor.
Chavelier wrote in his memoire about the meetings and conversations he had with a famous writer Voltaire. He wrote all of them aftre the meetings. But there is a critic that he noted it after many years down. And because of that not all of the information we have is true and  it isn't possible to write each sentence he spoke.
One of the critic is that he escaped from the prison in Italy by his political power. But there were many, who knew Politician but they didn't get the chance to use it. So Chevalier was clever enough and brought his political connection in play. And there is also a rumor that the jailer bailed him out or that they were reapering the ceilling. 
Though the gossips, we can only say that the memoir are  true because nobody can prove it.
