The Text about Chevalier de Steingalt raises three valid reasons to doubt his memoirs. Acoording to the presentation these points are not to be taken seriously. For one , Chevalier had borrowd money when he was spending time in Swizerland. According to the text he did this because he had insufficient funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle and he wasnt as rich as he claimed (like Donald Trump). This claim is debunked by the presentation. It is stated that Chevalier was only waiting for his money to arrive to Swizerland and thus having to borrow money during that time. So in short: borrowing money doesnt automaticly mean poverty. Second Chevaliers accounts of his conversations with author and writer Voltaire are questioned because the documents about where written many years after they had occured an thus Chevailier must have faked them. Aigain thuss assumption proves to be wrong. According to many people Chevalier wrote down detailed transcripts after each conversation with Voltaire and kept them for a long time. Third Chevalier claims he had escaped a prison in Venice when he put a hole in his cells ceiling. This for some reason seems unlikelee so he must have bribed prison gards to escape. The presentation proves the assumption wrong again by stating that more powerfull people had stayed in the prison before and they hadnt bribed guards. Also a prison cells ceiling had to be fixed soon after Chevalier escaped.
