The memoirs of the Cheavalier:
Many parts of the long memoir from the Chevalier de Seingalt are critizised. They often refer to the three following parts of his memoir. 
The Chevalier wrote that he was very rich during his life in Switzerland. But it's being claimed that he needed to borrow money. And if he really had been rich why would he have borrowed money? Opposing statements tell us that borrowing money then didn't mean to be poor. In the 18. century you had to sell things first to gain money. So as he was waiting for his money he had no. Therefor he had to borrow money to surpass the time he was waiting for the money. 

It's also being said that his parts where he wrote about an conversation with Voltaire he didn't really write what happend in reality. It's being claimed that he wrote it more than a year after the conversation. Therefor he can't remember every sentence he conversed with Voltaire. But the result of a research is; he wrote down notes about his conversation shortly after it. And as he wrote his memoirs, he referred to them.

Critics also claim, that his escape from the prison in Venice can't be real. It's more likely that his powerful friends have told the gouvernment to free him. But others in the prison have had even more powerful friends and couldn't be freed. And after his escape they had to repair the ceiling above his place in the prison. So it's possible that everything the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote, actually happened.
