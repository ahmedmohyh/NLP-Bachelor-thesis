Point of view from the text: 
Chevalier couldn't be that rich as he were in Switzerland becouse he had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. That is not really an indication for being rich. Besides that the crital voices also say that the conversation between him and Voltaire could not have been exacltly as he wrote it down because it was written many years after the actual conversation. Also they are not sure about the outbreak of the prison. It can't be possible to break out of a prison just with a pice of metal. They are convinced he must have had help from well-connected friends.
Point of view from the interview:
The person who is interviwed is pretty convined that all of his histories are accurate. Only because he had to borrow a little bit money for a while, it doesn't mean that he wasn't rich. To be rich means that you have to invest a lot to make a bigger fortune. So while he had a big invtment he had to borrow some money but just to pay it back immediately. To the conversation with Voltaire she says that he must have made notes while the conversation. He just used these notes years later to write this text. So the informations are still accurate. Also the outbreak out of the prison could be possible. It is a bit weird that immediately after his escape the ceiling must have been repaired in his room, isn't it?
