In the audio I just heard, three arguments that doubted the credibility of the Chevalier were disproved.
The first one was that the Chevalier had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, which was should be evidence he wasn't as rich as he wrote in his recordings. In the audio, the reason given for this was that his wealth was in form of property he had and in Switzerland he had to wait for his money to be converted, so he had to borrow some for the time beeing. 
The second part to disprove the credibility of the Chevaliers memoires was the documented conversation with Voltaire he historically had, that was documented word by word. Because the memoire was released some years later, the citics saw this as a prove that he had invented at least part of the conversation. In the audio we heard that the reason for this was that he made notes just the day after the meeting, when his memories were fresh and used them year later for his memoire.
The third reason to doubt his memoire was the escape that was also historically documented, from a prison in Venice, where he claimed to have made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and escaped through it. The ones who don't believe the story say it was more likely that the guards were bribed by some important friends of the Chevalier. This argument was disproved in the audio, where it was said that there were even more powerfull ones than the Chevalier in this prison, that weren't able to escape. Further are there documentations of the required repairings of the very cell the Chevalier claimed to be escaped from.
