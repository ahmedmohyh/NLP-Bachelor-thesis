Chevalier de Seingalt is known for his memoir, which is a historical source and which provides a deeper look into his life. 
There are two different aspects of the text and its accuracy which I want to discuss.

To begin with, the lecture found that the memoire is a reliable historical source. Although they say that it is impossible to be correct in every detail, that does not change the fact that it still can be used. Following they discussed three different situations;
In Switzerland the Chevalier says have been rich and living a good life, though the text claims he was poor instead. That is not neccessarily correct,one can argument that it can take time to convert asserts into money, so that does not mean that he was poor.
The many conversations Chevalier had with writer Voltaire, are said to not be so accurate. To pove that his notes are accurate and not invented, Voltaire is said to have written down each night the conversation he had had with Voltaire and that he, years later, wrote them down in his memoire.
The incident, how Chevalier had escaped the prison, it is said that bilbery unlikely and it is reported that the ceiling in the prison had to be repaired.
That can be seen as evidence for the claim that he indeed has escaped prison .
Both sources have very different apects on the memoire and if it now is core^rect o or not.
