The main problem about the Chevalier is that he wrote all these long memoirs about his life and his adventures but some people say that these memoirs aren`t accurate. Others say that they are valuable historical sources. The things that made them unsure, were the paradoxes he wrote in his texts. Some stuff was really controversial so many people doubt the accuarcy of the writings.
For example chevalier wrote down a conversation word by word which he apparently had with Voltaire years after the actual conversation. Scientists say it`s impossible for a person to memorize a conversation so exactly.
Chevalier also told in one of his many texts, how he escaped a prison in Venice, Italy. He wrote he broke out with a piece of metal by making a hole with it in the roof.
But others said that he had good connections in the city where he was prisonned and because of that he would have got free.
I personally think from what i read and heard now that there were true and wrong stories that Chevalier wrote down.
