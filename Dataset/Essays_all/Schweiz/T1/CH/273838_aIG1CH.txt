Chevalier's life is connected with many succesful people which makes him stands in a good light. Also this helps him to stand out and be an important figure.
In my point of view the surrounding is quite important because if you surround yourself with people who are making you feel good about yourself and who are just good for your mental health then your life will be much more peaceful. 
Chevalier doesn't seem to have a very good reputation in the world but he seems to have a lot of experience because otherwise succesful people wouldn't interfrere with him. Spending money on parties and gambling is pretty usual in the past and having fun while he still can is no problem. Being wealthy doesn't mean he is a bad person and nor is he bragging around if I understood it correctly. Having a lot money and still borrowing money makes people believe that he is  just showing off. It always depends on the person's intention so I wouldn't claim about it being a fake. 
Chevalier's close relationship to Voltaire must have been bothering a lot of people. How can a person remember the words from the far past literally? And who said Chevalier quotes everything he and Voltaire were talking about? And why does it matter as long as the meaning doesn't change behind the text? In my opinion Chevalier didn't have to mention the exact phrases of the conversations but more showing what he is trying to tell the world with the conversations. 
I have heard from a presentation that people in Venice had to fix the ceiling because there was a missing piece which Chevalier most likely made. Although I don't know why people have to set such a big pressure on Chevalier's memoir. I really don't care if it's true or not but if it's comprehensible and realistic why not.
