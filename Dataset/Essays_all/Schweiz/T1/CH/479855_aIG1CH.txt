In the speach the woman confirmed that Chevalier`s memoire is a pretty accurate and reliable historical source. However, there are a few doubts. 

Firstly, during Chevalier`s stay in Switzerland he went on many parties and he was gambling a lot. Additionally, he borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Therefore, people say that, in fact, he wasn`t as wealthy as he claimed to be. 

Secondly, people are unsure about the accuracy of the dialogues between Chevalier and Voltaire, because they were written down many years after the actual discussions took place. However, Chevalier himself and his friends confirm that each night after the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire, Chevalier wrote down every single word of the discussion and later referred to them when he wrote his memoires. 

Thirdly, people are in disbelief about Chevaliers prison break out in Venice. They claim that he didn`t escape through the seiling, but he bribed the jailers. However, in the speach it was said that there were other even more powerful prioners who didn`t escape. In addition to that there is evidence in the old venician government documents, that the ceiling of Chevalier`s room had to be repared. 

In conclusion, Chevalier is a controversial figure. Nonetheless, he is the man behind a valuable historical source about European society in the 18th century.
