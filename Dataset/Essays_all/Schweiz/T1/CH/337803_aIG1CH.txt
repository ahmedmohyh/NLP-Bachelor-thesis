In the audiotape there are three arguments which contradict the arguments from the essay. The first point is the question whether the Chavelier was rich or not. The essay says that the Chavelier had to borrow money in Switzerland, so it's impossible that he was wealthy. But the speaker in the audiotape said exactly the opposite of that. He believes that the Chavelier only had to borrow money because he made huge partys which must have costed lots of money. So he had to borrow money to finance these partys, so he could afterwards pay it back with the money he earned from the partys.

The second controverse opinion is whether he faked the conversations with voltaire or if they are correct. The audiotape said that after every discussion with voltaire, he wrote everything down and kept this notes until he wrote his memoires. Even close relatives have said, that he made it this way. So he had many sources from earlier conversations with voltaire to write down his memoirs.

And at the end also the third point isn't clear and there are different opinions about it. While the essay thinks that the Chavelier didn't break out of the venetian prison, the audiotape thinks he did. They are convinced that they have absolutely proof in a few venetian documents which say that the prison had to repair the cell of the Chandelier. Their second argument is that the Chavelier wasn't that well-connected and hadn't this many good friends who could have offered a bribe. There were inmates who had much more friens and were better connected than him and they didn't manage to come free.
