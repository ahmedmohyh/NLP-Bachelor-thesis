Obviously a memoir can't be correct in every phrase. Sometimes it's a liar, but without it the memoir wouldn't be as interesting as it is with it.

The text treats three different episodes of the Chevalier's life.

1. The Chevalier wasn't poor just because he borrowed money from a merchant. In fact he was wealthy, but he didn't keep his property by his own. When he run out of cash he must waited till the money arrived. So for the time between he needed to borrow money.

2. After the talk between the Chevalier and Voltaire, the Chevalier wrote every word down he remembered. So it isn't really surprising, that their is a full conversation in his memoir.

3. Of course others hadn't as powerful friends as the Chevalier had when he was in prison, but his cell had been repaired after he escaped. So why should they repair a cell, when the Chevalier didn't escaped as he said?
