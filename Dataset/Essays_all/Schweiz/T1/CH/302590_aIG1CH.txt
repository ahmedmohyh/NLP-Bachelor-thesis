Both of this textes are about Chevalier which is a very controversial figure. It is not known what of his things are true and which are false.
At the end the woman in the presentation is talking about his escape from the prison. She is confused about the fact, that they were many other people who has much  more famous friends so it is very speciall that Chevalier could escaped with the help of famous people when other humans in the prison had friends who were much more famous.  
In the text is written that it could not be that Chevalier can think about all the things he was talking about with Voltaire because nobody can remember exactly what he was talking about with someone. But in the presentation the woman said that it could be possible because he was a man that noticed everything and wrote down everything. He consulted notes.
It is also not clear if he was poor or rich because a person who is poor can not have this lifestyle he had but on the other side a rich person would not borrow money from another person.
The text is much more criticised than the presentation.
The text and the woman who talked were both the opinion that Chevalier is a conversial figure and that not many things are clear about his life.
