In the presentation they tell us the opposite than what we read in the text. Especially they can explain the reasons why it seemed to be that his story was true, like in the example when he had to borrow money in Switzerland. The reason was, that he was so rich and he spent so much money on partys and private activities, that he had to wait for his money to arrive. So it seemed to be that he was borrowing money. What was apparently not true.
In the text they also tell us that he could escape from the prison because he had a number of well-connected friends in Venice who have helped him to escape with their connection with the jailers. The presentation has a good argument for the truthness of this story. They explain it by the hole he had made into the ceiling to climb through the roof. The government had to repair it later on. So that seems to me a good evidence for the truthness of his story.
Apparently he wrote down those storys to make his life seem more exciting.
