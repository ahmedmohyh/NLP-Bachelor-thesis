Everyone knows that Chevalier was a controversial figure.Some critics have raised doubts the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events. 

For example the money borrow in Switzerland. In the text it says that he had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. And if he would be as richas Chevalier said he was, he didn't had to borrow any money. 
But in the audio it says, that Chevalier had to wait for his money and a the time he was waiting he hadn't any money. So he had to borrow it.

Now the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. Critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately,because it was written many years after the conversation occured.
The audio said Chevalier had written everything down after he spoke to Voltaire and kept these for many years.

Lastly Critics have also questionedthe memoir's account of the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prisonin Venice, Italy.Critics claim that an escape like this makes for enjoyable reading.
But in fact the jail had been repaired after Chevalier excaped. Chevalier wasn't the only one with big, influencly friends. In this jail had been more people with even bigger friends and they couldn't got out of this jail.

Even if Chevalier's memoir's are controversal,they seem to be true.
