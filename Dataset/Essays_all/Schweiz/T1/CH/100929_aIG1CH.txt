I think the biggest difference between the spoken presentation and the text is that the text is much more skeptic.

Both text talk about the "Chevalier de Seingalt", a man with a huge memory who remembers hardly all his adventures.
The spoken presentation is sure that all the stories the Chevalier has written down are true and it tries to proof some of his adventures. 
For exemple: The third argument they use is the escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. 
The written text is skeptic and talks about the number of pollîtically well-connected friends who could have offered him a bribe.
The spoke presentation is more convinced from this story and says that other prisoner had better connections and that after the escape they had to repair his ceiling (and this wouldn't have been necessary if he hadn't made a hole in it).
There is another argument both text talk about: The conversations with Voltaire.
The written text is not very convinced and not sure about the conversations between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. 
Because as it says the Chevalier has written down his conversations many years after that  they accured. BUT, the spoken presentations is sure that the Chevalier wrote down the conversations just after they happened.
