There are three episode's of the memoir of chevalier and there are pretty accured overal. I can't remember the first episode but the second was about the conversation. It has been told that the conversation between Chevalier and the population were really hard. So it wasn't that easy to communicate and talk with Chevalier. In the third episode they told us something about the escape of the prison. The people, who were in the prison too weren't that sad in case. But Chevalier was really. So he tried to escape from the notorious prison. 
The facts in the text and in the presentation were pretty similary. In both parts was written about the life of Chevalier and his memoir in fact. One diffrence was  in the text, where  critics has written something about Chevalier and his memoi rand give us an opinion to his life and problems..
