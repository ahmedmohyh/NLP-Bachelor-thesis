There are different opinions about the Chevalier's memoir. Some of them are positive but others show a lot of critic.

The chevalier claims that he was very wealthy when he lived in Switzerland. It is known that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. But recently, it was shown that he borrowed big sum of money from a Swiss merchant. So critics argue, that he can't had lived in wealth when he had to borrow this sums of money. But others think, that this is no argument. It took a few days to convert all his work into money so before he got it, he had to borrow some money. This doesn't mean that he was poor.

Critics also claim that the conversation records of the Chevalier and Voltaire can't be accurate, because it is not possible to remember everything they said many years afterwards. Other people say, that Chevalier had written everything he rememberred down, every night after he had the conversations with Voltaire. When he wrote the memoir many years later, he referred to these notes.

His escape from a prison in Venice is also questionned a lot. Some really query that he had made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. They think that the Chevalier had friends, who offered him a bribe. But lectures tell, that after his escape from the prison, the ceiling had to be repaired. So if he didn't escaped through the ceiling, why should it had been repaired then?
