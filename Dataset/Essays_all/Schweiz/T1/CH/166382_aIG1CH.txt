The woman mentioned three points. Almost everything of her sayings are in this text but with a different view on the truth about Chevaliers story. Her first point was that Chevalier wasn't poor, in fact he had some wealth even though he sometimes had to borrow money. He needed it to spend it on parties and gambling.
Secondly, there were this conversations between him and Voltaire. The woman said Chevalier made notes after each conversatinon and kept them for years. But the text critisises him as he can't remember exact phrases of the conversation many years after. It doesn't mention his notes. Third and last, Chevalier said he broke out of a prison in Italy making a hole through the ceiling with a piece of metal. In the text, critics say it's more likely Chevalier had friends in Venice who could have helped him out of the prison. Other than that, the woman mentions that soon after the escaping the roof of the jail has been reparied. This is not very likely to be an coincidence, she meant.
