First we have to answer the question if the things, Chevalier wrote, are correct.
It is a long time ago and you can not be sure that his text tells the truth. Becaus you read the story just of his point if fiew. How can you be sure tha he tells the truth? There were also a lot of other people and maybe he wrote the recounting just that we think he was the best and did everything right. We have to listen to other voices. Maybeto critical voices so that we can make up our own mind. 
One point is the escaping of Chavailer. Some people think or claim that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the celling. Others say that he escaped normaly and didnt destroy anything. And now the question, whoe is right? Another point ist the borrowing of the money.
Why should he have borrowed money if he was already rich? Did he really borrow money or is it just a try to make him wors than he is? 
In the end i think you have to build your own oppinion by listening to different people and being critical.
But a least ist up to you if you want to trust him or not.
