After the presentation we know that the Chevalier story is a reliable one. First about his time spent in Switzerland. The presentation says that he wasn't poor and that he could afford this expensive journey. But the diffrence is that he worked in Switzerland and that he also raised money and he didn't justshoot money out of the window by going to partys. He didn't borrowed the money from a merchant but he worked i a bar.
By the conversation with Voltaire he didn't recorded the conversation but he took notes during the discussion. So it's really true that there was a conversation between Voltaire and the Chevalier. After the discussion he didn't write down every single word but he wrote a little text which he founded from the notes he took.
There was also an escape from the prison in Venice. The situation was like that there were other people who had powerful friends in that prison and the Chevalier has had nobody. So he escaped from this prison without a piece of metal. He just get out by manipulate the ceiling. But there was for some reason a revision of his cell. So the story about his incredible escape is false.
