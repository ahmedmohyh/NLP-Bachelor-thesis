The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. Many people think, he was e very rich man, because he organized many parties and he gambled, too. For all that you need money. He was in the high society in his time, this is why he knew many famous people, like kings, writers and other good connected people. But many Critics about his money are argueing. Some of them think, the Chevalier was not very rich so he had to borrow money. Maybe, he was rich but it needed time to come to his money. So it is possible, the Chavalier only lended money, to pay it back, when he get's to his own. Remember, in his time the post and all the tranfers were not so fast like today.
The Chevalier was once in a prison in Venice, Italy. But somehow he escaped from there and the way of escaping ist still unclear. Some say, he was well connected to people, who helped him to set him free. Others think, that this is not possible, because in this prison were many other and better connected people too, who never escaped. And too, if Chevalier's friends helped him to set him free, why shoud the prison repear his cell? Because after his ecape, there was a hole in the celing, throu wich he may climed.
The Chevalier wrote a memorie of his life and adventures, wich is a historical source about European society from this time. But nobody can really say, was is true or what is just fiction, that the Chevalier only wrote to make his life look more special.
