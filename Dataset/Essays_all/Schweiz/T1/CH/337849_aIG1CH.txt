In the listening part they contradict the text critics with some possible reasons why it could had happen like Chevallier have written. For example they think about notices which were written by Chevallier after the conversation with Voltaire. They said that the memoir was written by Chevallier years later but were based on the notices he had made. Another difference of the listening compared to the text is that Chevallier could have borrowed some money although he was wealthy. They don't agree with the statement of the text part that he lied in his memoir, they tried to explain the situation with some possible reasons. So they aren't sure if he really was wealthy that time but the try to explain it in the listening. what they really think about isn't mentioned. The same thing is about the third aspect, the escape from the prison. They tell the listener that there were some other guys in this prison which were having some more influential friends which could get them out of the prison but they coudn't escape. And the fact that the top of his cell had been repaired after he broke out is another good reason why it could have happen like that and wasn' invent by him to make his memoir more spectacular. All this aspects said in the listening are speculations and aren't really prooved.
