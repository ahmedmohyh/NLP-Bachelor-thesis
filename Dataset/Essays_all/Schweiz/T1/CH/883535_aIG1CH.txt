Chevalier

In the presentation it was said that no memoire is a correct memoire. So i'ts clear that there are many critics around. I thinks the text and the presentations in the end said  the same. But there are a few little differences. In the text it's said that he was poor. but in the presentation they said he wasnt poor he just spent all his money on partys and gambling. And because of that he ran out of cash but he wasn't poor. so he had to borrow money. Now about Voltaire the people in the text said that he never met Voltaire  but in the presentation it said clearly that he wrotes down each conversaition with him. So yes he have met him once. About his time in the prison or better about his escape its just the same. bothe said that its neraly impossible and really strange that he esaped from the prison.
