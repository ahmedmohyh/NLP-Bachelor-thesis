The audio is about possible explanations for the arguments against the accuracy and reliance of the Chevaliers memoirs.
First the borrowed money in Switzerland, like mentioned in the text, the Chevalier "earned" his money by gambling. But if you win at gambling, as you may now, you have to wait a few days to get the money you won, so the woman in the audio explains that while the young man was waiting for his money to get in, he had to  borrow something from his friends until his wealth would get to him.
Like mentioned in the text, the Chevalier had a lot of conversations with the famous Voltaire, which he also wrote down, but according to the text this happened many years after the actual conversations and the accuracy of his writing is doubted. However, witnesses, friends of the Chevalier know that he took notes after every conversation, some of them saw those and others remember him mentioning them more than one time. According to them the memoir was written based on them, because the Chevalier had  kept them over the years so he wouldn't forget about his conversations with Voltaire.
The last paragraph questions the Chevaliers prison escape, it says that he got out, because he knew a lot of important people of the venice society and that some of them helped him. That could be a possiible explanation, but according to other sources, the ceiling of the Chevaliers had to be repaired after his escape and it's also said in the audio that there were many people in that prison, who had much more connections to Venice' high society than the memoir writer had, so how come they helped the Chevlier escape and not them?
