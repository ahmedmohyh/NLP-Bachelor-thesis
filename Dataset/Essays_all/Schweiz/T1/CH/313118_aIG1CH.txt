The short text about the Chevalier discusses to accuracy about his memoire, focusing on the points why it couldn't be copletely genuine. The audio-text on the other hand, talks about how those arguments aren't valid with providing proof.
In the first paragraph, the text claims that some statements made in his memoire are exaggerated or completely fictional, to be more entertaining and to push the Chevalier onto a higher level. Despite that, the audio still sees the Chevaliers as a valuable source about the society, Chevalier lived in back in the 1700s.
The point made about the Chevalier not being as rich as he wanted people to see him and in that matter borrowing money from a merchant, the audio talks about how de Seingalt just needed fast cash. That didn't mean that he was poor but that his money just hasn't arrived yet because transportation back then was very slow and he always sold properties he owned to have money.
His conversations with Voltaire don't seem to be accurate, because they were written down many years after according to the text. In contrast the audio tells that the Chevalier had a Journal where he wrote down all he remembered just after, making his conversations in the memoire realer.
And lastly, the Chevalier wrote down that he escaped the prison in Venice through a hole in the ceiling. The text thinks that he just was freed by his influental friends an their bribe, where as the audio says that the cell, the Chevalier has escaped from needed to be repaired after.
