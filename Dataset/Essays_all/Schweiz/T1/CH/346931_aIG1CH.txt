The presentation was about the Chevalier and the truth about his memoir that he wrote about his life. The presentation began with his time in Switzerland. He had lot of money and spent all of it while gambling and vistiting parties. So with time he had to borrow some money. The second point of this conversation was about the conversation between him and Voltaire. Chevalier wrote down the conversation the night after. So then, after a few years he wrote his notes down in this memoir. Lastly it was about his escape from the Venice prison. Soon after he escaped, the roof had been remade.

Like it was said in the presentation this memoir of Chevalier is a good source but there are some different versions between the presentation and the text:
Firstly, the woman talked about that he wasn't poor just because he had to borrow money after gambling. In the text it's mentioned that he would not have been rich, otherwise he didn't have to borrow the money.
Secondly, the text says, that he wrote down his conversation with Chevalier many years ago after the conversation happened. But the woman in the presentation said that he wrote down everything the night after something happened and so these informations are pretty safe.
And the last difference between the text and the presentation is about his escape from the prison in Venice. In the text was mentioned that he only could escape with a piece of metal. But many people think that it isn't true and that Chevalier must have had a few friends who took him out of the prison, because of his good political connections. While listening to the presentation I heard that the roof of his cell, soon after he escaped, had to be remade and that it doesn't make sense that if he had escaped in another way that the roof had to be made new.
