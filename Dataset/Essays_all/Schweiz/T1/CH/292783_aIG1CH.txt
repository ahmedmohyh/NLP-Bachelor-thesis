The short presentation I heard before said, that you need at first enough money to wite something, that will get famous in the future. So Chevalier de Seingalt needed some people who support him for his memoir recording. That's why it could be, that he wrote also things, which aren't really true. In the presentation they said, that in Switzerland were a lot of huge partys. But the short text sais, that Chevalier de Seingalt wrote that Switzerland is verry welthy and that is something, what the some people criticise. An other point is, that in this short text the criticals sais, that it is impossible to remember all the phrases of a conversations some years later. But in the presentation was said, that he wrote down everyshing he can remember and that he rememberd all this things. So the presentation and the short text has a verry different point of view.
