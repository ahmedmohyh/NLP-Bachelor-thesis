The women agreed to three claims of the memoir. At first, she came up with evidence which prove the fact that Chevalier was a wealthy man and spent money for parties and gambling. According to her, Chevalier had the money, but he also needed to have it received. This process would take a few days. In this text though, it is said that Chevalier borrowed the money from a Swiss merchant. Presumebly, he didn't have the money.
Secondly, she said that Chevalier and Voltaire conversed frequently. The only way Chevalier could have remembered those conversations by writing it down in his dairy he had. This is an argument which explains the one from the text that Chevalier wasn't able to remember his conversations that well.
Thirdly, the women claimes, based on evidence, that Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice, Italy. Although he was famous, he didn't have any contact to the outside world and escaped by making a hole in the ceiling which had to be repaired after his escape, according to the women.
