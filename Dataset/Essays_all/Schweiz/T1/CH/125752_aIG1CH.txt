The Chevalier's memoirs are a pretty controversial piece of literature. Written in the eighteenth century by the Chevalier de Seingalt, it recounts his life and adventures. It's controversial due to the validity of his tales. Some critics say that alot of it is made up,they argue that it was made to make his life more exciting, whilst others have evidence that seem to proove the validity of the memoirs.

For example: The memoirs tell us that the Chevalier was quite wealthy, and that he spent lots of it on parties and gambling. Critics argue that he took many loans from a merchant, and that a wealthy man wouldn't need to get loans. But being wealthy doesn't have to mean having loads of cash. The Chevalier had wealth in objects that he had to sell to get cash. And selling may take a while, so he took loans from the merchant to have the money at hand.

In another episode, Chevalier tell us of his conversations with Voltaire. They are written down to amazing detail, and that's where the critics argue further: Nobody can remember such long and detailed conversations for many years. But there is evidence that, every night after he had conversed with Voltaire, the Chevalier had written down the conversation. Whitnesses confirm that he had kept that notes until the day he died. That's how he was able to retell all of them.
