The text and the presentation are about the memoir that the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about his life and his adventures. 
There are three points being made in his memoir. His stay in Switzerland, his conversations with Voltaire and his escape from a prison in Venice.
Let's talk about the first point, his stay In Switzerland. In his memoir the Chevalier claims that he was very rich and wealthy. It is actually known that he spent a lot of money for parties and gambling, but it's also known that he borrowed a big amount of cash from a swiss merchant. His loan can be explained. He made a lot of money with gambling, but before he could gain money he had to have some to spend it in the first place. 
In the second part of his memoir he talks about all his conversations with the famous writer Voltair. He wrote down the exact phrases of their conversation. Because he wrote his long memoir a long time after these conversation happened, critics believe that a lot of them are made up or just not accurate because rarely any human being can remember these exact informations after so many years. However a person who lived with him at that time, said that every night the Chevalier wrote down everything he could possibly remember about his conversations he had that day or night with Voltair.
The third part of his memoir is all about his escape from the notorious prison in Venice, Italy.
The Chevalier claims that he escaped trough digging a whole in the cieling of his cell with a piece of metal and climbing out of it. Critics say that he had a lot of friends In Venice, who prabably just paid the bribe for him. However, old government documants say that the cieling of his cell actually had to be repaired and it's also known, that other escapers had friends in Venice aswell and non of them paid their bribe.
