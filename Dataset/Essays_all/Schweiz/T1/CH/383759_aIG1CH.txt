In the audio that I heard they said, that the Chevalier wasn't poor. He was also weahlthy. The text and the audio said that he spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. In that way they had the same opinion. In the text it says that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant and therefore they doubt that he is rich.
They were very sure, that Chevalier met Voltaire. But in the two textes there is a diffrence. In the audio they were very sure, that he has written down everything that he remembers about the meeting with Voltaire. In the text they have doubts about how he remember all those things many years after the conversation and how he could write it down with no record. They are not sure, how Chevalier knows exact phrases and could write down what Voltaire said. 
And the last point they were talking about was the escape from the prison in Venice. In the text they are very sure, that he can escaped by himself. But in the audio they thought, that he had a lot of powerful friends, who helped him to come out of the prison.
