In this essay i will compare the presentation and the text about Chevalier`s memoir.
The presentation tells the story with the merchant in Switzerland  like this. Chevalier liked gambling and was wealthy. But acutally sometimes he needed to change asstes into actual momeny. So these days he had to borrow some money from a merchant.  The text says that he actually was a poor man in this time and had no money for any thing.
Then there are the late chats with Voltaire. It says that Chavalier took notes every night after the chat. He kept his notes for years and later then he worte it down. The explanation in the book is different. Chavalier notes are  not accurate  because they were wirten so many years later.
And at last  the argument about the escape from a prison in Venice. There should have been people with even more powerfull friends than Chvalier, so he could not escap, because the jailers were birbed to free him, as the text tells you. also they had to repaire the celling.
