The lecture about the Chevalier de Seingalt included many facts that contradict the criticisms above. The text states that critics have many doubts towards his memoir and how accurate it is. There are three main events of Chevalier`s life mentioned both in the text and the lecture. The first thing talked about is Chevalier`s time in Switzerland, and how much money he really had. While the text states that Chevalier couldn`t really have been as rich as he said he was, because of his loans from a Swiss merchant after spending his money on parties and gambling, during the lecture it is mentioned that he needed time to convert his assets into money, and often needed to borrow cash while he waited for his own money. 
There is also proof, that while critics are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations between him and Voltaire, there is a good chance the conversations were real. Althoug the memoir was written years later, Chevalier always wrote down everything he remembered from the conversations in a journal. So while it may not be possible for him to remember the conversations, they were all down in writing and there was no need to rely on his memory. 
Another thing critics are not so sure about is the way he escaped from a prison in Venice. It may sound unbelievable for someone to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof, but it is explained in the lecture that it doesn`t make sense for him to have bribed his jailers. Many other prisoners had more important connections than Chevalier, but none of them managed to escape. Also there are sources that say the ceiling of his cell needed to be repaired after he escaped the prison. And what other reason could there be, other than his legendary escape?
So while it may all seem pretty impossible and made up for entertainement, there is some convincing evidence that Chevaliers memoir is reliable and accurate.
