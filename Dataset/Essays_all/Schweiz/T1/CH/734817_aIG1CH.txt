In this essay I will compare a summary of the mermoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt and a little presentation which is related to the written part.
So In both parts there are three big points which are discussen.
Both sides think that the mermoir of the Chevalier isn't according a hundret percent to the truth.
The first point is his money. So according to the mermoir he lived in Switzerland, where he was very wealthy and spent his time on parties and gambling. But evidence has recently surfaces that he borrowed sums of money. The women from the presentation says it doesn't mean that he was poor. In her opinion the Chevalier used  his borrowed money to become rich.
The second point is the converstations between him and and Voltaire. In the written part the recounted converstation can't be correct in detail, because nobody can keep so much informations for all the years. According to the women and a friend of Chavalier who died , he always wrote down the important parts of the converstations the evening after the meeting.
The last point is his escape from prison. His mermoir says that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling ans climbing through the roof. The author of the written part doesn't belive this and thinks that the jailers were bribed to free him. The women doesn't believes this too and knows that the other prisoner which could have had the forced to break out didn't do it. 
There's a thoughtthat he wrote down a few things that didn't happened or he switched a few arguments to make themermoir more interesting for the reader.
