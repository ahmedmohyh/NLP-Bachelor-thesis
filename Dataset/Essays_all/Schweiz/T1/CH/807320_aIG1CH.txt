In the listening example the woman says that Chevalier memoir is relieable and very accurate. In the reading part it says that he made a lot of things up to let his life appear more glamorous than it actually was and it doubts that he was actually so rich, because he borrowed money and why would you borrow money from somebody when you are rich. The reason why he borrowed money of a Swiss merchant is, because in that you first had to sell some ownings to get cash, but it took time to get the cash. That means that he still could have been rich, but only had to borrow money while he was waiting for his money to arrive.
Chevalier always took notes and wrote diary. So when he had a conversation with Voltaire, but wrote his memoir a few years after that he could still write everything down correctly because he had his notes which he could look at and could reffer to.
During his time in prison, there were also other people imprisoned, who had even more well-connected friends than him, but never could escape and after his escape they had to repair the ceiling of his room. That supports his memoir, too.
