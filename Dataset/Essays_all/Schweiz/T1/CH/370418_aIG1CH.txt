This essay is about different opinions on Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoirs.
The text part beginns with lots of doubts, that he invented most of it. In the presentation of the woman, it started with the fact that memoirs aren't alaways correct in every detail, but Chevaliers' would be. So a totally different opinion to the text. Then there are three examples what should proove the correctness of their beginning statement.
In the first one, the text passage argue that he had not been rich, because he borrowed some money for parties and gambling. But the women of the listening part still defend him and argue with the fact that if you borrow money, it isn't alaways connected to beeing poor.
Secondly the text has doubts according to the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire, because he wrote it down many years after. 
The last example points out that he wouldn't escape from a prison because of some connections he had, but onthe other hand the woman explained that the prisoners had even more politically friends.
