In the presentation the woman says, that Chevalier had a lot of money as he was in Switzerland. Chevalier spent his money on parties and gambling, so it wasn't that he borrowed money because he had none but just because he had to wait for his money to come. In the essay they critic the truth on this story, because for them it doesn't make sense, that if Chevalier would have been that wealthy he would have needed to borrow money. Also the women talks about the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. She tells that it's true that they have met and that Chevalier wrote so much as he knew down after the conversation with Voltaire and kept it. So after many years as he was writing his memoir he just had to look at his letter and involved it in his memoir. A critic point that is mentioned in the text is, that how should Chevalier remember years after his meeting with Voltaire the exact words they had spoken. For the critics that seems impossible and so they don't believe that this conversation has ever happened. The last thing the woman says is that it's true that as he was in prison he made a hole in the ceiling, because after he left his room, the ceiling had to be prepaired. Critics claim that he just wrote this down to make it more special, but actually the jailers were bribed to free him, because Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice.
