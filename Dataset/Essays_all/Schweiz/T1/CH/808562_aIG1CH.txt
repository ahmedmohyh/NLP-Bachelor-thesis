The Chevalier

The memoire of the Chevalier, what is correct and what can not be true? Critics have mentioned that the Chevalier invented many events to make his life more exciting but the contra argument is, that no memoire can be correct. While he was living in Switzerland he was having a lot of money and he also splend it out for parties and so on. In the text is written, that if he had really been whealthy, he would not have borrowed money.  But other critics arguments, that he just have borrowed this money because he was waiting for his money to arrive. 
In the text is written that it is not possible to remeber exact phrases many years after the meet between Voltaire and the Chevalier but it could be that he has taken notes and so he still remembers about what they were talking, as the other side arguments. 
When the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice critics claim that he must had got help from well-connected friends in Venice who were bribed to free him. On the other side, arguments that it is true that it had happened like he had written in the memoire is, that the room in which he was prisonned had to be repared and other prisonners had also friends who were sometimes much more known or well-connected. 

In the conclusion we can say that we really do not know what has actually happeed and what not but in fact there are different arguments which can be true or also completely false.
