Well, these two opinions, I have read listend to just before, are the oposite of eachother. While the person who wrote the text, can't believe what the Chevalier had wrote down, the other one thinks it sounds quite realistic. Both mention three exanples. Firstly the text says that the Chevalier lived in Switzerland and had a lot of money, he mainly used to use to pay parties. But on the other hand they say, he had to borrow quite a huge sum of money and as a rich guy, he would not have to do this. The audio says the contrary. They think, borrowing money does not have to mean, he was poor. Most of the Chevaliers did it like that. And also when they disscused the scene with the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire, they were optimistic. They simply said, he had a diary where he put in the hole converation between him and Voltaire, so that is the reason why he knew the exact sentences and words.On the other hand, the text still thinks the other way.Last but not least, they talked about the prison escaping of the Chevalier. Looking again at the opinion of the audio, they again believe his memoir.   Supported by the fact, that they found the hole in the ceiling, which had to be repaired  On the other side, we have got the critical side. Their criterium is that  the other prisoners had more politically important relationships and non of them got free because of that.In their opinion it woul have been unrealistic to believe his view.
