In the talk on the text stating that many of points of Chevalier's memoirs seem incredible, the speaker presents explanations on how Chevalier's statements still can be true.
First she states that borrowing money deosn't necessarely mean being poor. She explains that Chevalier indeed had a lot of affairs in Switzerland but that many of his tradings were of the kind where money first needs to be invested before it can be earned. So if he would run out of cash he would borrow some from a marchand.
The next thing told is that Chevalier stated that the nights after his conversations with Voltaire he used to write down what they had talked about and that there are sources assuring that Chevalier indeed often used his old notes while writing his memoirs.
Talking about the prison's escape the speaker claimed that there were many prisoners with more powerful friends in Venice, but that none of them ever escaped the prison, so that bribing doesn't make a lot of sense. Furthermor a source tells about the reparation of the ceiling of Chevalier's cell shortly after his escape, which makes the escape as Chevalier describes likely to have happened.
