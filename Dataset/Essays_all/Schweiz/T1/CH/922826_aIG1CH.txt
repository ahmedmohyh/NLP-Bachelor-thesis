The aim of this essay is to explain the differences between the arguments against the memoir of the Chevalier and such for it.
To start, in his memoir it is said that the Chevalier was very healthy while living in Switzerland. Although he used to borrow money from a merchant, because he didn't have money, he owned land. But at this time land-owners were the wealthiest people who lived. The difference to the text against the Chevalier is that it is talked about his land-ownings. The text only did mention, that he used to borrow money which should say he was poor.
The second point is about the conversations with Voltaire. There are many details mentionned in the memoire. According to the text, it isn't possible that the Chevalier knew the details anymore when he wrote his memoire, so it must be a lie. But as the woman told, he used to write his memories to the conversations every evening right after them. So he could have used his notes to write the memoire.
At last, the Chevalier said that he escaped a prison in Venice through a selfmade hole in the ceiling. In the text it is said, that it was more possible that he convinced his politically well-connected friends to let him go. Although these facts, it is more likely that he escaped through the hole. For one point, other prisoners who stayed had more influental friends and the prison had to repair the ceiling in his cell after his breakout, according to the woman.
