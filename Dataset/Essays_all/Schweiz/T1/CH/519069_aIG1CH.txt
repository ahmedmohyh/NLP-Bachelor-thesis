In the oral part, to wich I've just listened, the talking remains positive and shows, that the critics aren't accurate. The teacher tries to outweigh the critics and convice his listeners of the truth behind Chevalier. The written part, on the other hand, stays very negative. It supports the critics and isn't on Chevalier's side. 


In the first argument, the written part shows Chevalier as being rich and says he shouldn't have to borrow money from somebody else. But the speaker said, that he needed to work at first, then he lost his money and needed to borrow some. It seems, as the critis are only on the surface. 

Secondary, they say, it's impossible to remember some conversation wich was held years ago. But the speaker said, Chevalier had some journals and took notes after he had talked to Voltaire. In this way, he could remember the conversation for a long time.

For the last argument, the both sides also offer differents points of views. First, the writing shows that Chevalier had enough friends to help him to get out of prison, and it's not true that he had escape with a piece of metal - The oral part shows that it was exactly like he told, and strenghtens the arguments by saying that old documents show the evidence: After Chevalier had escaped, his prison cell had to be repared, because it was broken. There's rarely any argument that can hold against this one.
