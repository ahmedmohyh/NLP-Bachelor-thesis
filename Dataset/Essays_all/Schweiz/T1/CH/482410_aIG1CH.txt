(I haven't understood anything from the listening. I guess my headphones are broke or I'm just to stupid to manage them right. So my text won't be very good, I'm sorry.)
The text is about the Chevalier de Seingalt who is a valuable historic source about European society in the 18th century. We get to know him as a controversial figure. For exemple because he was known as a wealthy man but while he lived in Switzerland he borrowed money from a Swiss mechant.
The text talks about Critics that are skeptical about his written down phrases from the conversation between Voltaire and him because they've met many years before he wrote it. Another point they mention in the article is the escape from a prison in Venice. Critcs don't believe he was able to escape on his own. They think someof his politically friends helped him.
