Because of technical issues i wasn`t able to listen to the first part completally.

We don`t know if the Chevalier was rich or not, but we know, that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. The women said, that Chevalier wasn`t poor. This statement is correct i think, if you lend money from someone that doesn`t mean you are poor.

Critics are sceptical, if the Chevalier could have written down detailled phrases, years after the conversation with Voltaire. The women claimed, that the Chevalier used to make notes for everything, he also did for the conversation between him and Voltaire. With those notes he was able to capture the conversation more or less correct.

The Chevalier was in a prison in Venice. He wrote down, that he escaped through the ceiling of the prison.Critics claim that the Chevalier had bribed his jailers to free him. But this isn`t very likely, because in the prison were other people with more money and with better contacts to important persons in Venice and they had to stay in the prison. The women also told us, that after the Chevalier out of the prison they had to repair the ceiling in his cell, because it was damaged.
