So this text is about the Cheavalier de Singalt had written a memoir and afterwards he was accused for writing things down not the way they happened.
The Chevalier de Seingalt is describd in the text like a liar. It says that he wasn't very wealthy at all. It's a fact that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, but on the other hand you can also see it like he had money but was in need to borrow it from another while waiting for his own. Another example is when he met Voltaire. In the text it's said he wouldn't were able to capture these conversations accurately. But in differ it's said that he kept notes with him and wrote it down afterward with help of the notes. In addition there's the argument of the ceiling in the prison. In the text it's said that the escape makes more enjoyable reading possible, but to mention the facts, there was found some damage at the roof so they had to repair it soon after he broke out the prison. 
So you can't just call him a liar or that he writes some creative imaginations down. You have to always check the facts before you judge about someone.
