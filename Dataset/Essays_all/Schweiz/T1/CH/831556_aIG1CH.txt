There are lots of differences between the text and the presentation. They are about exactly the same topics but they tell different stories about what exactly was going on there and how Chevalier managed different things. First of all they tell about the fact that he borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant, now there are different opinions why he did that: The text says that he went out of money because he spent too much of it and he was kind of poor. The presentation says that hee needed the money to invest it and generate even moore or filling the gaps while he was waiting for his own money which doesn't mean that he was poor.
The next point is that he recorded some conversations in the memoir. The text tells that hhe couldn't be able to remember the whole conversation because it's too long ago. In the presentation we heard that it was possible because he was taking some notes which helped him to remember about the conversation.
At last both told about his time in a venician prison an how he manage to escape from there. The writer of the text shares the opinion that he hat friends outside with a lot of political influence so they can manage to get him out very easily. On the other side the presentation says that there were prisoners with even more powerful friends and they weren't able to escape. So he was forced to get out on his own and they support the theory that he made a hole in the ceiling.

As much as we compare both stories, will we ever know the truth?
