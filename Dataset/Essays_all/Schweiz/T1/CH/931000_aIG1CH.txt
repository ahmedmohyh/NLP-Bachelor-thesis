It is known that the Chevalier has spent a huge amount of money in switzerland. He claimed in his memoir that he was very wealthy, but the money he used for parties and gamling was borrowed. A very possible exlenation is that he was very wealthy but the money earned from his work arrived to late to be used for gambeling so he just borrowed a bit until his money arrived. The part with the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire is easy to explain. There were a lot of people saying he used notes he took, while writing his memoir. He himself claimed that he wrote down as much as he can remember just at the evening of the conversation with Voltaire. So it is very possible that he used his notes of the conversation while writing his memoir. The Chevalier had some very well-connencted friends in Venice. But other prisoniers had even more of those friends and didn't get out of jail. There is even a document that confirms, after the escape of Chevalier they had to repair the roof of his cell.
