Some people say that the memoir of conversation can't be possible because Chevalier coouldn't have remember so exectly at the converstion he has many years earlier. The woman who spoke of this theme said that it true that the memoir is written years after but Chevalier had wrote the conversation exectly dawn and hided the notied for years. 
That shows that the essay is right but not evry information is in it. That normal for a text and it would be much longer if everything would be in it but a important information like that should be written down. Without that information the people read this essay could have a wrong impression of chevalier. that he wasn't rich is true and false he becamr much money for his essay but used it and after that he had to barrow money for the time he became money for hisnew essay.
