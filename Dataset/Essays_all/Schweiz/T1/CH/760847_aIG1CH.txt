The two sources about Chevalier's accomplishments are contradictory. The text source states that many critics question the validity, accuracy and reliability of Chevalier's memoir. The text passage underlines three main points; his wealth, his conversations with Voltaire, and his prison escape in Venice. The text argues that Chevalier was exaggerating these events and explains how and why each of these events are impossible or very unlikely. In contrast, the audio clip argues reasons why these events are possible and thus acts as a counterargumentative source. An example of this is what Chevalier wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. While both sources agree that these conversations did take place, the text passage argues that it would have been impossible for Chevalier to remember Voltaire's exact words while writing the memoir several years later. In contrast, the audio clip mentions that there is evidence from several witnesses that Chevalier made notes every night after having conversed with Voltaire. He kept these notes and referred to them years later while writing his memoir.
Another example of this is Chevalier's prison escape. The text pasasge explains that although Chevalier claims to have made a hole in the ceiling using a piece of metal, critics argue that this is probably false, as it is more likely that Chevalier made use of his connections to help him bribe his way out of jail. On the other hand, the audio clip argues that there are official documents from the time period proving that the ceiling of Chevailier's cell had to be repaired after he left the prison, which would support Chevalier's original claim.
In summary, these two sources are contradictory; the text passage attempts to discredit his memoir, while the audio clip tries to prove that what he wrote is true. Both sources give information about what he actually wrote in his memoir, however they both have different opinions and viewpoints concerning the validitiy of his statements.
