Chevalier de Seingalt is a controversial person from the 18th century. Some people state that they doubt, wheter the famous memoir he wrote was accurate. However, in the lecture I just heard, are some counterproofs to this theory.

In the text it is written, that Chevalier claims to have spent some time in Switzerland as a wealthy man but people nowadays wonder if he was really rich, since there is evidence that he borrowed a huge amount of money from a merchant. However, in the lecture, the person explains, this doesn't have to be a proof that he wasn't rich, since his money most likely came from property which he had to sell first before he could use it. So, it is possible that he had to borrow money for his parties and gambling to pass the time, it took to sell his belongings.

It is known that Chevalier met Voltaire and in his memoir he wrote about conversations they had. Again, there are some people who feel like those conversations cannot possibly be accurate since Chevalier wrote his memoirs many years after he talked to Voltaire. But, in the lecture the person tells, that Chevalier claimed to have written down every word Voltaire said, only hours after he conversed with him and he used these notes later to write the memoir.

Another famous and controversial story of Chevalier is how he escaped from a prison in Venice. According to his memoir, he made a hole in the ceiling of his cell and used it to climb to the roof. Some people doubt that the event really happend like this, since Chevalier had many friends with connections and could have bribed himself free. Albeit, the lecture doesn't agree with this, since there were some other prisoners with even more powerful friend than chevalier and they couldn't escape. Additionally, it is known that the ceiling of Chevalier's cell had to be repaired only a few weeks after he left.
