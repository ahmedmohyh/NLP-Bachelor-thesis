The text and the presentation are based on the same three topics out of the Chevaliers memoires. Both focused on the chevaliers loan in switzerland, his conversations with voltaire and the Chevaliers escape from a venice prison. But there is one big thing that the two sources do not have in common and that would be their opinion on the three topics.
 
The presentation is saying that because he took a loan does not mean that he was poor. The chevalier was probably running out of money so he took a loan to not be completely dry, while waiting for his money. However the text is arguing that a rich man would never get in a position where he had to loan money.

The text does not doubt the fact tht the Chevalier has met Voltaire but rather that the conversations are not accurate. They strengthen this argument with the fact that the conversations and the writing of the memoires had a ig time diffrence. The presentation counters this argument with saying that the Chevalier wrote the conversations down directly after the conversations and that he later used these  notes to write his memoirs, which family members stated too.

The glorious escape from the prison also has two theories. The one from the text says that his powerful friends bribed him out of prison. The presentation says different. It says that there were other prisoners with more powerful friends that did not manage to escape. They have another prove in form of an old document that says that the ceiling had to be repaired directly after his escape.

Both have intresting facts and theorie on the three stories out of the memoires so you can not say that one is better than the other.
