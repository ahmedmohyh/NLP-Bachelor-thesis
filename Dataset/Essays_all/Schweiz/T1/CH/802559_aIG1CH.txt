Althought the text says that Chevalier's memoir are doubtworhty and also brings up examples, the lecturer is able to dismiss those examples. Of course we don't and won't ever know if who's right or wrong, but still we can conclude from other documents and witnesses about the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir.

The text questions the wealth of Chevalier by pointing out the loans he took up while his stay in Switzerland. It might be correct if we just leave that fact like that but as the lecturer points out, wealth comes in many forms. Chevailer might run out cash, so he had to sell some of his assets. Naturally, it took some time until he recieved the money, so he had to take up a loan in order to pay his bills.

Another, according to the text, questionnable event are the conversation between him and Voltaire. Clearly, no human beeing could possibly phrase converstations happened years ago. The lecturer can give an explanation here too: many of his friends witnessed Chevalier noting as much as possible, keeping those notes for years and reffering to them as much as possible when writing his memoir.

The last stated concern questions Chevalier's escape from a well known prisoin in Venice, Italy. The memoirs say that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole into the ceiling of his cell. The text suggests that he rather bribed the pguards.but then again, there were more powerful people imprisionned and not event them could bribe the guards.
