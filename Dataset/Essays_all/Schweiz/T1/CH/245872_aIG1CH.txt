The text is questioning a lot of Chevalier de Seingalts actions and also what he said and eventally wrote in his memoir. On the other hand, the women in the presentation was talking about why Chevalier was actually not a liar and why his memoirs are a accurate reliable historical source. 

First of all, it was written that Chevalier would have lied about being wealth in Switzerland as he borrowed money from other people. But the lady predicts that this didn't mean he wasn't wealth, it just shows that these days people needed to investigate and sell before they actually got their money some days afterwards. Furthermore, Chevalier knew Voltaire and conversed with him several times. These discussions are also in his memoirs, which were critisized and doubts came up: How should a human remember discussions by heart after so many years. Therefore, the presentation explains that Chandelier was used to write everything down in the same night after they conversed. And last but not least Chaveliers memoir is doubtable because of his fabulous prison escape in Venice, Italy. As he knew many wealth people, who could have easily get him out of jail, the text questions the escape he mentioned through a metal with which he made a hole in the ceiling of his cell, but more understandable an escape through jailers who bribed to free him. In that case, the women mentions that also this part of the memoir is probably reliable as after some time Chevalier escaped, the ceiling of his cell must have been repared. What other reason would there be, than because of the hole he did to escape...?
