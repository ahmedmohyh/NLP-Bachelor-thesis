The lecture points out that the memoire is probably correct. For example: The text sais that the chevalier needed to borrow money from a swiss merchant because he wasn't really rich. But he was probably rich because he had a lot of valuable things that he needs to sell in order to make money. And because he spent so much money on parties and gambling he had to overcome dry periods to wait untill his things got sold. 
Another thing is that the text said that it's impossible to remember the exact phrases he and Voltaire said during the conversation. But historians found that the chevalier made a lot of notes directly after Voltaire left. With the help of notes it's easy to remember things that happend years before.
He also escaped a prison in Venice by breaking the roof and climbing out of it. The text mentions that it's very unlikely that he actually escaped from the prison and that bribery is more likely. But the reading sais that the other people that were mightier than him and had more influence than him couldn't bribe their way out of the prison. Plus a document from the Prison sais that the roof needed repairing right after the Chevalier had escaped the prison. So it's possible that his memoires are correct again.
