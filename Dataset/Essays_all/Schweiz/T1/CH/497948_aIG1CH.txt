There are a lot of differences between the text and the presentation while the text seems to me more critically and the presentation more reasonably.

For example in the text is written "Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would  not have needed to borrow money" but in the presentation this statement is explained that he indeed spent a lot of money in gambling but he gained it from converting some things he owns in cash but he wasn't really poor.
And a second controversial would be his escape fromt the prison. The text claims that it is unlikely that he escaped from there on his own, instead the text points it out that it is more accurate that some of his politically well-connected friends helped him. But in the presentation this is also better explained, she said that there were some people in this prison with even more powerful friends but none of them escaped and also a short time after his escape the sealing had been repaired, so this would make perfect sense if he escaped throug them.
So at the end I would say from my perspective the presentation seems, how I said before, much more reasonably and logically but the text on the other side much more critically.
