In the first paragraph it is said that there excist doubts of the accuracy of his memoirs. But many people that lived with chevalier said that he consulted frequently his stuff where he had written down many of the conversations he had. So that he did not write just anything but what really happened.
In the second paragraph of the text it is said that Cevalier needed to borough money so they come to the conclusion that he was poor and not rich. But as said in the presentation he was rich. He made a living by selling things but it took some time until he got his money for it. Therefore, if he ran out of cash he needed to borough money from a merchant in order to finance his partying and gambling.
In the third paragraph it is said that Cevalier probably just invented the conversations he had with Voltaire because he knew the exact conversation he had with him. But as said before, Chevalier did wirite down many of the conversations he had so he could consult them as he wrote his memoires.
In the fourth paragraph it is said that Chevalier didn't break out of the prison through the roof but the gards were bribed so he could walk out of the prison. But the roof neede repairing after Chevalier broke out of the prison. It is not very convinient that the roof needed repairing when he was just bribed out. 
As you can see above, there is always evidence that supports the accuracy of Chevalier's memoires.
