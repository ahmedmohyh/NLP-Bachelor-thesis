There are three important, hardly discussed events of his life. In general, each and every aspect has critics which doubt the event, but every aspect has it's supporters too, which believe in the truth of the happening. The first event contradicted by the critics in the text was the doubt (that) the Chevalier wasn't as rich as he indicated, because he borrowed money. However in the presentation this is contradicted by the fact that he was just waiting for his money to arrive and was, in the event, very rich. The second contradiction between the critics and the presentation is Chevalier's relationship to Voltaire. On the one hand the critics doubt that he was able to remember the exact phrases of the conversation  many years after they occured. On the other hand, the women which was presenting claims that he wrote down the conversations each and every night when he returned home. The escape from a prison in Venice, the most doubtful event in the glorious past of the Chevalier, is believed to be overexaggerated, saying that he invented this one for story purposes. However, listening to the presentation the escape is also believed to be true, reason being the repairation of the ceiling of his cell shortly after his misterious escape.
