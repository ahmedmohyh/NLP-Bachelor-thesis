The text and the oral presentation are about the same storys the Chevallier wrote about in his memoirs during his life. The difference is that the text tries to tell us the Chevallier wasn't who he claimbed to be by finding reasons how the storys could have really happened. The oral presentation is about the same arguments as the text, but the presentation is about arguments that confirm the storys the Chevallier wrote about during his entire life. So it tries to tell us he only wrote down the truth.
But what are these memoir storys the text and the presentation are about?
The first one is that the Chevallier was very wealthy while his living in Switzerland. The second one tells us that the Chevallier used to meet Voltaire, a famous writher from the 18th century. The third and last one plays in a prison in Venice, Italy. The Chevallier has ecaped the prison by using a piece of metal to make a whole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
