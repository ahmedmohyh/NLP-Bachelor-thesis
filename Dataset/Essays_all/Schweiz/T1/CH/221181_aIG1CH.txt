The presentation defended Chevalier and gave us arguments that these stories really happened like Chevalier wrote. The first point mentioned said that he was rich in Switzerland and not poor like the text said. She gave us the explanation that Chevalier had to borrow money while he was waiting for his gained money to arrive. The other point was about the accuracy of the conversations with Voltaire, a famous writer. The explanation for this point was that he kept notes from their conversations and that he took his notes for writing the memoir. The last thing that is talked about is that Chevalier escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. The text says that Chevalier might have been escaped with the help of his politcally well-connected friends, but the presentation questioned this and brought the argument that the ceiling in his room had to be repaired a short time after his escape.
