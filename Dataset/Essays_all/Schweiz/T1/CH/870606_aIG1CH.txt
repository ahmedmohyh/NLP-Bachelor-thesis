In the text and in the listening, they talk about his  time while living in Switzerland. Both said that he had enough money to go to parties and gambling. But after a few time he had to borrowed money. The text sais that this isn't possible if he realy was a rich man. In the listening thei said it's posible if he spended so much money. But both, the text and listening, aren't so sure if Chevalier always told the truth.
The second point, that is critising by the text is the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. They think it's not possible because no one knowed that they ever met. The listening said, z^that it was a night conversation so id ccould be possible thta no one noticed. An other point which the text critisies is, that it isn't possible to remeber a conversation for such a long time. Chevalier wrote the conversation many jears after and it couldn't be all wright. In the listenign they agree, because they also said something like this.
In the third story if Chevaliers escape the prison, the critics think it's more logic, that he escaped with help of some friends and not with a piece of metal. In the listening they talk about, that this is not possible because in this prison are many other persons who have more friends for escaping but nobody ever could. So they think, this isn't true .
