While the Chevalier was living in switzerland the text says that he must have lyied about his wealth and that he borrowed from a swiss merchant, the presentation clarifyes that he had to go and borrow some money so that he had now a amount to start with but later when he earnd more he would pay all back.

 In the memoir he accurately described and wrote down the exact conversation he had with Voltaire. In the presentation it says that from a source they heard that while writing his memoir he used some papers and notices beside.So it wasfor him possible to exactely write down the conversation he had with Voltair. 
Because everytime he saw Voltair and had a conversation with him he wrote the whole conversation down the followin night.
The escape from a prison in Venice the critics claim that he had some connection to important persons who got him out. But in the presentation it says that there where other prisoners that knew much more and more important  people with influence than the  Chevalier himself. Another point is that they have discovered, that the ceiling of his old prison room was soon after his escape fixed, so it is possible that he might has escaped throgh the hole he made. 
It comes out that you need to consider also the facts of the hystorie.
