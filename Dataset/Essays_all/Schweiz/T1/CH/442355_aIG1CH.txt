In the text they show big doubts if the memoir of Chevalier is correct but the speaker brought many arguments to proove that the memoirs are accurate. 

To the first part of the text that says it can't be that he were wealthy in Switzerland if he borrowed big amounts of money the speaker says he had the kind of wealth he had to sell to get the money, and in the time where he waited for the money he borrowed some, so just because he borrowed money doesn't mean he wasn't a rich man.

The second doubts they have are the conversations with the writer voltaire. Their opinion is that it can't be that he remembers the conversations that well after a long time. But Chevalier, after the speaker, wrote down everything he remembered from that conversations the evening after they happened. For his memoirs he used these documents. Wittnesses said that Voltaire and Chevalier had a couple of conversations and proved the documents.

The escape out of a prison in venice is another point people have their doubts about. Chevalier said he used a piece of metal to destroy the ceiling. Some people say Chevalier had some important friends in venice and that he most likely just came free because of them. But others in that prison had more important friends and didn't get out because of them. Also documents proove that after Chevalier were gone out of this priosn the prison had to repair the ceiling of his room. Why should they have to repair his ceiling if he didn't escape trough it?

So every argument of the critic has been prooved wrong.
