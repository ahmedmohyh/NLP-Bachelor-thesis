In the text they wrote that the Chevalier couldn't have been that rich because he had to borrow money. But in the presentation they said, that sometimes also rich people had to borrow money till their "new" money arrived, because in this age the people had to wait a very long time till they got some money. So the Chevalier didn't had to be poor just because he had to borrow money.
Also in the text they don't think that he has met Voltaire but the people from the presentatin have found something which shows that they have spoken to eachother.
In the last paragraph in the text they talk about how the Chevalier could have escaped the prison in Venice. They believe that he could have made a bribery because he had very powerful friends. But the person who made the presentation doesn't think that it has been like this because there have been many prisoners who had more powerful friends and even they couldn't escape the prison.
