The Chevalier wrote a memoir. Some people doubt, its reality. They think that Chevalier just wrote things, to make his story more attractive. 

The first point, that some question is his lifestyle in Switzerland. He himself wrote, that he was very rich and weathly and was at many parties. But we know that he had to borrow money. some say the story is fake, some that he just had to sell something so he then could organise some parties again.

The second point is about the conversation he had with Voltaire. It is a fact that they had some conversations, but the letters have other dates than the conversation. it is plausible that is because Chevalier just kept the conversation in mind and took notes. He then kept the letters, and consulted them if he had to. 
The last point is about the prison in Venice. He sayd, he escaped the prison. But this is a prison, where it is impossible to escape. So there are rumours, that he just had some friends, who helped him to escape. But in this prison there were also many other prisoners, who were more dangerous and had more friends. Why wouldn't have they escaped too? And the prison really had a hole, that had to be repaired. So it could really be that there escaped somebody.
