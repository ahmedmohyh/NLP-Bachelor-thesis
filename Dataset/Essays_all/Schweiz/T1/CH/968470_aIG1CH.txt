The woman told that the momoirs of the Chavalier are not as incorrect as the text told us.
In the first example she said that he wasn't really poor. He was on many parties where he spent much money, and then he had to wait for his money from his job a few days, during this time he had to borrow money. 
In the second example it's written that the conversations with voltaire cannot possibly capture them accurately because his memoires had been written many years after this conversations occured. But the woman said that they'd had conversations every night and that the Cavalier wrote them down.
And the third example is also different from the text. She said that he escaped from the prison, because other guys in the prison had much more powerful friends than the Cavalier had and they couldn't escape. Another appiontment was that they hade to repaire the ceiling of his chamber after he escaped and why would they have to repair the ceiling when he didn't escaped. In the text it's written that he didn't escaped by himself and that his jailers were bribed to free him.
