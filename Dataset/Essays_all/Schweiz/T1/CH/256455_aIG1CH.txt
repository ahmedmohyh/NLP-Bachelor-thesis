Chevalier

The thext do not belive the strorys of Chevalier de Seigalt. The writer of the text think that this is a good history wich make his live more interesting and glamourous than it really was. But the madame in the dialog belives him and think that he wa a grat guy and a incredible person from how we can learn a lot. 

Firstly the text says that he wasn`t as rich as the people said that he was but this is not true. He was rich and he had enough money but sometimes he had only must wait for his money so he had borrow some, but he was not poor. the critics have also questoned the the memoir's account of the Chevalier`s escape from a notorious prison in Venice. But now the Lady shows us a great ponit how smart and fantastic he was. He do not know a lot of people in the prison in Venice. There were guys in the prison how knew much more people and had the better chances to leave.

The critics do not belive him and in some points the ,ay are rigth but the world need heros and we don`t have to ask so many questions we also canbelive the people.
