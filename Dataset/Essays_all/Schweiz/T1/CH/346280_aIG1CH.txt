I have read and heard to different points of view about Chevalier's stories. The reading presents all the stories how the Chevalier had explained them in his book. But the hearing shows arguement against his stories and why they are wrong. 

The Chevalier tells that while he lived in Switzerland he had to borrow money of a merchant because he spent a lot of money on parties. The critics argue that the Chevalier was not as rich as he said. But on the other hand people say that he had to spent a lot of money on parties to meet famous people first and after that he gained money.

The second story of Chevalier is that he had conversation with Voltaire. Many years after this conversation he wrote it down. People criticize that it is not possilbe to remember all details after some years. But the argument against it is that he made notes after the conversation but after some years he wrote the book. That is why he remembered all details.

His third story is that he escaped from prison in Venice.
