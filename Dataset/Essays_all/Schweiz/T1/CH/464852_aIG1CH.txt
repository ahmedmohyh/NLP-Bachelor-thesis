The presentation about the Chevalier de Seingalt states that most of the arguments made in the text can be disputed and rendered obsolete, and therefore the memoirs are not as untrustworthy as critics see it to be.
The first argument, specifically that the Chevalier apparently took one or multiple loans from a Swiss merchant, is intended to prove that he wasn't very wealthy, as claimed in his memoir, but instead just had a very extravagant lifestyle without the wealth to back it up. But the presentation goes on to explain that this wealth by no means has to be cash only and thus every time the Chevalier would run out of money, he had to take a temporary loan until he had cashed some of his posessions.
The second problem the critics in the text see is that his alledged conversations with Voltaire are too precisely written in the memoir that a man could actually recall them like that. Friends of the Chevalier though wrote in their memoirs and diaries that he would always write down his experiences of the day very thoroughly, and he consulted these writings when creating his memoir.
Lastly, the critics tell about a specific story from the memoir, specifically the escape from a prison in Venice. They state that this kind of an escape makes a good tale and "enjoyable reading", but, in their eyes, is by no means realistic. They instead assume that some sort of bribery got the Chevalier free, as he had some very influential friends in the politics of Venice. The presentation on the other hand says that bribery is less likely, because other inmates of said prison were far more well-connected and did not get freed by their friends, thus making bribery more unlikely. It goes on to present some evidence for the first possibility by recalling that shortly after the Chevalier's escape, the roof of his former cell had to be repaired.
