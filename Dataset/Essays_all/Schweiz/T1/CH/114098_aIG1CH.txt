The text says that Chevalier de Seingalt invented events to make his life seem more interesting than it actually was. He wanted to appear more exciting and brave.
In the text is written that Chevalier was very wealthy in Switzerland and that he spent so much money on parties, that he had to borrow some in the end of his trip. So the critics think that he wasn`t as rich as he seemed.  In the listening they told that he had to borrow money because Switzerland was expensive and if Chevalier really was poor, he wouldn`t have been able to spent a lot of money.

The second critic in the text is that the people don`t believe that Chevalier met Voltaire. Chevalier took notes during the conversation with Voltaire and many years after, he wrote a text about it. Critics say that he invented the story in his text. The women from the listening thinks that Chevalier can`t write a text about a conversation without notes.

So the difference between the text and the listening is, that the listening is more positive about Chevalier and his life. They believe that he was rich and that he has not invented his stories. In the text are a lot of critical analysis and Chevalier seems like he was a poor man.
