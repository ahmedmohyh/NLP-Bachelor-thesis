The lady in the lecutre tryed to prove Chevaliers memoir right. She talked about three topics and mentioned that she thinks not everything in his memoir can be absolutely true but altough it is a very important historical source.
The first topic was to prove, that Chevalier borrowed money, eventhough he was a rich man. She explains it with him not having his money with him in switzerland and having had the need to borrow money from friends to gamble while waiting for his money to arrive. With this thinkable explanation she tryed to convince critics.
The second topic was about his conversation with Voltaire. The lecturer thinks to know that Chevalier has taken notes after his conversation with Volaitre and used them years after while writing his memoir. But she also mentioned to know that not everything he wrote was exactly said like this. 
The last subject was about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. She gives us the argument that a lot people in this prison had much more influence friends than he had and all of them stayed in prison. In addition the prison had to renovate the celing after him being in prison. 
With all of this discussed subject the lecturer tryed to give us another perspective and also to balance the statements from critics.
