The presentation begings by looking on the aspect with the money. In the text, we read before, there is written, that he claimed to be wealthy in Switzerland. The contra argument is, that he has borrowed money. But even if someone has huge amount of money from working something, this doesn't mean that he receives this money imeadiatly. So it would also be possible that he was just borrowing money to continue his lifestyle while waiting for his money to arrive.
Another thing is that in his book he writes down the conversation, that he had with Voltaire word for word. But the problem is: He wrote this many years after the conversation took place. How is it then possible to remember every single word? The answer is really simple and given by the speech: He simply made notes shortly after talking to Voltaire. He must have kept this notes for many years until writing his book.
The last thing we are focusing on is his escape from prison. He tells, that he was imprisoned in Venice and than escaping by digging a whole in the ceiling. The critics say that it is more likely that his powerful friends could free him. But again there were other powerful people in this prison with even more powerful friends than Chevalier. Why should his friends could have freed him when the other, more powerful friends couldn't? Another point is that it is written in old Venice documents that shortly after he was out of prison, they needed a new ceiling for his old room. 
So overall for every critic on his book, the woman holding the presentation had an contra argument. So in my opinion, he didn't lie.
