The Chevalier de Seingalt was a somewhat controversial figure. He lived from 1725 until 1798 and his life and his adventures he captured in a long memoire. But is it all true? Let me compare the different opinions from the text above and the lecture.

In the text it was criticized if the Chevalier was wealthy or poor. They argue that he had to borrow money so he couldn't have had that much of his own. But the professor explained that he wasn't poor at all, he just had that kind of whealth you have in properties not in the form of money. To get to money he needed to sell and that's not happening fast so for a time he had no money and he needed to borrow some.
The second aspect was the escape from the Venetian prison. The article claims that his powerful friends helped him to escape but the woman said, referring to old evidence, that the story about breaking through the ceiling is true because the mentioned ceiling had to be repaired. Furthermore other prisoners had more powerful friends and weren't rescued.
Last but not least the conversations with Voltaire. They doubt that they were captured accurtely because they were written down years later. But Chevalier made notes each time right after those conversations and he wouldn't have forgotten the things the said.
To sum up, The lecture proves the opposite of what the article has written down. And because the woman doesn't tell the things randomly and she has evidence it's more believable.
