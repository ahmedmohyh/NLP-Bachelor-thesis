There was a man calles Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) and he was famous for his memoir in which he wrote about his wife and his adventures. The memoir became very popular but it became also a lot of critics. Some people claim that Chevalier changed some points of his adventures that his life is more glamorous and interesting for readers. The first point was that he said he was a rich guy when he lived in switzerland but was it true? They read that he borrowed money from swiss merchants. They think that he lied about his richness. Another point was the conversation with Voltaire. Voltaire was a famous writer. They say that he never met and talked to Voltaire in his whole life so the conversation was fake. To that they say that nobody can remember whole sentences of conversations which happened a couple of years ago, so it can't be true how Chevalier wrote the conversation in his memoir. The third point was the escape from a prison in Venice, where he escaped of making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. He wrote that he climed through the roof and that was his escape. People claim that the jailers helped him and that he had a lot of politically well-connected friends there which helped him to escape with a offer for the bribe. The audio had arguments against those critics. First of all he sold money to became more money bacck, that was his job she said. So it was usual to borrow money from someone. The second point was he tried to remember himself about the conversation and he made notes when he had the conversation. The last point was the escape. It would be weird if police officers repaired the room of Chevalier just a couple of days after he escaped of the prison, so she said that it was logical that he escaped like he told it at his memoir. The point outs of the Critics the woman claimed that it was unlogical because there were other people who had those politicol well-connected friends so they escaped either like that.
