The Presentation that I just heard about Chevaliers memoir storys tries to confirm the correctness of his storys. They try to explain how he did certain things that many critics would say are fake. For example their arguments about his Prison escape. They explain that Chevalier actually escaped through a hole he broke in the ceiling of his prison cell. The people who worked at that prison had confirmed that they had to repair a hole in a ceiling ofa prison cell. Their argument is: Why would they have to repair a hole in a ceiling when nobody escaped like that? That makes sense.
They also argumented, why he escaped like that. There was no bribery they said, because there were many prisoners in that prisonwho had much much more wealth and better connections to do so. But they didn't.
They have also talked about the correctness of the Conversations with Voltaire. Chevalier had written down parts of the conversation he could remember that evening after the meeting. He later wrote it down clearly, many years after.
The Text I have read argues against these well confirmed Arguments. The verycritical text sais Chevalier wrote the conversation down the first time many years after the meeting. So his story ist not very accurate. Also the prison escape never happened like that. The text argues that it must have been a bribery because Chevalier had some good connections.
