Chevalier lived in the 18th century. He wrote many things in this memoir which was very wealthy. On the other hand he was a figure who invented many events to make his life more special and interessting. So there were some people who were skeptical. He knew many famous people that's the reason why his memoir became also very famous. It was told that Chevalier borrowed money from a swiss merchant but he told that he should be very rich so it doesn't make any sense. He wasn't as rich as he told. Once he met Voltaire and after their meeting Chevalier wrote down everything which he could recognize. Many critics didn't believe what he had written in this memoir. Chevalier told that he escaped from a prison in Italy. But also this was critized by many historic people. 

In the audio it was told that he was in a bar but in the text it is written that he spent his money for gambling.
