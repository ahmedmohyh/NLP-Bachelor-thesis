An autor named Chevalier de Seingalt wrot a memoir about his life and the adventure he had. He lived in teh 18th century and met some famouse people. So this memoir is utterly important source of information in history. But many people have raised doubts the truth of this memoir.

The text says for example that he were a wealthy man but he spent it and had to borrow some money. On the other hand side the women in the Audio told that he was a businessman. He selled lots of things and made good money.
So about this point you cannot be sure what is right and what is wrong. There are diffrent oppinions and we cannot check wich one is the truth.

In the text is also written that Chevalier has escaped from prison, but critics claim that he wrote this only to make his life more interesting and such his memoir. In the Audio was said that it is possible that he really escaped because afterwards they had to check and fix the cell again.

Sadly it is the truth we never now what really happened and if he wrote the hole truth or if he is lying to make a good book.
