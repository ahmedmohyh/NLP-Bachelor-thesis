Critics doubt, that the Chevalier was very wealthy, because he had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. However, that doesn`t mean, that he couldn`t have been wealthy. There are other forms of wealth than having a lot of cash. Maybe, the Chevalier`s wealth was considered the goods, he was selling and maybehe had to borrow some money, because he had to wait for some money, that a customer who bought his goods owed him. Critics also claim, that it is rather unlikely, that the Chevalier could still remember whole phrases of his conversations with Voltaire, by the time he was writing his memoir. But there is evidence, that the Chevalier took some notes, while speaking with Voltaire. Several witnesses said, that they know, that the Chevalier often consulted these notes. The critics also doubt, that the Chevalier`s story of his escape from a Venetian prison. They think, that it is more likely, that the jailers were bribed to free him. But other inmates with more influence than him couldn`t be freed through bribery and tit is known, that after the CHevalier left the prison, a ceiling had to be repaired.
