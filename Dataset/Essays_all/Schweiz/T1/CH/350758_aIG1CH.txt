No memoir is totally correct and the accuracy of the chevaliers memoir could also be mistaken. However, the lecturer thinks that his memoirs are very accurate and can be used as valuable historical sources.

 For example, the loan from the merchant does not mean that the chevalier was not wealthy nor that he did not have much land. He probably had to borrow the money from the merchant because he needed to wait for is money to be paid since he only got paid later than expected. In this case he paid the merchant back when his money arrived. 
The conversation with Voltair may not be 100% accurate but the chevalier did indeed write done all the conversations he had with him. Many of his friends say that he also did console his notes and the written conversations while he was writing his memoir. 
The third point which they mentioned was the escape out of the Venitian prison. Many of his famous and rich friends were not able to bribe their way out of prison, so how was it possible for him? Moreover the roof of the prison had to be replaced after his escape. 

With the evidence which the lecturer provides the chevaliers memoirs seem to be precise and can be taken as historical sources for further investigation.
