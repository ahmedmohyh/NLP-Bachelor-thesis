The accuracy of the memoirs of Chevalier are questioned in the text because some critics say that he invented many things in case to make his life and adventures appear more "exciting and glamorous". We know frrom the text that while he was living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy but at the same time there is evidence that he had to borrow a lot of money from others. People claim, that if Chevalier was really wealthy he would not have borrowed money from others. But there's another oppinion on that in the presentation part. They said that in fact, Chevalier was pretty wealthy and by this term very rich. And in case to stay wealthy he had to live his life by spending that money and investing in some things. While he had to wait for the money to arrive, he of course practically didn't have any money. But that doesn't mean at all that he's wasn't wealthy or rich.
It is also written in the text that the memoir between himself and Voltaire can't be accurate. It says that the memoir was written many years later after the conversation happened and that it simply isn't possible to remember the whole conversation like it really was. In the presentation is also mentioned that Chevalier made notes after his conversation with Voltaire and that he used those to write his memoirs- so they have to be pretty accurate. 
They also pointed out in the text that his escape from a prison in Venice didn't happen at all like Chevalier describes it. It's more likely that they let him go because he had some politically well-connected friends who helped him and arranged everything. But in the presentation they argumented that others had even more powerful friends - and they didn't get out of prison. And there is also evidence that the hole in the ceilling had to be repaired after he had escaped.
