After listening to the lecture there are many arguments that do say that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is pretty acurate. For example while living in Switzerland it is true that from time to time he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant, not because he was poor, but because the most part of his money was invested in properties and assets that weren't cash so the time that it took to find a buyer sell him the property and getting the money in cash took some time. That's because he had to borrow money from the swiss merchant, not because he was poor or his luxurious lifestyle  made him to. He had to buy and sell and there were periods where he didn't had the money in cash but mostly invested in homes or land.

Critics often said that Chevalier would have never benn able to write that accurate about his late night talks with Voltaire ,that it just wasn't possible to remember a conversation that good. But what a lot of critics didn't knew was that Chevalier made a lot of notes and reminders after he talked to Voltaire and consulted them years later when he was writing his memoir. 

Critics also don't believe that Chevalier escaped from a Italian Prison by just using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They think that it was way more likely that Chevalier got help from some of his rich Friends and that they were able to get him out of prison. But in the lecture they told that in that exact prison there were people with much more power and more powerful friends that weren't able to flee, so that theory is wrong. Also there exist some old Documents that around the time Chevalier claims that he escaped the Prison they had to repair the roof because there was a hole in it. 

All these Points show that the memoir of the Chevalier indeed is valuable and mostly true and that Historians can count on what he says.
