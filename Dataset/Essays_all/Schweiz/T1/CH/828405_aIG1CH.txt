There are different aspects on how accurate Chevalier's memoir is. He claims that he lived in Switzerland and was very wealthy. As it is written in the text it doesn't make any sense for the critics that he had to loan money if he were so rich. But as the woman in the hearing said, it is very well possible, because to become wealthy you had to sell goods or land and the process of the change from an object into money took up a lot of time. So in the meantime he had to borrow money because he had to wait for to money. Therefore this makes perfect sense. Also the conversations with Voltaire must be true if he really wrote every single detail he could possibly remember every night after. Unlike in the text where critics are skeptical about how real his records are. They complain that nobody could possibly remember exact phrases of conversations years ago. Added to this critics questioned the escape of Chevalier out from a prison in Venice. He claims that he escaped the prison by digging a hole in the ceiling and climbing through it. This situation might be very fun to read but it is also very true. As a matter of fact, the records from the prison in Venice reassured that after breakout of him they had to repair the ceiling. So in the end everything Chevalier has claimed was true.
