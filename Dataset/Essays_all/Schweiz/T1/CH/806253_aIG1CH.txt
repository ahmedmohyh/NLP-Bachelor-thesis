In the text are lots of critics on the memoir of the Chevalier, in the audio are the arguments why these critics are wrong. Lots of people said that he invented many parts of his memoir. It's tols that he wrote it toward the end of his life so sure his not able to remember all the things correct but that don't say that he invented things. He just can't remember all as it happend. The claim that he can't be wealthy in switzerland when we know that he had to borrow grand sums of money seems locical, but there has also to be a time befor he was rich. For exemple when you want to build up a business, thats very expensive at the beginning and often you don't have much money. So you have to borrow money, after a while when the business gets well and you earn much you can repay the money and theres enough to get rich. There is also his escape from a notorious prison in Venice that is often criticalised that this nobody could made before, so why he can do it? It's known that after his escape the room he was prisoned in had to be repared, so it can be that this was his chance.
