The first part of the memories and the life of Chevalier de Seingalt which critics are sceptical about is the claim of his wealthy and rich life in Switzerland filled with big partys and events. As they say Chevalier had problems with his money. Several times they claim he needed to borrow a big amount of money. The idea of critics is that if Chevalier lived such a life full of money, why had he then to borrow it from others. The interview I lisened to is having a argument against the critics. In these times it was quiet difficult and needed long to get such big sums of money from the bank or to get your money liquid and the events came often without expecting it. Because of that it was only normal to borrow the money and some time after giving it back to the owner.
The second thing about which critics discuss is that Chevalier writes about his conversations and discussions with the famous writer Voltaire. They claim that he wrote his memoires years later and that it wouldn't be possible to write down conversations in the exact words as they happened after such a long time. The interview at the other hand is saying that it is witnessed by people that Chevalier took notes about his conversations with Voltaire each evening after the discussions and that he was with these notes able to recunstruct everything even years later.
As a last thing the critics in the text are trying to doubt about the accurency of the text with the argument that the spectacular escape out of a jail in venice has not happened as written. Chevalier wrote that he escaped throw the cieling of his cell, but the critics that it was more likely that he his jailers were bribed to free him, because of his good political relations in venice. In the interview they say that even people with better relations weren' able to escape and that witnesses say that soon after Chevaliers escape the ceiling had to be repaired.
