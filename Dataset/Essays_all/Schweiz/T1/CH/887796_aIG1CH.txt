Chevalier de Seingalt lived in the 18th century, met many famous people like Voltaire or other writers and also few kings, talked with them and wrote down his memoires. But many things about his life are not clear. Critics says that he lied in many points that he wrote. For example, when living in Switzerland, Chevalier was spending much money on partys and gambling. That is what he wrote. Critics can proof that hed had to borrow money from other people to survive in Switzerland. Other people say now, that borrowing money from someone doesn't make you instant poor. 
Chevalier has also published a famous conversation with Voltaire. Chevalier has talked with Voltaire about several things and made notes during the conversation. Critics have shown that Chevalier wrote this conversation years after he had talked with Voltaire and it cannot be that someone remember every detail years after a conversation. Other people say now that Chevalier had his notes from that conversation and that he wrote the memoires from the conversation based on these notes. 
The third point in this story is about Chevalier in a venice prison. In his memoires he wrote that he escaped from that prison with a special technique. Critics say now, that he had many powerful friends during this time in Venice and that the bribed him out. The other people can now proof that the venice gouverment had to reproduce the ceiling in the cell from Chevalier and that they wouldn't have done that, if Chevalier hadn't destroyed the ceilings and escaped like that.
