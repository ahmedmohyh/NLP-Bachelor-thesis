The Chevalier and his memoir are very controversial. For example in the time while he was living in Switzerland he was very wealthy but borrowed money, so some people thaught it might not be true that he was rich. A reason why he borrowed money could be because he sold properties. He had to wait for the money of his partners so he borrowed money for that time he had to wait for it. 
Another controversial record in his memoir were his converations with Voltaire. He wrote the memoire some time after they met but he wrote down the conversations very accurate. "Nobody could write down a conversation in such detail after such a long time!" some people thaugt. What they didn't knew was that he wrote down everything he remembered the same night they had had their conversation, so it could be possible that he used these things to write his memoir. 
Last but not least we have the story where he escaped from prison in Venice with a piece of metal.Critics claimed it was more likely that he bribed his way out. In the same prison there were some other, even more powerful peope, who could've bribed too. Another reason his story could be true is that the prison was repaired short time after he escaped.
