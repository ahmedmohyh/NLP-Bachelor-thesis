Chevalier de Seignalt was a somewhat controversial figure of the eighteenth century.
In the text it is argued that in the Chevalier's memoirs,the Chevalier distorted a lot of  the events that happened in his life, and in the presentation it is argued that his memoirs are probably correct.
The first argument of the presentation is the fact, that the Chevalier was indeed rich. He was known for partying and gambling, and that cost a lot of money, and he did borrow money from a merchant, but that he maybe borrowed money because he had to transfer his assets into money, and since that took a few days, he loaned money during this time, while in the text the fact that he borrowed money, is evidence of the Chevalier being poor. The presentation shows other possible explanations for the story.
The second argument in the presentation is that the protocolled talks with the famous writer Voltaire are accurate, as he took a lot of notes, and kept them for a long time. Wittnesses confirm that the Chevalier always made a lot of notes, and used a lot of notes to write his memoirs, so it seems quite logical that he had notes of his talks with Voltaire, and the talks are accurately transcribed in his memoirs. The text argues that since he wrote his memoirs a long time after he held the interviews, his memory would be very distorted.
The third and final argument of the presentation is that the escape from prison probably happened the way it is described in the memoirs. Firstly, there are documents, where it is shown, that shortly after the escape of the Chevalier, they had to repair the wall of his cell. the second is that there were other prisoners who were a lot more influential than the Chevalier, who didn't escape from prison, making it unlikely that the Chevalier was able to do so.
The presentation argues very logically, that the different points discussed in the text, are no proof of the Chevalier distorting his memoirs, and that it all probably happened the way it was told.
