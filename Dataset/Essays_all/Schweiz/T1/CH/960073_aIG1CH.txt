The text is about the memoires of Chevalier Senegal about his exciting life and the subject is about how much you should believe about it.
Many critics have made some points about evidence that some of his stories happened different than he wrote, but there are many points that prove that it was actually true.
Many critics said that he can't have been rich because he had to lend money from a meechant and he wouldn't have to do that if he actually had been rich. But other people say that just happened because he had to wait till his stuff got sold, which doesn't mean he hasn't got alot of money altogether.
Another point that the critics question, is the accuracy about the text he wrote about his conversation with Voltaire, which happened many years ago and he wouldn't be possible to remember exact phrases that they spoke about. However, it's proven that he had a journal and it's said that he most likely wrote the hole conversation in his journal the day after they spoke. 
The third and final point is that he didn't really escape out of the prison, but one of his politically well-connected friend in Venice bribed the jailers to free him. Points against that theorie are that there were people with better-connected friends in the prison at the same time, but they couldn't get out because of that too, and there is evidence that the ceiling of his actual room needed to really be repaired.
In conclusion both sides made got points, what you believe and what not is up to you. But keep crirical and don't believe everything you hear.
