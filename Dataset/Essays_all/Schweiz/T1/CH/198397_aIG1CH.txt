Critics claim that the memoirs are not a reliable historical source because they're inaccurate. The woman who held the lecture however is convinced that it is reliable and trys to prove that by bringing in facts and arguments supporting the Chevalier.
She talks about the three different episodes mentioned in the text and brings in supporting arguments for all three of them. The first episode mentioned the Chevalier's time in Switzerland and how he claims in his memoirs that he was very wealthy at that time, which critics doubt since evidence has now surfaced that he borrowed alot of money from am Swiss merchant to afford his parties. The lecturer explains this by saying that his wealth didn't exist in the form of cash but as objects he had to sell and that he only borrowed money when he ran out of cash. Not having cash does not mean you're poor.
The second episode were his conversations with Voltaire, which were criticised because it's impossible to recall full sentences from convesations one's had years ago. In the lecture we hear that the Chevalier always took notes right after the converations and that he consulted these notes while writing the memoirs. This supports the accuracy of the memoirs.
The third and last episode mentioned was his escape from prison. Critics claim that he only wrote this part of the memoires because it "makes for enjoyable reading" and that he just bribed his way to freedom. The lecturer however explains that there were much more powerful people than the Chevalier in that prison and that none of them could bribe their way out, which makes it very unlikely for him to be able to do it. She also says that documents from that time have been found where it say that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape.
