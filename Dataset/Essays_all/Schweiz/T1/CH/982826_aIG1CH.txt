The text I just read is agaist the honesty of what the Chevalier has written in his memoir. The woman in the presentation told me some arguments, that the Chevalier was totally honest in his memoir. 
There are three storys in the memoir the Chevalier has written, about the author of the text and the woman in the presentation movie were discussing. 
First of all, that the Chevalier was living very wealthy and spent a lot of money for gambling and partys, when he was in Switzerland. 
The text sais, that he had to borrow money and in fact of that he couldn't really have been very rich. 
The woman in the presentation argumented against that and said, that the Chevalier was rich, but that he had to borrow some money when he war runnining out of it. 
Second story was, that the Chevalier has met Voltaire and that they had a conversation.
The text sais that in fact of the way how exactly the Chevalier has written down the conversation they had, it can't be true what the Chevalier has written.
To support what the Chevalier has written, the woman sais, that there is evidence, that the Chelvalier has written down all the things he could remember about the conversation he had with the Voltaire, the night after they met. 
Third story they were arguing about was, that the Chevalier has escaped of prison.
The text sais, that the Chevalier had some wealthy friends, who could have payed a bribe to let him out of prison.
The woman sais, that there were prisoners, who had friends who were much wealthier than the friends the Chevalier had, and that their friends didn't pay a bribe either.
