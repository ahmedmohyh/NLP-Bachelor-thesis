Chevalier de Seinglalt wrote a long and very valuable memoir because he hed met many intressting people in his live. But citicers thin that not everything in his memoir is true. For example that he borrowed money in Switzerland from a swiss merchant. They say that Chevalier was rich and didn't need to borrow money. On the other side the speaker told, that Chevalier needed cash and it had taken to long to get cash out of his valuable things. 

An other story the criticers doubt is that the conversation with Voltaire, a famous writer, had really been like he wrote in his memoir, because the say its impossible to remember exact phrases from the meeting. But the speaker told theat he had made notes from this meeting, so possibly he had kept them for years and used them for his memoir.

The last doubtful story in this text ist that he escaped from a prison in Venice. The speaker also doubt about this story, but the ceilling in his former cell had to be repaired after he had been there. So is possible that hi story is true.
