In the presentation, they told about the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt, and what is probable, and what isn't probable to have occured as the Chevalier claimed. First they doubt human ability to memorize facts for years, but according to the Chevalier, he did. But as said, these people doubt this. They agree, that many chevaliers in that time had got valuable things, but they wouldn't say that these people were rich and had a lot of money to spend, just if they would sell these items first they would have got that much money as the Chevalier claimed in his memoirs. They agree that the Chevalier has met Voltaire, but they doubt that -after some years between the meeting and the writing of the memoirs- he could have memorized so much. Of course in this years he has still told and thought about this meeting with Voltaire, but not that much. They don't doubt that this Chevalier borrowed money from a merchant, and because of that, it is probable that the Chevalier had problems with money, because if he hadn't had problems, he wouldn't have needed this money.The Chevalier has written down in his memoirs that he was escaped from a prison in Venice with the help of metal to make make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, but they don't think that he has escaped that way. They have theories about his escape, but they differ from what the Chevalier's memoirs say. They think he could have escaped because of other rich prisoners.
