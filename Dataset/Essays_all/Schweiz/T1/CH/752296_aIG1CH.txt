In the text they say that Chevalier invented or added things which weren't true to make his memoir more intressting so that more people buy it. 

So the first thing they say isn't true is that he didn't was rich because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant but when we compare with the listened part they tell something very diffrently. They say he had to borrow money because when he kind of investet money he had to wait until it arrives and till it arrives he had to borrow money. 
The second aspect is that he wrote in his memoirs about the conversation between Voltair and himself but the problem about that is that he wrote that memoir many years after the conversation with Voltair. The person who says the opposite declares that Chevalier had wirtten down the conversation every time they had met and when he wrote his memoirs he used them to write down correctly the talk with Voltair and him. 
Now the least one is about the escape of Chevalier out of a prison just with using a piece of metal which he needed to make a hole in the ceiling about that they say he just used his powerful friends to get out of the prison the explanation of the the person who presented a text is that in the prison were even more prisoners with more powerful friends who couldn't escape and after Chevalier escaped they had to repare the ceiling of Chevaliers prison habitant.
