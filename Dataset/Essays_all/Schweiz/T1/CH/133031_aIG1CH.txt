Toward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recouting his life and adventures. The Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure, but since he met many famous people, including kings and writers, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. 
For example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, and its known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. However, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.
Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. No one doubts that theChevalier and Voltaire met and conversed. However, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occured. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations held many years ealier. 
I just rewrite the text from above, because I am very bored. And I am not interested in this measure. They didn't even ask me if I want to take part in it.
