The text is very critical about Chevalier de Seingalt so the lecture explains that the criticals are wrong. In the text they say that Chevalier's memories had become a valuable history sorce about European society but they think the events in his memory were made more exciting and glamorous than they realy were. In the lecture the woman explains that no memory is like it realy happenend, every person thinks in another way about a situation and the memories can change in time. Also thay say that Chevalier wasn't rich and that he had to borrow money because he spend it on parties and gambling. The womans opinion ist that he was rich but he had to wait for his money. The last point was that the critics think that Chevalier didn't escape from the Venetian prison, it was just invented to make his memory more enjoyable and that the jailers were bribed to free him. To this opinion the woman in the lecture says that the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repared after his ascape and otherwise it wouldn't make any sense. And she added that other jailer's had a lot more friends who could've helped them but they couldn't ascape. So she thinks that the criticals are wrong about Chevalierde Seingalt.
