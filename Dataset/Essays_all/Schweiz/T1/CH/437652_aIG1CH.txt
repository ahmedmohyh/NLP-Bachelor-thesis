In the Text is written that the Chevalier de Seingalt that he had tp borrow his money from another person. So had the Critics said that if he had really been rich, he haven't needed to borrow money. In the spoken part they have an other look on this story. They said, just because you have to borrow money you don't have to be poor. Sometimes you have to borrow money to get something started. Like a little help to do something you can't do without money. 
The story from the prison escape is also busted in the Critics. The spoken part say they had to renovate the Prison after his escape. So, why should they renovate something when it's not broken? But the memoir's are very old and you are never sure, it's never really safe that something is wright that happens in the past. But sometimes memoir's are the only source of something in the past.
