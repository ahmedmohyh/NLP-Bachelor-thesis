A person who read the memoire would say that Chevalier de Seingalt has had a very exciting and glamorous life, but is this true? Some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoire. There are many pro's and contra's that speak for or against the truthness of Seintgalt's book.

A main question is if this memoire really is accurate. Some claim that the memoire was only written towards the end of his life but Chevaliers wives and girlfriends said that he wrote almost every day in a diary and read that for inspiration to write his memoire. So why would he write in a diary every day to lie about his life in his memoire? Same thing with Voltaire. People said that they saw them together there are more pro arguments that contras.

Secondly, Chevalier was a rich man. He spent a huge amount of his money for parties and otherexciting things. As he spent all of his money to gain more money he had to borrow sums of money from a Swiss merchant otherwhise he would have had a complicated life without any money. 

Another highly discussed topic is the escape of prison. Chevalier was a very famous man to that time, he had many friends who could have helped him but on the other hand other prisoners had that too. So why should he had help to escape and others had not. He claims to have escaped the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Clearly there are people thinking that this is a lie but other people saw the prison repairing the ceiling on this particular cell, why would they repair the ceiling if nothing like this happened. With this repair they revealed the mystery of the escape. 

The 100 percent accuracy isn't given but there's clearly a true point in the memoire of Chevalier.
