First of all, the soundtrack said a lot of things which are in common with the text but nevertheless there are a few things which are different. In the soundtrack the woman said that no memoir can be that exact like this from the Chevalier de Seingalt and that he inclouded interesting memoirs to make it look more exciting and glamourus and the text said it could be that his life was exactly that way. But it gives also  many critics about the stories.
 The first thing was that the Chevalier was, when he was in Switzerland, he took lone from the virgint and the people thought that he was very poor, but at the same time he spent a lot of money for making party and things like that. The truth was, he wasn`t poor, he just waited for someone to bring him his money everytime.
the second argument from the woman was that he never could wrote everything down from the conversation with Voltaire. It`s not possiple to keep the whole sentences in your mind for such a long period of time and the text also says that`s impossible because the phrases are writtne many years after the conversation.
the third argument was that he could not just escape with a piece of metal from a prison in Venice. There were many other people who were more powerful than him. So there were certanly other people with influence who helped him out.
