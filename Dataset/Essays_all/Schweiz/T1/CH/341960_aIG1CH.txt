During the lecture, three points that critics of the Chevalier often take as evidence for the inaccuracy and unreliability of his texts were adressed: The Chevalier`s escape from a prison in Venice, the accuracy of his texts about his conversations with Voltaire and the fact that he, an otherwise wealthy man, had to borrow money from a merchant in Switzerland. Historians doubt the escape through the cielling, saying that the Chevalier most likely bribed his way out of there. Evidence for that would be that he had quiet a lot of important friends in Venice. however, many other prisoners had friends that had even more influence and they couldn`t bribe out either. Also, there are records from after his escape saying that the cielling had to be fixed. Critics also doubt that his conversations with Voltaire, which he certainly had, aren`t accurate, as there were many years between conversation and writing the memoires. There is evidence however that the Chevalier wrote most of the conversations, or what he rememberd of them, the same evening that he had had them. According to records of his friends, while writing the memoires he often consulted his notes that he made beforehand. And then there`s the thing about borrowing money. Of course a wealthy man wouldn`t need to do that, but since he lost a part of it in Switzerland by gambeling and spending it on parties, he had to borrow money. The lecture states that most likely a lot of the Chevalier`s wealth was in form of things that you can sell to get money, not money itself, and while waiting for said money, he had to borrow some from a swiss merchant. Overall, most of the Chevalier`s memoires are a reliable source of knowledge about the european society of the 18th century.
