First of all I want to say that Chevalier had tree interesting points in his entire life. He spent a lot of many for gambling and parties. In the text it is said that he was wealth and he borrowed a lot of money. But that is not completly correct. He worked hard for the money he spent. He wanted to do something good. It is also said that Chevalier met Voltaire and that they had loads of conversations. That is true. But the text sais that this meetings are not covered by an evidence. In the tape they told that Chevalier saved all the conversations he had with Voltaire in a kind of script. The last point i want to mention in this short summary is that Chevalier broke out of a prison. The text sais that the jailers were brided to free him. He had some well-connetcted friends who could help him. But what was it really like? In Venice he had not have the best friends. He was alone and he broke out of the prison without the help of well- connected friends. The evidence is clear. The sealing of his chamber or haw you like to name it had been repared. 

Well, Chevaliers life from 1725 till 1789 was not one of the easiest. He had to proove himself in loads of situations. But what criticists made with his story is definitely not what it really was. Why dont they leave him rest in peace after a hard life of a fight and appreciate what he really did?
