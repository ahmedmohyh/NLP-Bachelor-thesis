The text said that the Chevalier de Seinglat had make is memoir mor intresting with invented things which aren't right.

In the english speaking they said that many people said he was poor but he wasn't poor because he only borrowed money. But in the text they said he was rich and they critices that it wasen't true. In the diffrent texts they said the opposide.
The text said that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire was written many years after the conversation, but the expose said that Chevalier wrote the conversation during the conversation and not after. So the memoir are right and not invended.
In the text it is written that they point out that the Chevalier had a number of politically friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. But in the expose they said that many prisoner in Venice had a number of politically freinds and they didn't escape. So the expose said also that the prison had to clean his old prison room after he has left the prison, thats a point which is for the escape with a piece of metal.
