The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir, which is according to the speech very reliable. Though, in the Text it is mentioned that the Chevalier who was living in Switzerland was poor. Maybe he was kind of poor, but in the speech poor is used in a different way. Of course, when he ran out of cash and has to borrow money from other merchants to finance his parties and gambling it seems that he is poor. However, that does not really necessarily mean that he is poor. If he was rich he could have financed it himself. The speech also talked about his wealth, which he had to sell, that he gets more money. 

Chevalier claimed that he had a conversation with Voltaire. Criticist of his memoire claim that he could not confirm that. In the speech it was perfectly said that he actually consulted notes in a journal, which definitely confirms that he spoke to Voltaire. There is certainly a way to criticize that statement, but there is actually enough proof. 

The last thing Chevalier wrote in his memoire is that he escaped from a prison in Venice. Chevalier claimed that he made a hole in the ceiling. But it was extremely hard to believe that he really escaped through the ceiling.

Conclusively, the Chevalier had some true stories in his memoire. Though they seem sometimes a little bit exaggerated. That is why there is a lot of critics
