The Chavalier de Seingalt was a famous person in history. He wrote his memoires about meeting other famous people and the conversations he had with them. We know a lot of his life, for example his wealth. He lived in Switzerland and was a wealthy man. He had enough money to enjoy his life. When there was no money he just borrowed it and payed it back some days later. It is known that he spent a lot of time at parties, where he met famous people, who were wealthy as he was. Gambling was typical for him. One of the well known person he met, was Voltaire. A man who, used to be very important at the time of the French revolution. In his memoires Chavalier wrote down, that he had couple of conversation with Voltaire. Probably he met him at a party. Because of the conversations he had with a man like Voltaire and other person, Chavalier is a source for European society. His memoires are imortant for analizing historical content at the time of the French revolution. 
It is also known that Chavalier did not spent his whole life at partys, there was a time he was kept in a prison of Venice in Italy. Roumors say, that he was able to escape using an object made of metal but others say, that the wealthy Chavalier had friends in Venice which payed a bide to the prisoniers to let him go. 
However, we can not say everything in his memoires is true, but can give hints to the life the people lived in the 18th centoury.
