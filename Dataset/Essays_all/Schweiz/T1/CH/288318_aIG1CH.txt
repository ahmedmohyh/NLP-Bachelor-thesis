Well the Chevallier was a wealthy man who lived in switzerland and had a story about money because he liked to gamble a lot. Many people harmed him for doing what he did.. that's pretty much all I remember from the text. So I'm just gonna write something right now because I don't want the attendant to see that I wrote nothing. In a way I'm doing the right thing because the ones who are doing these studies just want to test the pupils English capabilities. And because of that I give them what they want in another sense. This text is probably the funniest thing you're going to read while you are reading all the essays of my colleagues so be thankful for that. There is a thing I want to know about those studys: How did you manage to convince the school to be a part of that?  Because if it would'nt have been a serious thing to which every student had to come I would have canceled the thing. I have other things to do rather then be a part of a study during monday afternoon after a weekend undone homework and learning. So it's not my fault that I'm not motivated, it's rather your fault because of your dates do you really think I'm going to write the whole afternoon either monday or friday four hours straight? Maybe you misunderstood there something. Thank you for your time, thank me for my time.
