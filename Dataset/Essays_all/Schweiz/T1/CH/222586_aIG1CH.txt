The lecture defends the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. While the text mentions the critics point of view, the lecture mainly consists of evidence that his memoir is accurate. There are three main incidents mentioned in both.

Albeit the text saying that if the Chevalier would have been as rich as he stated in his memoir, he wouldn't have been compelled to borrow money from a swiss merchant, the lecture considers him having had lots of property and as a rule having had to wait a few days before the deal was settled and his money arrived thus he borrowed money which he later payed back. 

While the text assumes that Chevaliers conversation can not have been described in the memoir in such stunning accuracy, reciting exact lines of their dialogue after a couple of years had passed, the lecture says that he had the habit of taking notes right after he conversed with Voltaire. Hence it was possible that the memoir is true. 

It is common knowlege that there were very powerful people with a lot of political influence in Venice at the time mentioned. Some of them were in prison, so that dismantles the theory that the Chevalier bribed the guards in his time in the prison in Venice. Because although he was also an important and influential figure, the infamous prison in Venice seems to have been unbribable.
