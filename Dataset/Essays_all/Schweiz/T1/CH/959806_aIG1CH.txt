The text says that the Chevalier spent a lot of money at parties and gamblings. Critics mean that this was not the case because they think he was poor and always had to borrow money from other people. But the women in the presentation thinks that he was very wealthy but borrowed money from his friends to do something with the money so that in the end he had a lot more than he borrowed. He could give back the money and had enough to go to parties and live a good life. She says that there is a property you have to sell first. 
The second thing the critics say he is a liar are the conversations with Voltaire. The women thinks that it could be true that the Chevalier had long conversations with Voltaire. He just wrote down everything he remembered from the conversations at the exact same evening so that he could consult his note during writing his memoires years later. 
And the last thing critics say he was not saying the truth is his esxape from the prison in Venice. They say he had influental friend that were bribed to free him. But never in the history the jailers of this prison a person had let go a person and in this prison were people who had much more influental friends than the Chevalier. The woman says that they renovated the ceiling during his stay in the prison. So he could climb trough the hole in the ceiling that was there from the renovation and had not to make a hole by himself
