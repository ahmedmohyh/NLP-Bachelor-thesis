It's for sure that Chevaliers memoirs are very interesting and that they had become an important source about European societa in the eighteenth century but it's also sure that memoirs aren't always true. Some things are invented just to make them more exciting for the readers. There are some critics on chevaliers memoir but they are very controverse.
For example, in his memoirs Chevalier says that he was very wealthy. This must be true because he spent a great amount of money on parties and gambling. He borrowed the money from a swiss merchant. critics now argue that he wasn't wealthy. They say that he was poor. But is borrowing money to give it back later really poore?
Another argument is also his time with Voltaire. there is no doubt he hadn't had coversations with him but the critics still complain that alot of the conversations in his memoirs are invented. You can't remember a conversaton word by word after many years. this also is just an unimportant detail. In chevaliers memoir is written that he wrote down nearly the whole conversation between him and Voltaire.
Thridly, the critics argue  about is breack out of the venice prison. In this prison where so many people with much more influental friends wich could have helped them to get out of the prison. so why should he have had the luck to get out of there? there is no other way to think hta
