In the text, it is said that the Chevalier was kind of a liar because he invented all of his stories to make himself more interesting. However we just heard that even though no memoir can possibly keep everything correct in detail it is still a very reliable source that can bring up many things from the past. 
Let's take a look at the Chevalier's time he spent in Switzerland. The speaker told us that the Chevalier was not poor at all, he spent much money and had wealth but he also had much property that he couldt convert into money. 
Another example that is mentioned which is about the Chevalier's talks with Voltaire says that it is impossible to keep every single detail of a conversation in mind for such a long time. Nevertheless the speaker talked about the Chevalier's habit to write down everything he could remember from his conversation he just had in every night. There are even witnesses who can confirm this statement.
In the end we learn from the speaker that some prisonners in Venice had friends that were way more powerful than the Chevalier's. And still these prisonners had never escaped. Another argument is the ceiling of the Chevalier's prison cell that had to be repaired after soon his escape.
All these statements show us that it is very common to hear things which seem to be true but are possibly invented.
