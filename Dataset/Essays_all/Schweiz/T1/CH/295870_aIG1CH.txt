The fact that the Chevalier loaned money from a swiss merchant doesn`t prove, that he was poor. He was gambling and due to that, he ran out of money. That`s a normal thing, while later the Chevalier also won some money back for gambling. This is the reason why it was a clever move to loan money from the merchant in Switzerland. At least, that`s what the presentation says. The text doesn`t agree on the idea of the presentation when it says, that if the Chevalier really would have been very wealthy, there would have been no need for him to loan money from this merchant.
Another event of the Chevalier`s life that is interpretated differently by both, the text and the presentation are his meetings with the famous Voltaire. While the text says that it`s impossible to write down the exact phrases of their conversations years later when the memoir was written, the presentation says that there is an evidence that agrees to the Chevalier`s ideas: "The Chevalier made notes after every meeting as he returned to his slepping place."
About the prison in Venice, well the text says it is impossible to escape through the roof. He was helped by his important friends. However,the presentation notices that he`s companions in the jail also had some even more important friends than him and they weren`t rescued. They think that they found a proof of the real way of escape due to that some week after his escape the roof in his cell had to be repaired
