The text and the listening tell us informations about Chevalier and his memoir. The text claims, that many events are fake and the listening the opposite.
In the text is said, that Chevalier wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. But some critics claim that many little stories of his memoir are distorted or invented to make his life seem more exiting. The text says, that Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and that recently evidence surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed sums of money. But in the listening is said, that it is normal to borrow money, because the wealthy people had sometimes something (i don't remember exactely what it was) so they didn'thave money for e few days.
In the text is written, that Chavalier cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written manyyears after the conversations occured. But what i think i heard in the listening was, that he always wrote everything down he could remember of that day. And that Chavalier kept the conversation a long time.
Critics also questioned the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. Chevalier claimed to have escaped by usinga piece of metal to make a hole intheceiling and that the climed through the roof. In the listening is mentioned, that the prison had to repair the ceiling a bit later.
