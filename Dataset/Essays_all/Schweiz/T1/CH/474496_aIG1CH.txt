It is a fact that memoirs aren't 100 precent accurate. Despite that, the memoir of Chevalier is very reliable. Critics say, that most of the events Chevalier claims to be real, are invented fantasy stories to make his life seem more exciting. Still, there is some  evidence that one can assume his stories are mostly true. The text suggests that while living in Switzerland, he could not really be rich because of the fact that he borrowed money. But the argument stands, that that not really means that he was poor. Actually it was normal to recieve money a few days late and so to throw these expensive parties he borrowed money while waitng for hiw own to come. In the next story it is belived that Chevalier always wrote down notes and kept them for years. Witnesses confirmed that he had kept diaries and journals for years. So we can assume that Chevalier had very vivid memories of the stated conversation and helped to back them up whit his notes. But critics also questioned his escape from a venetian prison. It is written that Chevalier used a piece of metal to dig a hole in the ceiling to climb out. Yet people belive that his contacts with wealthy politicans got him out of jail. But one can argue, that there were prisoners with far more influencial friends that he had. There also were very old venetian documents found , which state that the celing of Chevaliers cell had to be repaired. This leady to belive that this story is probably true.
