Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir, which has beeing critisised in many ways. The lecturer says that in the three cases meantend in the text above there are arguments why it is possible that these things really happened.

First of all, while he was living in Switzerland, Chevalier claims he was very wealthy, but he had to borrow money. Explaination of the lecturer: in this time you had to sell something to get money and because the money did not arrive in time, Chevalier had to borrow some from a Swiss merchant.

Second was the conversations with Voltaire where he would pararise whole sentences of Voltaire. This is possible because Chevalier took notes after every conversation with Voltaire, that is why in his memoir these conversations are very detailed.

The third thing meantend in the text is his escape from a notorious prison in Vencie.The proof that he did not just espace with the help of his powerfull friends are some old documents, they proof that after Chevaliers escape the ceilling of his cell had to be repaired and also the fact that there where prisoners with much more powerfull friends then Chevalier had.
