The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt have a lot more accuracy than its been descibed in the Text. For example while he was living in Switzerland he was very wealthy. But his wealth was made out of objects, for example furnitures. It cost a lot of time to change his belongings into cash so when he ran out of money he had to borrow cash. Because he was practicing such a costful lifestyle he didn't had time to wait for the changing money.
The critics are also sceptical about his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. In the this point the critics were right to say, that it is impossible to remembber the whole conversation, but that exatcly is the point. The critics didn't think about the possibillity, that Chevalier only wrote down what he could remember. In most cases Chevalier of course took notes, so that he could easily write them down many years after the conversation happend.
The answer for the question the critics ask about an other capitel in the book is hilarious. They say that he only claims to have escaped from the Prison in Venice, Italy. And just wrote that in his memoir because it , would be more enjoyable to read the book. But that he was freed is even more unrealistic because in the prison there were other prisoners with much more power and money, it would have been easy fot them to get freed. Also the cell were Chevalier was captured had to be repared after his escape/freedom.

In conclusion many of the critics questions and doubts are easily and logically to explain.
