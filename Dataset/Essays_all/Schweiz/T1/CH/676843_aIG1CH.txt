All the arguments are doubting if the memoir of Chevalier is true or if it's just his imagination or if it is just an invention of others. So one of the most significant points was the one with the question wether the Chevalier is rich or poor. Beacaus he often spent money on gambling and on parties and he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, but just because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant he shouldn't be considered as poor. Perhaps he knew how to handle money or had some extra money we don't know about. Another argument against his memoir, they doubt his escape from the prison in Venice. If he really escaped the way he scubscribed in his memoir, "make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof". They shouldn't had to repair the wall of his prison cell because how he said he went through the ceiling. 
They also talk about his conversations with Volontaire. Critics say that he wrote these conversations after some years. But in the presentation they told us, that he wrote down or at least took some notes after each conversation. So perhaps it's true what he wrote and wasn't just from his imagination. 
So the whole presentation is very critical and they discuss many diffrent point from this story, how many of them are real and how many of them came frome his imagination.
