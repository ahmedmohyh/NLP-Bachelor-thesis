Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his live, today we do not know, if it is true or not. The arguments are not bad, but they can be easily rejected.

Firstly there is the story about his life in Switzerland, where he was gambling and making parties. Because he sometimes did not have cash, he had to borrow it. This does not mean, that he was poor. He just could not sell his stuff fast enough to finance his parties.

Secondly the story about meeting Voltaire. Chevalier wrote all his memories down, but did not publish them untli years after their meeting and friends of Chevalier all said that he actually met him.

Thirdly we want to talk about the escape out of prison. Of course there is a possibility, that the wealhy friends of Chevalier offerd a bribe to the jailers. But the controversial thing about this is, that there were much wealthier and more important people in prison, which could not escape due to a bribe and the ceilling on the roof of the former prison cell of Chevalier had to be removed after his escape.
