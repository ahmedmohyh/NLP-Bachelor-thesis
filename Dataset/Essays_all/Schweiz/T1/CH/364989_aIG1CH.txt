No doubt the Chevalier, who lived between 1725 and 1798 is an important historical figure from the eighteenth century. But some of the events are not sure to be the way, the chevalier describes it in his memoir. 

It is easy to make an event more interesting than it really is when inventing something new or change some things. Some people think that the Chevalier did exactely these things. For example they think, that the chevalier can't have been wealthy in Switzerland, because he had to borrow money. 
In the memoire it is written that the Chevalier met Voltaire, and he describes exactely what they did that night and what they talked about. Critics do not doubt that they accutaly met but they say that the details are not true, because the Chevalier wrote this part in the memoire many years later. They also think, that the Chevalier invented his escape through the ceiling out of a Venetian prison. They say that he bribed his way out of prison.

But other sources defens the Chevalier. They say that it is normal to borrow money, because it takes some time to get your own money when you win some in gambling.They also say that it is also possible to remember the exact details of a conversation if you take notes immediately afterwards. The escape through the ceiling may also be true. There were many other men in the Venetian prison with far more influence and power that the Chevalier. But even these men didn't manage to get out of prison with bribing.
