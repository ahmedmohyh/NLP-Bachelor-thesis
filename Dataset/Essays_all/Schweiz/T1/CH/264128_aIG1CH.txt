The Chevalier wrote a memoir about his experiences in life. He wrote about a lot of social members. This is now really helpful for us to reconstruct the society of the eighteenth century. 
But there are some Critics who are sceptical about the accuracy of his writing. 
There are three cases which were strange. 
The Chevalier wrote about being very rich. In the text beneath they say he hadn't had a lot of money. In the presentation they say he wasn't exactly poor. He just had to sell his proberty, so he was forced to wait till his money arrived. He needed to get a credit, so he could pay for all the expensives parties. 
He also wrote about the conservation i had with Voltaire. In the text it is claimed that his memoir was written long time after having this conversation, but nevertheless  he still knew every detail. They think this is impossile. But I believe to have understood in the presentation, that they also believe that the Chevalier had made some notes right after the conversation with Voltaire. So it is possible that e wrote such a specific text about this conversation.
The last suspected thing they found was his escape out of the prison of Venice. The author of the text beneath wrote that he could have had friends which knew to be influental and that those freinds could have helped him eith the escape. But the person who held the presentation said that there where other prisoners which had more influental contacts and could't escape. There is also prove that they had to repair the cell where the Chevalier was arrested in.
