Accuracy of Chevalier

The controversy about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) is about, if the things he wrote about are true and be considered as a historical source, or if he fantasiesed about his life, to make it more interesting.
There are several moments of his life which seem false, but could be true. The first one is, that he said, in Switzerland he was rich and made parties, was gambling and spend a lot of money. The contra-side argues, that there  are documents, were it is described, that he borrowed money and since he should have been rich, there shouldn't be any need, to borrow money. The other side argues, in that time, you had to wait for your money and since he needed the money immediatly, he borrowed it and paid it back later. The second moment is, that he wrote down very clearly his conversations with Voltaire, but since his memoir was written years after, he couldn't have possibly remembered all of it. But there are sources, that claim, that Chevalier wrote down many conversation he had with Voltaire and that he carried most of the time a notebook with him. The last one is about his prison escape in Venetian. He wrote, that he made a holein the roof with a piece of metal, but since he had influencial friends, it would be more plausable, to bribe the prison. But the pro-Chevalier side argues, that in that prison, there were more powerfull man than him, who didn't 'escape' and that there are documents, which claim to have repaires the roof of the prison, after Chevalier's escape.
The memoir is is doubtable, because of his extraordinary events, but can still be argued true and since there are important accurate historical figures in his memoir, some believe, that one can consider it as a historical source.
