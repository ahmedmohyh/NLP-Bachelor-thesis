The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt was long claimed to not be accurate. Eventhough one had doubts and gave examples for them, we know that his memoir is a reliable historical source. 

First, the statement that the Chevalier wasn't rich can't be true. Even if they may be evidence that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, the Chevalier was a wealthy man. He earned money through investing.

The doubt that the Chevalier could remember conversation with Voltaire from years ago, is right - it's simply not possible. However, the conversations were still accurately captured! It has been proved that the Chevalier wrote down every single conversation he held with Voltaire the same evening. When he wrote his memoir, he used his notes to help him remember the conversations.

Chevaliers escape of the Venetian prison is doubted unnecessarily. There is evidence from documents of the Venetian government that he wasn't bribed out of prison. 

Even if critics doubt the accuracy of the Chevaliers memoir, it can be proved that his life was recorded the way it actually happened. Thanks to the Chevalier, we have a valuable source of European society.
