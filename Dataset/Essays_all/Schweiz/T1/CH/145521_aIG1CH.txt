It's possible that it wasn't all true what Chevalier said but there are facts which proof that he wasn't only lying.
Chevalier spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. His money wasn't anymore cash. That's the reason why he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. He was rich but he hadn't money at this moment in his hands. Chevalier had many conversations with the famous write Voltaire. After the conversations he wrote at night the phrases from the conversations. They have met and conversed a lot because that the Critics thought it couldn't be possible that he could remember all the phrases from the conversations. But in real he had just many conversations with Voltaire through the years.
When Chevalier was in a prison in Venice and he really escaped. There were a lot of prisonier in the prison and this prisonier had contact with rich people. Chevalier had no contact with other guys in Italy. But the rich people couldn't get the other prisonier out with their money. Chevalier had nobody and he wanted to escape. The ceiling in his room wasn't the newest one. It wasn't hard anymore. It needed to be repaird because that he escaped from the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
