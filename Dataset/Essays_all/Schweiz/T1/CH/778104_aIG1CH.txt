The chevalier controversy

The chevalier is mostly quoted as a very reliable source in history. But we all know that sources are never completly true. Some even say that the chevalier is one big lie. Now what isn't and what is, is something we can't figure out but let's discuss some points.
Cevalier de Seingalt(1725-1798) has written a lot about his adventures. For example he, for some time, lived in Switzerland .There he claimed to have lived a wealthy live. But it is known that he has borrowed a lot of money. On the contrary we also know that he invested a lot of his money in to objects he then had to convert back to money when in need. But if that wasn't possible he hadt to borrow money from a merchant.
He also has written about his conversationes with de Voltaire. He claimsto have made notes after every conversation he had with de Voltaire. But the story has been written many years later. That sparked a lot of critisism. They say he can't have remembered all the details. On the other hand ther are ZEUGEN that confirmed that Chevalier has consulted his notes when writing.
An other very controversial story is his prisonbreak. His narration of it is quite adventerous. So that it is good to read. The critics claim that he has bribed the the guards into letting him free. But other more important persons have tried to escape the feared venetian prison by bribing the guards. They all failed. Also known is that right after his escape the roof of his cell had to be repared. Now that can't be a coincidence, can it?
He might be a great liar. He might be a great adventourer. Fact is the stories are great and he's got quite a resume .
