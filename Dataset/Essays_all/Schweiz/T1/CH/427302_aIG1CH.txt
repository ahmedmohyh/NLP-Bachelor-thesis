Chevalier de Seingalt's accords of his life, are presumed to be pretty accurate, even with all of the critisism. With historical research, the points that the critics make can be easily refuted.

It is said, that Chevalier was indeed very rich. Not with physical money, but with assets, that he sold, in order to party and gamble. In the period of selling his assets, he would have had to borrow money, in order to continue his lifestyle. 

His conversations with Voltaire, the content of which critics say is impossible to remember, Chevalier wrote down, the night after they happend. This can be confirmed by people close to him, saying that he kept jurnals with him at all times.

Chevalier bribing the guard is the last point to be refuted. The accusation that he bribed the guards to let him out, is not very likely, since many other rich people in the prison were not able to bribe the guards. Additionally, there were old prison records that state, that Chevalier escaped, and that they had to repair the ceiling after he did.
