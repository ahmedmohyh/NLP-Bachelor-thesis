I have never heard about the Chevalier before, but this ended today. In the presentation they talked about the money in Switzerland, the converstation with Voltaire and the prisonbreak in Venice. There aren't many diffrents between the presentation and the short text, but some point are visible.

Firstly, they said that Chevalier wasn't really poor. Actually, he spent a lot of money in Switzerland at parties. Although, this money didn't come from nowhere. He traded with some things and then he gained this money.

Secondly, there was the conversation with Voltaire. He remembered a great deal of sentences, but he talked with Voltaire years ago. It is likely that he invented some phrases.

Nevertheless, the jailers had to repair the jail after Chevalier escaped. This could lead to the thought that he hasn't paid to get free. The story of using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof could be a true one. 

In conclusion, the text contains a lot of things in the presentation. Furthermore, it's very difficult to find any differences. When I read the story once again and hear the presentation once again I start to believe that these points are just small details.
