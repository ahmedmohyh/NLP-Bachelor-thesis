The Chevalier wrote a memoir. There are many critics about how true the things in his memoir are. Some people think that he inventet some events to make his memoir more exiting and glamorous.
For example he wrote that he was very wealthy during the time he lived in Switzerland and that he spend a lotof money on parties and gambling. But there are some evindence that he borrowed a lot of money. 
An other exemple is that he worte about conversations he had with the famous writer Volair. Ciritics say that it is impossible to remember e phrase exactly how it was for such a long time. Some other people say that this phrases can be true becouse he every evening after a conversation with Voltaire he took some notes. When he wrote his memoir he took these notes as a source. 
A third point that critics question is the part about how he escaped the Venetian prison. The Chevalier wrote that used a piece of metal tomake a hole in the ceiling and that he then climbed through the roof. Critics think that is more realistic that the jailers were bribed to free him. This is more believeble because the Chevalier had some politically well-connected frieds in Venice. But against this argument is the fact that the seiling had to be repaird right after the Chevalier escaped.
