The presentation told us that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt would be pretty accurate. The presentator told us that he really did spend a huge amount of money on partying. But to get his money, he had so sell some of his properties first.He had to wait until that money arrived. That's why he had to borrow some money first to throw his partys. The text claims though that he was poor excatly because he had to borrow money. 
The presentation gave us the information that Chevalier met up with Voltaire. After every meet-up, he wrote his conversation down. Or at least he tried to remember everything and wrote it then down. Many years later, he used these notes to write his memoir. The text tells us otherwise. It couldn't be possible for Chevalier to write down each and every sentence Voltaire said. So the memoir couldn't be that accurate.
The third information was, that Chevalier escaped an Venetian jail through a hole in the ceiling that he made by himself. One couldn't really argue with that fact because the Venetian governement still has some information on that. They've got a letter that proves that after Chevalier escaped, they had to repair the ceiling of his cell. Why would they repair the ceiling of the cell he was in, if he didn't damage it? The text claim tells us, that it's really unlikely that Chevalier escaped by himself. He sure had some connections with important people. Also in Venice as well. So Chevalier probably escaped with the help of them.
