Its true that Chevalier was a wealthy man and defenitely not poor but he did spend a lot of money to companies and so he sometimes had to wait a few day for getting money and that was the reason why he sometimes had to borrow money. Chevalier did write down each night before going to bed what he had talked about with his friends and what they were discussing about. So now we know how he could know what the conversations were about so precicely. As Chevalier was in prison he noticed that other people in prison had much more powerful friends outside which could help them to get out of prison and bribe them. As Chevalier came out of prison the ceiling of his prison-cell had to be renewed and so there was a chance that he wanted to escape.
