The lecture tries to reply to the arguments in the text and explain, why the doubts in the text are nothing to mention. First, the text argues that the Chevalier is not a reliable historical source because he lied about his wealth. As the writer says, the Chevalier was known to be very rich, but while he lived in Switzerland, he had to borrow money from others all the time. The woman in the lecture explains this circumstances with the fact, that he didn't have a large amount of cash, but objects that were much worth. So, he had to borrow money till he could transform his stuff to cash.
Second, the writer says that he lied in the transcription of a conversation held with the writer Voltaire. He has written this transcription many years after the conversation, so he could not remember every detail. The women replies that he made notes while or directly after the conversation and was able to rely on them when he wrote the conversation down.
And as last, the writer says that the Chevalier has shown his own prison break way too spectacular. He has rather had just influent friends in the government that let him out. The lecture woman replies that other prisoners had much more influent friends outside than the Chevalier and they were not able to escape.
