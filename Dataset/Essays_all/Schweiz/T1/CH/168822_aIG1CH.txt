Both the text and the audio imply three main parts: His gamble-life in Switzerland, his memories of the conversations with Voltaire and his escape from a prison in venice.

The presentation said, that no memoire can be completely accurate and yet the Chevaliers seems to be pretty close to the truth. Also the text sais, that his memoire has been an important source for historical research.
Coming back to his time in Switzerland, the person presenting the chevalier in the audio mentioned him having gambled quite frequently, as it is also mentioned in the text. But whilte in latter it's unclear on whether he'd borrowed the money for gambling or whether he'd actually been more or less rich, the audio sais, that it's more likely that he'd had financial aid from some of his friends.
The chevalier also noted several conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. The person in the audio mentioned notes, the chevalier had taken after some of those encounters with Voltaire and even people having stated to have seen the Chevalier using those notes to reproduce those conversations between himself and Voltaire. The text on the other hand seems more sceptical, it mentions criticism from several people, who firmly beleive that it's impossible to remeber conversations in such detail as to write them down way after the actual encounter of the two people and note statements which had been made years before.
Regarding the Chevaliers escape from the prison in venice, the audio sais that bribery is rather unlikely to have been his way, since the prison had had inmates with more powerful connections than the chevalier. And the Chevaliers cell-roof had to be repared after he had escaped. The text sais the exact opposite, that it's unlikely that the Chevalier had escaped through the roof, eventhough it seems like a more interesting read. The text suggests bribery.
