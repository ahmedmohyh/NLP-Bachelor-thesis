I think the presentation of the woman with the nice voice and the text are in many parts the same, but there are also a few differents which are very strange if we compare that, what is written or sayed by the woman:

Let's make an example in the end of the text, where I can see a part that isn't the same in the two stories. In the presentation the woman doesn't loose any word about jailers who bribed him to free. But in the text it is a very central thing.

I think diffrents like this are normal in a story like this because everyone tells the story a little bit different to their children and they do the same with their children. Like this the text become more and more different to the text of another narrator. This is very exciting because at the and you have many stories which were once the same but now every narrator tells them another way.
