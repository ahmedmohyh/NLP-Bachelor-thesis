The text mention all the doubt that people have about the truth of the essay of Chevalier de Seingalt.
The woman on the other hand give arguments and reasons why she think that everything that he wrote could be the truth.
I will now go point by point through the situation where criticers have doubt if this really happend how he said.

1. The doubt that he could'nt be rich because he have to borrow a lot money. But an explaintation could be that he wasen't poor he had just very much property which he have to spent and than have to wait for the money to arrive.

2. The criticers say that he couldn't be able to write about conservations in his memoir which had been happening a long time ago. But there is the option that he could take notes every evening about the day and that he wrote whole very importants sentences down. Thats how he could have been able to remeber some sentences with the excactly same words.

3. And there is also the thing with prison. You have to know that there were many other prisoners who had more powerful friends and they couldn't get out. It's unrealistic that someone with less powerful contacts could get out while so many others couldn't. And it's also a important detail that after he escaped they had to repared the ceiling so that proves that someone ruind it. And maybe that was exactly Chevalier with his piece of metal...
