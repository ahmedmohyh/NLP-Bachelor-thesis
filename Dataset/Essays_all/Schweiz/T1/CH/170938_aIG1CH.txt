Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir which was about his life and adventures and it has become a valuable source about European society in the eighteen century. In the presentation it's said that as he lived in Switzerland for some time, he had a big amount of money. The text says that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant which is a sign that he was actually poor but it's said that his money arrived some time later than he spent it so he wasn't poor, he only had to wait for his money being arrived.The women also pointed out that he noted the conversation with Voltaire only some days later down in his journal and that he used those notes years later to write his memoir. The writer of the text didn't know about this journal, so he thought that the phrases written down are not accurate because the memoir was written a long time after the conversation. To come to the third point in the presentation it's mentioned that there were persons who stayed in the prison with much stronger politically well-connected friends and that they also didn't suceeded in escaping. And that they had to repair the room in which he stayed. The text does not have the same opinion on this point and he says that Chevalier wrote those things down to make his life to seem more exciting and glamorous than it actually was. Finally the text raises many doubts which are declared in the presentation.
