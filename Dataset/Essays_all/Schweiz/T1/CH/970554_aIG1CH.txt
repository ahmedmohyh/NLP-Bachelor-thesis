The presentator starts of saying that memories cannot be given back word by word and as detailed as the Chevalier de Seingalt did in his memoir, and therefore looks critical at the things he writes about. The text also looks at the memoir critical and calls Chevalier a controversal figure. Although presentation and text both have a critical point of view on the memoir of Chevalier, the text points out the critics and contradicitons stronger than the presentation. The presentatior defends the Memoir and gives reasons to think Chevalier didn't lie. First critical point mentioned is Chevalies Wealth while living in Switzerland. The text says chevalier wasn't asrich as he claimed to be, because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. In the presentation the same arrgument is used but saying that Chevalier was rich. His richeness and wealth came from working and earning money and that this is a process in which there are also times he did't have the money fluently so he borrowed. Next point critisiced by the text is the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier. Critics say that it isn't possible to memorize a conversation as exact - word by word - as Cehvalier did. They don't dought that he had a conversationwith voltaire, but aren't sure if it contained all that chevalier gives back in his memoir. The presentation defends that point and points out that Cehvalier took notes of the conversation which he refered to during wirting his memoir. He took many notes and wrote dairies during his live which he than used to wirte his memoir.
