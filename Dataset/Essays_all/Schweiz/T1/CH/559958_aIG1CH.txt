So the first point wich creats a conflict is that the chavalier wasn't rich. When he sold a propertys he had to wait for his money so that he borrowed it in the meantime from other people, wich totally make sense in the time of  the 18th century. iIt wouldn't really make sens that a men wich hasn't money throws party and gambels.
the Second conflict point is about the coversation about voltaire. Everytime voltaire and chavalier had a conversation, chavlier wrote it in his journal after they talked.
the personally biggest point is the escape of the notorious prison in Venice, Italy.
While chavalier was in this prison there were other inmates with a lot more money and ifluence than him. So why could only him have bought his way to freedom
there was a old venicen Document wich shows that the cell in which chavalier broke out had been reapired afterwards. that^s
