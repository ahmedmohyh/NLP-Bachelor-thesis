Many people don't believe in the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir. But the critics are mostly not that accurate either.

Having to borrow money doesn't mean to be poor. Even thought it is true that he borrowed money from a merchant it could be that he had just sold his loan and was still waiting for his money. Nobody questions the meeting between the Chevalier and Voltaire but most of the people don't believe that he could have remember the conversation accuratly when he started to write down his memoir. However the Chevalier has wrote down every conversation with Voltaire the evening after having spoken to him. This would explain why the conversation is wrote down so accurate in the Chevalier's memoir. The critics of the memoir also believe that it is more likely that hes has escaped from the prison because he had friends in the city of venice other than having carved out a whole out the roof. Also this assumption might not be true because many prisoners with a lot more powerful friends didn't manage to escape from the same prison. Plus, the ceiling of the prison had to bee repaired after he had escaped which makes his story more believable. 

From what the presentation claims the critics have no reason to not believe in the accuracy of the memoir. Either they had a personal issue with his book ore they didn't check on his story and the actual events properly.
