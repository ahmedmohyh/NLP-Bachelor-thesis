So there seems to be a lot of contradiction between the text and the listening. So obviously no action too far in history can be proofed to be right to a hundred percent, but there is a lot of controversy around Chevalier's stories, since no one knows if there is any truth to them. For example, he called himself wealthy in his memoir, but he had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. According to the listening, it took days to turn assets into money. So it is explicable and reasonable why he had to borrow money for the first few days. Money could not have been transferred that easily. Then the second occasion is about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. The text claims that his memoir was written long after the conversations he had with Voltaire, so he could not have remembered the exact phrases and words of it. But in the listening, it's pointed out, that he did take notes. It is even being reported, that only with the use of journals and notes, he was able to complete the memoir. And the third discussed experience of his was his prison break in Venice. Bribery was not effective there, since even other inmates with a higher standard and the notion of more powerful people, could not bribe their way out of there. And with the ceiling that had to be replaced in his former cell, there seems to be no doubt about him escaping through that ominous hole. So no memoir can be correct in all the details, but his is called accurate and reliable.
