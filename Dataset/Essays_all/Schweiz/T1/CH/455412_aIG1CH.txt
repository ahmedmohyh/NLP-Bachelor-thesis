The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is an important source for many people who need information about the eighteenth century. Although no memoir is ever totally correct, the Chevalier's is considered a reliable one. The critics given in the text above can be easily explained without doubting the accuracy.
The first point in the text about the gambling, borrowing money and being poor is explained by the fact that the Chevalier's welth was mostly property in his country. If he ran out of money, he had to sell, but it took the oney a certain time to arrive. While he had to wait, he didn't have any money, so he had to borrow some, which is not the same as being poor. 
Friends who knew him later in life claimed that the Chevalier often considered the notes he made every evening after meeting Voltaire while writing his memoir. The point that the information can't be right due to the long time between the conversations and the writing is therefore invalid.
As for the breakout, many of the fellow prisoners had much more powerful friends, but none of them ever broke out. Also, we know from an other source that the window ceiling had to be repared directly after the Chevalier got out, There would be no reason to repare it if things hadn't happen the way the Chevalier claimed they did.
