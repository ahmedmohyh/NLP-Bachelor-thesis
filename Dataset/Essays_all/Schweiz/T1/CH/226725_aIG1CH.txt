The presentation allows another point of view on the memoir of Chevalier. First of all it mentions that Chevalier had never been poor while being in Switzerland but that he had to borrow the money because it often took days to receive the money that he was supposed to receive and that in the meantime he borrowed huge amounts which he then paid back. It also refers to the conversations with Voltaire and mentions that he had in fact written down every conversation or more precissely the parts that he remembered on the same day the conversation took place, he just refered to his notes when he wrote the memoir and there are even whitnesses which confirm that he had allways written notes at the evening. And last the presentation presumes that he had most likely escaped the prison cell like he mentioned in his memoir because there had been other prisonners with politically even better-connected friends that Chevalier had, and that there also exists a document which proves that the ceilling of his cell had to be repared the day after his breakout.

In conclusion the presentation counterdicts everything the text applies to Chevalier's memoir but from the perspective of a bystander it is impossible to say which text is true or false.
