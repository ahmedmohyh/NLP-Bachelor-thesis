In the lesson I heard the teacher said that the Chevalier didn't have to be poor, like the text says. The text says tha he wouldn't have needed to borrow money if he had been rich, but in fact there are things or situations in which you cannot give all the money you have. So it can also be that you have to borrow money even when you would have it. The text says also that the Chevalier payed a lot of money for parties and gambling, but maybe it was too much and so he had to borrow the money he lost there. 
The text says that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations, but the teacher said that he could have wrote it just after every conversation. When they conversed at afternoon or evening, he could have wrote it at the same evening or night, like a diary. 
The thing with the prison is also a bit unlikely, because it's said that he hadn't that much freinds who could have free him from the prison, so maybe he really freed himself with that piece of metal, and it's possible that there was such a piece of metal, I mean theres metal everywhere you watch.
