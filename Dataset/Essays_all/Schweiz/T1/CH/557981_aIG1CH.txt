The arguments heard in the listening part decline the arguments read in the reading part. First of all, the Chevalier was a wealthy man who was known for his huge parties and gambling whilst he was in Switzerland. Sometimes he indeed had to borrow some money when he was waiting for his own money, which he probably gained gambling, to finally arrive. The second story who was told, the story about the impossibilityabout writing down his conversations word for word with Voltaire ten years after the conversations occured, gets declined by the listening part as well. Many friends of the Chevalier remember him writing down everything he rembered Voltaire said during their time together in journals which he kept for many years and which he then used to write down his memoirs. And last of all even the last story isn't true if you believe the listening part. It could indeed be true, that the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice since the ceiling had to be repaired after he broke out which would suit his explaination of how he escaped. Furthermore, the reading part brings up the argument that the Chevalier just could escape due to his famous and politically well-connected friends who somehow helped him but this probably isnt true as well since there were other prisoners in the same prison with friends and relatives who were way more famous than the Chevalier's.
