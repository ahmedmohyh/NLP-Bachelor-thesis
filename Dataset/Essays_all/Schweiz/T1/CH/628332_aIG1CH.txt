The speach says, that there's no way that memoires are accurate for a 100 percent. But that doesn't mean that they're not true. The first critic point is about Chaveliar's wealth. Just because he had to borrow money, it doesn't mean that he's poor. There are also critics about conversations that Chavelier wrote down. It's impossible to rewrite a whole conversation correctly, but what he wrote down, was what he remembered. He wrote it down, like he thought it happened. And also the critics of the escape from a prison. It was likely that he had friends who offered him a bribe. The speach says, that these things ain't made up. The Chavelier wrote down, what he remembered and how he thought it happenend. Maybe the stories are just a little exagerated.
