The Chevalier de Seignalt wrote a long memoir of his life and advntures. He was a controverial person but since he met famous people like kings and wirters, his memoir become valuable. Many people said that his life wasn't as exiting as he wrote it down in the memoir. They said he invented many events to make his life more glamorous. He said he lived a whealty life in Switzerland but in case he had to borrow money from other people. And people who have money don't have to borrow it from others. So it's not really clear if he had money or not. Also critics are not sure if Chevalier met Voltaire once a time. If yes, that was years before the memoir was published and nobody can find a text where Chevalier has written down the words they told to each other. So it would be very difficult to know exactly what you have spoken with this guy years ago and remember all. In case of this the meeting with Voltaire could be imagined. Chevalier was once arrested in a prison in Venice and in the memoir it was said that he was able to escape. He said he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends and they may helped him to escape. Some people say the escape wasn't true it was just a event that he invented to make his memoir more enjoyable reading.
