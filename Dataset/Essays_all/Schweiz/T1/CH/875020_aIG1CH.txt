Chevalier de Seingalt lived during the 18th Century. He had a pretty arousing life, as he had the opportunity to meet several famous people during that time. Heading towards the end of his life, Chevalier wanted to sum up all his stunning memories about the things he had been able to achieve and do.
Typically, a memoir isn't 100% accurate, because mostly they are written at a later point of time than the things happened, meaning that the memories of a person may start to fade and we remember the things as we want or wanted them to be. 

Concerning Chevalier, there are various points that led to confusion. The first point that leads to contoversy is the fact that he wrote he that had spent large amounts of money on gambling and parties in Switzerland, but at the same time, he had to borrow large amounts of money in Switzerland. It doesn' really make sense because if one borrows a lot of money to spend, that does not make someone rich.
Chevalier was a very clever man. During the time after his conversation with the wel-known writer Voltaire, he had compulsed his notes quite frequently, meaning that the quality of the later written down sentences is expected to be fairly high, eventhough the legitemity of memoirs is known to be fairly low.
Last but not least Chevalier was known to have become free from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. According to opponents, he had been freed by bribery, due to Chevaliers' good contacts to politically well-connected friends, which he didn't have. But studies have shown that other prisoners had way better and mightier friends, but didn't become free. Chevalier noted in his memoir, he escaped by using a fairly small piece of metal to make a hole in the roof, through which he the escaped.Furthermore the ceilig of Chevaliers' prison cell had to be repaired shortly after he had left it.
