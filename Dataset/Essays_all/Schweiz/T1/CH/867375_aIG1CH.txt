So actualy in the oral presentation they tied to convince us that the arguments in the writing are not 100% right. First of all the memoir recounting his life and adventures sounds accurate and reliable.In the fisrt paragraph they talked about the parties and gambling he made, and that he had to borrow money from his friend, that made some people sceptical about his money condisions.The oral presentation explained the reasons for his actions, he had to wait for his money to arrive, so in this time shedule he had to borrow money from a friend. The story about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire had some unbelievable cases for example that he could remember the phrases he wrote years erlier, but they assumed that he just wrote down what he could remember and that he had notes from the past time. The most sceptical part is the prison break one, people say that the jailers  were bribed to free him but they said that there where many prisoners who had better contacts and who would be more likely to escape, at the other hand they had to remake the ceiling of the cell where he had been held in. So why shoud the remake a ceiling if nobody tried or broke out the prison.
