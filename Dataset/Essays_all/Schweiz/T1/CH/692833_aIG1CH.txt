There are three points where the text and the presentation do not agree.
Firstly, the text claims that Chevalier must have faked his wealth because he had to borrow big sums of money from a Swiss merchant and why should anyone rich borrow money? But in contrary to that the woman from the presentation believes that he only borrowed money while waiting for his own money to arrive from his buisness beacuse he spent a lot of money for parties and other fun activities but that does not mean that he was poor.
Furthermore, they don't agree whether the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire are accurate. Critics doubt this because the conversastions had been written a few years after they had actually happened so it was impossible for Chevalier to remember every word. In the presentation they explain that he always took notes while takling to Voltaire and the parts of his memoirs are based on them. There are also people who knew him who confirmed that he wrote everything down each night. 
The last point of disageement is his escape form a Venetian prison. He claimed that he was able to escape only with a piece of metal that he used to make a hole in the ceiling. Critics doubt that this actually happened and believe that he simply bribed some jailers who let him out. However, in the presentation they disagree with this statement because in this prison there were people with more important connections than he had so why would he have been able to bribe jailers but they were not? Additionally, there are Venetian government documents that confirm that there was a hole in his ceiling and there is no other explanation for this than his story in his memoirs.
