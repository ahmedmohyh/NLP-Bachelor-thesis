for the first ... about the Chevalier, when he was in Switzerland that he was very wealthy and spend the most of his money for parties and glambing but also borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. 
It's true that he borrowed money but that was at the beginnig from his time in Switzerland, later on he began to take money out of the window and live like a rich man.
Chevalier argued the sens, why he could remember the excat phrases of Voltaire many years later, with the fact that he wrote his conversation down each night he hold one with Voltaire and kept his notices until he wrote the memoir.
And for the last thing he told us in the memoir, that he escaped from the prison, there are many doubts about it.
Other prisoners had more stronger friends than Chevalier and they couldn't espace.
And it's also curious that after Chevalier was escaped hisr have been given to an other prisoner and the room haven't been repared
