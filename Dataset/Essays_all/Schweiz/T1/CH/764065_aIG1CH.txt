There is no doubt, that Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure. The critics were clearly against him and let him look like a fool. There are three main parts, that were criticised. Firstly, that he wasn't that rich as it was told, secondly, that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire weren't like he has written down and thirdly, that he escaped from the prison because his realitonsand friends (who were very rich) have bribed the jailers and he didn't escaped trough the ceiling. Now there are some evidence, that "wiederlegen" those statements.
The first: He was rich because, he had many assets but not that much cash. So he borrowed money because it took some time to convert the assets into money.
The second. It is told, that he worte down everthing he remebered. So it could be, that it wasn't accurate but the main things must be true. There are also some witnesses which confirm, that Chevalier wrote some things during and after the conversations with Volontaire down.
The third: I can be, that he bribed the jailers, but it would be very nulikely, because there were some other people who had even more valuable friends and connections and they couldn't bribe them. It is also told, that after Chevalier escaped, they had to repair the ceiling.
There will always be a fight between critics and believers. What eventually true is, knows only the dead corpse of Chevalier.
