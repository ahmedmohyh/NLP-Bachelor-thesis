The first argument that was brought up, is that the Chevalier had a job where it took a few days to convert his money to cash. So that meant he had to borrow some money during those times. Just because he needed to borrow money doesn't automatically mean that he wasn't rich. 

The second argument that was talked about was, that the Chevalier used to write down everything that he experienced during the day at night time, like a diary and he kept those notes for a long time. Many friends of his remember that and confirmed it. This differs from the text since the memoir can be accurate because he had the notes. 

The third argument was about his escape of the prison. They said that he had powerfull friends, but other prisoners had even more powerfull friends and they didn't get out of prison. Also the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired after the Chevalier had escaped, which would confirm that something was wrong with the ceiling after he left as in a hole that he made.

Another difference is that in the presentation it was said that the story is pretty accurate overall, but in the text it is said that the story mademore interesting by adding in events that didn't really happen.With the arguments aboveyou cansee that this is not true.
