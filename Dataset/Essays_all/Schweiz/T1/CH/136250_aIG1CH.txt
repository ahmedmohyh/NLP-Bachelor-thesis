At this evenings he spent a lot of money. Also in the text is standing, is that he must borrowed a lot of money, but the lady didn't said something about that. She said that after these nights in clubs, Chevalier wrote all what happen down. His texts he wrote, he needed to wrote a long memoir recounting of his life and adventures.
