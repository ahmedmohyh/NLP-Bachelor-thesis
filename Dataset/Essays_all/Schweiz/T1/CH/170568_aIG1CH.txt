In the text Chevalier de Seingalt is shown like a person who knew rich people, but in the presentation before, it says that he had not had that any rich friends. In the presentation before it says that no memories can be correct at all, but Chevalier was a reliable kind of person. In the text it is is written diferent about it. The text tells the reader, that Chevalier invented his memories, just to sound quite exciting. Another one is, that in the Text it is written, that Critics argue, that if Chevalier would have been a rich person, he would not have needed to borrow money from others. In the presentation the lady told the listeners that Chevalier sold his things to get money, and then maybe got richer, and in the time he had not already got his money, he borrowed it from the others. The last one I found is where it says in the text, that Chevalier described his escape unreal just to sound amazing and that  "Chevalier had a number of politically well-connnected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe". In the presentation the lady told that he absolutely had not had any "politically well-connected friends" in venice and his way to have described escape is not that unreal. In the end I learned that text is way more negative about Chevalier and now I do not know about the truth. This man really seems to be a secret.
