The lecture I just heard was a direct response to the above text, advocating vehemently against the arguments brought forth in the therein, by arguing to confirm the reliability of the "Chevalier's" memoirs. In the lecture the arguments from the text are mentioned in the same chronological order as they appear in the text. While in the text, the memoirs written by the "Chevalier"are heavily criticized (although the author never does this directly; he always starts an argument with "critics say" before every one of hius arguments) and the validity of the documents as a historical source is brought into questio, the person giving the lecture argues in their favor; suggesting that historians can indeed refer to the memoires written by the "Chevalier" as an accurate historical source, and refutes any evidence to the contrary suggested in the text. 
The arguments mentioned in the text are broken down and analyzed by the speaker...citing important sources (such as reporters in Venice) to back her claims, though most of her references are vague, seeing as she never mentiones any actual articles (or dates of release).
The whole exchange can be summarized as a b
