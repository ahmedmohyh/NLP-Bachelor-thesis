First part of the memoire
In the speach they were discussing the three parts of the memoir from Chevalier. In the first part Chevalier wrote that while he lived in Switzerland, he spent much money on parties and gambling. The text says that Chevalier was not that rich but more likely borrowed his money from a merchant. In the speach there were an argument, that Chevalier wasn't poor, he sold things to make money and spent that money on parties and gambling. So according to the speach Chevalier didn't have to brorrow money. 

Second part of the memoire
In the second part he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire, and had many detailed discussions in it, word by word. The text says that it isn't possible to remember such details of conversations which were many years ago, in the speach though it's said that Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered about his dialogues with Voltair at the day it took place and kept this notes for many years. According to the speach Chevalier used many diaries and notes he took over the years to write his memoires. 

Third part of the memoire 
Chevalier once was a prisoner in Venice and wrote in his memoire that he escaped it with a piece of metal. With this piece of metal he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped over the roof. The text is critizising this and has the argument in it that Chevalier more likely had very important friends in Venice who bribed his jailers to free him. In the text that I heard, Chevalier must have escaped because in his chamber, there was a hole in the ceiling which was repaired. Why would there be a repaired hole if he didn't escape the way he said? Second, there were other prisoners which had much more politically well-connected and important friends in Venice and they also couldnt bribe the jailers to free one of the other prisoners.
