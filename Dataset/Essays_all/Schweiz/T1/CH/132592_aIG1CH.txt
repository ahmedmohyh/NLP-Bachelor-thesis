The Chevalier obviously had a really exciting time in his life so that his memoir leads to a big discusion. At first he mentioned in his memoir that he had a lot of money and felt very rich. In Switzerland he spent a great sum of money there on partys and gambling, but later evidence has surfaced that he had to borrow a lot of money, while beeing in Switzerland. That's why people say that this fact isn't reliable. However the true story says that he had a lot of money, but he had to get it first, so he had to lend money until then. The second argument for a unreliable story was that he could exactely memorise the conversation with Voltaire many years later. This sounded very unbelievable for many humans. But fact is that he took notes after this conversation and that he found them a few years later and then wrote the memoir. Also critics claim that it isn't believable that he really took a piece of metal to make a hole through the ceiling to have escaped the Venetian prison. They say it would be more likely, that his jailers were bribed to free him and let him go. The point is, that the ceiling of this prison had to be rebuilt soon after he had escaped. For me, it sounds like it could really be the true story.
