In the presentation it was said, he was not as poor as it was said in the Text. In Switzerland he spent a lot of money, he could do that, because he was rich, but unfortunately he hasnt had enough monye with him, so he had to borrow some from a Swiss merchant. Later, when his money would arrive in Switzerland he would pay him all the borrowed money back.
In the Text it was said, that he had manipulated many events. He obviously inventet some, because it is impossible tha a human could have throughlived so many events. In thepresentation they dissagreed. It was said that he wrote down his memmories a long time after this events happened. During this long time he forgot some parts of the events, what influencet his textwriting a bit. So the dates are wrong as well as some invents.
Once he broke out a prison. In the Text it they sai, he only could do that because of his well-connectet friends. Thats true, but in the presentation it was said that other prisoners had much powerfuller friends than his, and they werent able to escape. All in all Chevalier is not such a bad person as it was said in the te text.
