According to the presentation Chevalier de Seingalnt wasn`t poor like it`s said in the text. It`s right that he hasn`t got that much money but before he went to parties and spend his money for that, he had enough money. So according to the text he borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. So thats actually not right. So that`s why Chevalier de Seingalt was lying in his memoir, to make it more interesting and readable. Critics in the text say, that if the Chevalier had really been rich, he would not have been needed to borrow money. But the teacher in the presentation said, that he wanted to make his life for the memoir more interesting.
Another diffrent between the presentation and the text is, that it`s written in the text, that no one doubts that the Chevalier and Voltair and Chevalier met and conversed, nevertheless they said, that it`s not possible that Chevalier could rember that well to the conversation after so many yearshe started to write his memoir. But actuallyit`s not impossible, because it could bethat Chevalier wrote his conversation between him and Voltaire down because Voltaire was a famous person. So that`s another big different between those informations.
Also critics don`t believe that Chevalier was able to break out of the prison because alot of people who were also there weren`t able to breakout.
