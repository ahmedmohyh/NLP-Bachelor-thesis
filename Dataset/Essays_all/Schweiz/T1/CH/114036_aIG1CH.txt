The text is about Chevalier's life. All his life he wrote memoirs of his life and adventures. His memoirs became very valuable as he met kings and writers. But no memoir is correct. There are many critics about his memoirs.   Here are three examples: 
1. As he lived in Switzerland and spent alot of money there on gambling and parties. He then ran out of money and borrowed it. The Chevalier is now looked out as poor. But the critics complain that if he had really been rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.
2.There are critics about the accuracy of his memoirs. One of them is that he met  the famous writer Voltaire. In the evening he wrote down, as far as he knew,  every conversation. However, critics complain that it's not possible that the Chevalier who wrote it because it was written many years after. 
3. It's also been told that he escaped from a prison in Venice. He said he would escape through the ceiling but the critics complain that he was sent free. He was bribed to free.
