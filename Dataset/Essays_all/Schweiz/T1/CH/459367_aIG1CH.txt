It is about the Chavalier de Seingalt who wrote his memoir. It is an important memoir for the history because he met many famous people, like kings and wirters in his life. But there are some critics who doubts the memoir. They believe that the Chevalier inventet many events to make his life more exciting. 
The first argument is that he was living in Switzerland and his memoir says he had much money. But evidence had proof that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. In the audio they sayed he was not poor. 
The second argument ist about the meeting with the famous writer Voltaire. They believe that they met but it is nearly impossible that he wrote all the conversations because he wrote it many years later. It would not be excatly correct.
The third argument is about his escape from a prison in Venice.
