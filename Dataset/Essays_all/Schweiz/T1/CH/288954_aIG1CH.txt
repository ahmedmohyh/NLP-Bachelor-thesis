The first point, the one that while Seingalt lived in Switzerland, the fact that he spend a lot of money, made him borrow some more because he had gone broke, was said to be wrong in the audition.
There it was claimed that he was actually very rich but got his money from selling some valuable belongings. As this could take some time, he had then to wait for his money and borrowed some from the bank for these short intervals.
Now to the second point: The chevalier was said to have forged his conversations with the contemporary writer Voltaire, which was then in the hearing part falsified by the fact that Seingalt had appearently written down what they had talked every evening.
As a thirt point it was written in the text that the chevalier had, to make the story more interesting, claimed to have escaped from venitian prison by making a hole with a piece of metal. This was said to be wrong; historicians explain his successful escape by saying that he bribed the guards to get out.
The thing with the hole could actually be the true story as it was proved that the cell where he had been trapped had to be repared later.
All in one this whole thing doesn't make much sense and no one actually knows what to believe.
