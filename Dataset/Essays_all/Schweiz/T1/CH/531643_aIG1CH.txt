The presentation was about Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoir. The beginning was about how important memoires can be to understand the life from that time and even they are not one hundred percent the truth it helps to undestand this time. The memoir of the Chevalier is very important because he met many famous people including kings and writers, because of this his memoir became a valuable historical source abot the aeuropean society.

She says that when the Chevalier was in Switzerland he was wealthy and spend much money on parties and gambling. But his wealth was in things he had to sell first and if he couldn' sell fast enough he had no cash for a short time so he had to borrow money. In the text it says that someone who borrows money can't be wealthy but he just had to lend money because his health wasn't in cash.

The Chevalier also wrote in his memoir about his conversation with Voltaire, critics say that he couldn't know the exact conversation after the many years that passed since that conversation happened. But it is proven that he took notes every night after the conversation and kept them until he wrote his memoir.

The Chevalier also esccaped from a prison in Venice once by digging a hole in the ceiling and climbing through it.In the text it says that his powerful friends bribed him free, but even other inmates with much more powerful friends couldn't bribe themselves out and only a few days after the escape the ceiling had to be restored. So it is likely that it really happened.
