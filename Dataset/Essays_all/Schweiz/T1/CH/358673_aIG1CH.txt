In this little essay I will write about the memoir of Chevalier. Chevalier was, how it is said in the text, a controversal figure. Many people believe that there are a lot of things that were invented by Chevalier in his memoir and are not true at all.
Once Chevalier has been living in Switzerland, where he was very wealthy. In the text it is said that he spent a lot of money there on parties and gambling. Because he did not have any money he had to borrow it from a Swiss merchant. They say that Chevalier was poor. But in the audio there is said that he was not poor at all if he first spent money on parties and gambling. So he had enough money to live.
The second argument was about Voltaire. Voltaire was a famous writer. The critics about the things written down in the memoir were that this things could not have been true because Chevalier wrote it down a few years after he actually talked to Voltaire. But in the audio there is said that each night that they talked to each other, Chevalier wrote everything down that he remembered from the conversation. So it can not actually be true that the things he wrote in his memoir about Voltaire are not true.
Last but not least they were talking about the escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. Chevalier escaped from there by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. So the question appears, why did other prisoners not also escape from the prison before? 
So you see, the things that are written down in the memoir of Chevalier can be interpreted in many ways. It is important that they are interpreted in many different ways because only with this you can try to understand the living of other times.
