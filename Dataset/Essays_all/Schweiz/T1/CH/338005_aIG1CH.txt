The Chevalier's memoir is an discussed writing beacuase you may know that memoirs are never completly correct but he has written some things you have to think about it twice to be sure if it is true or not. For example the Chevalier wrote that he was in Switzerland and was very rich and have made a lot of parties and events. But you also know that he borrowed a lot of money in Switzerland that should mean he didn't have a lot of money. But in the past it was usual to borrow money also for rich people because you had to sell your ownings to get money and this needed a few days to get that money in this short time between selling and getting the money for it you have borrowed some money. So it doesn't mean the Chevalier has lied about being rich. But what is sure is that he disortet events to make his life more exciting than it was in reality. 
He also mentioned that he broke out of prison and many peolpe couldn't believe it because breaking out of prison in Venice is not that easy. Many prisoners had friends with a lot more influence than Chevalier but they couldn't reak out of the prison and Chevalier should have done it with a piece of metal. But there is somewhere written that they had to renovate Chevalier's ceiling after his break out and why should they renovate a ceiling if there wasn't a hole from Chevalier?
Chevalier tried to write down all the important conversations he had right after he had them. and of course their are some pieces that are missed or not true but he probably just didn't remember the whole conversation.
