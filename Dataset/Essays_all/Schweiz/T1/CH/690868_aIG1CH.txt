In the presentation we heard that all the arguments given in the text got an explanation why the memoire wasn't faked. The first argument, that they take up is that he borrowed a lot of money and wasn't really a wealthy man, they rely that he just had to wait a while for his money to arrive and that he would pay all the money back.
Second thing they relied was the argument with Voltaire. No one doubts that they actually met, but some of the critics believe that he faked some passages they talked about. But in the presentation they say he wrote it down on papers long after they talked and that's why he may messed things up a little bit.
The third point is, that critics believe that he made up the story (escaping from the prison through the roof just with help from a piece of metal). They think he had well-connected friends that helped him to break out. What they did not know is that there were prisoners who had even better-connected friends and they had no influence to their offence. But later we hear that the roof Chevalier escaped through really had to be repaired. So why should it, if he made the story up?
They don't really talk about the first argument that he pimped up his memoire with events and adventures that may did never take place. But then again how would you proof that this was made up?
