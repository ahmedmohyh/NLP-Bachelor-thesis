Chevalier de Saingalt was a very rich man who once livedn in Switzerland. He often spent a great deal of money on parties and stuff like that but he also had to borrow some money of swiss banks. There is written in the text that if the Chevalier had been rich he wouldn`t have to borrow money but in the hearing is said that he had to sell things first to gain money.

After each time Chevalier met Voltaire he took notes so he saved everything important in his notes.It`s written that It`s impossible to remember exact phrases from conversations held many years earlier but Chevalier wrote everything down to remember.

After his prisonbrake they had to fix the roof of the prison so it seems logical that he escaped by climbing throug the roof.
Critics like to question all and everything. In some cases the truth is just a mix of reality and invention. nobody, no matter how hard they try to, will ever find out how it really was.
Maby Chevalier liked do be a hero.
