In this essay I'm going to connect the two sources of information about Chevalier. Both the text I read and the audio I heard were about Chevalier and his memoir. The text is way more critisizing than the audio. They assume that his memoir is not accurate. The texts mentions different parts of the memoir which they think are not  accurate enough. For example the time when Chevalier was in Switzerland. In his memoir he speaks of his great wealth but the the text says that he had to borrow money from a Swiss marchant. They audio explains why he had to borrow the money. They explain he really was rich but his wealth was in buildings and ohter phsysical objects. So he had to convert these things into real liquid money. While converting it he had to borrow money. Another point are the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The text says that it's impossible to memorize all these conversations over years and then write them down correctly. But the audio confermes that he had written all the converations down at the same night he had spoken to Voltaire. The third and last point is the escape from a notorious proson in venice. Chevalier mentions in his memoir that he escaped through the ceiling with a piece of metal. Critics assume that he had powerful friends outside of the prison who could have let him free. But aswell in this point the audio has an aspect. They say that other prisoners had even more poweful friends outdise of the prison and couldn't escape. An interesting thing is, that the prison had to repair the ceiling of the cell in which Chevalier was kept. So his memoir might be true for real.
