In the presentation the woman relates to many of the stories from the chevaliers memoires, but she makes his memoires look more respectable. She claimes that a memoire can't be absolutely true, but the memoires of the chevalier are a reliable source to the 18. century. In the text they outpoint that the chevalier said that he was a rich man, but needed to borrow money in switzerland. The woman in the presentaition is saying that it is true the chevalier needed to borrow money, but that does not mean he was poor, because he had money sources where he first needed to sell them to earn his money. About the conversation with voltaire the text said that it is impossible that the chevalier was able to write down the exact phrases of the conversation years later. The woman in the presentaiton points out that the chevalier himself said that he sat down the same evening he spoke with voltaire and wrote down eveything he could remember. People who lived in the time of the chevalier also said that when he was writing his memoires he often related to little notes he had. The woman in the presentaition is sure that the escape from Venice was clearly not going from mighty friends there, because other inmates had even mightier friends in Venice. In addition documents from the Venice government said that after the escape of the chevalier they had to repaire the ceiling. Why would they need to repaire the ceiling if the chevalier dind't made a hole through it?
