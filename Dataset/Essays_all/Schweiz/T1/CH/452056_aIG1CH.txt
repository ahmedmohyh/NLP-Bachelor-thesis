The presentation defends the criticism risen in the text. It is all about Chevalier and three milestones of his life which he wrote about in his memoir. 
A fist point is the time he spent in Switzerland. Critics say that he pretended to be rich while he actually was not. They say he had to borrow money while  staying in Switzerland. The presentator  defends Chevalier: he and his family had a lot of assets in Switzerland. When they needed money they first had to sell some of the assets which could take some time. Meanwhile they had to borrow money. 
Another issue is the part in which he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. Critics say that it is not possible to remember long conversations that detailed but again, the presentator defends Chevalier in that point. He wrote down his momories of the conversation shortly after the conversation. That is why it is possible that the contents are still true. 
The last point considers Chevalier's escape from prison. Critics doubt that he could flee through a whole in the ceiling. They think it is more likely that he bribed the guardian. The presentator on the other hand beliefes that this is very unlikely since a lot of other rich people were imprisoned as well and they could not bribe the guardians in order to escape. 
So the text and the presentation are of the opposite opinion considering these points. After reading and hearing both, the arguments of the presentation seem more convincing.
