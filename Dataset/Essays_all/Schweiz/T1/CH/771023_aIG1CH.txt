Difference between two medias - Chevalier

In the two medias it goes about the accuracy of his memoir. In the text they said that his memoirs aren't accurat at all, but it is an important source about European society. The other media tend to say that his memoirs are right. For example the text said that he wasn't rich at all, he had to borrow money from a . Swiss merchent. On the other hand the sound media said that the Chevaliers were pretty rich at least in switzerland. Also dure that time they had to wait long if they transfere money from they're bank account. So it's normal that they had to borrow money if they needed it quickly. Another Example, the text media said that his texts about his conversaition with Voltair can't be accurate because he wrote it years after it. Also the text said that his escape from the prison in Venice is more like one from an action movie. The sound media thinks that he wrote down notes after each conversation and they have a document that after Chevaliers escape his Cell had to be repaired, so they think he told the truth. To sum the text media thinks that Chevalier text aren't accurate at all and he invented a lot of events of his memoir. The sound media think that his memoirs are accurate.
