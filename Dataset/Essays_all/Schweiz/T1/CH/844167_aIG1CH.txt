Chevalier Seingalt, undoubtedly an intersting person, who lived in the18. century, wrote a memoir about his life. He met different famous people and his yearswere full of adventures. Although the memoir is very fascinating and you really want to belive everything in it, some critics have raised doubts if all the informations are reliable.
For example when he talks about his wealth and being rich. It can be true that he was pretty wealthy, because he participated on a lot of parties and other fetes, but how can it be, that he was rich, when he always had to borrow money from friends when he run out of it. Those informations match with the informations in the text.
What isn't written down in the text is, that he always wrote everything he memorized from the day in a sort of journal, in case he would forget something. This says that the critics who are sceptic about the accuracy of all the conersations between him and famous people are wrong.
Another difference is, that in the text it says, that for the chevalier, it was impossible to escape from the prison, unless he had help from outside. In the hearing... they made clear, that in several venezian documents it occurred that they hadto repair the ceiling of his room, which is an evidence, that he escaped by himself.
