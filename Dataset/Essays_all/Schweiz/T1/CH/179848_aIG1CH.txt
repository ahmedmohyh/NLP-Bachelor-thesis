I'm going to tell you first about the critical points and then about the reasons they might be wrong. First of all, the point about borrowing money: People say that he had to wait until his own money came because switzerland is expensive and even if you were wealthy you had to sell first to get your money! That doesn't actually mean that he was poor! About meeting voltaire: Critical people say that it's not possible for him to remember every word they said because he wrote his memorial down a few years after actually meeting him! But the others say the reason he could remeber was that all night he wrote every word he could remeber down to keep all of it, and when he started writing his memorial he used all his notes! Third point about his adventure escaping out of prison: ciritcal people don't believe in this because he had some wealthy friends which could have helped him getting out and they say there was no need to break out with this metal thing and behave like a hero. But there were some other people in prison who had even wealthier friends and they didn't manage to get out with their help either,so he had no chance getting out.
