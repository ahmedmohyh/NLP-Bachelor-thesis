Without Question, the Chevalier de Seingalt had a very interesting life. Howerver, some critics argue, that not all of his memoir is actually true. Let's take for an example the three episodes that we heard in the lecture and read in the text. Firstly his life in Switzerland. It is a fact that the Chevalier spent a great deal of money whilst living there. He threw parties and gambled a lot. Critics say though, that he actually just borrowed his wealth from a merchant. As explained in the lecture, he only had to borrow money at all because he had only goods with value that he had to sell first and then had to wait for the "real" money.
Secondly, his conversations with the great french writer Voltaire are documented very detailed. So detailed that many critics suspect that the Chevalier actually just invented some of the talk they had to entertain the people. But also here there's an argument against that: In the time he was talking to Voltaire, Chevalier would write down their conversations every evening. He kept these dairies for many years after, and witnesses prove, that he took these dairies as a foundation for his detailed memoir.
At last, there is his spectacular escape from the prison in Venice. In order to escape, he reportedly dug a hole into the ceilig of his prison cell with a piece of metal and climbed thtough the roof into freedom. Old documents from Venice even state that shortly after his escape the ceiling of the very cell he used to be capured in had to be reapaired. However, it is much more likely, that the prison guards just had been brided, since the Chevalier had quite a few politically influential friend in the city of Venice. This again is apparently unlikely, because in the same prison there were other very influential people captured, so that they would have escaped too by bribe if the Chevalier could do so.
