The topic of the text and the speaking part is the critics of Chevalier de Seingalt. He wrote many thing about his life and adventures and his memoir has become important for the European society in the eighteenth century. But there are many critics about his memoir and his storys. In the text are three examples of them but in the speaking part a woman spoke about this critics too and she relativate them. There are many critics but it is possible that his storys are true. 

The first example is that the critics says that he wasn't very wealthy because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. The woman in the speaking part said to this that it is possible that he had much money but when he was in Swiss he had to borrow money beacause his money was in another country and it took a longe time to bring his money to Swiss. 
In the second critics it is written that it is impossible that he can remember all the conversations which he had many years befor he had wirtten the conversation. This critics is relativated when we look at the fact, that he could have written down the conservation and what he remembered shortly after but many years later he published the storys.
The last point is that Chevalier could have escape from a notorious prison in Venice. The critics says that is more possible that the jailers were brided to free him. But on the other side we have to see that they were other prisoner with powerfull friends and they couldn't escape. So it wasn't possible that the jailers freed him and he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling.
