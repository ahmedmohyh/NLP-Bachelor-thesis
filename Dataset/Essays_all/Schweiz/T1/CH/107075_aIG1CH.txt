In the presentation, it's stated, that the Chevalier wasn't poor despite borrowing money. He had properties that he sold to get money and that money usually took some time to arrive. While the money was on it's way, the Chevalier would borrow money to sustain himself. In the text it's just written that he borrowed money and thus maybe wasn't rich.
Also his conversations with Voltaire get criticised. There are people that don't believe his descriptions of the conversations are accurate, because he wrote the memoir much later which could have corrupted his memory. The presenter however thinks they are accurate, because the there are reports in which is written that the Chevalier made notes of his conversations and reffered to them while writing his memoir.
The last point of critic is his escape from the prison in Venice. In the memoirs he claims to break out of the prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing out. Critics doubt that it happened and think that he bribed his guards. In the presentation however they say that it's possible, because others weren't able to bribe themselves out either despite having more power. Also they have a source that states that the ceiling of the Chevalier's cellar had to be repaired after he broke free.
