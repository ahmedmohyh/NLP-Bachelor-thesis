There are two ways you can look at the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt. Either you are cynical by doubting several extraordinary accomplishments he made in his life or you try to find arguments to proove that his life and adventures are based on actual historical facts. The text claims that during Chevalier's stay in Switzerland he borrowed considerable amounts of money from merchants although his memoir states that he lived a wealthy life. On the other hand, the audio file explains that in order to make profit as a merchant you have to buy goods and borrow money, so you can sell them again.
Additionally, the text mentions Chevalier's recorded conversations with the famous writer Voltaire which are thought to be impossible as they were written down many years after the conversations had actually taken place. The audio file disagrees with that and claims that Chevalier did write down notes on those conversations as many witnessed him with many notebooks.
Finally, the text says that the escape from a Venician prison with a piece of metal wasn't as probable as the bribery of the guards. Disagreeing with that, the audio file states that many more influential men couldn't bribe their way out of prison and that the prison did need to repair the ceiling of a cell after Chevalier's escape. 
In conclusion, one can say that the historical figure of Chevalier was indeed a controversial one. But if one thinks about the plausibilty of his adventures it's our own decision what we choose to believe.
