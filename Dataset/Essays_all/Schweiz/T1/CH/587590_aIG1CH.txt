In the presentation the woman talked about the Chevalier's life and the accuracy of his memoir. She says that the memoir is historically relieable and that there is no reason to claim the truth of it. She for example explaines how it could had been possible that the Chevalier had to borrow money while he was living in Switzerland. He was gambling alot so he didn't always had money, he sometimes had to wait a few days for it. But that doesn't mean that he was poor or something. She also refers to the critics about the Chevaliers friendship to Voltaire. Even if the critics do not doubt that they had known eachother, the still don't believe in th accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier wrote down in his memoir. But the woman tells us that he always wrote everything he could remember down after he had a conversation with Voltaire. Even people who knew the Chevalier agreed to that and they also said that he just wrote everything into his memoir many years later. Even for the story about the Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice the woman found some proof. In fact, there are some Venetian documents which tell that the roof of the Chevaliers room had to be repared after he escaped from the prison. So how could this had happend if the Chevalier got out of the prison with the help of his wealthy friends, like the critics tend to say?
