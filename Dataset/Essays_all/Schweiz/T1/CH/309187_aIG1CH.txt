The woman talked about the accuracy of the Chevaliers memoir. Just because some people think his journy was impossible it does not have to mean it really was. For example his problem with money in Switzerland: The text asks why he needed to borrow money in Switzerland when he was wealthy? To explain that: It did take the Chevalier some days for his money to arrive and in this time he needed to borrow some money for gambling. Just because he borrowed money you can not say he is poor. 
Another point is that people did not believe his memoir because he wrote his coversation many years after he had had it. But this does not indicate that it was not true. He consulted his journals and notes to write it down and he only did it so many years later because at the time he had had the conversation he could not have known he was going to write a memoir about his life. 
In the text is also written that the Chevalier could not have escaped from the prison in Venice. For one reason because the hole in the ceiling was not to be found and in addition because he had many friends who could have helped him. But the ceiling was repaired some time after his escape and the jailers had more friends to help them than the Chevalier.
All in all a memoir is never fully reliable but there are many other sources to make an impression of them.
