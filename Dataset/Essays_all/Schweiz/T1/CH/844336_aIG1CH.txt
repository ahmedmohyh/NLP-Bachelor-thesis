First of all in the listening they say that Chevalier's memoir is an important historical source in the 19th century, which matches with the words in the text.In theleistening they explain that Chevalier claims to be a rich man but there are some doubts about his wealth. Usually to earn some money you had to have properties to sell them und grow wich like that. The money had to be transferred, which took a few days. The problem was that Chevalier spent too much money on party's and that's why at the end he run out of money and had to borrow it form a Swiss merchant. However, in the text it isn't explained that accurately.   
There are also doubts that Chevalier could describe perfectly the conversations with Voltaire. In the Listening they say that friends from Chevalier noticed that through the years he took notes and at the end he wrote everything down, which could be true but impossible to describe these conversations accurately within these years.
As well as the escape, in the listening it's described differently. Chevalier claimsthat he escaped but the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, which shows that it can't true that he only escaped but had some help. In the text it says that he used a piece of metal. In the listening they don't really say what he had possibly done. They only say that it can't be possible because other men in prison had more powerful friends than hehad to help him break out.
