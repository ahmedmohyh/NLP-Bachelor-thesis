Chevaliers memoir is really controversial. In the lecture the professor mentions that no memoir is completely correct, but Chevalier's memoir can be used as a reliable source and is pretty accureate. The text on the other hand criticizes the accuracy of the memoir. 

It is mentioned in the lecture that Chavalier borrowed money from rich Swiss merchants, even though he claimed to be rich. In the presentation it is said, that Chevalier took a lone, because he was waiting for his money to arrive, as he just sold a property. While he had to wait, he borrowed money, so he could keep up his fancy lifestyle and could party and gamble on. The text mentions though, that Chevalier still should have had more money to do that, if he had really been so rich.

The lecturer said that each night Chevalier wrote down what he could remember from the conversations he had with Voltaire. He consulted his notes when he wrote his memoir years later. The paragraph of the text criticies the accuracy, since they did not consider that Chevalier took notes and they could not imagine how Chevalier remembered all these sentences of the conversations many years later.

Chevalier himselfs claims that he broke out of a prison by using a piece of metal to breake the ceiling and climb out. The text says that that is not possible and that Chevalier was freed by a jailer, since Chevalier had good friends who worked there. In the lecture it is said, that it is not possible that Chevalier was freed by his jailer, because many other prisoners had good friends who worked as jailers as well and they were not freed. A document was found, which mentions that the ceiling had to be fixed after Chevalier escaped and why would the ceiling need to be fixed if he had not broken out the way he mentioned?

Chvaliers memoir will always be controversial, but it will also always stay a mistery. How could anyone find out what exactely happened so many years ago?
