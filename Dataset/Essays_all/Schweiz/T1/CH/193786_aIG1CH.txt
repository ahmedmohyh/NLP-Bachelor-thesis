Often people think Chevalier was a rich man but other people say, that he was a really poor man, so who is Chevalier and what is the real truth about him?
Chevalier wrote a lot about his life. In every conversaition he documented the full conversaition, so in the end of his life he had a long memoir of all his adventures and know a lot about famous people. 
He spent a lot time with parties and gambling in where he was very good so he wasn't really poor and have to borrow money from other people, but on the other side he get to prison because of a money problem. In this prison is the next question. Chevalier escaped from this prison in Venice but it isn't clear how he do this. One meaning is, that he make a hole in the ceiling and go through this hole out of the prison. Other people say, that he ask a politically well-connected friend who gives money to buy Chevalier out of the prison. If the second statement is true, than people ask, why there are reperations of the ceiling in the prison in Venice? 
So in the end, no one knows the trueth about him.
