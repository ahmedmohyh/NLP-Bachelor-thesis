Chevalier de Seignalt ( 1725-1788 ) wrote his own memoir. Today it is a historical source but for critics not every thing he had done during his life seems beliefable. 
Chevalier lived in Switzerland for a fiew years. He had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. Critics think that Cevalier was poor because of that. But other critics say that Chevalier had a expensive lifestyle. He went to a lot of parties and spent a lot of money. But he also got money but he has to wait so he asked the merchant to lend him some. Chevalier couldn't have such a lifestyle if he wouldn't be rich.
An other controversal piont in his memoir are his conversations with the famous philosoph Volaire. Chevalier wrote many details about their conversations in his biographie. It is impossible to know that after so many years. But witnesses in Chevaliers life said, that they had seen him going throuh some notice while writting. It is possible that Chevailer write quotes and interessting themes after the conversation witz Volaitre down to remember them later.
The last critical pion is that Cevalier escaped from a prison in Venice. He made with a piece of metal a whole and escaped through the ceiling. IN old papers it is written down that this seiling Chevalier has escaped through had to be repared. So it could be.
Finally nobody knows the truth excapt of Chevalier.
