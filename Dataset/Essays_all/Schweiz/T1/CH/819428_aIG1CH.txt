The listening input and the given reading text have a lot of parallels. Both speak about a man who is called Chevalier de Seingalt. He was born in 1725 and lived until 1798. In the listening input and in the reading text it is said that Chevalier wrote a lot. The reading text explains that his textes were about his memoir which means that he wrote about all his adventures and summaries up his whole life. From the listening input we also know that Chevalier wrote down every night his conversations. That`s why he alsways knew when he had spoken to a person and what their conversation was about.

An other argument of the two inputs is when Chevalier lived in Switzerland. There he spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling. This is also meant in the listening input. Furthermore the last one gave the information that Chevalier first had to sell something for having afterwards that huge amounts of money.

There is one more very important point of Chevalier`s life: His time in prison. Both inputs give the information that he spent some time in prison in Venice, Italy. Once the man tried to make a hole in the ceiling by using a peace of metal. Afterwards he wanted to climb through the roof. The reading input also said that Chevalier had a lot of political well-connected friends in Venice and they could have helped Chevalier by "leaving" the prison.
