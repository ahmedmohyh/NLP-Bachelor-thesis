About the life of the Chevalier de Seingalt

Chevalier vrote at the end of his life all his memories down and is therefor a valuable source about European society. However, there are many peoble that criticise his writings. They think that he wrote down some things differentliy than they reallly were to make reading more exciting. In the text are three examples of critics given. in the presentation, a woman talks about these three critics and explains, why they might be true. The first one is abaut the time, Chevalier spent in Switzerland. In his written memoir he says, that he was very wealthy and it is known that he spent a not too ssmall amount of money on parties and gamling. Recently came out, theat he actually borrowed a big amount of money from a Swiss merchand. But that does not mean that he is poor, says the woman that made the presentation. By that time, peoples wealth was not just money, they also had things like land that brings a lot of money too when it is selled. And when he selled things to get on money, it took some time until it arrived and in that time he needed money as well so he had to borrow it. THe second critiv is about his conversation with voltaire. Critics do not think that he can exactly remeber conversations after some years. But he actually worte down something about his day every day, like a diary and there he was able to take his information from. The third critic is about his time in prison ant that he impossibly coule escape using a stone. But is is known that they had to repair the ceiling after his escape.
