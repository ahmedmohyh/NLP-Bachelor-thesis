Several critcis raised doubts about the memoir. For those critcis it seems a little unrealistic that all those things happend and they believe that the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) disorted or invented some of his adventerous events. There is for example his escape from a prison in Venice. Critics believe in the fact that Chevalier's powerful friends bribed him out of the prison. However, at that time there were other prisoners with far more powerful freinds than Chevalier had. Furthermore there are records that after his escape out of the prison in Venice they had to repair several things in the prision.

Another point which attracted a heated discussion are the conversation between Chevalier and the famous Voltaire. The critics argument is that he wrote down these conversation years later. As a matter of fact he would not be able to recall the converstation in such details. The one holding a speech however, quered that Chevalier wrote it down the next day and gave it the finishing touches years later.

Unfortunately the sound did not really work, meaning it was not loud enough. Thats why I was not able to understand the other points and I am not sure whether what I wrote is correct or not.
