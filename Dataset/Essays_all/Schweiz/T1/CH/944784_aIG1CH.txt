Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the 18th century wrote a memorial about his life which is today a historical source. some critics question his storys because some things don't really fit together.
He said that he was really wealthy while he lived in Switzerland. In the text they say that he hadn't enough money because he had to borrow some from the Swiss merchant so he could finance his parties and gambling. In the audio they say that he had enough money, but he had to borrow some because he received the money he eanrt from his parties a few days after they where done.
In the text they say that he wrote down his conversations with Voltaire a few years after they acctually talked. But in the audio they claim that he wrote down his conversations each time after he talked with Voltaire (a few people confirm that he really did that.)
Another thing he wrote down in his memorial was that he escaped out of prison in Venice, Italy. The reason in the text why they don't believe him is that he had a number of politically friends who could have offered a bribe.They also think that he said this becuase it sounds adventurous. But in the audio they don't belive his story because the Wall (where he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole and climbed trough the roof) never had to be fixed and there were so many other prisonors with him who had better connections and no one could ever escape.
