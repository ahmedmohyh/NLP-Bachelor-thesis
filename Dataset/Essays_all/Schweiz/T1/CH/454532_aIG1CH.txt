There are many arguements why the Chevalier wasn't as famous and glamourus like he tells us in his self-written memoir. He for example, partied and gambled lots in Switzerland, although there is evidence of his borrowing money from swiss banks because he ran out of it during his stay. He also documented a whole conversation with Voltaire which happened many years before writting it down into the memoir. We heard the women talking about the notes and writtings of Chevalier and that he documented lots of his conversations and happenings into a notebook. So even if it sounds kind of unbelivable it might even be true. We also heard in the audio about the escape story which seems to be pretty accutate. Chevalier tells a really interesting story about how he got out of the Venecian prison by pocking a hole into the ceiling and escaping through this hole. Critics doupt that and see the source of his escape by some rich, imoportant friends. But this might not be true that Chevalier got help from his friends. There is evidence that the prison had to replace the ceiling in Chevaliers cell after his escape. We'll probably never know what really is true and invented in this memoir but we for know that it's fun to live a life full of adventures, even if it's just happening in the head of the writter, without being true at all.
