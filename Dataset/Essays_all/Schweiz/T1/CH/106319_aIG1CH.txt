In the oral part, you hear that Chevalier de Seinigalt was an poor man. They say nothing about the meetigs he had with the famous persons.
In the text is also written that he wanted to make his life more exciting and that he met famous peoples. So the most important part is that in the text they say that he was not realy a rich man because he had to borrow money. But the reason why he had to borrow money was that he worked and organised many events  
and you have to wait very long until you get your money back.
Then there is the argument that he can not had met the famous writer Voltaire because he wrot doen the phrases many years later. But in case that he maybe wrote down the whole conversation withe every single phrase it can be true.
In the text is written, that he could escaped of prison because he had friends in the there who was willing to help him. But as you can see he had not very good contact withe the prisoners. So they did not helped him.
