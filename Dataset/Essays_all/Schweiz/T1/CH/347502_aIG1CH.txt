The chevalier was very rich, when he lived in Switzerland but he throw his money away with a lot of parties and gambling. This is probably the reason why he had to borrow money. So we can say that he became poor because of all the parties. But in the listening they said that the chevalier was not really poor because it does not mean that you are poor when you borrow money from someone. So we do not really know if he was actually poor or just pretended to be it. 

It is also said that he escaped from a prison in Italy by using a piece of metal and make a hole in the ceiling but that is not true because he probably just had good connection to some friends in Venice. Another proof is that no one of all the other prisoners have managed it to escape from a prison like this was. 

So we can say that the chevalier just invented all these stories to make his life seem more exciting than it really was.
