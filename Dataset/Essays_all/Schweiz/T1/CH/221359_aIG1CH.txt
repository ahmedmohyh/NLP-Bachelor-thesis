In the presentation it's said that Chevalier was a salesman and back in these days it took a while till the money arrived, when they made a deal. So sometimes he had to borrow money till he get his momey, but in the text they say to reason because he borrowed is easy, Chevalier just hadn't money.

Critics also say that the conservation with Voltaire can't be real because Chevalier wrote them down years later. No one can excectly remember a conversation word by word. But in the presentation they say that there are notes of the conversation from Voltaire.

In the text they say that Chevalier didn't escape through the roof, instead he had a number of politically well-connected friends who could have offered him a bribe. The woman from the presentation told something slightly different. She said that there were people in the prison who had had more politically important well-connected friends them him, so thex could have got more easy a bribe  but they don't got it. And also after he escpade from the prison they had to repair the roof, because Chevalier fleed through the roof.
