Toward the end of his lifetime the chevalier wrote down his memoire. These memoire and the person itself were very controversial eventhough he met a lot of famous people who made his memoire a historical valuable source but there are a few points who are not matching with historical correct facts.

The first controversial theme in his memoire is that he pledged to live a  very rich and wealthy life at his time in switzerland but other sources are claiming that he borrowed all the money from wealthy persons which does not make him automaticlly a poor man but shows that his memoire might is not that what it seems to be.

The second sceptical critics areall about the memoire about the conversation with Voltair, which he wrote down a few years later and everyhistory class visitor knows that stuff which is written down a few years later is likely to be not true.

Critics were also about his memoire about his time at a notorious prison in venice whre he escaped out of a ceiling with nothing else than a piece of metall. This point is so sceptical because other intimates had better abilities and stuff to escape out of the prison than the Chevalier. This point is often overlooked but seems as the only legit one to explain the whole venice story, so the Chevalier made in his lifetime a few politically very well-connected friends who could have bought him out of prison.
