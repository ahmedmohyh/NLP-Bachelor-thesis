Chevalier didn't have at all a lot of friends in Venice, who had been able help him bribing the prison. But the bribe could actually be true because after he bribed the hole in the ceiling  had to be repaire. This was writen down in Venice so you can kind of proof the escape from Chevalier.
It didn't say that the Chevalier were poor but they always spent their money on paries and gambling and after that they had to borrow money from people they know so that means that they werent't really wealthy.They actually lived in Switzerland, but nothing was said about the destroing of paries
 In the hearing part it also didn't say anything about the meating with famous people, like kings and writers. 
It's true that Voltaire and Chevalier met sometimes and had conversations. After those conversations with Voltaire, Chevalier wrote everything down so his knowledge began to rise.
