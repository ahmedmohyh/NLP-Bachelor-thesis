There are three points which are mentioned in the memoirs of Chevalier.

The first one mentions that he spent a lot of money in switzerland at parties or for gambling, but the text disagrees and says that he borrowed all the money from a rich swiss merchant because he was poor.
The other one says that he worked a lot and got a lot of money. But he had to wait until he got the money and in that time, he borrowed it from the merchant.

The next point is about his conversations which are written many years after he had the actual conversation. The text says that it is impossible to remember what someone said that many years later.
The other one mentions that the Chevalier took lots of notes and kept them with him. Many people who knew the Chevalier agreed to this. So in that case it would be possible to write a text about a conversation in the past.

The last point tells us about the escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. The Chevalier escaped through the ceiling, where he made a hole with a piece of metal. The text mentions that the Chevalier had lots of good connections which helped him with the escape from the prison, so he didn't escape from the ceiling.
The other one said that there were poeple in the prison who had even better connections but didn't manage to escape. And another point/evidence was that the ceiling of the room, where the Chevalier was kept, had to be rapaired after the escape.
