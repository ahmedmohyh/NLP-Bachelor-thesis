The arguments that are mentioned in the audio file support the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir. As examples where mentioned, that he was really wealthy while living in Swizerland and had to borrow money, because his wealth consisted of assets, that took a few days to convert into money, so he had to borrow money, until the payment for his assets arrived. The text states only that he borrowed money and doesen't mention what his wealth was based on.
Another point mentioned in the audio file concerned the conversations with Voltaire. There is evidence from people who lived with him in his late years that he consulted notes while writing the memoir and he stated, that he tried to write as much as he rememberd from the conversations in a notebook after the conversations. But in the text, there is only mentioned, when he wrote his memoir and that was years after the conversations.There is no information in the text that concernes his notes and when or if he wrote them.
The last point was about Chevalier's jailbrake from a prison in Venice. Old gouvernement documents state, that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after his disapperance. So it can be seen as true that he broke out by making a hole in the ceiling and that he was not bribed with the help of an influencial friend because there were other prisoners that had much more poverful friends than him and weren't bribed.
