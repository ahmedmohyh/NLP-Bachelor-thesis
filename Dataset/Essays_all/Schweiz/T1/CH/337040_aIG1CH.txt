At the text, there are a lot of critics, which are based on facts in the life of Chevalier de Seingalt. But in the text, we actually don't know exactly, why a part of the book shouldn't be true. The critics just realised 2 things and combined them. They don't know the background of the facts, and it seems, that the Chevalier lied a lot, to make the book even more interesting. It is possible, that someone doesn't write the whole truth down, so at this point the critics are right. 

At the first part of the book, Chevalier wrote about his life during his stay in Switzerland. At the presentation, they sayed, that the Chevalier first had to sell things, before he had money, so he borrowed some, unless he hadn't sold it. At the text they agree with the fact, but they didn't say, that he selled something. Maybe they forgot it, or they didn't know it.

In the second part of the book, the Chevalier wrote about his conversations with Voltaire. The critics think, it couldn't be true, because he wrote down the conversation a few years later. But it is proved, that the Chevalier had kapt some notes about the conversation many years, before he wrote it down.

At the end of his book, he wrote about his escape from a prison in Venice. According to the critics, he just wrote that, that it is enjoyable to read. And they propose, that he could escape, due to his influense. But we shouldn't forget, that there were a lot of other people in this prison with more influence, and that they prison has to repair the ceiling after his escape.

So some parts of the facts in the text are true, but we don't know everything. In my opinion we should always be critic with critics.
