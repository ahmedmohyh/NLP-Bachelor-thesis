Chevalier de Seingalt was a famous historical figure and he wrote memoirs about his life. However it is believed that some parts of his memoirs have been invented by Chevalier himself. In the text and listening comprehension, three points have been pointed out which were mentioned in the memoirs.
Chevalier wrote in his memoirs that while living in Switzerland, he was wealthy. Both the text and listening comprehension agree that he spent his money on parties and gambling. In the listening comprehension it is said that it would require a few days to convert assets into money. They believe he was not a poor man and agree that Chevalier's memoirs are pretty accurate.
However in the reading comprehension it is believed that if Chevalier had really been rich, he wouldn't have needed to borrow money. Thus not trusting the memoirs for what they claim.
The second point mentioned is the conversations Chevalier had with Voltaire. The presentation explains that Chevalier wrote down the conversations each night after they occured and that he later often referred back to them. However, the text suggests otherwise. The text critises the memoir by saying that it was written years after the conversations had happened. It is pointed out that conversations from such  long time ago cannot be remembered as accurately. Nonetheless, if we compare the two ideas, a possibility is that Chevalier wrote the conversations down as the happened. Then while he was writing his memoir, he referred back to his notes and wrote the conversations as they were originally held.
Last but not least, the point about Chevalier breaking out of jail was pointed out. One version(the text) doesn't trust his memoir while the other does, saying that there really was a hole in the ceiling as proof.
