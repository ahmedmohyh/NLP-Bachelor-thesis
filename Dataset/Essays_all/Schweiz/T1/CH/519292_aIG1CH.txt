The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. He´s known many famous and well connected people, although he's been a controversial person. He had wealth, but in the written summery, it says that he could have borrowed the money from a swiss merchant.
Both summeries about the chevalier tell us that he maybe invented many events in his memoir, to make his life more interesting. 
For example his escape from the Venetian prison, he claims to have escaped byusimg a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. But critics think that he had help from his jailers, and that they were bribed to free him. In the text I've heard, they also said that his room has been repared right after he escaped prison. That means that they had to know his going to escape.
