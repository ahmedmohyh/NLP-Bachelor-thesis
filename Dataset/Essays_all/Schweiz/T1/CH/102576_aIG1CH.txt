In the reading part did pop up some doubts about the correctness of the momoir but in the listening part almost all of them were destroied. 
It is almost impossible to write down a memoir 100% correct and it's more difficult when you write down some conversations because you can't remember every and each wort you have ever said. This is a point some critics raised but some witnesses did say that he consulted some papers, where he looked up important information, when he wrote his memoir. This means that it is possible to know excactly what was said in a chat some years ago.
Furthermore he wrote that he spent a lot of time gambling and partying but he still needed to borrow money. Wasn't he as rich as he mentioned in his memoir? In the listening part was mentioned that he needed to borrow money because as a mechant e did not gained money on a certain date in the month but e got money when e sold something. While he waited to get his money form a customer he borrowed money to continue with his lifestyle.
And a third importent thing was his brakeout of the prison. Yes it could be possible that some guards freed him because a person of interest told him to but in the same time he used to be in prison there were other people inprisoned with much more power and these were not freed. And when Chevalier did not escaped through the roof why was it nessesary to repaire the roof (there exist some notes about this repaire work) after Chevalier was no longer inprisoned?
I guess the points
