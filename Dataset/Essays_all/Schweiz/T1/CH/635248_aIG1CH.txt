Chevalier

It is a fact that memoirs mostly are not a hundret percent true. Naturally some are more than others and the"Chevalier" is might one of them.
In its plug there are many lies and situations which never have happened or not the way it is written down.

On one hand the text says that the Chevalier was never rich and he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. On the other hand the listening declared that he really had money but not in a bank account. He investigated, so he had money but was not able to use it and this why he had to lend some.

The conversation with Voltaire is also told twice. On one side he seems to be a lier but on the other he looks like an organized serious writer.

Last but not least is his prison escape. In the text it is told that he some friends with goog influence who could have freem him. But in the listening they say that others had better friends and were never able to escape. But it is true that they had to repair his cell after his escape.
