First of all a memoir can't be fully correct. It is a collection of memories over years. So there are a few things that are possible in Chevaliers memoirs.
He claimed, that he would have been rich. He spent lots of money for parties, so that proofs that he couln't have been poor at all. So why did he have to borrow money of Swiss merchants? Maybe Chevalier lost all of his money, because he celebrated to many parties. 
He also wrote down, that he had met Voltaire a famous writer. That could be possible too. He wrote down some notes, while he was reading with Voltaire. Perhaps Chevalier wrote down his momories much later, then writing down his notes.
In the third topic which was pointed out, it says, that Chevalier has escaped from prison in Venice. In the text we can read, that he has made a big hole in the ceiling to escape. In the presentation we could hear, that they really had to reapair the ceiling in this time. So this memoir could be possible.
