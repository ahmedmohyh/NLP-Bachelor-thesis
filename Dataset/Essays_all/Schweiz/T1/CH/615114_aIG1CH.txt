Is Chevalier`s memoir a good historical source? Is all true what he writes? 
In the presentation they say as first argument the chevalier wasn`t poor. In the text is written that the Chevalier borrowed money but if he really had been rich he would not have needed the money. 
The second argument of the presentation is that there are some witnesses wich confirmed that the Chevalier make notes and write a lot. So he can remember the conversations. But in the text is written that they have doubts if Chevalier really can remember all the conversations because the memoir was written many years after the conversations.
The third argument of the presentation is that they have to repair the priosn in wich Chevalier was and therefore they believe that Chevalier really break out of the Venetian prison. In the text they mean that it isn`t true.
