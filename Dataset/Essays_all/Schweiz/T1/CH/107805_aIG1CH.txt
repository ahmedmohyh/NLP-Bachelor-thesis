While not everything may be true, the person that spoke thinks that the most of it is correct. Firstly, the Chevalier wasn't poor. He just invested in different things and then had wait till his money came back. Sometimes he had to take a loan because the money didn't arrive early enough. But that certainly doesn't mean being poor. About the conversations he had with Voltaire, the speaker said that the Chevalier wrote everything down one to two days later, which contradicts that the memoir is not accurate. He just didn't release it to the public for many years. And finally his escape from a notorious venetian prison. The speaker claims, that there were many other prisoners who had even better connections to politically friends in Venice, though they could not escape. Also for some reason, the ceiling had to be repaired after the Chevalier broke out. These are two strong arguments, in my opinion, that his exciting escape may be true. 

The speaker pretty much has an argument, or a story what could have happened, for every single point. While I also think that the chevalier made some of his adventures up, I certainly think that most of it is true, since his adventures are not that absurd.
