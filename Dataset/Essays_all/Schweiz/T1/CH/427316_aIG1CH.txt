Chevalier had three memorable points in his life. The first is, that he lived for a while in Switzerland and lived a very wealthy life there. Critics are't very sure if this could possibly be true. Because due to some reports, Chevalier borrowed huge sums of money, during his time in Switzerland. The second point is, that he met the famous autor Voltaire, but not only that. He could remember clearly what the two had talked with each other. Friends of him witnessed, that he wrote every converstion with Voltaire into some kind of diary, so that is why he was able to remember nearly every part of the conversation the two had with each other. The third point is, that Chevalier had escaped from the prison of Venice. This point is probably true, because reports show, that the prison repaired the ceiling of the cell Chevalier was in, shortly after Chevalier's Escape. So why should they repair the ceiling, if Chevalier hadn't escaped through exactly that ceiling. Critics say, if other people with much more ifluence couldn't escape from the same prison, why should Chevalier with his small influence been able to escape?
