The pesentation, that we listend to, wanted to wiederlegen the critics and doubts of Chevalier's memoir recounting his life. 
While the Chevalier lived in Switzerland,he borrowd sums of money to go to partys and to go gambling.Chevalier wroted that he was a wealthy man. Critics claims that he wasn't so rich like he said. Why, otherwise, did he borrowd. The hear text give this resolution: when you want to get money from the bank in an other land, you have to wait some days. So for this first days, he had to borrow money.

The hear text also tell us that after or while having a conversation with famous people, he often took notes so he couldn't forget anything. So the critic of the text, that it's impossible to remember exact phreases from the speach of Voltaire could false.

There is also a missunderstanding with the escape of Chavalier from prison. Critics questioned, that he escaped with  making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. But we can prove that after Chevalier de Seingalt was escaped, the ceiling had to get repaired. And there were other prisoners who were also "famous persons" and the jailers didn't  bribe them free.
