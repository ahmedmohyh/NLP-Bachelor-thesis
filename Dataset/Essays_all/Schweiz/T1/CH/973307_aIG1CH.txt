In this next essay, which i get forced to write, i take my place about why the Chevalier de Seingalts life story is not wrong or is wrong. For this i compared the upstanding text with the listening, which i heard before. There are three passages in text where are differences with the listening.
So first i want to say that just because it seems, that Chevlier wrote the memori exciting than it really was, it is also possible that Chevalier just had some other feeling about life than the rest of humanity. Because no one can understand how somone else think at all. And if you dont argue with me you soud not be correcting this essay. And it is also like this, that his story is as famous as it is for the reason that he wrote in this overexiting glamorous wey. 
So to the first point with the borrowing of money. He just needed the money because he did many partys and gambling. And because his money did not fly in some magic way to him he had to wait for his money. But he did not wait with partying so he had to borrow money.
Time caused i just do the last point. It is said that he coudnt break out because other people had more powerful friends than him. And if they coud not escape then why shoud he? I got an other question why shoud his cell got repared after he got away if he dindt broke out?
