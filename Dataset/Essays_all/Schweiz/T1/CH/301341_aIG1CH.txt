The woman said, that he wrote down everything he knew from his conversations with the famous people. That's the point why his memoirs are so populare.But the thing that someone remembers isn't the true happening. Most it is more a feeling or something what he thinks that happens. The other person would often write an very different storie about this meeting.
In the text is written, that the Chevalier is very rich and that he hasn't to borrow money because of this. But the woman said, that borrowing money isn't a sign of poorness. In Switzerland for example is it cheeper to take a credit for the house than to pay everything at the beginning. How much money you spend isn't a sign of richness. It does more show how you live. But it is true, that by richer people the tendence for spending money is bigger than by poor people. Often you have to invest some money in something to get than more money. For example if you buy a new car to get to your work you have to pay a lot of money, but in the end you can work everyday an half an hour more and you don't have to pay the train ticket. Such investitones are things that poor people can't do.

The Chevalier could escape from the prison and other prisoner couldn't escape. This has to do with his caracter. If someone tel you that it is important to let him free you have to trust him. It's more importent that you belive him the lie or the story that he tells you, than be strong. That's why other couldn't escape from the same prison.
