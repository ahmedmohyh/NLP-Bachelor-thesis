In the text, there are many arguments against the truth of the life from Chevalier de Seingalt. On the other handside de woman in the listening have arguments for the life of this controversial figure. She wants to questioned the skeptical arguments from the Critics.

According to the text the Chevalier could not be rich, because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. The woman claimed that the Chevalier have not to be poor, if he only borrow money. He spend his money not only for parties. He lend much to other people. Furthermore the text is also skeptical about the accuracy of the converstations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and Voltaire. It was written many years after the conversations occured. The argument of the woman was, that he note things after the conversations and years later he finished them with other words or expressions, hence this conversasions of the records might be right.
At last the writer of the text questioned the memoir's account of the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to grab a hole. According to the presentation of the woman he has not many of political well -connected friends in Venice, who could offered a tribe in contrast to other people in the prison. So it was more difficult to get out of the prison. I heard also, that the prison was renovated and so I think it was his chance to left the prison with a piece of metal, yet also with help from friends.
