In the text they say that Chevalier's memoires were a historical source about the European society in the eighteenth century, but also that you can't really be sure if everything he said is true because they think that he've invented many of the things he have written to make his life mor exciting.

 But the woman in the record has the opinion that the most things Chevalier said were true and plausible. In the text they say that while Chevalier was living in Swtizerland he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, so he can't have been really wealthy. But the woman thinks that that isn't an argument because he first spent a lot of money at parties and then he had to borrow the money so in her view he was rich and it is sometinhg normal to borrow a little money of a friend.
.
Then they say that that what he have written about the conversation between him and Voltaire can't be true because it was written down many years later, the woman arguments that he has written everthing down emediatelyin  the same night but he haven't put it emediately in his memoires

 The last thing the Text questioned was his escape from the prison in Venice because other prisoners were much more well-connected than he was and couldn't escape, but hte women says that they had to preapre his room new and to renovate everything. So she asks the question why they should have done that if he wouldn't been escaped.
