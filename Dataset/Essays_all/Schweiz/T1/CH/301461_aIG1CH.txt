First off, the note and the presentation were very contoversial. While the writer of the note mainly mentions the doubt of accuracy of the memoir, the woman talking actually showes that it might have been true. She explaines the three main episodes, which were the loan from a merchant in Switzerland (which the text sees as evidence that he was not in fact rich), his conversations with Voltaire (which the text claims could not be remembered accurately for so long) and his escape from a prison in Venice through a hole in the ceiling. First, she explains that the loan maid sense because while Chevalier in fact did have to borrow some money, it was only because the price of his gambling wasn't yet converted into money and it took some days to get back to him. About the conversations with Voltaire she says that he wrote everything down the next day of the actual conversation and kept these notes until writing the memoir. As evidence she says this is also mentioned in the memoir and Chevalier apparently often kept notes. The last episode was the escape, to which she first says that there have actually been a lot more famous people in the prison than Chevalier. Most of them had way more powerful friends than he did and thus would've probably gotten out before him. Also, the ceiling of his room had to be repaired shortly after his escape, which shows that it had actually been damaged.
