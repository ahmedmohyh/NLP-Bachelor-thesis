Chevalier was a very rich guy. We know that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. You aren't a poor guy if you borrow money. So the critics on him that he hadn't a lot of money are completly wrong. The conversation with the voltaire wasn't fake in his memoire. He had a conversation and after also on the same day which he had the conversation he had written down anything what thay talked about. He just brought them out many later. The critics were that he couldn't imagine what they talked about so many years later but as they said in the presentation he did it on the same day. And the escape happened how he said that. There were many more powerful prisoners in the prison but they all hadn't a chance to escape. And after Chevalier escaped, they had to repair the ceiling in his room. Thats like Chevalier said.
