Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir can be cut up in three parts: 
In the first part it's about his social life in Switzerland where he spent lots of money on gambling and parties. He himself was vey rich but according to the text he borrowed money from Swiss merchants so critics argue that he actually didn't have that much money. But the listening says that while Chevalier was very rich he owned lots of property which was a big part of his wealth. So he always had to wait several days until he sold property and in mean time he borrowed money from merchants.
The second part is about his conversations with Voltaire. It is confirmed that Chevalier met Voltaire in the early part of his life but critics complain that Chevalier couldn't possibly remember the conversation accurately so he invented phrases and such. But apparently Chevalier wrote up the conversations afterwards and used them while writing his memoir which family members could confirm.
Last but not least in the third part he escaped an infamous Venice prison. Chevalier claims that he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped through the roof. But again some critics say that that isn't possible with no reasoning at all but instead he bribed Chevalier's jailers. Not to forget Chevalier also had a number of good friends in the Venice government. Though the listening says that he did escape through the roof because other friends with even more political strong friends couldn't escape and in some ancient Venice papers it is mentioned that Venice after Chevalier had escaped had to pay for some repairs in Chevalier's prison room for the ceiling.
