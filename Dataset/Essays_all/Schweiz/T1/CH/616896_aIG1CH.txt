The woman who made the presentation about Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoir, in which he wrote about his experiences and conversations with important people in his life, thinks that what he wrote is mostly true. She explains the three points which critics mentioned the most and explains them so that they make sense. 
First, she says that Chevalier claims to be very wealthy when he was in Switzerland but after her opinion, he didn`t have a lot of cash. Instead, he had a lot of things which had a very high value and he had to sell them first in order to get more cash. So during the time when he didn`t have the money yet, he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The text says that borrowing money is a proof for his exagerating in the whole memoir.
Second, the woman says that he took notes every evening after a conversation with Voltaire and wrote his memoir with the help of this notes many years later. This theory is also supported by family members who say that Chevalier often used notes while writting his memoir. But the text says, that it is impossible to remember exact parts of a conversation many years after it took place and takes this as a reason for their critic on the accuracy of those conversations.
Third, Chevalier writes that he broke out of jail in Venice by using a oiece of metal with which he made a hole in the ceiling and climbed out. While the text says that it is way more realistic that one of his important Venetian friends offered a bribe for him, the presenting woman knows of many other prisoniers with more important friends which weren`t offered a bribe. Also, she knows from a man who worked in that prison, who says that the ceiling of Chevalier`s cell had to be repared shortly after his break out.
