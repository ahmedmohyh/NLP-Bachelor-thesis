Chevalier met many famous people. He was a somewhat controversial figure. Chevalier's memoires were mostly correct.Chevalier didn't need to borrow money if he was rich. Some people don't think that Chevalier escaped from prison by bribing. It's unlikely because he didn't have friends with as much influence as some other prisoners had who didn't escape. From a source we get to know that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired. That's why he's described his getaway correctly.
To sum it up many of Chevalier's memoires were correct.
