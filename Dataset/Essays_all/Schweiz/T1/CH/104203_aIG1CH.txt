In the listening excercise I just heared, the three points that were also mentioned in the text I've read befor are the following:
His life in switzerland, the meeting with the famous writer Voltaire and his "escape" from a prison.
First the listening excercise:
while Voltaire was in Switzerland he claimed to be a very wealthy man. But he was also a gambler and player. While he was waiting for his money he sometimes had to lend money from others until he received his cash.
The meeting with the writer was very important for Voltaire, which is why he kept notes of it and was able to produce years later a very accurate text about the conversation.
In the prison that he was held in, many people had very powerful friends, even more than he had.
This and the fact that an old writing claimed that the ceiling in his prison room had to be repaired after he left are potential evidence for him actually escaping the prison by himself instead of his friends just offering a bribe.
Now whats the diffrence between the listening excerice and the text itself? The author that has written the text was very critical about the events Voltaire has been talking about actually happening.
Everytime he explained the situation, he claims that critics have their thoughts about the storys actually being true, which is the complete opposite from what I've heared in the listening excerice, where every story was based on some kind of fact or "evidence" for the event actually happening the way Voltaire wrote about it.
So whilst the text is very sceptical about Voltaires storys, the person talking about it believed what he said based on the facts he brought up.
