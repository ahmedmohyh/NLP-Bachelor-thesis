So now what do both sources have in common? Both of them spend time with the memoir of Chevalier. But that's the only thing they have in common, because they show different opinions.
 The written text is rather sceptical in comparison to the audible source. The written part claims that he wasn't as wealthy while living in Switzerland as he said because he had to borrow money from a merchandise. The argument of the other source is that just because he had to borrow money doesn't mean he wasn't wealthy. He had to wait for his "things" to convert into money but he had a glamourous life. The next critcal aspect was his part about Voltaire, where the sceptical people say the phrases of the conversations with him are too exact to be correct because he wrote his memoir many years later. On the other hand the audible part says,  he took notes right after chatting with Voltaire. And now to the last point, the escape from a prison in Venice. The critical part arguments that he just wrote it like that because it's more exciting to read but in reality he probably bribed his jailers to free him and this was possible because of his politically well-connected friends in Venice. On the other hand the positively charged people say that very old venician documents claim that the prison room of Chevalier had to be repared right after him beeing free again. So why should they repair a room if he hadn't broken it?

In the end we can say that both sources are well thinked about the case of Chevaliers memoirs and both have equally good arguments to start a propper discussion.
