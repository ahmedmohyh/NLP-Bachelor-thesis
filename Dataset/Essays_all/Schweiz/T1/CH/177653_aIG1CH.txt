The memoir is a very valuable historical source and it is pretty accurate. Many people thought he invented some events, but it is all about accuracy.
 
While Chevalier lived in Switzerland, he was very wealthy. He went out gambling and partying. Sometimes he had to wait for his money, so he had to borrow some from other people, in this case a Swiss merchant. The text claims that Chevalier had to borrow the most of his money from this merchant, but in fact he wasn't poor, he just had to wait for his money to arrive. 

Secondly, the talk and meeting between Chevalier and Voltaire. The memoir was written years after their conversation, but Chevalier wrote everything down. Old aquantience and friends of Chevalier claimed that Chevalier himself always had a notebook or paper with him. They don't doubt that he wrote down his conversation with Voltaire. In that way, Chevalier could always remember the exact phrases and the meeting itself.

Thirdly, critics doubt that Chevalier could escape prison and that he most likely were bribed free, but the problem was that other prisioners had much higher friends than Chevalier and they weren't bribed free. Furthermore, a old venetian document was found. It was written that in the cell where Chevalier stayed was a hole in the ceiling and it had to be fixed. Chevalier claimed that he made a hole in the ceiling with a metal piece and then climbed through the roof.
