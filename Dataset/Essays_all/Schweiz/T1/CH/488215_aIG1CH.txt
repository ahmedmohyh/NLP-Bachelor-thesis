 Chevalier

     The text say's, that many people believe the Chevalier was poor when he lived in Switzerland, because he had to borrow money from a merchant but this doesn't mean he was actually poor. He could also have waited for his money because it wasn't there yet, but he did need money to do something and later he could pay it back.
     The second thing the Chevalier tells about in his memoir are his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. Many people don't think,that he can be remembering his conversations, because they were many years ago. But in the listening, it is said, that he wrote down notes about his conversation every day and he used journals while writing the memoir.
     The third thing is his breakout of a prison in Venice. But many people are in doubt, that he truly escaped through the ceiling, like he told it in his memoirs, but there are documents who say, that the roof had to be repaired a few days after his escape.
