The text amd the presentation both discuss the topic about the Chevaliers truthfullness. In the text they clearly state that they don't believe that the Chevaliers memoir was correct. In his memoir he claimed to be a very wealthy and rich man and he goes on telling stories about the time he spent in Switzerland. In the text and the presentation they say that he attended many parties and liked to gamble.While the critics claim that evidence surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed quite an amount of money from a merchant and wasn't that wealthy afterall, they argue in the presentation that he didn't have cash. Hesold houses and it alway took some time forthe money to get to him.

In his memoir he also wrote down many conversations he had ahd with friends and mentionable people. While critics say that you can not remember a conversation word by word and that he probably made everything up, his followers know that hewrote down everything he remebered from a conversation on the same day. 

The last story mentioned is his grand prison escape from the  Venetian prison. Apparently he escaped by carving a whole in the ceiling by using a piece of metal, then climbing through the roof.Critics believe that it is more likely that the Chevalier bribed his jailers to let him out. 
In the presentation the Chevalier's followers claim that there are documents that prove that right after his escape, the Chevailer's ceiling had to be fixed.
