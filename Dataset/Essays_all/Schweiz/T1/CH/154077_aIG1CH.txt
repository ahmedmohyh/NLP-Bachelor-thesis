The first argument was, that even though he had to take a loan from a merchant, him being rich was still highly possibly. The reason given is that Chevalier himself had been a merchant and while he just bought stuff to sell, he lacked liquid money to hold his parties. To summarize, it takes time in his buisiness to make money because after he buys something, while Chevalier always spends tons of money.
The second point about his discussions with Voltaire was also explained quite simply. Chevalier immediatly made notes after each session with his friend and took them as a help once he wrote his memoires. This had been confirmed by other friends and workers of him, they saw how he often looked up his journal and notes while writing.
So the last point against the critics is that it`s highly possible that Chevalier de Seingalt really broke out of the Venetian prison without being helped by political friends. The lecturer said, that in the prison there were many people that had even more powerful connections, but not one of them could escape. Another evidence is that the sealing of his chamber had to be repaired after his escape which equals him having harmed it, or like he wrote "made a hole into it".
To conclude this text, the arguments of the lecturer seemed to be well-made, but without any furthrt knowledge, I can`t say whom to believe.
