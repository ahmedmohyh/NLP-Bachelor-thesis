Chevalier what possibly really happened and what was added as a fairy tale

Chevalier de Seingalts memoir counts as a historically very reliable source. It is a fact that the Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling.
In the text it is said that he could not have been that wealthy as he had to loan money from a swiss merchant. However the person that held the presentation contradicted that statement, by adding that although he had to lend money that does not mean that he was poor. She said that the reason as to why he had to borrow money was not because he was not wealthy but because there was a longer waiting time between his money won through gambling arriving and his great amount of expenses thus forcing him to find a source of money to overcome his shortage.


His conversation with Voltaire does not have to be partially invented, as it is said that kept his notes of the conversation for a very long time and  on top of that consulted many additional notes. While we cannot be certain as to whether all of the conversation is correct, we cannot just guess that he invented some parts of it as he did keep his notes to help him whith his memoir.

His prison break can be truthful although it seems difficult to achieve. It is certain that he escaped the prison and while bribery was more or less unlikely as there were much better connected people in jail, it is very likely that he broke out by creating a hole in the ceiling as they had to repair the ceiling after his escape.

All of those contradictions make the memoir seem more reliable than shown as in the text above. As there are facts that support the truthfulness of the memoir.
