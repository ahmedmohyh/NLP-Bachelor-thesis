The defenders of Chevalier try to prove the accuracy of his memoir. First of all they explain that it's not contoversial that Chevalier was rich although he borrowed money in switzerland. They say that it's normal in switzerland that you have to sell first before you get you money. So Chevalier needed to borrow money for his party lifestyle, because his clients didn't paid him yet the money they should. And during he waited for his money he went and borrowed some, knowing that he will get his money soon. 
Secondly they say that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire indeed are really accurately. Chevalier said that in the night right after the conversation he took notes about everything they talked about. He kept his notes long time by himself before he wrote his memoir but text from the conversations were written right afterwards. Also friends of Chevalier said that he often took notes from conversations right afterwards. So it's prooven that his conversation between Voltaire and him indeed is accurately.
The other statement from the text, that it's really unbelievable that he could escape from the prison is also not true. They explained that in this prison there were a lot of other persons who had better connections than him, and even they couldnt get out through there connections. Also it is prooven that right after his escape the ceiling where he said he made a hole, needed to be repaired. This was the statement of the prison director. So it's clear taht Chevalier didn't lie.
