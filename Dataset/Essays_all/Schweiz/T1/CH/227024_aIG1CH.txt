"Chavalier"
The Presentation and the thext have the same subject. They both talk about the Chavalier and about the doupts wich people have about his stories. 
The writer of the text tells us that the Cahvalier used a piece of metal to make a hole inside the ceiling to climb through the roof. The guy from the presentation tells us nothing about the piece of metal, neither that he escaped through the roof. He just tells us, that the roof had to be made new. The "presentator" and the writer both say something, that he lived in Switzerland. The writer writes, that the people had doubts because the chavalier borrowed a lot of money. During the prasentation, the speaker never told us anything about this, the only thing he said was that he was rich an so on.
It is not sure if the Chavalier was able to write down his stories with every datail wich realy happenned. The speaker tells us something about a man called Venetian, who wrote dwon all his stories imediatly after they happend. The writer just tells us something about a man called Voltaire who made the stories after a confersation wich took place with the Cavalier a long time ago. 
This two stories have the same meaning but it is difficult to find out wich one of them is true.
