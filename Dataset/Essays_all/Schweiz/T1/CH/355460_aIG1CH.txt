Chevalier de Seingalt was a very controversial figure in european society from the 18th century. He had met many famoous people and he wrote memoirs from those meetings, so his memoirs were a very important historical source. The Chevalier was a very rich man, but still had to borrow money, due his money was all in property, which he had to sell first to get the money, which takes a few days. Critics were sceptical about his memoirs and that Chevalier may never have met Voltaire. They also didn´t really belive all Chevalier wrote, because he wrote the memoir years after meeting Voltaire and who can remember exactly what someone said years ago. The critics don´t belive that Chevalier escaped from an italian prison. He writes that he only used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, but critics say that he bribed his jailers to free him.
