The historicals aren't sure if they should believe the memoir of Chevalier or not. There ar some points which are showing that this all happened more or less but also there are some arguments that are showing us the oposit. 
First the women in the video recorde is talking about the exathurating money flow of Chevalier. So he did alot of party and had a fancy lifestyle will he was living in Switzerland. But the question is where did he got all his money from. The women tells us that Chevalier always had to wait for his money for some days due to this he had to asked people for money. Because of his expensiv lifestyle he run out of money really fast and while he was waiting, he needed money from someone else. This shows us that he wasn't poor at all, he just had a too expensive lifestyle. 
 About his conversations with Voltaire, we have the facts that he always had a little writting book with him in which he could have wrote some notes. He also did that when he met Voltaire. So when Chevalier wrote it down two years later he hadn't have to capure every conversation with Voltaire in his mind, due to is notes. 
The story about the prison also can be true owing to a note of a comisar, or someone who knew about the escaping of Chevalier. Thsi note tells us that the prisonguards had to fix the celing in the roof of the room of Chevalier. But the women is complaing about the fact taht no one but Cheavlier escaed from the priso  even alot of the prisoners had much better conections in Venice, conection how would help to escape.
