Chevalier de Seingnalt had a couple of interesting adventoures in his life, no doubt about that. He lived in the eighteenth century, where he met some famous people like kings and writers. At the end of his life, he wrote a memoir about his life, what he had seen and just about some interesting story's.

In the text, they alway's criticise Chevalier, that it can't be true what he is saying, for example that he was saying he was very rich in switzerland, but he had sometimes to borrow money, so the criticers are saying that you don't need to borrow money if you're rich. 
Further they are complaining about the story between Chevalier and Voltaire. That it can't be true that all is correct what he is saying. 

In the Presentation which I heard, there was an other position described, this person was showing some fact's against this criticers. They said that it's possible that you have to borrow some money sometimes, even if you're rich. And mentioned an example that he could have paid the whole event and then he was a bit broke because that costs a lot. Also they told abour the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier, it's possible that there are some mistakes in it, but the most would be true. 

These two Positions are just a bit against each other, because you can't know about everything, also about the escape out of the prison. There are story's you can never know if they are true or not.
