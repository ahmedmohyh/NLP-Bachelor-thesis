Chevalier de Seingalt said in his memoir that he was very rich. He's a controversial figure. In the presentation were three arguments for Chevalier and his richness and his controversial memoir. The first is, that he had a lot of money. In the text, they're saying he just borrowed it and when it isn't his money, he isn't rich. Against this critic is this argument from the presentation. In his bussiness he had to sell first to get money. He had to borrow, that he can invest, his money come after the event. The second argument in the presentation ist that he just had written down the things he remembered. A memoir is from the view of the writer and not objective. The critic in the text, that it can't be right because it was written many years later, is not fair because he remembered the situation and just wrore down everything he knew. The third argument says that he had a lot of influence. He escaped out of prison, where another really rich men were in. He had to be really influencing and rich to do this. The text says that it's just a story but also says that he had a number of politically well-connected friends that helped him.
