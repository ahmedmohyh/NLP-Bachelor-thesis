The written text claims that Chevalier invented many events in his memoir. But the Presentation said something else. It agreed,, that no memoir is to h, undered per cent accurated, but that Chevalier's are a very reliable source. The text is also suspicios about Chevalier beeing rich. Because evidences has surfaced, that he borrowed a huge amount of money and if the man were rich as he claimed to be, he wouldn't have the need to borrow money. THe presentation said something different. Then the reported, that because of his love for gambling and party he had to sell some property. and till the property arrives he had to borrowe some money, but payed it back later, till the other money arrived. The text has also doubts about the accuray of the conversation Chevalier held withb Voltaire. THe records in his memoir are very precise and thats suspicios, because it's impossible to remember the exact phrases of a conversation.
The presentation believes in the record and it's accuracy. Because it's said that each night after Chevalier had talked to Voltaire he wrote the conversation down. Word by words, this explaines the accuracy of the records.
Plus text wrote, that critis have questioned the part of the memoir, where Chevalier claims to be escaped from a notorious prison in Venice, by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. And that it's more likely, that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him.
But according to the presentation there are evidences that Chevalier escaped through the ceiling, Because the ceiling of his cell in had to be repared.
