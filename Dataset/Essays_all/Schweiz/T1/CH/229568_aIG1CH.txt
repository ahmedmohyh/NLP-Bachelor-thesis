Chevalier wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. The text says that Chevalier wasn't verry rich because he had to borrow money. But in the interview they said that because he spent so much money on parties and gambling he just had to wait for more money and for this time he borrowed some. Also the text doesn't believe in the writting about the conversation between him and Voltaire and that he ascaped the prison in Venice throu the roof. The text thinks that his politically well-connected friends had offered a bribe to free him. In the interview they think it could be true because he could write his conversation the day after and about the prison they said that he hadn't better friends than others in the prison. Also they said it could be true because after he "left" the prison the roof had to be repared.
