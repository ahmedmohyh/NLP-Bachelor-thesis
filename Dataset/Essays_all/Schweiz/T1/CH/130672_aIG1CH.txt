In the text it is said that the Chevalier had many well-connected friends in Venice who could have helped him to escape from the prison in Venice, but the speaker said that even if he had some well-connected friends there were many other prisoner who had much more friends who could have helped them out but none of them was able to do so. It is also written in the text that the Chevalier escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling an climbing through the roof which isn't said in the documentary I listened.
In the text it is also said that the accuracy of the converstation with Voltaire is unlogical because he wrote it many years after. But the speaker said that Chevalier wrote the conversation just after he got home then. So he might could remember the most phrases of the conversation.
