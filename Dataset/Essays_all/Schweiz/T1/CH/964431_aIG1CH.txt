The text about the memoir from Chevalier de Seingalt and the lecture about it state two drasticly diffrent oppinions. The text says that his memoir couldn't be so accurate in every detail. For example the conversation he had with the famous writer Voltaire couldn't be true because he wrote his memoir long after he spoke with Voltaire. The lecture states that he wrote all of his conversation down after he had them with Voltair. The story about his prisonbreak is also false according ton the text. Why would he spoon his way out of his imprisonment if he could have just bought his way out of it? That is because other, more powerful and richer people, were held as prisonners too and they couldn't just buy themselfs out. But the prison repaired the ceiling of his cell after he left which f According to the text he borrowed money for his partys and events so another point why he couldn't buy himself out. The lecture states otherwise: He got a loan because he needed money before he had his assets convert the real money. A loan is not always equals poor. Sometimes it is just an investment like in Chevalier de Seingalts case.
