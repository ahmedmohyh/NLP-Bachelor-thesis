Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir about his life which has been discussed by many people since. Critics have questioned multiple parts of the memoir,  for example the fact that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy.They found out that in fact he had to borrow money from other people and hence, he couldn't be that wealthy. In the lecture about his life though they argue that even though he had to borrow money, that doesn't necessarily mean he was poor. With his job, he always had to wait several days to get paid and because of that, sometimes he had to get a loan from a friend to survive during these few days. 
Another part that critics have discussed are his memoirs about the conversations with Voltaire. They claim that since he wrote his memoir years later, he couldn't possibly remember everything he and Voltaire had talked about. The lecture on the other hand says that they know from other sources that for a while, each night, he would write down his conversations with Voltaire. This was also confirmed by some of his other friends, whom he told that he was doing just that. 
The third thing they mention in the text as well as in the lecture, is his escape from a prison in Venice. While it is written in his memoir that he got out by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing out, the people who question the memoir's accuracy say that it's way more likely some of his very powerful friends offered a bribe. In the lecture though they talk about other prisoners who had even more powerful friends than he did and who weren't able to get bribed either. Furthermore, old documents of that very prison report repairing a ceiling in the cell Chevalier was in and of course, it wouldn't make sense to repair a ceiling if it hadn't been damaged beforehand.
