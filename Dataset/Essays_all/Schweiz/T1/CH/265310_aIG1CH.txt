Chevalier

In the listening the woman explained that Chevaliers loans from a merchant do not mean, that he is poor. To prove this the woman that was speaking told that Chevalier spent lots of money on organizing parties for his friends and that he sometimes ran out of money hand had to wait until his new money arrived. So he lended money of a swiss merchant to survive that time.
However in the text they write that if Chevalier had been as rich as he claimed to bee he would not have needed to borrow money.

Another point is that in the text the critics write that Chevalier could impossibbly remember every detail of the conversations he held with Voltaire. But in the listening they explain that Chevalier wrote down every conversation with Voltaire the night after and later when he wrote his memoir he could look up the conversations. If he really did do this it could be very possible for him to remember so much details.

The last point they mentioned in the listening is that Chevalier could possibly escape the venician prison with only a piece of metal by making a hole in the ceiling. They disagree with the theory of the critics that says that his politically active friends in venice helped him. The woman explains that other prisonners had much more influencal friends than Chevalier but they did not come out of prison. Also she points out that the prison had to repair Chevaliers cell after he escaped or as the critics say was bought free.
