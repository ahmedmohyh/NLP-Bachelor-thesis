Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir of his life including all his adventures in the eighteenth ceintury. He met famous people, and some of them were kings and writers. There are historical sources but also critics that the stories are distorted or invented. Some of the things he wrote are pretty accured. In the reading and in the listening part there are mentioned three episodes he had written down.  
Chevalier was in switzerland and spent a huge amount of money on parties and gambling. He was waiting at the bar for his money that didn't show up. Critics are also skeptical about the accurancy of the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire because the memory was written down many years after the conversation. As in the listening said, Chevalier wrote right after the conversation everything down he remembered. So this should be proved as right. The last episode talks about his escape of the prison in Venice. In the reading is mentioned that he claimed to have escaped the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling through the roof. Critics claim thet this makes the reading of those memoir more enjoyable and that it's more likely the Chevalier's jailers were bribbed to free him. They point out that the Chevalier had a number of well-connected friends in Venice who were politically active to offer him a bribe. In the presentation is explained that the Chevalier could escape is true. He had friends in Venice but other prisoners had much more stronger friends and they weren't living free for their life. The best evidence which proves that he could have escaped is the fact that the ceiling had been repaired after his escape.
In conclusion, the historical resources proves that the memoir of his life and adventures is true and not invented.
