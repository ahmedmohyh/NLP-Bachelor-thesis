The woman speaking claimed that memoirs can not be correct since they are only written by memories which tend to fade fast and be inaccurate. But she also said that Chevaliers memoirs seem to be quite reliable.

The first thing which the woman pointed out was Chevaliers richness. She does not think that borrowing money from a merchant means that someone is poor as the critics claim. Chevalier might have not had any cash so he had to borrow himself some money to finance his parties and gambling, but he probably had a large amount of wealth which wasn't spendable, because it was not cash.

The text points out that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire can not possibly be accurate, but the woman claims that it is known that Chevalier wrote everything what he could remember down just after conversing with Voltaire. Years after he used those notes to include his freshest memories of their conversations in his book.

While the critics complain that Chevalier wasn't able to escape from prison, but that his jailers were bribed to free him, the woman pointed out that there a roof  had ato be fixed in the prison in Venice just according to the story. So it seems very likely that Chevaliers memoirs are actually reliable.
