The first critic point about the text is about the thing, that Chevalier was poor.The reason who's given in the text is that he had borrowed some money while he was in Switzerland. But to his time in Switzerland they made many parties, there they spent much money, but for to get money they have to sell first.Between selling and get the money were about three day. For to go out he had to have some money on these days, that's why he borrowed some money from some rich friends.
The second point is that he didn't met Voltaire in real life. Because he wrote down sentence by sentence from the meetings with him and that was manyyears before he wrote his memoir. But he wrotes too that he after every night he met him he wrote down all he still knew and he kept the noticed thing for many years and wrote it down in his memoir.
The third one is that he escaped with some good friends in the politics from the prison.But there were other people that had much more important friends and they didn't got out of the jail. And the officers had to repair his room, why should they do that when he gots out with some friends help. The prison room wouldn't be broken.
