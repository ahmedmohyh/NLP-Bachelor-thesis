Chevalier de Seingalt

Cheavalier de Seingalt lived from 1725- 1798 and in the end of his life he wrote a long mermoir recounting his life and adventures.
He met many famous people for example writers like Voltaire.
There are doubts about his mermoir. He did not take notes every day about the conversations he had with Voltaire because it was written many years after the conversations occured. So it is impossible that he can remember every phrase exact.

He was not always very rich because if he was, he would not needed to borrow money. In the audio it says that he had to sell first to make money but he still had to borrow it.

In the audio it says that there were many other prisoners who had more well-connected friends than he had, so they would have had a bigger chance to escape through that way than him. Also they had to repair the ceiling after he escaped from the prison in Venice, Italy but in the text it says that the Chevailer's jailers were bribed to free him.
