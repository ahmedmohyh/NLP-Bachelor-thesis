First of all, if we borrow money it isn't always because of poverty. The Chevalier had a job, in which he had become only every few days money. The text says that the Chevalier had spent lots of money on parties or gambling. So if he had spent all his money before he has got new, he had to borrow it from a merchant. 
The text says that the Chevalier couldn't captured these conversations accurately, because there is to many time between the actual conversation and the writing of the memoir. But as in the interview said, Chevalier has written directly after these conversations notes about it and had them during this time and so it would be possible to write an accurately memoir. 
The interview says that there were more persons in the prison who had more and bigger politically well-connected friends than the Chevalier but they didn't get a bride. So it can't be possible that he had got a bride. That means, he had to escape out of prison, like in the memoir said.
