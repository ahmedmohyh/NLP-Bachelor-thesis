Chevalier de Seingalt wrote every experience he made in this life in a long memoir. Critics raised a lot of questions about it. They said, Chevalier wasn't honest about everything he wrote. First of all, the Chevalier met a lot of famous people, including Voltaire. It was quite surprisingly that he was able to write the whole conversation word by word down. In this case it was possible for the Chevalier to remember everything many years later. Second he borrowed money from a person in Switzerland. We could think the wasn't rich. But he wasn't poor eighter. He had to borrow the money because he had to sell his property to get more money. He was waiting for his money to arrive. A point that critics have questioned was his escape from the prison in Venice. It sounded quite impossibly to get out of the prison through a hole made by using a pice of metal. The critics suggested that some of the Chevaliers famous rich friend bought him free.
