The Woman in the presentation says, that no memoir is perfectly correct. But she also mentions, that Chevalier's is quite accurate. The text says the exact opposite. The woman tells a few examples, to confirm the accuracy of Chevaliers memoir. She says, that Chevalier was very rich and that the fact, that he borrowed money in Switzerland can't be used against that. She thinks, that he just didn't have his property in form of cash. so when he needed money for gambling or making party, he had to sell something, and because he couldn't get the cash immediatly, he had to borrow some. The text says, that the records of the conversation between him and Volaire can't be very accurate because of the long time period between the conversation and the record. The woman fights against that statement, with the argument, that Chevalier still had the notes from the conversation. The story of the prison escape of Venice seems quite unlikely, says the text. It would be more likely, that Chevalier got out of the prison because he had powerful friends. The woman tells, that other men in prison had much more powerfull connections and didn't get out neither. And the fact, that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, would also confirm the story.
