Not every deteil can be correct if you write a long memoir!

The text told that the Chevalier was poor and he needed to borrow money because he spent a lot money for parties and gambling. But the woemen said that he wasen`t poor at all but to earn money you need some days. So he was healthy and he wasen`t poor. An other point was that some critics have also questioned the menoir`s account of the Chevalier`s escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. The text told us that he was able to escape because he had friends which helped him because of the politically well-connected friends of the Chevalier in Venice. The women said that he had no strong friends at the prison and he did it by himself! This fact is based on documents of the goverment of Venice, Italy.

At all we can say that the base of the memoir is correct but not every detail. One reason could be that he didn`t make a jounal and he wrote the memoir based on his memories and feelings and all of us know that we see some situations different then an other one do.
