The lecture disagrees with the text in all of the three points made. The texts says, that the chevalier was quite surely poor because he had to lend money from a swiss merchant. The lecture disagrees: Getting a loan from somebody does't need mean that he is poor. It could be, that the chevalier, after spending a lot of money on parties and gambling, needed to wait for his money to arrive. In the mean time he needed to loan money from this merchant to keep up his wealth. The text also states, that he couldn't have written the exact conversations between him and Voltaire, because he wrote his memoir many years later. The lecture, on the other hand, states, that the Chevalier wrote down notes the nights after every conversation he had with Voltaire. In his memoir he used a lot of these notes, as stated by his friends.
The third point is the escape from the Venitian prison. The text claims, that the Chevalier could have never escaped through the ceiling and most likely bribed, because of his good connenctions, his way to freedom. The lecture dissaproves this point with some very good arguments: There were a lot of other people with a lot better connections than him, but they couldn't bribe their way out, so why should he be able to? In some documents of the Venitian goverment, it says that they had to repair the ceiling of Chevaliers cell. This is a good argument for Chevalier escape through the ceiling he broke with a piece of metal.

The Chevalier needed a big loan
because it was well known
that he spent a lot of money
so that his parties could be very funny
he talked much to Voltaire
but he couldn't have wrote their
conversations in his book
from the way it looks.
