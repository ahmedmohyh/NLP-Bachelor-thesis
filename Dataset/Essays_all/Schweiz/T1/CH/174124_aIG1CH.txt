Critics have many doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. Althoug there are exisiting evidences about the accuracy. Three cirtical points were said in the presentation. 

Firstly they know, that the Chevalier spent a great amount of money in Switzerland on parties and generally his social life. He had not always enough money for his luxury so he had to borrow from firends, but this in fact does not mean that he was poor. He was just not able at the point of time to pay. But every time he paid his debts. So he was not poor.

As a second point they metion his conversation with Voltaire. In the text they describe, that it as impossible to remeber so many details and this is totally true. But there is a witness, which reported, that the Chevalier wrote down notes after the conversation and kept them for years. The witness also mentions, that he has seen how the Chevalier used his notes while writing his memoir. So it is possible, that exact phrases of the conversation are true.

An other theme was how he escaped from the prison of Venice. Many critics think that he had a politically well-connected friend who offered a bribe. This can not be true, because in the prison had been people, which had much more important friends than the Chevalier and none of them could get out with a bribe. As well there exist a report that the prison of Venice had to repair the ceiling after the Chevalier escaped. So it is very probably that he tells the truth in his memoir. 

For sure many things seem invited, but as wee see evidences exist and prove the memoirs accuracy.
