There are controversals about the accuracy of the storys of the chevalier. lots of people doubt that they are accurate, because some of them sound like an overstatement or completely made up to make his stories more inresting.

there are for example doubt thatthe chevalier was a wealthy man during his time in siwtzerland, because evidence has surfaced that he borrowed a lotof money from a swiss merchant. Some people therefore don`t believe that he was rich. Other people say that he was wealthy, but didn`t have a lot of money- so his wealth wasn`t bound to include a lot of cash. to make his possesions to money, he needed time. But because he had to pay for all those parties during his time in siwtzerland, he had to borrow the cash.

There are also doubts about the accuracy of the contents of his conversations with Voltaire.He wrote about them many years after they happend so many people don`t believe that he could acctualyy remember them so exaclty. Other people say thaht he worte each conversation down, right after they happend and referred to them.

The last thing that lots of people can`t belive is his spectacular escape form a prison in Venice. He claimed to have used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. This sounds too extraordinary for many people. But again, other people say that it must have been true, because they repaired the ceiling of this prison right after he escaped and those people don`t see why they would have had to do so if he didn`t escape like he said.
