Chevalier's memoir raises many doubts about its accuracy. It seems as if he has invented a lot of events, because they sound so unbelievable. In the text it says that his memoir is not really reliable, but during the hearing it is said that it is indeed a reliable historical source. For the first example, they said that if he was really rich he woudn't have had to borrow money form a swiss merchant. But there is a reasonable explantion for it. One does not have to be poor to borrow   money.For the second example, critics said that it is impossible to recall many years later the exact words he has apparently exchanged with Voltaire. But there could also be an explantion to that. Chevalier could have written everything down in form of a journal. It is known that he used his journals to write his memoir.
For the third example, critics said that the story with the prison escape and the hole in the ceiling is probably false. He had powerful venician friends who could have bribed the jailers to let him go out, but there is evidence that the escape really happend, because there are venician documents which state that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier got out. And there where prisoners who had far more powerfull friends then hima and they couldn't bribe themselfs out.
