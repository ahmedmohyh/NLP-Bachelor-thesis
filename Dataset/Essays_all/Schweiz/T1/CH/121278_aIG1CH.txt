The fact that we know that not all of his memoirs are correct dosen't mean that all parts of this are wrong. For exemple the fact that he borrowed money of a merchant doesn't mean that he was poor because his money was in value papers and so on and to make money out of these he needed time and in this time he borrowed some money. Also the conversation between him and Voltaire dosen't have to be faked.He could had a good mind and also the conservation was sure a big event in his life and at big event's we remind better than on other's. But it's very logical that the conversation  (if it took place) wasen't written down one to one. Also the prison break dosem't have to be wrong because the prisoncell had been repaired after the written prison break of Chevalier. Also other prisoner's had been more well connected to important people in Venice and they doesen't breaked out of prison. So theres sure a little bit of fantasy in the memoir's but i doesent think that all is invated.
