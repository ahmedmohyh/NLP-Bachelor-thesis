The Text approaches the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt with a much more skeptical attitude , than the lecture. It argues that many events have been changed and modified , in order to make them see more exciting for the reading audience. There are 3 events in partcular , which the Text questions.

First of all the text raises doubt about  de Seingalt`s wealth , since he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The lecture responds to this conclusion with the argument , that de Seingalt was famous for his extravagant parties and that he simply had to wait for the convertion of his asseds into money. So he only borrowed the mony only for inbetween these two periods.

Second ,the text argues about the accuracy of the written down conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire , because the actual documentation of the exchange has been written down years after the meetings. The lecture on the other side defends the conversations , saying that there were many witnesses who confirmed that Voltaire and Chevalier were in contact and that  de Seingalt did had many journals ,in which he wrote down the conversations , right after they occured. 

The third and last doubt of the Text is the truthfulness of Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. The Text defends it`s position with the fact that the Chevalier did had poweful friends and money , who could bribe him out of prison. The lecture responds to that by saying that there were many other prisoners who were much more powerfull and wealthier , who still couldn`t bribe there way out of prison. The lecture also claims that there were witnesses in the prison , who staited that the door of Chevaliers cell had to be replaced after he left. So why did it had to be replaced if Chevalier bribed . This argument also defends the accuracy of the memoires .
