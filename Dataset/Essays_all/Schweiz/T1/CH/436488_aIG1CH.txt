In the audio data we heard the person talking about all the exciting things the Chevalier has done in his life. 
First, the presenter claims that the Chevalier was not poor, as the text sais, but that he just didn`t have his money prepared in cash, but in material things. That means that he first had to turn these material things in to get some money back. That may have taken some time, but he still wasn`t poor at all.
The second thing that is spoken about are the phenomenal conversations he apparently had with famous writer Voltaire. While the text is critical about the Chevalier remembering every single word from these conversations, the presentation has a valuable explanation for this. They say that evidence has been found that proves that, each time the Chevalier spoke to Voltaire, he immediately wrote down every single word as soon as he came home. Moreover, scientists say that it is possible that the Chevalier controversed notes he took over the years to write his memoire.
The third thing that is argumented about is the famous outbreaking from Venice`s prison. The text says that it is not possible that the Chevalier himself has built a hole through the ceiling of his cell and escaped through that. They argument he must have had some help to escape from there,and since he had many friends in Venice, it can`t have been a problem for him. However, the presentation contradicts this opinion. They say they have found evidence in the old documents of the prison of Venice that tell us that the ceiling of the Chevalier`s cell had to be restored after he escaped. That would be a clear argument against the text.
