The first thing, the critics complained about, was the borrowing of a lot of money from a swiss merchand. But at the same time, the Chevalier claimed he was very rich. But there is an explanation. To take a loan does not always mean to be poor. The Chevalier just had to borrow some money until his own would arrive. Because there is obviously evidence of him spending a lot of money on parties and gambling. So he must have more than just a bit money.
The second point was about his conversations with the well-known writer Voltaire. Chevalier wrote their conversations down. But critics believe it is impossible to remember a conversation as well as he did and for sure not as long as he did. It has been prooved that he wrote the texts years after they had met each other. But there exists as well a proof for him keeping his notes always for several years. However it acually could be possible that he took a lot of very precise notes witch led to an accurate writing of the conversations. 
Last but not least, the criticts are sure he couldn't break out of prison, because there were other people in there with much better relations to helpful people. But as in every other case, there are documents of evidence. In these documents it is written, that right after Chevalier broke out, they had to repair the celings of his cell. If that istn't proof enough.... 
The text was about criticts while the audio pointed the controversial version out. There are always diffrent ways to look at a thing.
