Chevalier de Seingalt was sort of a controversial figure, but he wrote a memoir about his life, where he claims to have met a lot of famous people, which makes him and his memoir an important source of knowledge about the eighteenth century. In his memoir he wrote about his converations with important and famous people all over europe, for example kings or writers. Later the where some critics about the historical accuracy of the memoir, and a lot of the things described in the memoir never really happened, and he invented them to maybe make his life seem more exciting and more interesting to read about. Some of the critics on the memoir are about his claim to have lived in switzerlan and, his meeting and conversations with the famous writer Voltaire.
He wrote in his memoir that he lived in switzerland for some time and that he was very wealthy, and it is known that he spend a lot of money on parties and gambling there. The problem with that is the recently discovered evidence from a swiss merchant, where Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from him. So some people think he hadn't really been rich, because then he wouldn't have had to borrow money. Others say that his money just hasn't been sent to Switzerland at this time, and he needed some money to party or to gamble.
The other point was, that he wrote his conversation with the writer Voltaire down a few years after the conversation, and he wrote some exact sentences from the converation. Critics say it is impossible to remember exact phrases for many years. Other say he wrote notes about the conversations every evening and he use them to write his memoir.
