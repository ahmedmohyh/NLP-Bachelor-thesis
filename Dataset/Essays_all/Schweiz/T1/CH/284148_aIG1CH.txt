In the presentation, I heard about  things like he was poor, he borrowed money from other people because he didn`t got enough. Also they told about  he invented famous and glamourous people to partys.The biggest difference might be, that in the story is nothing written about  that he wrote almost evers night conversations with other people. But both, the story and the presentation have many similiar things. For example, he has written a long memoir recounting his life and adventures or he lived in Switzerland. The point is that in the story is much more critic. There are many critics about the conversation he had with the famous wrtiter Voltaire. They complain that it is impossible. And also the escape from a venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. In the presentation, the speaker tells threee point about the Chevalier. The whole presentation long, no critics. In the presentation they are more optimist than in the story about the Chevalier.
