Chevalier


In this mainpart of my essay I will explain the life of Chevalier better and also the truth.

Chevalier was not poor. It was true that he spent a grat deal of money there on parties and gambling. He borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. However, the Swiss merchant was waiting for this money. Chevalier, the controversial figure, really borrowedmoney from the merchant, athough he was a rich man. 
The argument that the conversaions between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire is not true,is not right! Chevalier wrote everything on a paper while they were speaking.  Then, after many years, he presented his memoir with this conversations. So Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed in real life. The memoir explains the truth. Chevalier`s escape from a prison in Venise is also right. But thereisno evidencethat he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. He repaired the ceiling and escaped from prison. His friends did not help him because there was other prisoners who hat more power than Chevalier himself. So you can guess that his "well-connected" friends did not really offered a bribe.
