The memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt are a very important historical source. They describe the state of European society in eighteenth century. However the memoirs have also raised critical voices. Some people criticise that the events described in his memoirs aren't accurate and therefore made up by the Chevalier in order to make the memoirs appeal more to the reader. There are three events which are most criticised for being made up.
The Chevalier claims that the was a rich man while staying in Switzerland but evidence has surfaced that he had borrowed considerable amounts of money from a swiss merchant. On the other hand some people say that he received his money only from time after time with large gaps in between and thus he had to borrow money in order to maintain his gambling habit.
It is also claimed that the conversations with Voltaire described in the memoir are too accurate despite the fact that they were held years before the memoirs were written down. However some people including friends of the Chevalier say that he had usually written down his conversations shortly after they were held and kept them until he wrote his memoirs.
Some people also claim that it is highly unlikely that in order to escape from a Venetian prison he had made a hole using a piece of metal. Those people claim that the simply bribed his jailers. For other people this seems unlikley because in the same prison at that time there were much more influential people who - assuming that the in comparison unimportant Chevalier managed to bribe himself free - could easily make their way out of prison.

Past is past. The deeds of the Chevalier are history. One doesn't know what really happened. In this short essay I tried to show the different viewpoints and how one can see things the other way round.
