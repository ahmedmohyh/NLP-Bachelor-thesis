In the presentation of the woman about Chevalier she told some different things about his history.
The first thing was about his memoirs that they are reliable and pretty accurate which is not the thing the author of the text wrote.
Afterwards she talked about the problem of his money. Aganinst the argument of the text that he wasn't in need to borrow money she brings up the idea that during the time he had to wait for his next loan he had to borrow some. That doesn't mean that he is poor it just says that he was wealthy and needed the money to keep his life standarts.
Aganist of the argument the memoirs are not reliable because nobody can write a conversation one on one down a year later she said that every time Voltaire came to his house he wrote about the conversation on the same day he even did that later on with other people. He always invested time to take notes for the memoirs. This facts make the memoires more reliable than the text mentioned it.
In the end the prison escape was the problem in the text. The text says that it can't be true that he escaped through the ceiling because he had so many people and friends there with influence that is is more likely that he escaped with their help. 
But the woman mentioned that there were other prisonors who had more influential friends but they didn't escaped. Even more important is the fact that a guy who work there in that time said that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier escaped. So why did they have to repaire the ceiling is it just a coincidence the woman thinks not.
