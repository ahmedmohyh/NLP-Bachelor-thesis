Chevalier wrote a memoir about his exciting life and adventures but a lot of critics don't belive that it's true. The first point is about if Chevalier was rich or poor. Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he spent much money in gambling and parties while he lived in Switzerland but at the same time he had to borrow money. Why should he borrowed money when he was rich? The second critics point is the meeting with Voltaire: How could it be that he known each phrase exactly which he had said? Because between the meeting and the writting it has many years, too long to remember. At least another critics point is the prison story. Chevalier told in his memoir he escaped from prison in Venice, with a piece of metal. In real critics say that he had a number of politically friends in Venice so they had offered a bribe.
