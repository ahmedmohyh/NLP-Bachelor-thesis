Chevalier de Saingalt wrote a long memoir, because he had met so many famous people, including kings and writers. But critics say that the memoir is invented, because once he lived in Switzerland he was said to be very rich and spend a lot of money on gambling and parties, but he took many loans from a Swiss merchant so he can't have been that rich. The ones who think that Chevaliers memoir are more ore less true, say that he borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant, but only because his Assets needed time to return to him as money, so that he could use it and in that time before the Assets became useable money he took a loan from a Swiss merchant, but that doesn't mean he was poor, he was just a clever inverstor.
An other point which might be invented, was his meeting with Voltaire. He had met Voltaire for sure, but the memoir was first written eight years after the meeting. The enemies of the criticisers say that he wrote down as much as he could remember of his talks with Voltaire in the evenings, so they aren't a 100% accurate but pretty accurate.
The last argument for the invention theory is, that he was said to break out of a notorious prison in Venice. But it's also said that he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. But the following day that Chevalier broke out or got released the prison had the repair the roof of Chevaliers cell and that must have had a reason.
