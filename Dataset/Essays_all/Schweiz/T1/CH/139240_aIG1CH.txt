The Chevalier was a guy who wrote a memoir about his life and his adventures. Many people believe that his stories are only invented because they are very detailed. One story is about his life in Switzerland. He wrote down that he was very wealthy and had a lot of money. Some people think this isn't true because he sometimes had to lend some money. But he only had to do so because he had to wait a few days until he got his money. Another example is his conversation with Voltaire. It's true that they met but critics think it's impossible to remember so many details after so many years. The reason why the conversations are very detailed is, he wrote down all the things he could remember in the evenings after the conversations and then kept these notes. The last example that was mentioned is his escape from the prison in Italy. Critics think that he got out of the prison because he had influental friends but other prisoners had more influental friends and couldn't escape. Furthermore, the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape.
