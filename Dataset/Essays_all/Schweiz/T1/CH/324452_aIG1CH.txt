This essay will be about wether Chevaliers memoir was mostly true or if it was made up. The text is from the critics point of wiew that says there are many things that he made up. The text I heard said that those points could easily be 'proven' wrong.

One controversial thing was the fact that Chevalier said that he was rich in his time in Switzerland. The critics say that there is proof of him spending money but there is also proof of the fact that he borrowed a big sum. Therefore he wasn't rich, he'd only lend it. They counter that with the point that his money consisted of a lot of thigs that couldn't be transformed into money very easily, and because of that he had to borrow some. But borrowing money while still having his valuable things don't make him poor.

The other point of the critics is that he wrote down his conversation with Voltaire many years after it really happened. They say that it is impossible for a man to know everything after that time. The other article says that he took notes of the conversation the day after, and that he consulted those while writing his memoires. They say there even are witnesses that confirm that he often worked with notes..

The last thing is that the critics say that he probably didn't escape the prison through the roof, instead he had powerful friends in Venice that got him out. They say Chevalier only wrote this because its enjoyable to read. On the other hand there were other prisoners in Venice during that time that had even more powerful friends and they didn't get out, so it is pretty unlikely that he got out that way. Instead they say that the ceiling in the prison had to be repared short time after his escape. That points towards the fact that he really escaped by using a metal and making a hole in the roof.
