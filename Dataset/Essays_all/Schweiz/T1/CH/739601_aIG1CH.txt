In the text the writer wrote that the Chevalier had to borrow money in Switzerland and therefore it's a lie that he was rich. In the audio the speaker said, that to get money he had to sell things like proberty etc. and it took some time for the money to arrive. That is suposibly the reason why he had to borrow money.

The second statement of the text is that he could never had captured the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire that accurately, because he wrote about these conversations many years later. The speaker on the other hand, stated that Chevalier wrote down every conversation the night after (on notes or in his journal). That's the reason why he could write down the conversation that accurately.

The last parapraph refferes to his escape from a prison, in which he claims to have escaped with a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. In the text they claim that he had acctually bribed the jailers to let him go. However the speaker said that it had more powerfull people in the prison that could have bribed the jailers with more money, but they didn't escape, therefore Chavalier could have only escaped with the piece of metal.
