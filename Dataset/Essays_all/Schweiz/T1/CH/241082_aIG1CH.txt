In the text it is said that the memoir written by the Chevalier de Saingalt recounting his life can't be accurate. It claims that Chevalier disorted or invented many  events mentionned in his memoir.  On the other hand, the woman says that she's quite sure that must of the things Chevalier described in his memoir actually hapenned. She claims that most of the in the text mentionned "evidences" can easily be explained by the facts. 
For example, Critics are sceptical about the convesations he had with Voltaire. They doubt that he, years later, when he has written the book, couls have been able to remember the conversation accurately. The woman says that Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered of their conversation the same night in his diary.
Another example is his escape from a prison in Venice. Critics believe he didn't actually made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. They think that the jailors were bried to free him. The woman has another explenation. She mentions old venetian documents dated shortly after Chevaliers escape. The document mentions that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired which is a clear evidence for the truth of this passage of his memoir. Critics point out that he had many politically well-connected friends but the woman says that other, even better connected people didn't manage to esccape from the prison.
