They talk about the life of a man, Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote a memoir about his experiences. Many thought, that not everything can be true because a lot of memoires are not correct. We can suggest that this man was someone who liked adventures. But we do not exactly know if he was poor or rich. So many people thought that he was a poor man, but others suggest that he had a lot of money and lived very wealthy. So he went to Switzerland, which is a rich country, and spent all his money. When he ran out of cash he had to borrow money from Swiss merchant. And that does not mean that he was poor. Since there he wrote down everything he could remember. One thing was about his escape from prison. There were others, but non of them made it. They could not believe that this really happened, but after the government confirmed that they had to fix the ceiling. 

So a lot of people do not know if they should believe this stories or just everything he wrote. It is quite sure that this man was alive and so there are some people who believe in what he sad. We know it is interessting to read others memorials but can we trust them? Ans how do we know that this really happened?
