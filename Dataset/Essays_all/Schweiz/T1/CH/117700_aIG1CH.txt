The memoir of the Chevalier who was living in the eightteenth century includes, that he was very wealthy when he was in Switzerland, conversations between him and the famous writer Voltaire and that he could escape from the prison in Venice by climbing through the roof. 
He himself said, that he spent much money on parties and gambling. On the other hand is it known, that he had to borrow money from other people. Some critics say, that he only put this, the money-spending, in his memoir to make a impression that he was wealthy and good-hearted. Others say, that it is quiet possible that he spent money and had to borrow afterwards, because it takes a longer time until you get the money.
The second point is about the conversations between him and Voltaire. They were written many years after they met. On the one hand, criticers are convinced, that it can't be possible to write about a conversation you had years before, others say that he could have written down everything that was spoken directly after they met and published it just years after. 
The third and last point is about the escaping of the venician prison. The Chevalier himself says in his memoir, that he could get out through a whole in the roof. Some critics say, that the jailers were probably bribed to free him and the story with the roof just sounds more adventourous, various other critics talk about, that the roof was made new what made him easier to escape.
