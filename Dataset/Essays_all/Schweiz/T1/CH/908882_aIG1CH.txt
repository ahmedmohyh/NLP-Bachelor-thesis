The lecture on Chevalier was concerned with the accuracy of his memoir, just like the text we were presented with before. However, their accounts on the believabilty of Chevalier's writing differ. The text we read was very sceptical of the historical accuracy of the memoir, for instance it asked why Chevalier would need to borrow money if he was so rich. The lecture explained that he was indeed a wealthy man, but that he borrowed money whenever he had to wait for his money to arrive. Next, the text adressed Chevalier's conversations with the famous writer Voltaire, that he also recounted in his book. The memoir was written many years after said conversations took place, and many people doubt their accuracy. Chevalier couldn't possibly remember the exact phrases used. The lecture pointed out that while Chevalier wrote the book a long time after the events had happened, he consulted his diaries and notes he had taken every evening after conversing with Voltaire. The existence of these notes is confirmed. The last event the text and the lecture mentioned was Chevalier's escape from a Venetian prison. While the text soberly said that an escape through the ceiling of the cell is highly unlikely and more fiction than reality, the lecture pointed out that shortly after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, a fact which indicates that the memoir really did tell the truth. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the lecture that numerous criminals in the same prison had more powerful friends than Chevalier, and that even they didn't manage to get out by bribing the guards. So how would it make sense for him to have done so?
The text doubts the memoir's value as a historical source, whereas the lecture encourages us to believe it is accurate.
