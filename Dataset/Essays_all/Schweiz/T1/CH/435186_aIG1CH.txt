Chevalier

So there are more or less 3 themes, who raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. The first is: Some critics don't believe, that Chevalier had so much money, because otherwise he didn't had to borrow sums of money from a Swiss merchant. But to be rich in this time, meant to first invest in something befor getting money. So I'm sure he borrowed this money to invest it later on. Another point, who critics don't believe, is the fact, that Chevalier could escape from the Venetian prison. The critics says that other people had much ore politically well-conected friends and even they couldn't manage to escape out of the prison. But however, I think he could escape, because they had to rebuild Chevolier's cell. It would make sense, beacuse in this way its also accurate, that he ould use a piece of metal. The workers who rebuild his cell probably forgot this certain piece of metal in the room.
