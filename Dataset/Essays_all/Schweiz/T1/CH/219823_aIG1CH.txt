 It is said that no memoire is correct in every detail but in the presentation they explained that the details in the memoire of Chevalier are likely to be accurate. First they stated that just because Chevalier had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant he was not necessarily poor. He just needed to wait until his money arrived after he gained it.So nobody can say for sure if he was poor or rich. Secondly the conversation with Voltaire. In the Chevaliers memoire he writes that he took notes every night after he conversed with Voltaire. He kept this notes for a long time and used them as a reference for his memoire. In that sense the argumentation of the critics does not make sense anymore. Finally they pointed out that Chevalier probably were not freed through a bribe. In the prison were other prisoners with even more politically well-connected friends and none of them came out of prison. So it is, in opposition to what the critics say, not very likely that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. And there is a source from a man who had to repair the ceiling of his jail right after the time Chevalier escaped. If there was no hole in the ceiling why would he have to repair it? So it is in fact likely that Chevalier escaped the way he described it in his memoire.
