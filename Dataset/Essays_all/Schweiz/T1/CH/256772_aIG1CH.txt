People's opinion aboutthe memoir of them Chevalier differ widely. Many readers think that it is not accurate because they think thta he had just invented some things to make it more exciting. The Chevalier wrote that he was very wealthy, but the readers claim that the Chevalier actually borrowed money. It is also known that he liked to gamble therefore it couldvery well be that he just lost alot of money with gambling. And do you really need to be poor to burrow money? The critics also state that the conversation with Voltaire he wrote about can't be true because he just wrote it down two years afterwards. Critics are also skeptical about the accuracy of his prison escape. They think that it would be more realistic if one of his politically well-connected friends offered a bribe. But there were also other people with better connections inside of the prison why didn't they get out this way? In his memoir the Chevalier wrote about escaping the prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. And there indeed are evidence that the prison had to get repaired after his escape.
