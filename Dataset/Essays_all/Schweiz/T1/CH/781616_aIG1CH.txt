The author of the text describes the memoir of a person called 'Chevalier' and states that some critics doubt the accuracy of it as a historical source. First of all there is a passage in the book that describes his live during his stay in Switzerland. He describes himself as wealthy and spends his money on gambling and making parties. However the critics state evidence that he should have borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant so he cannot be wealthy if he has to borrow. The lecturer refers to this point as tough he needed to wait for his money to arrive in Switzerland and in this time he was short on money, therefore he had to borrow some for this short period.

The critics also questioned the accuracy of the talks that he had with a famous author called Voltaire. They say it is inaccurate because the memoir was written many years after these conversations took place but also here the talking prson says that this is not true. Chevalier states that every evening after the talks, he took notes in order to remember everything and somebody was able to confirm this.

Chevalier tells in his memoir that he escaped from a prison in Venice through a hole he made in the ceiling. Critics question this and say this is only written to make make in more enjoyableto read because he had a lot of influencial friends in polically high positions and that the jailers were bribed to free him. But also here the lecturer states that this passage is true because there were other prisoners with friends in higher positions and they were not able to escape. Also shortly after his escape, a document states that the ceiling, where his escape should have taken place, had to be repaired so this also points out the accuracy of his memoir.
