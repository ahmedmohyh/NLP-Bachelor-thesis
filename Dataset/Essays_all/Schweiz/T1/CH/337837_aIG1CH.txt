Critics of Chevalier doubt that the memoir of Chevalier is correct but the lady in the listening exercise said that no memoir can be correct.
While Chevalier lived in Switzerland he was known to be very wealthy but his critics are skeptical about this because he often needed to borrow money. The lady in the listening exercise said that he really was wealthy. Chevalier and his family spent much money on games and gambling and because of this sometimes he had to wait until their money arrived. During the time when he was waiting for the arriving of their money he needed to borrow some.
The critics in the texts are doubting that Voltaire and Chavalier met and conserved. The lady from the listening exercise said that they actually met and that they had conversations in the night. The lady also said that aftr each one of this converstions Chavalier wrote everything he could remember of the conversation down. The witnesses who lived with Chavalier 
Another point is that the critics of Chavalier don`t believe that he could escape the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof. The critics believe that a one of Chevaliers politically well-connected friends had offered him a bribe. But the lady in the listening exercise said that there were other prisoners in the Venetian prison which had better contacts than Chavalier. Another intersting thing the lady told was that after the mysterious escape of Chavalier the ceiling in his cell had the be repared. So it is likely that Chavalier told the truth.
