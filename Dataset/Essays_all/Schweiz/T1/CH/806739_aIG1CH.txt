Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoire about his adventures and his life. Because he had met so many important people his memoire is a valuble source of European society in the eighteenth century. But some critics say that he invented historys to make his life more exciting. For example, he wrote that he was very wealthy during living in Switzerland but evidences show that he had to borrow money multiple times. On the other side of view we have to say that while gambling he didn't always had his money with him, so he had to borrow some of a Swiss merchant.
Critics are also skeptical about his meetings with the famous writer Voltaire. No one ever saw them together and there are no evidences that show that they met. But his friends claim that Chevalier had made notes every evening they met and while he was writing his book he used them, because he made every note right after every meeting he had with voltaire.
Another part of his memoire that critics question is his escape of a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. They say that because Chevalier had so many important friends that could have offered a bribe. But there are Reports that the prison had to repair the cell after Chevalier escaped and this is a big argument for his story where e said that he made a hole in the ceiling in the roof of the cell.
