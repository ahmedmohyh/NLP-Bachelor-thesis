The Chevalier

Toward wrote a long memorie recounting his life and adventures. Since the chevalier met a part of famous people, his memorie has become a vauable historcial source about European society in eighteeth century. His life changed a lt. Other people claimed that the Chevalier disorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life more excited.

The Chevalier went to Switzerland. He lived in Switzerland very healthy, had enough money and went to a lot of parties. Many rich people thought that the Chevalier was also rich, but he wasn't. He had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The story about the Chevalier and Voltaier I didn't understand. It's something about a important conversation, but I really don't know.

Chevalier was also in the prison in Venice, Italy. No one knows how he escaped, but some people think that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and cimbling through the roof. He didn't have really strong friends there, but he was the only one who could escape.

The presentation and the writing story was quite the same. It doesn't have a lot of differences. I couldn't hear everything because my headphones gone rude. It took me a long time to take new one and put them in. Im sorry. But I heard that the Chevalier hadn't strong friends in the prison like other guys in the prison. But he was the only one who escaped, a really mo********. I can't write down the arguments which "dagegensprechen".
