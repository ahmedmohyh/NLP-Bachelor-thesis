The arguments from the presentation try to explain and negate the doubts mentioned in the text.
The person presenting for example explains, that even if he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant he was rich, but he needed some time, maybe multiple days to "liquidise" his assets such as houses. She also claims, that he wrote, or at least tried to write down his whole conversation with the writer Voltaire the same day he had it and kept the notes with him until he wrote his memoires. This way he would have been able to, contrary to the critic's beliefs, write down a nearly exact conversation years later. A counterargument to the fake prison escape which she mentions is that people with much more powerful friends were not able to bribe the guards, which the critics thought he had done, so he sure wasn't able to too. She also mentions an old venecian document which states that the ceiling of Chevalier's prison cell had to be repaired shortly after he escaped.
