No memoir can be correct at every detail, but the Chevalier memoir was in fact a reliable source. Critics raised many doubts about it. The first one is about Chevalier saying to be wealthy while living in Switzerland but at the sime time loaning money from a Swiss merchant. Actually this fact doesn't mean he was poor. The explanation for the loan is that he selled his properties and had to wait for the money to become liquid, so in the meantime he borrowed money. Another point that was very doubted, was the accuracy of the conversations between him and Voltaire, but Chevalier actually did write down every aspect of that conversation, keeping notes about that particular event. He never wrote anything before consulting notes and journals, fact that confirms the accuracy of his memoir. Another questioned point of the memoir was the escape of Chevalier from a prison in Venice. People couldn't believe that he made such an adventurous escape trough the ceiling and claim that he just bribed the jailers. But in this prison there where many other people a lot wealthier than him, and none of those did get out of there thanks to bribery, which proves that the jailers couldn't be bribed. Another point that proves his story right, is that there are reports that after Chevalier escaped, the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired and it wouldn't make any sense to repaire it, unless he had escaped through the the roof, as he wrote in the memoir. Chevalier did write a valuable historical memoir that is in fact reliable.
