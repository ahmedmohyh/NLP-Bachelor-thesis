The story about Chevalier - lie or truth?

Many claim that chevalier made up a set of lies but in contrast there are also people who claim the opposite.

In the reading part it has been said that the Chevalier isn't that rich as he always appeared to be. It's been evidenced that he had borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. In other words, he was poor. In opposite in the listening part it's been said that he of course was a very wealthy man. He just had to sell when he didn't have enough money but just because of that it doesn't mean that he was poor.

It has been mentioned that that all the conversations he had with Voltaire weren't accurate because they were written many years afterwards so it's impossible that the phrases were originally constructed like they were said in the conversation. In contrast the listening part has showed that Chevalier every night after he had a conversation wrote down the sentences exactly like they were said. After many years he just rewrote them so it's possible that they were originally said like he has written in his memoir.

The escape from the prison of Chevalier was doubted too. He claimed that he has escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and then climing thorugh the roof, which seems inaccurate because more probably jailers were bribed to free him. Also it needs to be said that he had well-connected friends in Venice who have offered a bribe. He just needed an interesting and enjoyable story so he made up a set of lyings.The listening part disagrees, it says that the ceiling was broken so it's a plausible proof that he hadn't lied and made up the story. It's also said that there were prisoners which had much more powerful friends who could have helped them but didn't. The ceiling also has needed to be repaired.

In the end there are always people who think differently so believe what you want to believe, one side has to be true but which one no one knows.
