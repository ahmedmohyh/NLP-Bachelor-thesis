In the speech the woman claims that Chevailer was wealthy. She said that he had borrow the sums of money but after a few days he was able to pay it back. That means that he made dealing that were worth doing so he could pay the money back.

People who knew Chevailer said that he wrote down his conversations with Voltaire right after he had met him. It is also known that Chevailer wrote down his memoir years later, So when he wrote his memoir he used his notes that he had written down earlier. So it was possible to write down the conversations accurately even though the conversations had occurred years earlier.

The author of the speech claims also that his escape from prison could have occured like Chevailer wrote it down in his memoir. Because there where a lot of prisoners who had better connections but they weren't able to bribe the jailers. An other argument for his escape is that the prison had to repair the ceiling of Chevailer's cell after he had escaped.
