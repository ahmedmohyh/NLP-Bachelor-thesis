Chevalier is not poor like other people says. He has money in his clubs but he didn't take it and so he hadn't a glamorous life. In his memoir wrote he had a glamorous and exciting life but it isn't corect. Chevalier wrote his memoir like he would see his life and not than it really was. He also wrote about a conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Some peolpe think it's not the trouth because no one saw both together. But he explains that he wrote it many years after the conversation and now at this time no one knows. So it can be possible. It's also in the critic that he was in the prison in Venice.
