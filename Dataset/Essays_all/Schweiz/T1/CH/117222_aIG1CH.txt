A few minutes ago I heard a text and read an essay about Chevalier and his lifestory.

They said in the text that Voltaire was in Switzerland and that he spend a lot of monay and afterwards he had to borrow monay. It was the same situation like in the essay but in the essey they said it`s a sign that he acualy was poor, but in the text was it a way to make money after to spend money.

An other adventure in Chevaliers life was a meeting with Voltaire. In the essay was it impossible because Chevalier could remeber every detail of the conversation a few years later. But in the spoken text was it realy possible that he realy met Voltaire.

The third and last thing was in Venice. Chevalier breaked out of a prison. In the essay the story tells that he break out like a hero but they thinks it`s a fail and he spend money to get out of the jail. in the spoken text they also don`t belive him because they had to repaire a seagel. Also they said there were a lot of other guy and none of them could ever break out and thise guys were a lot better than Chevalier.
