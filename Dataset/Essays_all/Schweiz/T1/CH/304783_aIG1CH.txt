Chevalie de Seingalt wrote many of his memoirs and his andventures down. But many critics raised doubts about this histories, because the memoirs which he had were too exciting and adventures, so they can't be possible.
Chevalier wrote down, that he had to borrow money for many times but the critics said that this cannot be possible, because he had a company and Chevalier have been very rich at those times; so he would not have to borrow money. 
Further more the critcs doubt that Chevalier and Voltaire have met each other. Chevalier wrote down that he had a very exciting conversation with him, but accually he had written down the conversation just many years later. They cannot understand how it is possible, that he remember exact phrases of this conversation. They think this can not be possible too. 
Chevalier claims that he escape on a spectacualer way out of a prison in Venice. He used a piece of metal to make a hole in the roof of the prison and escaped like this. But if we are serious. With a little piece of metal, you can not rip a hole in to the ceiling. 
But the readers enjoy such dangerous and exciting histories, like Chevalier had told his histories, so they can speculate a little time about those histories.
