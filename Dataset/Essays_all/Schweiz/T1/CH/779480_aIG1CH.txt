Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir has been criticised of it's accuracy. But the lecture clearly disagrees with this statement, infact it seem to be a very reliable historical document. 
First about his wealth in Switzerland. It is seen as a fact that Chavalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. He also took up a loan every know and then. For some this idicates that he in fact wasn't wealthy but him taking up a loan doesn't mean he's poor. He just had the kind of property that first had to be sold. Hence it took a few days to convert his assets in to cash, so if he ran out of money he had to take up a loan while waiting for his own money.
The accuracy of the conversations has been criticised too. As critics argue that one cannot possibly remember something word for word a few years back. But Chevalier wrote down everything every night after conversing with Voltaire, and family memers of Chevalier do say he consulted his journals frequently while writing his memoir.
The last point questioned is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. Critics say he bribed himself out. But as there where much more powerful men in that venice prison who didn't get out is is very unlikely that Chevalier could do so. Their was even a document found, which stated that in the prison cell in which Chevalier was in, the ceiling had to be repaired. 
As all points of criticism could be discredited, Chevalier's memoir still is a valuable historical document.
