Chevalier

Chevalier de Seingalt worte a memoir about his life. This memoir was told to be a reliable historical piece for having an idea how his life was. But Critics are skeptical about the accuracy of many parts of the memoir. On the other hand, all points can be proven right in an audiotext. 

Firstly, the audiotext said that he had to wait for his money and that is why he had to ask a Swiss marchant for money. 
Secondly, he had a conversation with the famous Voltaire. It's true that the conversation was a time ago but he had wrote everything downt and cepthis notes until he wrote his memoirs. 
And thirdly, the great escape from the Venetian prision in Venice.Critics claim that Chavalier's jailers were bribet to free him because he had powerful friends in Venice who cold arranged such a think like that. But the audiotext said tha other prisioners had also friends, even more powerfull than Chevaliers, but they could not manage to escape.

In conclusion you can say that the text showes some good points but the audiotext can prove that they are more or less wrong.
