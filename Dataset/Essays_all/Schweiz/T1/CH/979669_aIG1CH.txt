Chevalier

In the text critics think that not everyting was true, what he did because he seems to make his life more exciting and glamorous than it really was.
His story is divided in three chapters: the first is about the merchant, the second is about the conversation with voltaire and the third about the prison in venice and how the he escaped. In the listening everything seems nicer in his life than the text describes it.
