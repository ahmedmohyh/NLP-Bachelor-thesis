There is no memoir in which every detail is correct.If you had to borrow money you don't have to be poor. While Chevalier lived in Switzerland he went to many partys and gamblings. If you win you don't get the money imediately. So if Chevalier played with a lot of money, he would't have any money anymore and had to borrow money for a few days.
Chevalier recorded the conversation between him and Voltaire by writing everything down he could remember in the evening. These notes were used to write the conversation many years later. So not every phrase is correct but the main points of the conversation are right. And if mentioned earlier, not every detail is correct in a memoir.
The third point of the memoir, the escape from a Venetian prison, is also critisiced. Other prisoners had more powerful friends than he had and they couldn't helped their friends. Also the ceiling in Chevaliers prison had to be rebuild. So if he didn't escaped like this, why had the ceiling to be rebuild? 
The text looks at both side but destroys everything with the critics. The audio answer of the text itself.
