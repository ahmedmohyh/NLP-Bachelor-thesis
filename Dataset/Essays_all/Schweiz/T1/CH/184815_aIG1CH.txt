Chevaliers memoires are pretty accurate because they most likely rely on real sources.

Many doubt his wealth and richness because it is speculated he borrowed some money from an Swiss merchant. This does not deny the fact that he was unwealthy. It is stated that Chevalier did spend a lot of  money in gambling and partying in Switzerland and he may have been broke afterwards because of spending too much. So he borrowas money from someone, the merchant.

It is claimed that he had several conversations with Voltaire and has written a memoire about it years after the occurence. Chevalier took notes from the conversation and could remember the exact words to put it in 

In the lecture it was stated that there were many other prisoners who had even better political connections than our writer. So it is less possible he could have been freed because the jailers were bribed. The governement later said Chevaliers ceiling had to be repaired and the person in the lecture pointed out, that the writer may have escape himself through a hole in there.
