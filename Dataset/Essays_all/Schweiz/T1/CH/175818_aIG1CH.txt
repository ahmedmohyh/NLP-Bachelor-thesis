In the presentation they said that not everything is true what he wrote down in his long memoir about his life and adventures but probably much of it. 
E.g. he couldn't remember every single sentence that he said in the conversation but he never said that he could. He just wrote this down what he could remember at this time.
He made big parties where he had to have much money for. He wasn't rich how some people said but he also wasn't poor he borrowed money from people to make big parties.
About the escape from the prison they knew that other people were also catched which had more and better connections to high political people and couldn't get bribed so why should they let him go before them? And why had they to repair his ceiling? So they think it's true that he could escape, probably not exactly in this way he told it but he escaped and wasn't bribed.
In the end they meant which memoir is completely true and correct.
