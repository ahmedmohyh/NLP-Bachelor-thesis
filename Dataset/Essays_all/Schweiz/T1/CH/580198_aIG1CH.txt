     The arguments given in the presentation are arguments against the critiques that are written in the text. 
The first one counters the claim, that the chevalier wasn't very rich if he had to borrow money. In the presentation it is sad, that he had to wait for his money to arrive which was normal for his time. But he still wanted to gample and go to parties in this time and that's why he borrowed the money.
 
     The second one explains how the Chevalier was able to write down the conversations with Voltaire. The women who gave the presentation claims that he wrote down everything he could remember of the conversations right after them. She also says that other people living while the Chevalier lived did say that he used his notes to write the memoir.

     The third argument is about the escape of Venice. It claims that a lot more popular people than the Chevalier didn't manage to convince the guards to free them, so he wasn't probably able to do it too. Also there is a report that right after his escape, the celing of his apartement had to be repaired.
