The question is, how accurate are the texts written by Chevalier?

The text says that the text about the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire is not that accurate, because it was written many years later, after the conversation has happened. So Chevalier wrote them, only by using his memory and this questionables the accuracy of the text. While the woman of the presentation said that they are really accurate and relyable, because Chevalier wrote down the conversation the evening, after it has happened. So what we can see,is that the text and the presentation have different opinions about the accuracy of Chevalier's texts. Another point is the question about the wealth of Chevalier in Switzerland. So the remarkable thing is that if Chevaliers was that wealthy, why would he have borrowed money then? The text says that the entire wealth is questionable. During the presentation, the woman said that he has borrowed the money because he had to wait for his own money because it was on its way.

As we can see, there are two different opinions, but now there is the question, who is right? Answering that question is almost impossible by using only these two sources. If you would want to compare them, you would need more sources and some experts about Chevalier.
