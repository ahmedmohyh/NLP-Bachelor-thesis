In the presentation perfomed by the teacher, it comes out that she has the opinion that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is a more or less correct document. It is just as correct as a such old document can be. In her opinion it is not possible to write down something without change anything. The first argument against the correctness of the document was, that Chevalier had to borrow some money from other people when he was visiting Switzerland. But it was said that he was very rich, so that was impossible for someone who doesn't know how richness was defined in that epoche. He acctually was rich, in a sense of having lot of things with high value, but when he was spending money in Switzerland he had to change first his things against money. And before he had done that, he had  to borrow some money from others.
The second arguement was that he has wrote down a conversation long after that took place and in this case it was impossible for him to remember as accurate as he wrote it down the conversation. But it was said that he took notes during the conversation with the writer Voltaire. So that he had the chance to consult these notes years later to write down the conversation.
The last arguement was that he broke out of of the prison without any help from outside, but the writer of the text thougt that, because of he had so many important friends in Venice, it was very possible that one of them freed. The teacher had the opinon, that was not very possible. If it was possible, why did the other important people witch were in the same prison not excatly the same thing? In if it was that easy, why had they to repair the prison after him was feeing himself?
It can be said that the teacher in the presentation thinks that this memoir can be seen as an important historical document, while the writer of the text owns the opinion that the memoir is more an history to tell someone rather then a historical useful document.
