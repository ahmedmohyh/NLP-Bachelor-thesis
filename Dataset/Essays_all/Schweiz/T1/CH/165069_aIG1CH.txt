There are man parallels between the text and the presentation of "the Chevalier".The critics who think, the Chevalier distortet or even invented some of his stories are mostly right. They tell that no memoir can be correct in its detail. As it's written in the text that the Chevalier spent a lot of money for gambling in switzerland. This is also said by the speaker. But why should he have borrowed money for this? He had the money.
The story about his escape of the prison in venice is a little bit strange too. There were many other people in the prison that had much better "friends" who could have helped them to escape. So how should the Chevalier have escaped of a prison, where nobody else could escape? The text and the speaker tell the same: That can't be true... It's nearly impossible for a man like Chevalier. As we can see there are mostly parallels between the text and the presentation.
