The Chevalier's memoir is supposed to be a very reliable source of his time. Firstly, i want to talk about his time in switzerland. Having to loan money from someone does not automatically mean that you're poor. The chevalier used big amounts of money whilst gambling, and if that money ran out, he had to wait for his money to arrive, so he had to loan money from others whilst waiting. However, the text's critics raises doubts about this fact. They question him having a lot of money. Instead, they think that he had to borrow money because he didn't have any in the first place.
Secondly, the conversations with Voltaire were that accurately represented in the memoir, because the Chevalier wrote down everything that he remembered of it, right after talking to voltaire. The Chevalier was known to keep notes over long periods of time. The texts relies on the fact that nobody is capable of remembering exact phrases from conversations, especially if they were held several years before.
Finally, the prison escape. There were lots of bigger, more powerful people in the same prison as he was, and they were not able to bribe the prison workers. He must have escaped through the roof, because it is said that one had to repair the exact roof after he escaped. The text claims that he bribed the prison workers, and that there was no spectacular prison escape through the roof at all.
