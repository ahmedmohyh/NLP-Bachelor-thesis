The Chevalier got a lot of money as loan but this money needs time to arrive so that he could use it. In the days the Chevalier has to wait for his money or take the money from a Swiss merchant. This does not mean he was poor. The Chevalier was famous to spent his money on parties and gambling so why shout he wait for his money if he can borrow money. Borrow money from a Swiss merchant gives the Chevalier a chance to go to all parties and gambling when he wanted. 
The Chevalier met a lot of famous people and as he met Voltaire he wrote the conversation down after it. It is also true that the memoir cannot save all informations so this means maybe the conversaition that Chevalier wrote down is not the same as the original. Alltough the journals of Chevalier got found and this is a hint that Chevalier met Voltaire. 
There are more then one thing that says the escape of Chevalier in Venice is true. First there were more prisoners in this jail with more friends and more powerfull friends. So if a friend was helping then the other prisoner got a greater chance to got out of their than Chevalier. Another argument is that the cell of Chevalier has to be repair after Chevalier could get out. If there was something offred to let Chevalier get out why has the cell be repair?
