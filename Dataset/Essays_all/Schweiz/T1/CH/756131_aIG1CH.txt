Firstly the woman explained, that it my be true that Chevalier had to borrow money, as the text says, but that doesn't mean he was poor. She explained that, after spending all the money he had, he may had to wait for his money to arrive again. In the time inbetween he probably borrowed some money from a merchant. However that doesn't make him a poor man. 
Secondly, she talked about the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire. It is said that Chevalier took each night after talking to Voltaire notes. He wrote down everything he could remember about their conversation. Keeping this notes for many years, he was able to write those conversations in his memoir by using his diarys. That would explain the details he could enclude.
The last point she talked about was his escape from prison. While the text claims the escape was written much more for enjoyable reading, then to show what really happend, the woman says that it really may be the truth. She says that other prisoners knew more well-connected people than Chevalier did, but they weren't able to escape. Also. the ceiling had to be repaired after he escaped, that wouldn't have been the case if he didn't escape the way he claims he did.
