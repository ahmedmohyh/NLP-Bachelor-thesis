Although critics say that Chevalier's memoirs are not accurate, they are still a reliable source for the readers. He claimed to be very wealthy while being in Switzerland, but there's evidence that he borrowed money for gambling and parties. The lecturer says this doesn't have to mean that he wasn't healthy. He needed a large amount of money, and he could have borrowed it while he was selling things, because it took a few days until it was converted into actual money. In the meantime, he could have borrowed money for what he needed it for, and pay back as soon as his actual money arrived. The whole procedure would've lasted only a couple of days.
He claimes also to have had long conversations with Voltaire. The memoirs were written many years later, but Chevalier was able to remember exact phrases, which critics point out to be impossible to be accurate. But friends and family who saw him writing his memoirs say that he had notes and journals for help. It is possible that he took notes every night after conversing with Voltaire, which he could use later to write the memoirs. 
He also escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. He writes to have made a hole in the ceiling of his cell with a piece of metal. This sounds spectacular, and it is more likely that he just bribed the guards, for he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have helped him out. But there's an old Venician document which says that soon after Chevalier's escape the ceiling of his cell had to be repared. Also, there were other prisoners with mightier friends and connections who didn't escape, so why should bribing have worked only for Chevalier?
