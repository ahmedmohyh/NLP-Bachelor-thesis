Chevalier had written a historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. In the presentation they mentioned that he wasn't poor. Chevalier had made a lot of money in Switzerland but first he had to earn money. That's the reason why he had to borrow money to start his success. In the text it's written that he was a poor man because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The writer is more cri Chevalier kept his conversations a lot of years in his mind. The critics say that there must be faults in his book. Because nobaody is able to keep conversations with every detail for such a long time in his mind. Another fact from the presentation is that he escaped from the prison in Venice. Nobody knows why he was able to escape. Chevalier had no powerful friends in the prison. How did he made it out of the prison by himself when other muscular prisoners weren't able?  In the text is an extra information. He had some political friends that probably bribed the jailers to let him escape. The speaker was more on the side from Chevalier. The text is against Chevalier. The writer tries to reflect how he wrote the memoir.
