Chevalier was a writer and lived between 1725 and 1798. He was famous for his written memoir. But some people say, that no memoire can be correct but there are arguments against this. For example once he was in Switzerland. And there he was very wealthy and so he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. But critics say that he borrowed a big sum from a Swiss merchant, so if he really was rich he wouldn't had to borrow money from others. An argument against this critic explains that he was rich, but he always had to wait on his money. It took some time to arrive, but he still want his parties and so he had to ask someone to help him out. But that doesn't mean that he wasn't rich. An next critic on his memoire is the conversation with the writer Voltaire. The conversation was written down some years later than the conversation actually was, so this isn't possible to be right, is it? Yes it is, say people, because he wrote every night the conversation with Voltaire during the day down, so he could easily write a whole memoire about it some years later. The last maybe false memoire is about the escape from a prison, he climb out of the prison, but that sounds more exciting than it could be. Maybe the politically well-connected friend helped him. An argument against this thought is, that other prisionniers had more political powerfully friends, but they still couldn't helped them. So he had to help him by hisself.
