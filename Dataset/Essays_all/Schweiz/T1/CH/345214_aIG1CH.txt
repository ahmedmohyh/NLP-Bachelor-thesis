To summarise the text you can say that Chevalier was a controversial person who had as many followers as people who had critisised him. There are three points which aren't known to be true or false. The first critic is, that Chevalier had to borrow money in Switzerland although he had a huge amount of money. People ask themselfes how this could be possible. Why did he have to borrow money? Well he became the money, which he gained by doing assets, later than he wanted, so he had to borrow it first, for doing parties and gambling. The second contoversial point is the conversation between him and Voltaire. The memoir about this meeting was written many years later. How can you know everything about this conversation many years later? Well the answer is simple. Chevalier wrote down anything when he was talking to someone. He did that regulary. So if you write down anything someone says like at a presentation or a meeting you will also know it many years later. So this point really can't be falsified. The last point which was questioned about Chevaliers life is his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. He said that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a whole in the ceiling. But people say that he bribed jaylers to free him. His followers are saying that the ceiling had to be repared after his escape and so the whole story couldn't be made up. To conclude you can say that his life was full of action and although there are different storys about his adventures, he deffinetly enjoyed his life and people are still talking about him.
