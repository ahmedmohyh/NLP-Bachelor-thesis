In the first part, they said, that Chevalier couldn't had been very wealty because he needed to borrrow money, but even rich people had to borrow money from time to time, because they couldn't have all their money with them. In the second paragraphe they write, that Chevalier couldn't have been so accurate about the conversation with Voltaire, because he wrote the memoir later. But the memoirs can be accurate, if Chevalier wrote the conversations in a journal, so he could have used these notes and write an accurate conversation between him an Voltaire even years after they had met. In the final part they said, that Chevalier couldn't have escaped the Venetian prison and that it was more likely that he offered some well-connected friends a bribe. In the audio they said, that a bribe was hardly likely, because there where even better connected people in the prison and they couldn't escape by offering someone a bribe. They even say that the ceiling had  to be repared after Chevalier was escaped, so they think that it's way more likely that he actualy escaped from prison on his own.
