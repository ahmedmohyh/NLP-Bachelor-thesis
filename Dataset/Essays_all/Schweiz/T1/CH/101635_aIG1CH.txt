There are some critics about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) and his memoir which recounts his life and adventures. In the text they write down the critics and that he probabley invented some stuff in his memoir. But the woman tells some facts about his adventures, like the roof of the prison that needed to be repaired after he escaped from the prison in Venice, that convince to his memoir.
Further the text is giving us a hint that Chevalier maybe wasn't rich at all even thought that he spent a lot of money for parties and gambling cause there are some cllues that he needed to borrow money. To that critic the woman thaught of some other reasons why he could have borrowed money. There is also the possibilitey that he needed to wait for the cash, which means that he always had the money but because he needed to wait until he received the money in cash he rather borrowed it from a Swiss merchant.
In the text they also think that he invented some stuff about his conversation with Voltaire. But the woman has some reasons to belive that Chevalier wrote the conversation in the same evening down as he had it.
