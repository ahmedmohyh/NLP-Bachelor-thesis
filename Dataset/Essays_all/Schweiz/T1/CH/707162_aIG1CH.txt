On one hand we have a text who critics many adventures of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) and on the other hand a speech wich wants to proof the contra. In the following text I will explain you the differents in each little story.
The first roumer who was common said thah he was a very rich man when he lived in Switzerland and that he spent a lot of money there on parties. So this is a really glamorous and exciting life! But people aren't shore if he said the truth and so they began to critic. They questioned this fact that he was sooo rich and they argued in this way: Chevalier was a poor man, he just borrowed his money from a Swiss merchant. But the woman in the speech told us some other points. She gave us the information that it is necessairy to own a lot of mone. FIRST you have to sell  - THEN you can get money.
An other point of the critics is the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. They do not belive that this meeting happened. Buet there is a proof! The wholw conversation was written down. 
and last but not least the adventure with the prison. chevalier was inprisonen an broke out by him self. and this is right, said the women in the speech, because the other persons in the prison had had more powerfull friends than him and the (loch) hadnt been repaird.
