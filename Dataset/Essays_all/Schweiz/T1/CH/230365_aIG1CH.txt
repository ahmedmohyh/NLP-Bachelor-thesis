The text is very critical about the memoirs of the Chevalier. It says that most of his historys didn't really happen like that. They say: "the Chevalier distorted or invented many  events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous." But the lecturer interpretes his memoirs in a totally different way. It said: "No memoir can accurately be correct, but the one from the Chevalier seems to be pretty accurate." Of course the Chevalier just writes down the things he remember and it seems to be obvious to the lucturer that the Chevalier was forced to borrow money, although he had a huge sum of money. Her explanation was that he had the money just not in a liquid form and that he was borrowing it, while waiting on his money to arrive. In the text they claim him to be a liar for saying that he was rich. Why would he than borrow money...?
Another point where the writer and the speaker don't share their opinion, is the part, in which the Chevalier claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. While the writer says that this is bullshit, the lecturer has a strong beliefe that this is true. Why not? It's known that the ceiling needed to be repeared after the event, so it seems obvious that the Chevalier wrote the truth.
