In the audio it was said that it is true that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But it was also said it wasn't because he was poor or not very rich. It was because his wealth was mainly based on properties and other things that are valueable, but first have to be sold, to get the money. With this in mind it's logic that he had to borrow some money, till he had sold his stuff and got the money. The text mentions the same things as the audio, but it also mentions what the critics say. The converations with Voltaire are pretty precise means the audio, he wrote them down every evening after the conversations. He also appears to have used his notes very often while writing his memoir. The text just said that it is impossible to remember exact phrases that he used for multiple years. As the text was written many years later. The audio says that if others with politically more important friends could not get out of the prisons in Venice, why should he had been able to. Aditionally to that the ceiling had to be repared shortly after the Chevalier's escape. The text mentions only that it's interesting to read such an escape, but thinks it's still unrealistic and that a friend of him had bribed the jailers.
