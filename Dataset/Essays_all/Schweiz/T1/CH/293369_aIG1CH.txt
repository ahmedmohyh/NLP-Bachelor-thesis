The text says that there are three very suspicious moments in the memoirs of the Chavelier. One of them is his wealth while beeing in Switzerland. In his memoirs you can see that he spent a bunch of money cambling and partying like crazy. The problem is that it is proven that he borrowed big amounts of money from a Swiss merchant. The women in the listening puts trust in the Chavelier and deffends him with saying that earning money is sometimes a long process and that he didn't have enough money over the process of earning money and so he borrowed some for that Swiss merchant. The second very suspicious moment in his memoir is that he wrote down the whole conversation that he had with Voltaire who is a very famour writer at the time. Critic's  believe that it is not possible for someone to write down a conversation as accurate as the Chevalier did. It is known that he wrote the down that conversation with Voltaire many years later after the dialog between them occured. The women in the listening is on the Chaveliers side again. She says that he wrote down some notes right after the conversation occured and that he wrote that part in his memoirs a couple years late with those notes. The last suspicious moment is the Chaveliers escape from the prison in Italy.In his memoirs it says that he made a whole in the cealing of his prisoncell and so he was able escape. The critics believe that the Chavelier's jailers were bribed to free him. The women in the listening takes the Chaveliers side again and brings out the fact that the cealing of the Chavelier's cell had to be repared so the possibility of that part of the memoir beeing true is there. 
The summory is that the Chavelier must have had a very interesting life but that there are moments that he captured in his memoir that are questionable. The Women in the listening is cleary on the Chevalier's side but she can't deny that some moments in his memoir are hard to believe.
