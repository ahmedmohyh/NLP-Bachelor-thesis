While in the text Chevalier used a piece of metal to escape through de ceiling it isn't mentioned like in the speech that he had powerful friends that helped him out. In fact it doesen't even has a part where any friends are mentioned in the text. While he climbed through the roof in both stories, the controversial that he didn't escape from prison in the speech was that the ceiling was just repaired after he escaped while the controversial in the text is that it would make a more enjoyable reading.
