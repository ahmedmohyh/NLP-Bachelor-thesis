First being discuessed is the point, that Chevalier borrowed  a considerable amount of money, even he is claiming to be a very wealthy man and to have spent great deals of money in Switzerland. The argument of the professor to the audience simply is, that Chevalier in fact was a very wealthy man, but that he wasn't owning the kind of money, which could be liquidated fast. So in order to throw his parties and to gamble, he probably often needed money very quickly and borrowing money doesn't mean you are poor.

Is Chevalier a historical reliable source? Critics point out, that Chevalier wasn't able to remember all of his conversations with Voltaire exactly, because his memoirs were written many years after the conversations occured. It differs in the way,  that the professor in the presentation points out, that witnesses acutally confirm those conversations occurred and that Chevalier was always writing them down after.

The third controversial, that Chevalier claims to have escaped from the Venetian prison and  that it isn't the case, that actually powerful friends in Venice helped him to get released from prison. The professor argues, that there were other inmates locked in, who in fact had even more powerful friends and they didn't get released. Also a government document, confirms, that after Chevaliers escape, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired.
