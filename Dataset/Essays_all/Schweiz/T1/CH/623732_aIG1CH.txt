The Chevalier

This text is about the Chevalier de Seingalt and about the discussion if his memoir is accurate or not. He surely met many famous people and so his memoir became a valuable historical source. But there are also some doubts about certain passages in his memoir. For example about the fact that he was known to be very rich. One may say that this is not true because while he spent some time in Switzerland he borrowd money from a swiss merchant, but why would he do that if he was as rich as everyone said. But one could disagree with the argument, that he simply had to wait for his money to arrive in Switzerland what would definitely make the whole thing appear in a diffrent light.
But there are also some doubts about his meeting with Voltaire, critics say that it's very inaccurate that he could remember the whole discussion ten years after the meeting. Other voices say that immediantly after the meeting he wrote down all he could remember, what would explain the detailed memoir of the discussion. 
The Chevalier also spent some time in a prison in Venice. On one hand, critics say that the story about his freeing is unlikely true because he had many connections to people with power in politics who possibly helped him to escape. So the adventerous story of digging a hole in the ceiling would not be true. But on the other hand other prisoners had even better connections but could not free themselves. 
So what is true now and what is invented? Of course, only the Chevalier knows.
