Both, the text and the recording cover the same topic. Chevalier de Deingalt and the memoirs he wrote about his life. Both agree that his memoirs are a valuable historical source, but the text is much more critical. Let's have a look at the three main parts, discused in both sources. Number one: Chevalier states in his memoires that he was very wealthy during his time in Switzerland. And both sources agree that he spent a lot of money partying and gambling, but there are doubts about how rich he really was. According to proven evidence, chevalier had to borrow money from other people. However, the text uses this evidence to really criticise the wealth he is talking about in his memoir. The recording I listened to had a simple explenation. Because he spent so much money, he had to 'order' more all the time. While he was waiting for his money to arrive, he had to borrow money from others. Number two: The chevalier remembers his meetings with Voltaire. None of the sources doubt that he met with Voltaire, as also this is proven. But the text claims that his memory about their conversations is too accurate, he would never be able to remember all of it, it has to be invented. The recordin'ss explenation to this critical topic is also simple: he had notes from the time he met with Voltaire. And number three: In his memoir, chevalier writes about his escape out of a Venetian prison. He says he managed to make a whole in to the ceiling to escape. The criticers out of the text think, he could have never done this alone and point on his friends in venice. They claim he had help. However, the recording I listened to states that other prisoners had much more influencial friends in the region, and they didn't escape. And as it is proven that there was a whole in the ceiling over where chevalier was (and so this fact out of his memoir is correct), they believe what he writes in his memoir.
