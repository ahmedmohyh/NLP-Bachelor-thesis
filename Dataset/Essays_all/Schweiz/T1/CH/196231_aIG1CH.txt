First the story in Switzerland. Chevalier de Seingalt wrote in his memoire, that he was very rich at the time in Switzerland. The criticers say, that he had to borrow money from a merchant and that i'ts a lie. But when you are wealthy and spend a amount of money in a short time, you have to wait till the money comes again after a period of time. And so you have to borrow money from annother person, also when you are rich.

Chevalier de Seingalt said, that he met in his life a famous writer named Voltaire. Many people don't belive him, because he wrote the conversaition down many years later. But he wrote it very exactly and so you need much time to write.

At the end, the story in Venice. Chevalier wrote, that he broke out prison whith a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. So the cricticers say that it is not possible, because no one broke out of the prison and that includs also stronger mens. But the question is, why had they to repair the ceiling when the criticers say, that he broke whith a complice. That doesn't make sense at all.
