The memoir of the chevalier is a historical soure. They are not bluff and we can trust the stories, the chevalier told. The chevalier was not poor. But when he came to swiss, he needs to made money first. But need to make it first, befor he got this money, he borros money from a friend and sold something of his own things. 
In the text, they say, that it is  not inpossible, that he met voltaire, but the accuracy, what he wrote about, what they said, is doubted. The women in the presentation said that we can trust the records, because after every conversation, he had with voltaire, he wrote his notes on the same day or evening. So he had not to rememer everthing when he sumed up the conversation he only had to take his notes.
Last but not least, there is the story with prison in Venice. Chevalier told us in his memoires, that he escaped from  prison, by using a piece of metal. The women said that the escape is true. After he was gone, they must repeared his prison cell, because ist was destroyed. Why would there be a hole, when they would free him. There were other prisoners which had more friends, but they did not escaped. So I think Chevalier is true and not a liar.
