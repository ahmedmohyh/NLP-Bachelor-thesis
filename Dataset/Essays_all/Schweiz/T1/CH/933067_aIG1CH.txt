In the presentation the speaker argues that the memoir of Chevalier is a reliable source about European society in the eighteenth century. Whereas the text doubts the accuracy of this work through actions, which stood in contradiction of his memoir, the speaker seems to explain those actions whitout questioning his accuracy. Firstly, the speaker doesn't believe that borrowing money implies that he is poor instead she argues that he simply ran out of cash. Secondly, in her opinion the Chevalier wrote every evening all the conversations with Voltaire down. Therefore, unlike as mentioned in the text, the conversations must be accurate as she states. Thirdly, a report of the Venice jail showed up, which proofed that the prison had to repair the ceiling of Chevalier's prison room. Overall, the speaker appears to defend the accuracy of Chavilier's memoir, which was critised in the text.
