Chevalier de Seingalt was a famous person during the eighteenth century. He wrote a memoire that is nowadays often described as "not accurate". But many Critics can actually prove that Chevalier's memoire lies on facts and truth.
 For example the questioning about his escape in prison: Chevalier wrote that he could escape with a piece of metal. People often doubt that, but as a matter of fact they actually had to repair his cell after his escape and there were many other prisoners who were more powerful than him. So the chance of him offering a bribe to get out of jail must be very small. Also some people don't believe that he was rich, because he had to borrow money. But today's Critic say that he only had to lend money from people whilst he was waiting for the other money to arrive. Another argument against doubts of him writing down the discussion of him and the famous writer Volontaire would be, that he always made notes after such important discussions. 
So pretty much every point of what some Critics may have to say to falsifize the memoire of Chevalier, can be verified as wrong with stapable arguments from other Critics nowadays.
