Chevalier and his memoir

His memoir is a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteen century. The problem is that there are doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. He made his life look like an adventure but some people think that it wasn't like that. There are many things which can confuse. For Exemple, he wouldn't have been able to escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. In the text they say he just had connections, but the audio thing tells us that there were many prisoners who had better connections and after his escape they had to fix a thing in the prison.Other critics complain about the conversation with Voltaire him self, because he couldn't have been able to remember a conversation over such a long time. No one thinks about notes he may had written. In the presentation they also tell us that it's possible to be rich and need to borrow money.He just wasn't rich enough. As conclusion they don't think everything in his memoir is true, but there are also not that many lies.
