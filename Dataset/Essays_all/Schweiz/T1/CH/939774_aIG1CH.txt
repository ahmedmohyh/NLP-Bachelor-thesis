Chevalier de Seingalt was a controversial figure who wrote down his life and adventures in a long memoire. But the memoir has raised some doubts about the accuracy of the memoir because they think that he invented many events which didn't happen or happened differently.
The First critic is about the whealty life in Switzerland where he spent much money on parties and gambling. They surfaced that he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. So they think he could not have been rich when he had to borrow so much money. But he had to sell first to get money and when he ran out of cash he had to wait till he get his money. And in this time he had to borrow money to live in Switzerland.
The second critic is skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations that he records in the memoir. Chevalier had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire, and mostly everyone belives that they had a conversation but they don't belive what they talked about because he cannot possibly caputre these conversations when it was written many years later. Thats why they say that the conversation didn't happen exactly like this. But it could have been exactly like this because Chevalier wrote everything he coud remember on notes. An he took these notes after he had this conversation so hit is possible that it happened like this.
The third critic is about the scape from the notorious prison in Venice where he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The critics think that his jailers were bribed to free him because he had a number of politically well-conneted friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. BUt this is not possible because there were also more powerful prisoner ther with more powerfull connection which couldn't escape from the Prison.
