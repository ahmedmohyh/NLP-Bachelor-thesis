There's seemingly a big debate about whether "Chevalier" and his memoires are reliable sources which are accurate. In this text im gonna compare the contradictions of the text with the presentation that I listenend to.
Chevalier surely had big adventures to many places, like Switzerland. There are many people who say that while staying there, he was very wealthy and didn't spare a copper about anything. But, as evidence shows, he actually borrowed a lot of money from a swiss merchant and was not so rich after all. Though it is true that he borrowed money doesnt mean he was poor. From the gambling he had won some assets or estates which he intended to sell for money, thus he had to wait a good amount of time before his money could arrive and that's why he needed to borrow some money.
When he met with Voltaire he talked alot with him and later he even recorded everything they talked about. But after several years does he truely know about what they exactly talked? It is mentioned that every night he wrote down what they had spoken of. And later a lot of his friends confirmed that indeed the night he writes down his memorys of the day.
While he was in prison, rumour has it that he actually broken down through the ceiling, but it was way more likely that he bribed himself out of there. Actually, at the time being there were a lot of more famous and wealthier prisoners there, so the fact that only he got out does not really fit into the story. And, in fact, the most critical piece of evidence is that after the glorious escape of his, the ceiling had to be repaired, which would only confirm his escape.
