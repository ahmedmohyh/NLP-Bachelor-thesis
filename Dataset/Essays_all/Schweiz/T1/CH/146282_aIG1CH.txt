In the text it's said that the memoir of Chevalier isn't that reliable and accurate. They had three examples to proof it:
First of all, the author of the text mentioned that he had to lend much money from a Swiss merchand and therefore he wasn't the rich as he claimed. However, the audio speaker says that he wasn't poor because he spent so much money on parties and gambling that he didn't have money anymore in the first days because he didn't have all his money with him.
The second point is that he couldn't have written down his conversation with voltaire accurately. His memior was written a few years later so the author says he coudn't capture it well enough. But in the audio it is mentioned that Chevalier often took notes and also wrote some words down after the conversations. When he wrote his memoir he referred to his notes and could write it down correctly.
The last point is his prison escape: The text author explains that it is very unlikely that he escaped through a hole in the cealing made by Chevalier using a metal bar and that there were more powerful prisoners. He says it's more likely that some friends freed him with a bribe. The audio says that they had to repair the ceiling afterwards and why would they have to do this if he hadn'd damaged the ceiling?
