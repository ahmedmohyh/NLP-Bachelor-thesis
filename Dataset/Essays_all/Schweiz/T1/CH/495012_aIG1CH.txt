The woman who was talking about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt said that this is a pretty accurate memoire. She sais that there are reliable sources which show, that the adventures which Chevalier de Seingalt wrote down really happened. 
She says that when Chevalier was in Switzerland, he had to borrow money form other people because he just sold some things and was wating for a huge amount of money to arrive. But in the text it says that wealthy people in Switzerland didn't have the need of borrowing money.
In The text it also says that Chevalier ones wrote about a conversation that he had many years ago in Italy. The Chevalier wrote down exact phrases and critics say it's imposible to remember a conversation from many years ago so accurately. But the woman says that he sometimes took notes from his conversations. So it was posible that he wrote down things very exactly, she says.
And lastely: In the text critics say it was very unlikely, that the Chevalier escaped from a prison in Italy through a hole in the ceiling. In the audio in contrary, the woman says that this is extremly likely possible because old italien documents say, that the ceiling of exactly his room had to be repaired after he had left the notorious prison.
