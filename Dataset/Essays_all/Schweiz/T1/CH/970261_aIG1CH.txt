The chevalier escaped from the prison through the ceiling. gouverment had to chang the ceiling after he escaped, they had to because Chevalier went through the ceiling. In switzerland he borrowed money from wealthy people. Chavalier liked to lie, so his storys would be much more interesting to talk about or to read. Chavalier liked to spend his money on partys and gambling. Thats true, because they said it in the vortrag and it is also in the text written. I don't know if all is true but he probably had a really good life. A lot of critcs say that he wasn't even that wealthy, ecause if he really was, he wouldn't need to borrow money from his friend. That fact is acutally true. Which wealthy person borrows money from friends? A poor person.
