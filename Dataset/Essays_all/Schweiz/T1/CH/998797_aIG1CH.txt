The speech says as well that not everything can be right what the Chevalier told. It says that it`s right that the chevalier had been rich once, but in Switzerland he also runned out of cash. But he was not really poor, because he could borrow some money from friends. In this point the text and the speech say the same, except the text says that the chevalier never had been rich. It`s emphasised that he wrote something like a diary about his conversations with famous people and he has some witnesses, who confirmed it. The text is more critical about the conversations. It seems that the writers don`t really believe that he had talked to so many famous people. His breakout of the prison is not realistic, because there were prisioners, who were much stronger than the chevalier. These prisioners hadn`t been able to break out, so why should he been able to get out of prison. in the text it is claimed that he didn`t break out by himself. He had some jailers, who helped him to free out.
