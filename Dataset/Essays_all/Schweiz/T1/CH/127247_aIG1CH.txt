The woman that hold the lecture says, that Chevalier's memoir is an important historical source. She admits that it includes some mistakes but after her opinion that's normal for memoirs: `"No memoir can be correct in every detail."

Overall, the big statements in the memoir are correct. Nowadays we know that Chevalier spent a huge amount of money in Switzerland. He wrote down that he was very wealthy these days. The article says that Chevalier was lying about this fact because it's proven that he regularly borrowed money. The woman says that this critic is true but doesn't put down the fact that Chevalier used to be rich. He borrowed money in Switzerland because it took time to convert his salary to cash.

Another critic point in Chevalier's memoir are the conversations with Voltaire. Chevalier claims that he quoted every conversation exactly. The Critics say that that is not possible because he wrote the memoir many years after the conversation.The woman admits that this is true but also has sources that say, that Chevalier captured every evening the things he talked about with Voltaire.

Another argument is about Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice. He claims to have escaped by using apiece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roofs. Critics claim that he had popular contacts in Venice that payed a bribe. The lecturer says that this wouldn't make any senese because other prisoners had more powerful friends and didn^t get out. It is also proven that the roof in Chevalier's needed a repaired after he got out.
