She said that the memoire of the Chevalier was pretty accurate. To prove this accuracy there are three different points:
First of all was the lone from the merchant. This doesn't say that the Chevalier was poor, moreover he lived in wealth.
The second point was about the conversations with Voltaier. It's said that the Chevalier wrote everything down about these conversations as soon as they were over so he was able to put them in his memoir. And last but not least the big escape from the venice prison.She said that there were other jailers which had way more and better friends to escape the prison but he really did escape through the ceiling because the prison had to repair the ceiling after he had escaped.
So these facts about the Chevalier don't match all the facts from the text. For example the first point with the merchant: in the tex they clearly say that the Chevalier got a fair amount of money from the merchant but it really doesn't say that he had been poor, right? Than in the second point, with the conversations with Voltaire they mention in the text that the accuracy can't be that great because noone has such a good mind to remind all those conversations allthough they don't say that the Chevalier wrote everything down after each conversation. And finally in the last point with the great prison escape the guy who wrote the text simply doesn't believe in the Chevalier and said that he had more than enough help from the outside allthough there were other jailers who had way more helpers which hadn't escaped.
