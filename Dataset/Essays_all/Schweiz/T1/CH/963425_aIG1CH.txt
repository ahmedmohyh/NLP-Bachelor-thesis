The woman  tells us about a man how is well known for his memoir, which is a reliable historical source. Each night the man wrote down the conversations he had with famous people. He kept his notes for many years until he finished the memoir. Some people think that he was sometimes lying about his stoires so that his life seem more interesting and better than many others. It is sais that he spent a huge amout of money going on parties while being in Switzerland.But where is this money from? People think he was poor and  borrowed it from somewhere but he says he would habe been very rich in Switzerland. Critics have also questioned the stories of his escape from the prison he was in. He claims to have escaped by breaking out of it, but it is more likely that he just dealed with a jailer to get him free. I heard that his prison room needed to be repaired, so the critical argument from the text, telling that he got help from a jailer, doesn't fit with this one.
