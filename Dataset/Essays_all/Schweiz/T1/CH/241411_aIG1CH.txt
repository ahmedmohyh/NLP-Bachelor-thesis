The Cheavliers memoirs have been controversally discussed for a long time. Finally someone stepped up and tried to clear all the insecurities and different opinions about this historically relevant book. People claim that his wealth, which he had while living in Switzerland, was only borrowed by friends and he was not wealthy after all, but as he travelled and got to know some of the most powerful people of his time, he got gifted many expensive things, that in his time in Switzerland, he started selling. But selling such things, gifted by kings, takes some time. So when he needed money he had to wait some time until he could finally feel it in his pockets, so he borrowed it from friends, and payed them back as soon as he got his money. Furthermore people doubt about his conversations with Voltaire, since the book was written many years after they had met, and he couldnt have remembered everything that good. But friends of the Chevalier claim that he wrote everything down in the evening after their conversations. After every converstaion he tried to remember as many things as he could and wrote them down. The most controversial story of his life might be the prison escape from venice. In his book he says he made a hole in the ceiling with some piece of metal and succesfully escaped. Criticists say that he had some powerful friends who simply just bribed the guards to let him go, but other stories say that there were some people with even more powerful friends than him, and not even them, got to bribe themself out. In addition to that an old record of the venice prison says that some days after his escape there had to be made some reparations in the cell he stayed in. The reparations were made at the ceiling.
