In the presenation they have said that no memoir could be correct. But the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is very accurate. For example the story about the loan: That he had to borrow money doesn't mean that he wasn't rich. He has made many parties which were expensive. But he had to wait for his money. So to pay all the things which he needed he had borrowed some money. 

The discussion with Voltaire is also true because he have written down the results of the discussion each night. He kept this notes all the time and so he could know all details.

The outburst of the prison is aswell true because they were many other people in the jail who had higher-ranked friends than Chevalier. And this friends didn't help them. And there is also a document of the prison in Venice that after Chevalier's outburst they had to repair the ceiling of his room. He wrote in his memoir that he escaped because he have made a hole into the ceiling.

In the text they say that Chevalier wrote things into the memoir which are not true to make his life more exciting. For example he said that he was rich but he had to borrow money in Switzerland. But he only had to borrow money because his money did not arrive so fast. In the text they say that they stories with voltaire are not true because it's impossible to remember all the details. But he has took notes from the conversation so he was able to write it exactly down. The outburst of the prison is also true because they have found documents that the ceiling of his room had to be repaired.
