After some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of Checalier's memoir they could find explanations against all those critics.

1. Evidence has surfaced, that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. He was partying and gambling a lot while he was there, but first he needed money to sell his assets, so he borrowed the money first, but that doesn't mean he was a poor man. 

2. Critics are skeptical about conversations he had with the famous writer Voltaire many years earlier that he wrote his memoir, but that's easy expalined. After every conversation he wrote down everything he could remember about the conversation. He just took his notes as a reminder and then many years later he wrote about them in his memoir. Even wittnesses confirmed about this strategy. 

3. There are also critics about his escape from a prison in venice. Critics think he had well-connected friends who could have offered a bribe. But there are two evidences, that proof the opposite. In that prison were a lot more "famous" people at that time, who were way better well-connected. Why didn't they get out of prison? Another reason is, that soon after his disappearing the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired.
