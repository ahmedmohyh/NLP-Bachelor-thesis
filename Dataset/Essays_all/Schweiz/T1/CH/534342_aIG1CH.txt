Chevalier

The first wrong part of the written above is the claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events.
We heard in the presentation from the old woman that Chevalier did not distorted and he also was truly not telling wrong things. His memoir are mostly true.

The second thing is that in the written stood he borrowed money therefore he was not so rich like he said In realtiy he was valuable and he just borrowed money for short episodes.Borrowing money does not say if someone is poor or not.

The last thing is therefore the part of the text in which stood that the Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friend in Venice who could have offered a bribe. This is not true because he broke out of the prison and has no friends who helped him. There are also old documents who say that the cell has need repairment after the Chevalier was in so he broke out.
