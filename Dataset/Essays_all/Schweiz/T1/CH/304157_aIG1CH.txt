The chevalier de Seingalt wrote an memoir. And in his memoir the chevalier was living in Switzerland, there he spent most of his money on his paties and gamlings. Most of the critics says that he already was very rich and he did not work and he weould not to need money. 
Critics says also that he had a very skeptical conservation with the famous writer. so that no one doubts that Chevalier met Voltaire. And they think that  this memoir cannot be possible, because the memoir was written many years after the meeting. So they think it is impossile to remember what Volaire sad exactly, when it could be true tthen must Chevalier made notice many years ago. In addition the critics think that the memoir of Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice. Because such a daring escaoe makes  a enjoyable reading, it more that Chevalier's jailers were be brided to free him. Finally the Cheavlier had friends in Venice who had connections to the politician, who could offer him a bribe. But i think also that the story is impossible and he wrote it , because he would the  attention of the people and he would be famous, have a lot of money.
