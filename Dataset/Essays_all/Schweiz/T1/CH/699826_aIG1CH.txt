Chevalier de Seingalt, a realiable historic source or just a cheater?

There are three important parts in the text which are controversial to the audiopresentation.

1. In the text it is said that the Chevalier was poor because he loaned money from people when he was in switzerland. But in the audiopresentation the lady said that loaning money doesn't necessarily mean you are poor as you may have money but in form of houses or land instead of having cash.

2.In the text it is also said that you can't remember extended conversations for years and write them down afterwards. The Chevalier didn't even have to remember these conversations for years as he had written them down every night after he had conversations with any important people. He then used these notices to write his memoirs at the end of his life. It is even confirmed that he used the notices during the process of writing his memoirs

3.The prison escape through the ceiling might seem weird and as mentioned in the text it is more realistic that he had bribed the prison guards. The only problem with this theory is that there were people in this prison who had contact with even higher political personalities but they didn't get out of the prison by bribing. And to finish off there are documentaries in the Venetian prison, that the ceiling in the cell in which the Chevalier was kept arrested, had to be repaired after his escape.
