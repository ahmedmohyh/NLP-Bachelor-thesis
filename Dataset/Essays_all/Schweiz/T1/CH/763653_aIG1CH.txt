In the listening it says that he wasn't poor, so he had always money for parties and gambling. if he didn't had no money anymore he knew where to go to borrow some more money. He borrowed pretty much money. In the reading it says that he wasn't poor at all. when he was in Switzerland he was wealthy. the people don't know if he had really borrowed money because critics are sure that he was wealthy enough. In the wiriting critics are also sceptical about the conversation he had. chevalier said that he remembers exact prhases of he conversation with volataire but critics think that that would be impossible to remember every single phrase. In the reading they said that chevalier wrote down everything he knows about the conversation. In the prison he didnt have as much  friends as the other prisoners had but in the reading he also has many politically well-connected friends. he escaped from the prisnon in venice, italy. with a piece of metal he made a wole into the ceiling and climbed through the roof, but in the listening they only know, that the ceiling had to be repared.Everything in the text is recommended by some critics. They aren't sure about so many things but it is all written down.
