In the audio the presenter admits that no memoir can be correct in any detail, but that Chevaliers memoir must have been pretty accurate and is therefore a reliable historic source. The presenter explains this statement in three point. First he talks about the time Chevalier was living in Switzerland. It is said that Chevalier spent a great deal on parties and gambling. The text says that Chevalier borrowed big sums of money but that if he would have really been as rich as it was said he needn't have borrowed money. While the text makes it seem like Chevalier wasn't as rich as everyone thought in the audio it was said that he only borrowed cash while waiting for his money to arrive. Secondly there was the example about the conversation Chevalier wrote down. The presenter in the audio is sure that only because of notes and journals he was writing back when the conversation happened he could write it down as precisely as he did in his memoir. The text on the other side doesn't consider any notes he could have referred to. It says that it is impossible to remember a conversation that clearly after so many years. Last there was Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice. As in the other examples the text accuses Chevalier of having written it that way only to make it more enjoyable for readers. But the presenter of the audio states that other prisoners also had powerful friends but couldn't be freed and that  there is the information of the government that the ceiling had to be repared after Chevaliers outbreak.
The audio and the text both talk about the same examples. The text says that Chevalier only wanted to make his life seem more important and spectacular than it actually was, while the presenter in the audio is sure that Chevaliers stories are true and the presenters outlines them all with possible explanations. Both sources agree that Chevaliers memoir is a valuable historic source, even though it's truthfullness is doubted by some.
