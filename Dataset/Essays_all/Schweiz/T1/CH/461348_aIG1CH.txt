The Chevalier has wrote s long memoir, about his experiences in his life, but many critics disagree with the memoir and the life of the Chevalier. In the following, I'll sumare this article and explain, why many critics disagree with it and which points can be true or not.

The first experience of the Chavalier was about being rich. In the memoir it's told about that he was very active in going to parties or gambling. And there for you need a lot of money, because parties and gambling isn't cheap and it's possible that the Chevalier lost sometimes a bit of his money, and then he had to borrow something from his friends. But this doesn't mean that he was poor.

A other argument is that the Chavalier hasn't ever had a conservation with Voltaire. For sure, it's not possible to remeber everything from a conversation many years ago, but I think, when somebody was really impressed by a conversation, than he may remeber a couple of sentences forever.

The last point is, that the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice. Many critcs say that, he had a lot of friends, who could have helped him. But in fact, the othere prisoners had a lot freinds too and they were more dangerous than they from the Chevalier. An other question is, why was the prison from the Chevalier destroyed? If is friends had helped him to have offered a bribe, than the prison was never ever demolished. 

Personally, I think that many things can be true or not. Nobody can absolutly show how his life was and which experiences he made. We only have the memoir and so we only have a history.
