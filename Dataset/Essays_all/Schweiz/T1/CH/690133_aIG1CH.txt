The short presentation explained a few things about the life of Chevalier.

It`s said, that Chevalier was not actually poor, but it took him always a few days to make some of his property into cash.
But that means not, that he was poor. So thats the opposite that was written in the text, where it`s said, that he always borowed money because he wasn`t rich, but in the presentation we`ve heard, that it was just because it took him some time to get cash. So of course he had to borrow it in the first place.

Also it was said in the presentation that his escape from prison in Venice had consequences. They had to repair his ceilling after his escape. So why did the have to repair his cell, when he bribed someone to get out of prison. Another point is, that in this prison in Venice there were a lots of other people with way more influence on the outside than him, who didn`t escape through a bribe. So it`s unlikley that he escaped that way, the presentation said. 
So the text is more critical against Chevalier and his adventures, and the short presentation kind of argues against the text, with some critical questions.
