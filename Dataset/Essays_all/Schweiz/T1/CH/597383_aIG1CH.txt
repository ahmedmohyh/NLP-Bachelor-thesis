Chevalier has written a long memoir recouting which many critics aren't shure about the truth of it. As we know from Chevalier, he lived in Switzerland for a part of his life. He wrote that his lifestyle was very wealthy there and he went to a lot of parties and gambling. Recently an evidence has surfaced that Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Was he rich or not? We know about this time that you had to sell first to get money. But as we have that evidence we know that Chevalier wasn't as rich.
Chevalier also wrote down the converstions between him and Voltaire. We know that they met and conversate but could he realy had remebered all this details at the end of his life? No usual man could that. But they've found other notesfrom Chevalier which shows that he wrote down all things he remembered at the same evening after the conversations. So he just took out this notes again when he wrote about these conversations in his memoir recounting.
Chevalier told us that he escaped a Venetian prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through th roof. But he had some powerful friends in Venetia. Did he realy freed his-self or did his friends look for that he become free? There were other prisoniers who had friends too but they were more powerful and any of them freed somebody who was in the prison. That the ceiling of his room had to be repaird after his escape tells us that he realy freed his-self.
