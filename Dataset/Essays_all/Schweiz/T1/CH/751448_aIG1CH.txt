In the hearing presentation they talked about, that the story of the Chevalier were historical sources. But in the text they discribed that he wrote down a long memoir recounting his life. In the text they explain, that the Chevalier records the conversation with Voltaire in his memoire. The presentation tells something different. They tell that after the conversation between Voltaire and the Chevalier, Chevalier noted everything and gave the writting to Voltaire. He kept the papers and after many years he wrote it down in a book. The third example they presented in the text was, that the Chevalier escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal. But the people didn`t believe and said the Chevalier`s jailers helped him to escape. In the speech they  told something totaly diffrent. Yes, also that he escaped, but it didn`t say anything about the jailer. They told about the fact that the was a hole or something was broken in the room where Chevalier was injailed. The they tell about that they had to repare his seeling after his escape.
Looking the first example in the text they talk about that it`s not logic that someone could be rich and borrowing money at the same time. In the speech they just tell that he was in Switzerland for parties and gambling and that he was wealthy. Also that he had to borrow some cash, But the didn`t touch the point that it was impossible or not really realistic that someone who played and was wealthy, had to borrow cash from someone.
