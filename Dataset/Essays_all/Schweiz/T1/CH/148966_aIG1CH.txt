In the text it's written that while Chevalier was living in Switzerland he was very wealthy and he got his money through gambling, but there is evidence that he just borrowed the money from a Swiss merchant. In the Speech the woman said that this can't be really true because when you gamble than it needs some time until you get rich. 
Then the second part, Voltaire. They had conntact every day and he recorded all his converstations with him, but this cannot be that accurate because he wrote the memoir several years later and that's not possible, that he can remember everything. On the other side, the woman said that Chevalier wrote every convestation on each evening after the converstation for many years. But many people doubte, that he recorded them every night. 
And finally the last part, his escape out of a prison in Venice. He claimed that he escaped with using only a piece of metal, but many people don't belive that and they argue that he had famous friends in Venice who helped him to escape. But that's also not true, because there were many other prisoners who had even more famous friends and after his escape they had to repair his seiling in the prison
So finally we can't really say what's actually ture and what's wrong.
