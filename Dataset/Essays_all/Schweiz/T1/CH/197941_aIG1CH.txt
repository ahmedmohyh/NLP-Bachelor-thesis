In the written paragraph about Chevalier de Seigalt it sais that many of Chevalier`s achievements are most likely exaggerated or even made up. It is written, for exampe, that it is much more likely that he escaped the prison in Venice by a bribe from his influencial friends than that he escaped by making a hole into his ceiling. The oral presentation is much more trying to convince of Chevalier`s honesty in his memoir. It sais that there are documents which imply that soon after Chevalier`s escape, the ceiling of his cell was repared. The critical written paragraph, as well as the oral presentation mention that Chevalier was gambling and partying a lot. But while the oral presentation sais that he must have had great wealth to finance this kind of lifestyle, the writer of the written paragraph claims that Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. Another point about which those two sources talk differently, are his conversations with the legendary writer Voltaire. The written paragraph sais that it can`t be very exact, because those chats happened long time before he wrote his memoir. The oral presentation though claims that Chevalier made notes every evening, after chatting with Voltaire.
