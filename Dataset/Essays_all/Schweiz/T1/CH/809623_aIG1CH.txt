Some peope say that Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs aren't correct and that he distorted or invented many events in the memoir which aren't true. But memoirs are never correct in every point and we also can't prove all things that he had mentioned in his memoirs. 
Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant as he was living in Switzerland. Some critics are saying that he wasn't rich because he had to borrow money from another man an if he was rich he hadn't to. But loan doesn't mean that you're poor. When he was going to live in Switzerland, he had to have a lot of money to settle down. And when he went to parties then he needed a lot of money. With borrowing money, he could do what ever he wanted to do and didn't have to wait for get his own money.
Some people say that he didn't flee from the prison. But some other prisoner had more strong friends than he had. And after he was imprisoned there, they had to repair his ceiling which proofes that he escaped.
