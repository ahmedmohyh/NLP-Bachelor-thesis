In the text, the accuracy of Chevalier's memoir really isn't taken as guaranted, whereas in the speech, they have almost no doubt that his memoir is correct and claim it as the almost only reliable source they have. 
If we take the example of his time in Switzerland, where he seemed to have borrowed money and the text takes it as not having had the wealth he actually wrote about, the speaker explains it as such: While partying and gambling all the time, he also kind of needed to convert his money and in the inbetween time he needed to relie upon the money of others.
When it comes to the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire, the text ciritsizes, that Cheval won't be able to quote the conversations accurately that they held many years earlier, before writing the memoir. The speaker on the other hand said, that he relied upon the notes he always took right after the chats. His relatives and friends also confirmed, that he had been using notes and diarys during the process of writing his memoir. 
His escape from the notorious prison in Venice, that the text takes as a result of his well-connected friends, that had offered a bribe, must be wrong, if you believe the speaker. She says, that they found documents assuring the ceiling needed to be repaired just after his escape and that there wouldn't be another explanation than that his story with the piece of metal and the hole in the ceiling is correct. Besided that, other prisoners are said to have had even better connections but couldn't be freed by being offered a bribe.
