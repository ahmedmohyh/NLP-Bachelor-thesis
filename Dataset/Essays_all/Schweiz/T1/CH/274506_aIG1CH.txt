People say that the Chevaliers memory was questionable and not very accurate. But in fact there are some details that may not be so wrong after all. Living in Switzerland, the Chevalier had the opportunity to gain money by buying and selling things, for example houses. In order to buy an expensive house he needed a big amount of money. That might explain the considerable sums of money theCchevalier had rented from the bank. Another story the chevalier had been takling about was his relationship to the famos writer voltaire. Even years later he could remember the exact phrases voltaire had said. Critics believe that it is not possible to remember a conversation that detailed as the chevalier remembered it. But as research was made, the chevaliers friends could explain that he had taken notes after each session with voltaire and had consulted those every now and then to refresh his merory on the conversations.
Even the Story of the prison break could be true. He was accused of escaping from a prison in Venice with only one piece of metal. After that the prisons ceiling was severely damaged. So even legends can turn out to be true.
