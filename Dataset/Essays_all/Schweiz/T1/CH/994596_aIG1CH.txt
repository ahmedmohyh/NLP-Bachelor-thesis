The Chevalier de Seigalt who lived from 1725-1798 wrote about his adventures and about few things which happened in his life. In the audio the lady said that the Chevalier was poor. But how could have a poor man so much money in the wallet and spend it for parties in Switzerland.  It does not make sense. But the is an evident that he borrowed money fron a Swiss merchant.
He also wrote that he met a famous writer who called Voltaire. No one doubted them that they had a conversation. But his memoir did not capture the conversation. Critics also said that it is difficult to remeber the sentences from the conversation. Plus it was written many years ago. So the critics could not say it it is true that he met him or not.
In the text it was also written that Chevalier escaped from the prison. Then he had a lot of well-connected friends in Venice. So he used a piece of metal to make a whole in the seiling and escaped by clmbing the roof. But there were also other people in the prison who knew well-connected people and they had more friends. So why did they not have the oppertunity to escape? In the text was written these well.connected friends in Venice could have offered a bribe. Why did not the friends of other prisoners help?
