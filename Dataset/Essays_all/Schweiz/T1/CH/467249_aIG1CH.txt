A memoire of a person is not always compared with the truth. No one knows really what it really was, only the person themself. The voiting and the text have a lots of contreverses. The text is more overspaced and not all sees are included, but the text tells more about facts and means of critics. For example said the text that Chevalier de Seingalt wasn`t so rich as he seems like. But the voiting told us things that he could not be poor. In Switzerland he spents a lot of money at parties or something else, and the part with borrowing some money was also very unclear.
The voiting is more deeper I think. The voiting wants to look more at the backround, and creat his own thoughts. The example with Voltaire in the text told us that Chevalier never ever met him but in the voiting were also some points against. They said that Chevalier has written all on a sheet of paper after this evening. 
The biggest diffrent is the Venice escape. Critics in the text said that Chevalier has not really escaped, only a friend of him in Venice paied for him that he could go out. But why had his room to repaired after the escape?

So I think every person should create his own meaning. Because in bouth varias are some holes and oppen questions.
