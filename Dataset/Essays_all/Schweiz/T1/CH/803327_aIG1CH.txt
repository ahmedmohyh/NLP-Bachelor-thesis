Some memoires may are invited but over all the most are correct. It`s not said, that Chevalier was very rich when he was in Switzerland. He sometimes borrowed some money from other people to orgonise partys. He wasn`t riche but also not poor. He was may only a well-earner, thats all. In the presentation it`s said that Chevalier memoirs of the conversation with Voltaire weren`t written years later. He wrote them down every day after a conversation. The statement in the text that the memoirs were written down years later isn`t true. They may isn`t everything correct bur over all they most are true.
The presentator says that Chevalier had less politically friends then many other prisoners. But only he managed to escape wrom the prison. After he had escaped the prison repeared de celling from his cell so it`s more possible that he escaped in this way and not with political friends.
