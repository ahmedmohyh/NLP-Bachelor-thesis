Chevalier de Seingalt born in the year 1725 and died in 1798. The Chevalier wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures. 
The Chevalier lived in Switzerland, was a contorversial figure and was a wealthy man who was known for organizing parties and gamblings on which he spent a lot of money. Spending a lot of money he also had to borrow some fronm a swiss merchant. The Critic say if he had to borrow that much money for gambling or parties then why was he discribed as a rich man. In the Memoir there are long passages of conversations in which the Chevalier and Voltaire are discussing. The Chevalier wrote down, each evening, the conversation he had and used them in the memoire as refrences. The converations were confirmed by friends also long after he died. The dicussing point is, how can the Chevalier himself and his friends confirm a conversation that took place long ago and it is not even proven that all his friends were at that time inculded nor at the same time at the same place, hearing the conversations. So how is that possible? 
In the memoir the Chevalier also claims that he escaped from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. As the memoir goes he escaped from prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The Chevalier was a well-known man and well-connected to friends who worked in the politics or were present, but the critics claims that the Chevalier could escape but not his friends who, what is proven, had even been better known or connected to the outer world.
