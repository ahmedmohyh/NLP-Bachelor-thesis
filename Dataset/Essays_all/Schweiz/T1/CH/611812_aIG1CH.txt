There are three different points in the long memoir recounting the life and adventures of Chevalier de Seingalt which maybe were invented. 
Many people doubt that Chevalier de Seingalt was wealthy because he had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. But that isn't true. As the woman said, Chevalier had to borrow some money because sometimes he had to wait for his loan to arrive. That's why he didn't have money for a short time, so he borrowed it. When his loan arrived, he paied everything back. 
The second thing was that he couldn't possibly remember everything he talked about with Voltaire. In fact he made some notes while their conversation and kept them many years afterwards. That's the reason why he could capture these conversations accuratley. 
The last point was his escape from a prison in Venice. The critics didn't believe that he broke out by himself. They thought that it was impossible to break out by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling of his caige to escape by climbing the roof. They believed that his jailers were bribed to free him. But other prisoners had more politically well-connected friends and no one came to help them. So it's more likely that he did it by himself. 
The facts which the woman from the presentation had pointed out are more logical then the ones the critics had said. It was possible for him to write a valuable historical memoir.
