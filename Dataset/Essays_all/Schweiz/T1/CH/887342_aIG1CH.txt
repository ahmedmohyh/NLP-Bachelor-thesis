In the prestentation the woman explain how it can be possible that the memoir is telling the truth. She's on the side of the chevalier and just says how it is possible that all this thing happened. For being rich when he has in Switzerland, she explain that he was rich but that it wasn't real money. He owned some privat proprety which had a lot of value. When he arrived in Switzerland he sold some of them to get real money, so that he could glamb and get on parties. Second, the text tell us that people can believe that he met Voltaire, but what they don't understand is how he could have remembered all the things they discuss about a few years after. The woman explain to us that every night after their discussion, when he came back home, he wrote down every single words he could remember. With those ones he could have wroten the memoir afew years after because he had the most of their talk on the paper. Finally, She tell us a last thing about the Venetian prison. She say that it's true that th Chevalier had a number of politically friend in Venice and that could have helped him to escape but ahe add that some people have heard that the Chevalier's room had to be repaired just a few times after he escaped. That seems logical that it was because he did a hole to escape. In this presentation she's just telling us the truth and to make us believing in her she add some proofs.
