Chevalier de Seingalt, a man who lived in the eigteenth century, had written a memoir and there are different opinions wether the memoir is accurate or not. The text, however, says that what he had written is not accurate while the presentations says the opposite. The text believes that Chevalier had made the story more exciting and glamourous than it acctually was. Firstly, the text tells us that Chevalier was poor, because he had to borrow money from his merchant. Anyway, the presentator says that he was not poor. Secondly, there is the story with Voltaire: In the presentation it says that it is possible to write exact conversations down even a few years later, but the text tells us that critics say this is not possible. In the presentation the presentator tells us as well that the story of the outburst is pretty accurate whlie critics question the possibility of escaping with a piece of metal.
