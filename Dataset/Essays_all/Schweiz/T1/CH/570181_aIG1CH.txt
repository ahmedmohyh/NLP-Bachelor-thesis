People doubt Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. It is too adventourous and exciting, they say.There are a lot of different opinions about it. But what we do know are three facts: at first there is a rumour about his loan. Some critics say, that it isn't true, that he was very wealthy during his time in Switzerland because he borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant. That seems legit. But we also know, that his loan didn't arrive immediately. That means he always had to wait, so it isn't very surprising he sometimes had to borrow money he spent on parties. It doesn't automaticly mean he was poor. 

The second fact is, that he had a conversation with Voltaire. In his memoir it is pretty well described what they said. A lot of people think, that this can not be true, because Chevalier wrote this many years after the conversaition occurred. There are arguments against this. Citizens say, he wrote down everything he could rembember some days or weeks later and not a lot of years, so it is possible that he may say the truth. 

Last but no least, they doubt about him breaking out of prison. Critics believe he got out of prison because they let him. So why would they repair the ceiling right after he left? Isn't it possible, that he told us the truth in his memoirs?
