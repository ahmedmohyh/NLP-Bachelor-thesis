The text I read tells me, that some critics have raised doubts abozt the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier Seingalt, for example Chevalier claimed in his memoir that while living in Switzerland , he was very wealthyn and that he spent a lot of money for parties etc. but we also know, that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Why does he need to borrow money, although he was rich? Well this question answers the audio I heard. In the audio they said, that the chavalier needed to borrow this money, because as he spent his money in big amounts, he needed to wait for it to arrive again, so he wasn't poor just needed to wait for his money. Another thing that the text skeptical about is that in Chevaliers memoir he wrote down conversations he had with the famos writer Voltaire. There are no doubts that those two actually met but the memoir can't possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations took place. So how could Chevalier write down those conversations with all these details? Also this question answers the audio. They said, that Chevalier always, (after every conversation he had with Voltaire) wrote down, in his sort of diary, what he conversed with Voltaire in every detail. Another thing that the text questions is his escape from prison. They think that Chevalier did'nt escape from prison, more they think that his powerful friends outside the prison arranged something for him to get him out of prison. Did he really escaped from prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling? The audio claims yes. Because after he got out of prison the ceiling in his room needed to be repaired, why should his ceiling be repaired if he hadn't made a hole in it? On top of that they say, that other people in prison had way powerful friends that Chevalier had and they all didn't got out of prison.
