Chevalier de Seingalt was born in the year 1725. He was always named a reliable source for historical events, because its said, that he wrote down all conversations, that he had at parties in the evening. Its also said, that he met a lot of famous people. However a lot of people doubt, that he has such a good memory. People say, that the stories he tells, are just made up completely. 
In one story he says, that he lived in Switzerland and was very wealthy. But sources confirm, that he had to borrow money all the time. This was confirmed to be true but its clear, that he just had to lend money, because he didn't recieve his money fast enough for the belongings he sold. 
A other story says, that he broke out of the Venice prison und Italy with just a small piece of metal through the ceiling. Again critcs say, that he just made up the story so it is more enoyable for reading. Sources confirm this because it has been found that the cell he was in had to get the ceiling repaired.

In the end nobody really knows if the stories are correct. Most people still use the stories as a reiable source of historical events.
