In the text is written that tht Chevalier was poor because he had to borrow money to be wealthy and oragnize parties. But the woman said that he isn't poor because the money had a time to get to the Chevalier and for this time he borrowed money. 
The woman also said that the Chevalier took notes after the conversation with Voltaire and so he could wirte the conversation down some years later. In the text is nothing said about any notes and so the text says that it's impossible to remember exact phrase of the conversation.
Another point in the text it the escape in Venice. The text says that he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice and criticals think that the gave him a bribe. But the woman said that other prisoners had politically better-connected friends and even they couldn't offer a bribe. Also that the ceiling of his cell got repair and the ceiling wouldn't repaired if it wasn't destroyed.

All in all I think teh text is way more critical than the woman. Also said the woman things which weren't mention in teh text. And beaucause of these information both versions make sense.
