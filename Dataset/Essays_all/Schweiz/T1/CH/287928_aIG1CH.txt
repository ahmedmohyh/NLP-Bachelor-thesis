In the presentation the life of "the chevalier" is presented as a story that happened in reality like it was written down in the text it says the historical accuracy is not good enough confirmed. For example, in the text it says "the chevalier" is a poor person because he borrowed money from a swiss merchant. In the presentation it says that it was normal that even rich people borrowed money because it was highly needed if someone at that time has giving many partys and traveled around the world. Even today rich people still borrow money because it takes often to long to earn it and they need it right away. The second issue is conversation with voltair. The writer of the text is much more sceptic than the woman that made the presentation. In the text it says there are no evidences that this conversation realy took place on the other hand in the presentation it is explained that "the chevalier" took many notes about what he experienced and that friends of him told taht he often used his notes while we wrote his text and that that would make much more sense than just write such a memir out of the mind. The third and last issue was the escape of a prison in venice. In the text the writer explains that he most likely used his money or had the help powerful friends tocome out the whole story about his escape through the roof just seems to bizarr and fantastic. In the presentation it says it is possible that he escaped through the roof because in dokuments of this time it is written down that not to long after "the chevalier" left the prison the roof had to be repaired and that this fact whould sugest that he really escaped through the roof.
