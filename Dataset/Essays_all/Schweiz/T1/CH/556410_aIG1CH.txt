The text give us informations about a Chevalier, who lived a life which nobdoy knows if it's real or if he just invented  these excinting and glamorors stories. Then the text we have to listen told us what really happened in the situation, which were describe in the first text.

So in the text is written that the Chevalier de Seinglat was poor beacause he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss mechant and he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling in Switzerland. But the woman we heard in the oral text explain that he wasn't poor he just had to borrow money because when he spent the money at gambling he had to wait to get this money back so he needed some money for this time. The woman also said that it wasn't a very big deal to escape from the prison. The text will say that he just coud escape beause he had a lot of conections but it isn't all correct.
