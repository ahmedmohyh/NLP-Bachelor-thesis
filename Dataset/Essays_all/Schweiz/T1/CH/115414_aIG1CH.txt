The first point is about his life in switzerland. So the critics said that it's not possible to be rich and borrowing money at the same time. But that isn't a argument to say he's poor. When he was in switzerland he had to wait for his money because before he staid in an other country. For me it's to easy to say he is poor only with the fact that he borrowed some money. As mentioned before his money wasn't in switzerland while he spent a part of his life in Zurich.

In the text it's mentioned that it's impossible that the Chevalier could remember all phrases about his conversation with Voltaire. The critics are skeptical about his memoirs and what it's written about the conversation about him and Voltaire. But that's not a fact that he lies about this conversation with voltaire only because he wrote it down many years later. I think if you have the chance to speak with such a famous, intersting peple you won't loose this time spending with him. It was also said that he only remembered such things about it and I think that he also invented a little bit. But who would say, who has written a book/memoire that he hadn't invented a bit to make it more interesting for the readers.(nobody)  So I think it's to easy to say that he hasn't a conversation with him.

The last point is about his escpape out of the Venetian prison. Critics in the text are questioned about the fact that he could escape only with a peace of metal. But there are some indicators. Namely, after the "escape" the ceiling in his cage had to be repaired. Why should they have to repaire the ceiling if he hasn't escaped. Maybe he couldn't escape of the prison but he tried to and that's for me enough.

To sum up I really trust more the informations of the presentation than of the text.
