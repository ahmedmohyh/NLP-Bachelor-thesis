In the text it's about the genius like Voltaire and their seriousness. They say they are really serious and more or less never drink alcohol.But in the listening it's about how Voltaire gets a genius. And he always discus with people when he was going to a party and wrote down every thing he remember. 
Chevalier de Seinaglt wrote a memoir about his life and adventues. He wrote that he was living in Switzerland. An other point is that they say in the text that this guys who invited and also Chevalier who wrote a memoir are very rich, but the woman from the listening says they were not really rich.They say they were not really poor but no way they were rich.
The last point is, in the reading they say that Chevalier escape he from a notorious prison uin Venice, Italy. But in the listening it's about he lived in Venice and go away from his home. Also Voltaire should be rude boy when you read  the text. But hen you listenhe is just an inventor who want to find thing from this world no one ever seen.
