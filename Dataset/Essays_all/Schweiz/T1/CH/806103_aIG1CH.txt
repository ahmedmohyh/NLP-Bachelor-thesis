The speech about Chevalier was critical, but not as critical as the article. The article doubts really hard on the accuracy of his memoir. In the speech they said that he was in a business where he had to wait on his money and that sometimes he had to borrow money while waiting on his loan. And during waiting he spent his money parties and gambling. But that doesn't mean that he was poor and it doesn't mean that he only borrowed the money for parties and gambling to appear wealthy. The text assumes that he was poor because he had to borrow money but that assumtion isn't completely correct. 
The second point is that speak with the famous writer Voltaire. The text criticts that it is impossible to remember every sentence from a comversation years after the conversation took place. But they leave out that Chevalier refers his memoire to notes he took right after he talked to Voltaire. But with notes it's likely possible to remember the exact phrases of a conversation.
The last point about the prison is again really diffrent seen in the text and the speech. The speech says like the text that he had powerful friends in venice, but it also says that there were people with even more powerful friends in the government and they weren't able to get out of the prison. It also arguments with the point that after Chevalier left the prison they had to repair the ceiling. This wouldn't have been necessary if he got out on the normal way only with help from his powerful friends.
