The life  of Chevalier de Seingalt is quite controverial and to alot of critics hard to believe. But there's an explanation to all of the adventures and events that happend in his life. 
First of all no memoir can be fully correct but the one of Chevalier is quite reliable. 
The loan from the merchant in Switzerland isn't as critics say an act of poorness but simply something Chevalier was forced to do. Because Chevalier didn't always havehis money in coins and notes but in things like houses and other belongings. So until he could actually grip his change his valueable belongings into money you can grip he had to wait and that's why he had to loan it from a merchant in the meantime
The statement that Chevailiers conversations with Voltaire aren't accurate because it's impossble for a person to remember converstion so many years later is false. Because Chevalier acually wrote down his converstions right after the meeting but he never published his dairy and only mentioned it years later in his memoir.
The escape of the prison in Venice is also easy to explain. why did the ceiling of his prison cell have to be replaced shortly after he escaped?
