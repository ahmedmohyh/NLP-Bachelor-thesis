In the text it is written, that the Chevalier de Seingalt lived in Switzerland and that he always went to parties and was gambling. They say, that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant, although he claims that he's been rich. But in the listening the woman said that he wasn't poor, but it only took some days to get the money and so it looked like he had been poor. Furthermore in the text it is told, that critics think the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire is not real, because it is impossible to remember everything of the conversation after all these years. But the women of the listening said that, in the evening,  the Chevalier wrote down everything he and Voltaire talked about during the day. Moreover, in the text it is written that he did not escape the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal, but by some politically well-connected friends who bribed a number of jailers. On the other hand, in the listening waas told that all the other prisoners had way more important friends than the Chevalier and they hadn't been able to escape. Aditionally, some people told that the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape of the Chevalier and this shows that it could be possible that he escaped through the ceiling.
