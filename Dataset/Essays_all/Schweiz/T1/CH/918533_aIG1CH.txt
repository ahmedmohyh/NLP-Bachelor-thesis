It's obvious thet the text and the presentation are connected to eachother. The text explains, why the Chevaliers memoirs aren't historically accurate, while the presentation tries to convince the listener of the opposite. For example it is mentioned that the Chevalier was actually poor, he is said to having borrowed most of the money he spent. On the other hand the presentation explains that borrowing money doesn't mean that someone is poor. Also the notes of his conversations with Voltaire are said to be inaccurate, since he probably wrote them many years later, which the presentation denies. The story about him fleeing from a prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing out of it seems quite spectacular and is very enjoyable to read, but noone really knows what actually happened in there. t seems true, since it's impossible that he had help from others, because other prisoners had much more powerful frieds, but they couldn't leave the prison. It seems that the Chevalier has lived a quite spectacular life, even if the truth of his words can't be proven.
