The Chevalier of Seingalt was a controversial writer in the ancient past. However, there are a lot of critics who do not believe the stories from the Chevalier,
The Chevalier claims that he was a whealthy and important person in the high society during his time in Switzerland. But critics found some reliable sources which may be more truthfull than the objective stoy which was written by an person who was envolved. On the other hand, an explanation could be that the Chevalier had to sell something to get to money. Some people claim that he needed to wait a few days until the money arrives and according to the supporters he borrowed money from a swiss merchant at this time.
Critics also believe that he could not write down his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire after about ten years. But peers claimed that the Chevalier wrote down his conversations each evening and because of this he could be able to write the conversations again a few years later.
In his memoir, the Chevalier writes about his escape out of thr prison in veniche, where he was arrested. He says that he escaped by it-self, without any help from the couvernement. Critics believe, that it was not possible to get out of the prison without help from his friends. The ones who believe in the memoir are saying that there were other people in prison with more friends.
