The audio presentation says that though many people say Chevalier's memoir can't be correct, it is indeed pretty accurate. It can be used as a relieable source for the life in the 18th century. 
According to the text, Chevalier couldn't be rich and wealthy and he couldn't gamble and go to parties, because he was very poor. But he wasn't. It is correct that he borrowed money from other people. But that doesn't say that he was poor. He just needed a few days to make even more money with that money.
The text also says that the conversations between him and Voltaire couldn't be accurate, because he wrote his memoir twenty years after the conversation. But the audio presentation claims that every night after a conversation, he wrote everything down he could remember. There were even witnesses who confirmed that he'd had those notes. 
At last, the text tries to proof that he couldn't possibly escape from a prison, only by using a piece of metal. It is more likely that he gave his jailers money to free him. But the woman from the presentation is sure that he used that piece of metal. Because there were even more powerful prisoners who had even more friends than Chevalier had. And they didn't manage to escape. It is also wrote on some old venician dosuments that after Chevalier escaped, they had to repair his ceiling. So there's no reason why they would've had to repair his ceiling, if he didn't escape through the ceiling with a piece of metal.
