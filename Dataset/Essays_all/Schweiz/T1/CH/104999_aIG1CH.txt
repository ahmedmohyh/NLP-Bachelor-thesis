There was this historical person named the Chevalier who wrote down his memoirs. It isn't proved that his memoirs are complete right but it isn known that he sometimes distorted some storys to make his memoirs more exciting.
First, there is this situation in Switzerland. in his memories the Chevalier wrote down that is was very rich and it was known that he had spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. But in the text there is written that he had borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant and if he had been wealthy he hadn't had to borrow some money. In the listening text they claim the critics and say that it sometimes took some days to tranfer money to Switzerland and so maybe the Chevalier just had borrowed the money while he had been waiting fr his money to arrive.
Second is the conversation with Voltaire. Critcs complain that it isn't possible to remember the exact phrases from this onversation during many years.But ther is also the possibility that he had written down the conversation a few days later and after some years he wrote it in his memoirs.
And last there is also the situation that the Chevalier wrote he has escaped from a prison in Venice. The critics in the text point out that it had been impossible to escape from this prison and so the Chevalier maybe just had some well-connected friend who had gotten him out of the prison.
In the listening text they complain that they were a lot people with higher friends who couldn't got them out. It was also known that the prison cell from the Chevalier had to been repared after his escape so it might could been possible he really escaped with a piece of metal through a hole. 
The reading text and the listening text both give some pro's and con's to the truthness from Chevaliers memoirs.
