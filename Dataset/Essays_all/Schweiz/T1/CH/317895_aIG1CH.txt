Critics claim that chevaliler lied about various events written in his book. for example he said that he lived in switzerland for a while and was very wealthy at that time while evidence shows that he had borrowed considerable amounts of money at that time. why would he have to borrow money if he was so rich? Well other sources say that he could`ve just needed cash at that time to be able to afford the luxury he was used to, while he was waiting for money that he was supposed to get.
It`s also hard to believe that he remembers the exact conversations he had with the famous writer Voltaire when he had written the book a long time after their talk. However it is said that chevalier used to write down everything he remembered from such important events the same night.There are also testimonies saying that he used old notebooks while writing the book.
The last controversity is that critics don`t believe that he escaped from the prison since he had a number of politically well-connected friends in venice  who could have offered a bribe. On the other hand bribery seems very unlikely because no other inmate with even better connections got out like that. And what, other then his escape through the roof, would explain why the prison had to repair the roof in his cell shortly after his escape?
