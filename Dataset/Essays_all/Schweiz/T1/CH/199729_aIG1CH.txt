The woman in the listening thinks that the memoir is quite correct and a reliable historical source, whereas the text speaks about what the critics think of the memoir. For example that it was written a long time after the events took place and therefore cannot possibly be accurate. The woman in the listening doesn't agree because she says that a lot of witnesses say that the Chevalier referred to several diaries and notes which he took right after the conversations he had, whilst he was writing the memoir. They also disagree on the fact that the Chevalier was poor. He spent very large sums of money on parties and gambling but instead of financing this himself he borrowed a lot of the money from other people, but the woman says that this was because he had wealth as objects which he first had to sell so he borrowed money from other people until his money arrived. The last part is that the text says that the Chevalier escaped the prison in Venice by bribing the jailers, since he had several well-connected friends. The woman disagrees on this point, she thinks it is more likely that he escaped prison because some very old venician documents state that the ceiling of the cell of the Chevalier had to be replaced after he left. She also doubts that he bribed the jailers to let him go because there were many other prisoners there at the time that were far better connected, which didn't escape prison.
