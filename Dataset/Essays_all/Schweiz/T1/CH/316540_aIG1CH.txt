In the lecture the woman made clear, that the memoir had to be pretty accurate and correct the way Chevalier de Seingalt wrote it, because there was evidence.

She said that while he was living in Switzerland, borrowing money from a merchant doesn't necesseraly mean that he was poor, it just took a while until his money arrived. So to still gamble and party when he ran out of cash, he had to borrow cash from the merchant. 

Regarding the conversations between him and Voltaire he claims that he had written down everything that exact same night as accurate as he remembered. He used this texts to write the memoir later on and didn't try to recall the conversation. 

It was known that a lot of inhabitants of jail had way more friends than Chevalier that could have gotten them out of jail, but none of them could ever escape. So it is very unreal that it was a bribe in Chevaliers case. Also the jail later on released that they had to rebuild the ceiling of the cell Chevalier was in. Why would this be needed if he didn't escape trough the roof as the memoir claims?
