The first point is about how rich the Chevalier really was. The text says that he wasn't as rich as he claimed to be and was even poor. The speaker says it doesn't mean that he was poor just because he did have to borrow money from other people because he had to spend much money on parties; Although he had to borrow money he wasn't poor. (he could pay the borrowed money back)

Secondly, the text says that the Chevalier does really had conversations with Voltaire but couldn't be able to write down years later what they had actually spoken.In contrary, the speaker says that immediately after their conversations the Chevalier wrote down what they were talking about. She says that witnesses prove that later when he wrote his memoir he refered to his kept notes.

In the text there are doubts that he could have really escaped from his prison in Venice by his own. It says that the Chevalier wrote down his escape as an adventure instead of just writing that he got help.
The vortrag says that in this prison there were prisoners with far more powerful friends than the Chevalier had and that they also couldn't be freed by them. Furthermore, the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape of the Chevalier. Why should have the ceiling been repaired immediately after his escape when not because he made a hole in the ceiling so that he could escape?
