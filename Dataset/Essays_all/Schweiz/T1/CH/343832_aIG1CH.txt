No memoir can be correct. The memoir of the chevalier is considered as a valuable historcial source.
Three critical aspects where mentioned in the text, that were explained in the listening part.
First, you can read in the text, that the chevalier had written in his memoir that he was wealthy, but he had to borrow lots of money. So you can think he should be poor. As explained in the listening text that doesn't mean he is poor for real.  He had lots of his wealth in objects that had to be sold first to get the money. So he had to wait for his money to arrive. That's why he had to borrow money meanwhile. 
Then, they talk about the conversation that were written down years later. Critics say that is impossible to remeber what they talked about in these conversation so long time after it. In the listening they explain, that the chevalier took notes every night about everything he remembered of the day and he kept these notes for many years. So it can be possible, that he wrote down this critised conversation years later based on those notes he took every night. Which means, he could noted the exact phrases from the conversation held many years earlier.
The third point that is questioned in the memoir of the Chevalier is his esacpe from the prison in Venice. It is enjoyable to read such a story, but critics claim it's truth. During the listening they explained, that it sure can be true. The government had to repare the celing of the Chevalier's cell after he escaped. Why should you repare a ceiling when he didn't escaped as he mentioned in his memoirs? So he really had to escape like he mentioned in his memoir by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
So to summeries all, the text has a very critical view to the memoir of the chevalier, but for all points that critics claim on, the recording has some explanations.
