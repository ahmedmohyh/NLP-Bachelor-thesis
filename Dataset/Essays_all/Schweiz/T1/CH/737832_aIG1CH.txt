First of all, Chevalier de Seingalt was not poor. Borrowing money in switzerland isn`t that big of a deal. He did spend much money on gambling and other things. Another point is, that it takes many days, to get the money he earns from writing his texts. They claim that chevalier invented many events in the memoir and they are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversations. But people who knew him very well confirmed, that he didn`t invented anything and wrote down everything he heared during the day on the same night. People also questioned the way he escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. They don`t think he escaped by a whole he made in the ceiling. But actually, a ceiling had to be repared in the Vice prison. And as well, he didn`t had the strongest group of jailers helping him to escape, as people claimed.
