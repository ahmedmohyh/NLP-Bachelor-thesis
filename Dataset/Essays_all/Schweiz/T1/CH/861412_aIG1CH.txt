In the presentation of Chevalier de Seingalt, they say, that his writings are a very valuable and a reliable historical source about the European society in the eighteenth century. But the text says, that a lot of things are probably made up by him to make his life sound more exiting and glamourous. The text also states that he probably wasn't very rich, thus bowrrowing alot of money from swiss merchants. But then again, in the presentation they say that he had to take loans, because the converting of his wealth into money took a few days, and tired of waiting, he just borrowed the money, and a few days later, he simply paid it back. The last conflict about the text and the presentation is the escape from the prison in Venice. Again the text states that its not really possible, to escape from a prison like this by digging a hole in the ceiling with a small metal piece and escaping throughit and that he most likely got freed by friends of him, which had alot of power in Venice, but again, in the presentation they say that other prisoners also had friends, which had even more power than the Chevalier, but unlike the Chevalier, they didin't get to be freed by their friends. Witnesses also confirm, that the ceiling in Chevalier's cell had to be repaired, after he escaped the prison, so the presetator, which like already said earlier, is very unlikely to be true.
Over all the presentation and the text contradict each other in every aspect.
