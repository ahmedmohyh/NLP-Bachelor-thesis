The memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt became a valuable historical source, however doubts have raised about how much of these events are really true and happend in a way as it is written. 

Refering to the first point, the Chevalier was wealthy and spend a lot of money- borrowed my a merchant, but critics argue that he had to change his goods into money fast, been able to participate a those parties mentioned in the text. Changing to another point of critcs, Its clear that he met the french writer Voltaire, but not everybody agrees that he capture those conversations accurently because of the well know fact that those conversations are not written during the same time, while others say that he took notes of these onversations every night. Taking a bout the last of the three point of critics, some think he had good connections to political friends who bribed the jailors, but others argue that a historical source from this time indicates that his cell was repaired at a point after his escape at a locations as decribed in the memoir.

To sum up there are some point that seem to be true, however probably nobody can say what really happend. Perhaps some points are truely in detail, while others are not.
