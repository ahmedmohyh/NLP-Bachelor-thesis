The woman holding the presentation said that Chevalier de Seingalts memoirs are reliable and historically correct. Many points in the text however claim that said memoirs can't be used as a reliable source for the history about the European society. Since Chevalier wote his memoir so many years after the events had happened, the author of the text argues that his memories can't be historically correct since a person is not capable of remembering small details for that long. The woman talking about him however makes a remark about how Chevalier used to make notes from his conversations and brings up the fact that there are sources from other people agreeing that these notes were made.
Another point that raises doubt about the accuracy and truthfullness of his texts, is that Chevalier claimed to be wealthy but in fact had to take a loan many times. What could explain this phenomena is the fact that Chevalier owned his wealth in the form as assets and these needed time to be converted into money. Since CHevalier however liked to organize big parties, he often had to borrow money temporary for the event since selling the assets first would take too much time.
A spectacular event in Chevaliers life was the claimed escape out of a prison by making a hole into the ceiing using a metal rod. The text says this can't be possible and that in reality some high raking friends of him made sure he could get away. The woman holding the presentation contradicts by explaining that there were other, way more powerful prisoners in the same prison who surely had more connections than Chevalier but nevertheless weren't able to escape. Apparently there are also documents saying that the ceiling had to e fixed after Chevalier had escaped. Knowing all these informations makes Chevaliers memoirs more believable.
