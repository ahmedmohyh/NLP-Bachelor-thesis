Right after he talked with Voltaire he wrote everything down.So when he wrote the memoir he could remember everything  like it was yesterday. The Peolple from the text think, that he is a liar and he dindt talk with Voltaire at all. They wrote that it is impossible to remember al the little details from the discussion.
The writers from the text think, that he didnt escape from prison. He just wrote it that the memoir is not boring to read. But after he broke out of prison, they had to recover the ceiling. Why did they have to recover the ceiling when he did not break out? And all the other prisoners had also well-connected friends who could helped them. But only he escaped.
In the text, they think he was not as rich as he wrote about. he had to borrow money from other people. Just with this money he was able to buy all this fancy stuff. But in the Presentation they said that that he needed money to start with all this things, and if you have no money, how could you become rich? How could you build a factory for example? Right, you can not. You have to have money to start.
