The presentation delivers a few important facts about what Chevalier (what a bizarr name) has written in his memoir. A few persons din't think that the memoir is fully trustworthy and tried to claim that. For example the fact that he was rich isn't fully proovable but they know, that he has spent a huge summ of money to gamble in a casino and so on. The most stunning fact in his memoir, wich says, that he escaped the prison with only an tiny piece of metal can be easily prooved as an wrong information. Other reports say that at the time he was in prison, there were persons much more common as he was and they had friends much more powerfull that his friends. But a prisonreport claims that his window (im not sury if I had understand that correctly) was being repaired at the time he was prisoned. So that would be an easy possibility to escape.
