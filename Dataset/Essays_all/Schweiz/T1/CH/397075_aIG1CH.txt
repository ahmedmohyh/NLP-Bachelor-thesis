According to the presentation the memoir of Chevalier is very accurate.
The first claim about his wealth is likely to be true. In the text it sais that he had to borrow money from a merchant, but he had made many parties in this time. He made his money with buying and selling things, so he had to borrow money but when he sold the things he made a good profit.

The second thing mentioned in the tex are the conversation between him and Voltaire. The text sais that it is not possible to remember every phrase of the conversations many years later. This is correct but Chevalier did write down the dialog as acurat as possible in the same evening and when writing his memoir he looked at this notes.

The breaking out of jail could have happend because bribery was very unlikely. There were some very important people in this jail and they haven't been able to bribe somebody. Also in the police report is mentioned that the roof had to be repaired shortly after he broke out. So it is likely that he damaged the roof.

Overal the presentation talks very possitiv about this memoire where as the text is very critical about what realy happened.
