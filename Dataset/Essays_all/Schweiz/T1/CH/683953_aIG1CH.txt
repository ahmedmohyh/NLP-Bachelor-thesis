Chevalier could not escape from the prison in Venice because there were other people in Venice who had more well connected friends and they were not able to escape from the prison. Actually this must be invented. 

It also must be invented most of his conversations with Voltaire. A lot of Critics say that he never met Voltaire, even when he met him he wrote the conversations many years later and it's impossible that he could remember every single word. Actually this must be invented. 

They say that when Chevalier was in Switzerland he had spent a lot of money in gambling and parties. But this can't be true because if he had spent money in parties and gambling, he should be rich. Actually the found out that he borrowed a lot of money, so he could not be rich,he must be poor.
