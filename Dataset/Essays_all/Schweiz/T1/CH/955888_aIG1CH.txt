This Text goes about Chevalier de Seingalt who lived in the 18th century. It exists a long memoir about his life and his adventures. This document shows very good how they lived in this society 200 years ago. But there are some doupts from critics who say that some stories can't be true.
Chevalier said that he was in Switzerland for gambling and parties. In this case he said he is rich but he wasn't. He had to borrow a lot of money by a swiss mearchant the critics found out.
Also he said that he met Voltair, discused and spoke with him. But in his memoirs he wrote exactly what they've conversed, But the memoirs have been written many years later is this possibel to remember it everything? The critics say no.
Also the critics are questioning his escape of the prison in Venice. He told that he made it with climbing out of the window down the roof. But thats just for exciting reading.  Perhaps he had some powerful friends who paid him free. The found out that one of his friends was the governour.
