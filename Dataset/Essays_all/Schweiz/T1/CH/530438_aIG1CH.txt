The presentation tells us about 3 things from the Chevaliers memoir. He once lived in Switzerland and spent there a big amount of money on gambling and on parties. He had to be rich, otherwise he couldn't do all these things. But his money wasn't available at all times. The Chevalier had to wait sometimes until he got the money he won. Voltaire was a friend of the Chevalier and they had a lot of interesting conversation in the evenings. Chevalier wrote down what they talked about and rearranged it later when he wrote his memoir. In the memoir is also written down how he escaped from the prison in Venice. He hadn't had good connections with powerful people in there, so it's unclear to say how he escaped.
There are different critics mentioned in the text then in the presentation. The text says that the Chevalier borrowed money from other people, so he wasn't really rich but as the presentation says it could also have been that he just sometimes had to wait to get his money.
That Voltaire and the Chevalier conversed is true, but in the text it's written down that he wrote everything from this conversations just when he wrote his memoir and not that he took notes every evening after their conversations.
Somehow the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice. His memoir says that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof but the critics in the text says that it's actually more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him. Then there's the presentation where it's mentioned that he probably not escaped with help from the jailors because the Chevalier hadn't those good connection with powerful people.
