Chevalier's memoirs were pretty accurate and reliable. And because of that his memoirs are an important historical source.
He was not extremely rich but it would be wrong to call him poor, because he had always enough money, but often he had to wait for it to arrive. 
His escape from a prison in Venice was more or less confirmed because there was a report about fixing the roof of his cell. Chevalier could not have escaped because of his powerful friends because there were other people with much more powerful friends in the prison and they staied in prison.
In the text Chevalier's memoires were called inaccurate and it is written, that the report of the talk with Voltaire is also not accurate. 
It is said that he was very poor and not rich at all when he visited Switzerland. 
His prison escape trough the roof of his cell is not confirmed. It is said that he could escape because of his powerful friends.
