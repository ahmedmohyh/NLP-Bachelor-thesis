The essay sees Chevaliers memoires much more critical and it involves much more doubt about the accuracy of the momoires. For example in the essay it is mentionned that chevallier needed to borrow mony even he should have been rich and this fact is seen as lie. In the lecture thats seen as a reason for the gambling they think he spend mony in gambling but he had to wait until he gets the winns and so he had to borrow money. They do not see that as an dissagreement with beeing rich.
It is interesting that facts could be interpretated so diffrently. And it is also interessting to see the diffrent assumptions the people use to proof their arguments, For example with the momoires about the conversations with Voltaire. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from conversations held many years earlier. On the other side in the lecture it is mentionned that it is known that Chevalier took notes about conversations so he could write them in his memoires many years later. An other example is the question about his escape from a prison in Venice. Critics think he just got liberated by politically well-conected friends. The lecrture points out that the prison in venice had to get an reperature in the ceiling shortly after Chevalier was there and they think it is likely that he told the truth and escaped through the ceiling.
