No memoir can be correct in detail. Although Chevailer's is a  reliable source according to the presentation, but the text says otherwise. In Switzerland, both sources agree that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and that he borrowed considerable sums of money but the presentation tells us that he just borrowed money while waiting for his money to arrive. Another difference is the conversaition with the famous writer Voltaire. It is not just proven that they really  met each other but also that Chevailer kept notes of the conversaition over many years and that he often documented conversations in his diary, not just that one. The mystery about his escape form the a notorious prison in Venice is also not so clear. The text says that the jailers were bribed to free him because of his politically well-connected friends. The presentation on the other hand claims that Chevailer didn't have any well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. They also share the opinion that it is could be possible that he eascaped through the roof because they had to fix a hole in the ceiling in Chevailer's cell.
