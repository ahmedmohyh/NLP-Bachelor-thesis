There are three points about Chavelier.
1. The Chevalier de Seingalt was very poor. But he become very wealth. Chavelier lived in Switzerland and spend his money on parties because he had a lot of cash.
2. After he met very famous people, including kings and writers, he write everything he could remember.
3. The escape of the prison: He had escaped of a very safe prison. The other prisoners had more friends, know-how and more muscles but they couldn't escaped of the prison. 

The difference to the text is that in the text it saids that he had a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. But in the Video it saids that he could escaped at his self. It didn't said something about well-connected friends in Venice.
