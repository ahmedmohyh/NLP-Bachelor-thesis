Chevalier de Seingalt who decided to share his adventures with the future wrote a text full of old memories. In that text there are a few things which were doubted by others, for example the story with his prison escape. In the audio I just heard a women talks about the doubted things and explains the critic that was made. 
Starting off with the story of Chevalier beeing in Switzerland. He described his time in Switzerland as glamorous, wealth and full of parties and gambling. People  said that there was some evidence that the Vhevalier had to borrow money therefore it seemed like he wasn't that wealth. However borrowing money doesn't mean that someone has to be poor. Chevalier might had to wait for his assets at first that's why he borrowed money but it is definetly not a significiant proof of Chevalier beeing poor.
The next thing people were skeptical about was the review of the conversations with Voltaire. People said it is impossible to remember such details after a very long time. But Chevalier had made notes each night after a conversation with Voltaire. Which makes sense ofcours and explains the detailed report on all the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire. Chevalier relied on his notes very often when he wrote his report, just a general fact.
Chevalier's escape from prison, yes, also this story was highly doubted. Chevalier wrote that he had been in prison in Venice but he could escape using a piece of metal to make a hole into the ceiling and then climb out of the prison just through the roof. But it is more likely that the Chevalier could have just asked his politically well-connected friends in Venice to pay his bribe, that's what the critic says. Although Chevalier wasn't the only one in that prison and considering that there were even more mighty people in the prison and not even they could pay the bribe, makes this argument kind of unimportant.
