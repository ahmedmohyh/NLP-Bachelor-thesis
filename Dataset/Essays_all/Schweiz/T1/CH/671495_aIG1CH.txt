The Chevalier was indeed a highly influencial figure during the 18th century, but the accuracy of his famous memoires are highly in doubt. Pointing out the controversy of the Chevaliers memories shown on three examples. In his memories he chevalier wrote down the precise conversations between him and the famous Voltaire. There is no doubt about them meeting each other, however, some people strongly doubt that dialogues can be written down in that precision after so many years have passed. Critics of that theorie claim that the Chevalier had plenty of journals and took notes right after every conversation with Voltaire. The Chavalier apparently even managed to escape a famous, at that time, high security prison in Venice, Italy. He could escape it by breaking through the ceiling with a piece of metal, which seems fairly impossible. Some history experts are sure that politically influencial friends of his must have bribed the the right people in venice. On the other hand, there is an extremly old document from the venecian archives, in which stood that around that time he claimed to have escaped, a ceiling in the prison had been in need of reparation. The decision on what to belive now lies upon ourselves.
