In the first sentence of the text it said that the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures many years after his escape of the prison. But in the conversation about Chevalier, they said, Chevalier have written everything down staight after a conversation. And these four words "straight after a conversation, doesn't fit with the text about the Chevalier de Seingalt. We'll never know if he had no time to write everything down or what the problem was.

Secondly, it is said in the text, that the Chevalier was very wealthy while living in Switzerland but in the listening they have spoke about how poor Chevalier's were. But it is true, that a Chevalier have spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling.
