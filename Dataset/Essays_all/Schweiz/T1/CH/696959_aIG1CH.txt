Many people don't believe the memoire from the Chevalier de Seingalt. In the text they write about three things who can't have been like this. 
First that the Chevalier was wealthy. While he was living in Switzerland he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and he needed to borrow money from other people. But in the listening they have an explanation. He had to wait for his money while this was travelling to him and he paid all back.
One other thing is that he wrote about a conversation with Voltaire many years later and that he couldn't remember. But it is possible that he wrote the things down to remember later and that he consulted this notes while he was writing his memoires.
And finally there is a legend that he could have escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. The text sais that he couldn't have used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. He had many friends who were important politicers and they could have helped him to sort the prison. But in the listening they say that other people in prison had more important friends and they couldn't get out. 
So we don't know what is true and what not but perhaps we will know it in a vew years.
