"Chevalier"

The Chevalier spent time in Switzerland where he went often to partys and spent a lot of money there. But it isn't true that he borrowed money from a Swiss mechant.
In his life he also met the famous writer Voltaire. In the text there is written, that the critics don't belive that. But the speaker of the presentation said that he Chevalier wrote everything (while the conversation) down. 
He also escaped one from the prison. But not by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceilling. His friends helped him to escape from the prison.
In the prison they were more guys who had stronger friends than Chevalier but they couldn't help their own friends.
