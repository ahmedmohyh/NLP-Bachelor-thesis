In the speech they were a lot of arguments, which toke the power of the statements in the next. For example the story about his vacation in Switzerland. The text says, that Chevalier was a poor looser who spend a lot of money for gambling and parties. It went that far that he had to borrow money from other people to pay his addiction. In the Speech we get to know, that borrowing money isn't a sign for less money. He had a lot of money, which he had to bring to switzerland. So while he was waiting for his money to arrive, he had to borrow from others. The second point that is mentioned is Chevaliers memoir with the famous writer "Voltaire". It seems that it's not possible to remember that much things and capture them for such a long time. But through the speech we get to know the idea of writing notes about the conversation with Voltaire. Chevalier was a clever guy, he could take all of his notes together and write his memoir pretty easily. The last critic point in Chevaliers life, is his glory escape from a notorious prison in Italy. The text says that it seems to be rubbish, that Chevaliers escaped by himself just with a piece of metal and his climbing-skills. It's more likely the jailers of him were bribed too free the Chevalier. Whatever, in the speech we get to know that the cell of Chevalier had to be repared and that seems to be a fact, which gives his story a bit more trustwurthy.
