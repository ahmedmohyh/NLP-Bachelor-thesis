In this presentation the historical accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalts memoire is discussed, since there are many critics who beleive that chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more interesting.Like in the text above the speaker discusses mainly three passages of Chevaliers memoir and provides evidences for their historical accuracy; Chevaliers glamorous life in Switzerland and the lone he received from a merchant, the conversations with Voltaire and Chevaliers escape from a notorious venecian prison.
The critics in the text above argue that if somebody needs to borrow money, he can't be a very wealthy person. The presentation on the other hand mentions that he had to wait for his money to arrive and therefor needed to borrow money from this swiss merchant.
The next controversial passage in Chevaliers memoir contain his conversations with Voltaire. Critics are skeptical about how somebody could accurately reproduce conversations held a long time ago. The presentation invalidates their arguments by reporting that people wholived with Chevalier saw him use a lot of notes while writing his memoir, so he must have took notes after important events.
And last but not least there is this movielike story about him escaping prison. Critics argue that his powerfull friends probably bribed his jailers to free him. The presentation counters this argument by mentioning that there were inmates with even better-connected friends than Chevalier and that there is a govermental report about a cell wichs ceiling had to bee repaired after a inmate broke free.
