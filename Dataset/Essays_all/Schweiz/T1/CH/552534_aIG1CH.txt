    The Chevalier de Seingalt is sure to have met at least most of the people he claims to have. But some of his adventures and tellings differ in the eye of critics from reality. Let's take his time in Switzerland for example. He definately spent big sums of money for gambling and he threw parties that would have made the great Gatsby jealous. But also known is that the Chevalier borrowed money from some merchant. Some critics say he must have lied and had been pour instead of wealthy. Those who belliev in his memoirs accuracy reply that his wealth took time to get, and that he borrowed money in the meantime.
    The next point being his conversing with the Voltaire. Again, we know they did meet an talk to one another, but the Chevalier wrote down their conversation precisely, and that fact gets the critical fraction of his readers reason to belive it's to some degree fake. However, the followers of the memoirs counter with the fact that the author consulted notes to write his text.
    The last thing is the acclaimed jailbreak form Italy's Venice. The critics tell he got brabbed out. The believers say he esacped the way he claims to have. After all, people with even more powerful friends didn't make it out there, and after de Chevalier had left the prison, the ceiling in his room needed to prepared. But the damage of the ceiling could have been from anything.

    But in the end, we will never know for sure, if these memoirs have been written on true facts or to what degree they're real. Unless any definite evidence finds its way into the hands of a follower or critic, de Chevaliers adventure will stay debated.
