Chevalier lived in the eighteenth century and during his lifetime he wrote a memoir which became a valuable historical source about European society.
As mentioned in the presentation, it is pretty accurate and reliable eventhough there is are a lot of critics. 

Chevalier claimed that he was very rich when he lived in Switzerland which is also shown by the great deal of money he spent. People have raised doubts because they recently found out, that he borrowed a loan of a swiss merchand. Well that might be true but back then it didn't work like nowadays - you had to sell things first before you could get wealthy, what took some time for sure.

The second point was about his conversations between himself and Voltaire who was a famous writer. Did they really happen they way he wrote them in his memoir or are they taken out of the air? What we got to know by some reliable sources is that he kept a few notebooks and journals, where he noted down every conversation he had that day. So therefore we can be pretty sure that he tells us the thruth in his memoir.

Last but not least: the escape from the prison in Venice. Critics doubt his adventurous escape through the ceiling of the prison and think his rich friends helped have offered a bribe to help him get out of it. But we can read in some old books about the prison that they actually had to repair the ceiling just after he escaped which is very accurate with the story he wrote in his memoir.
