Chevalier was a man who lived in the18 century and got well know because of his memoir. he's telling a lot about famous people he had met in his life. But not everybody's sure he's always telling the truth. There have raised many doubts about his storys. For example he told he escaped from the prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, but there are some criticts who are sure he bribed some jailers and he only didn,'t write it down because it was embarissing and not as dramatically as his new invented story. But there are others who bring really good arguments for examle that its prooved that they had to fix the ceiling after he escaped and also that there where people with conections to even more powerful men and nobody of them could escape. . Nowbody doubts he didn't always tell the hole truth and often added some more details but there is a discoussion if the mainstructures of the storys are real. Also an important aspect is a conversation he had with Voltaire. he wrote down the conversation many years later and many voices say it's not possible to remember it that exactly, word for word. Others say he just tried to write it as near as possible as it happend so far and that maybe not evrey word's as said but he just wrote that what he remembered. whatever he had a very intresting and adventureful live and he had the possibility to meet various famous people.
