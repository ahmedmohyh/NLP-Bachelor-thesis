The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about memoirs recounting his life and adventures. But first we have to thought about the question are all the memoirs correct? Because sometimes we do not even know that our mamoir changed from the truth.

Chevalier lived a while in Switzerland. He wrote that he was very wealthy and rich in this part of his life. But critics say that he borrowed sums of money. So what is true? They both can be correct. Because if you leave you home you leave also your place of work and the place where you can earn money. So if you went in another country you do not have a work so you do not have money too. Additionally. In addition, you need to borroy money.

Chevalier claims that he had a conversation with Voltaire. He wrote about this conversation. But critics thinks this memoir is not true because it is impossible to remember the exact phrases from this conversation which was many years ago. This point from the critics in naturally true. But it is possible that Chevalier wrote some notes to save the correct words.

Summed up, we do not even know the truth. We can not say who tells the truth and who not. But nobody knows. So we can believe whatever we like to.
