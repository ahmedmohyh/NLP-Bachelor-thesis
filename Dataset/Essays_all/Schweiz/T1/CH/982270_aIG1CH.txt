While the text shows how the memoirs of Chevalier cannot be an accurate source, the presentation tries to explain how everything Chevalier wrote is in fact correct.

Firstly it is written about the time Chevalier lived in Swizerland. Chevalier claimed to be awealthy person.To the author of the text it does not add up that a wealthy person hadto borrow money from a friend to party or to gamble. The presentation justifies it by saing that Chevalier sold things and sometimes he had to wait to receive his money and so he did not always have the money he needed.

Secondly it is written about his conversation with the famous French writer Voltaire. Chevalier wrote down the conversation after years of having it. Now what they say does not make sense is that it is impossible for a human to remember all the things exactly. In the pesentation it is said that he wrote down everything the both discussed and so it is possible for someone to write an accurate chapter about the meeting with Voltaire.

Finally it is written about the time when Chevalier escaped a Venetian prison. Chevalier claims to have escaped by making a hole in the roof and climbing out of it. The writer of the text sais that he offered abribe to the jailers so that he could escape. In the presentation we find out about an Venetian document which said that there was someone who had to repair the roof because of the hole and so the story about the escaping of the prison has to be correct.

in conclusion it is difficult to know if the things Chevalier wrote are correct and actually a good source for us to learn more about the european society of the eighteenth century. We should not just blindly believe everything we read even if it is a memoir by a person who lived during this timepeople always knew how to tell a story in a interesting way even if it means to lie about it.
