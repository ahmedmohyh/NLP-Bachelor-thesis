The Chevalier de Seingalt was a very controversal figure because of the memoir he wrote about his life and adventures. Some feel like he was a liar and somebody who exagerated when telling his stories. This theorie is not just something critics invented. They have clues that his lifetimes stories were not true. Other people think that what the Chavalier told in his memoir is hundert precent true and not just an exageration. They believe almost every story he told. For example they don't think that he had to borrow money from the Swiss merchat because he was poor but because he just ran out of money. Many Chavaliers from that time were known for the parties and gambling they threw and those Chavaliers also had to borrow money for some time but would give it back after the big event. In his memoir there's written a story about him and Voltaire and how they used to talk and spend time together. Critics belive that this can't be true because nobody can remember phrases that sombody said for such a long time. Non- critics belive that everytime he talked to Voltaire and spent time with him he came home and wrote down their converation. That's why he could write down whole conversations that they had. Critics also don't believe what he told about his escape at the prison in Venedig. Others claim that other prisoners who were there knew much more important people that could've helped them to escape but they didn't. In Venedig documents it said that they had to repair the ceiling after he escaped and this makes only sense if what he told about his escape is true.
