It was stated during the lecture, that the chevalier in fact was a relatively reliable source. It was correct, that chevalier had to borrow money from a s merchant during his stay in switzerland. But that was the case, because it was not easy in medieval times to get quick cash money. It is possible that the Chevalier had taken some loans, because he needed fast money to continue to gamble. The next critical point was about the accuraccy of the discussions of him and Voltaire, a french philosophers. Altough the chevalier wrote his memoir five years after the conversation, many of his servants claimed, that he had used old summaries of the times of his adventures. The prison escape in venice is most likely, so say his critics, the outcome of bribed soldiers, but the lecturer stated, that there were even more powerful figures in that exact same prison, who were not allowed to freedom. At the beginning of the lecture it was also made clear, that the chevaliers memoir probably were not bulletproof, but it still functions as a good inside of the medieval time period.
