Both, the text and the hearing tell us facts about a historical person, the Chevalier. In the text it is said that some historians do have doubts about the accuracy of the memoir he wrote about his life. In the hearing, the woman, who is probably a historian that has studied Chevaliers life, sais that the memoir is very acurate to the real happening. So we could say that she is telling us her own point of view rather than the text is more balanced. 

Some historians think that it could be possible that the Chevalier didn't actualy write down his life exactly as things had realy occured, but added some addional details to make it more adventurous and exciting. Details for example such as the escape of the prison in venice, the years in Switzerland and the discussions with Voltaire may not be very acurate.
But the woman in the listening sais that there is evidence that all those things realy happened. So she mentiones (for the escape of the prisin of Venice) the writing of a prision guardian that said, that after his escape the roof had to be repared because it had been damaged. Or the discussions with Voltaire: is seems that the Chavlier took notes meanwhile the discussions and then used themas a base for his memoir.
