Even if you just look at the text and compare it to the audio tape, you will see that Chevalier de Seingalt was an extremly controversial figure. The first aspect, that was discussed in both medias, is his wealth and how he spent his money in Switzerland. In his memoire Chevalier claims to have been very rich while living in Switzerland. The text doupts that, because in later research it was discovered that Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a swiss merchant. The audio tought thinks that both of this thinks could be true. It is a known fact that Chevalier was involved in a lot of partys and gambeling.When you win money in gambeling, you receive your sums a bit later. So while waiting for his money, he could have borrowed some from a swiss merchant. 

The second topic was his connection with the french writer Voltaire. In his memoir Chevalier wrote down detailed conversations with him. The text is very sceptical about the accuracy of these conversations because his memoire was written ages after theseconversations happened. How could he remember them in such detail? Did he invented a lot of it? The audio on the other hand says, that he kept a diary, in which he captured conversations like the ones he had with Voltaire. So when he wrote his memoir, he could just grab his old diarys and copy from them. 

The last but certainly not least topic was his escape from a prison in Venice. In his memoir Chevalier claims to have escaped it by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb trough the roof. The text thinks, that a lot of this is invented to make his escape sound more exciting. Chevalier had many friends in politics so it would have been likely that one of them got him out of there. The audio on the other hand says, that shorty after his escape, the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired. This evidence was found in the record of Venice, If he hadn't escaped like he said inthe memoir, why had they had the ceiling repaired?
