In the presentation the woman explains that the Chevalier's memoire is possably accurate.
 It is said that the Chevalier spent large summs of meoney in switzerland and had to borrow money from a merchant.
the professor explains that the chevalier had to sell his belongings to get to his wealthyness. He needed to borrow money from the merchant because the goods for money transfer took a couple of days back then. She also states that the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire were documented so accuratly in the memoire because of notes taken by the Chevalier during the conversation. The last statement explains the Chevaliers prison brake out of a venetian prison.
According to the memoire the Chevalier broke out trough teh roof. And the proof was that documents revealed that the prisons roof hsd to be repaired shortly after the escape.

The difference betwene the presentation and the text is that the text criticises the Chevalier's memoire of being historicly inaccurate.
The text states that the Chevalier was extremly poor as opposed to weathly as he rote in his memoire and had to borrow money from a swiss merchant.
The text also sais that it's impossible for a person to remember conversation word for word for many years, which was the time betwene the conversation with Voltaire and the publishing of the memoire. <<according to the text it is also more likely that the Chavelier bribed a prison guard to break him out as opposed to climbing through the roof. The bribe and the statement by the text that the Chavelier was poor counterdict eachother though which is why i think the presentation is more accurate.
