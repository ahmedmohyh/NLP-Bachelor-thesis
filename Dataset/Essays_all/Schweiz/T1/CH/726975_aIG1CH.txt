Chevalier lived in the eighteenth century and he is known for his memoir which recounts his life. That memoir is the reason why we now that much about the eighteenth century. But critics raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir.

 One of the main advantage is that Chevalier lived in Switzerland and he was very rich but it seems that he has borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But on the other hand it's said that he was pour. An other advantage is that he critics aren't sure that a human can rewrite everything exactly like it was said a few years ago. But other people say that he wrote everything down as soon as he heard something interessting that his friend Voltaire said. In advantage it's questioned about his escape from the prison in Venice, Italy. Chevalier himself told that he escaped by using a piece of metal to get throught the roof. Some people say that he just wrote this to make his life more interessting because he had some well-connected friends in Venice who could helped him. The other text tells us something different. There it's said that he wrote that he has some friends who helped him but it could not be because other people who wantet to escape from this prison had bigger friends than him and couldn't get off of it. And later the ceiling of the prison had to be reconstructet. So it's possible thad he used something to make a hole throught the ceiling.

In conclusion, both textes are interessting but not very thruthfully.
