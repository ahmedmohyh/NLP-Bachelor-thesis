Text and presentation about Cheavlier 
First I want to talk about the living in switzerland. In  the text they say that he's live in switzerland was very wealthy and that he had spent a great deal of money on parties and gamling. In the essay they say that he borrowed considerable sums of money from  a Swiss merchant and that this is the evidence that he had not so much money. But in the presantation they say that he was rich and he borrowed the money from the merchant to make buissnes. He used the money like a bank credit and gave it back.

Chevalier and Voltaire
In his memoir he has a lot of zitates from the conversation between him and Voltaire. In the text they write that it isn't possible to keep such zitates in his mind for such a long time. They say this because he wrote his memoir years after the conversation between him and Voltair.
But in the presentation the woman says the zitates are correct because he wrote them down every night after the conversations

Chevalier's escape from the prison
The autor of the text says it is very unlikely that Chevalier escaped from the prison in Venice all by his own. He says that Chevalier had powerfull politically friends in Venice and that they said to the jailers "let Chevalier free"
In the presentation they believe Chevalier that he escaped from the prison by his own. They believe that because they have textual evidence whitch says that the day after Chevalier escaped from the prison they had to repair the hole.
