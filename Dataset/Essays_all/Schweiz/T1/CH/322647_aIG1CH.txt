It is said that the memoirs of the Chevalier could not be correct. In the text it is said that he met many celebrities and he went to many parties. Maybe they invented many events to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous as it is actually. He also was not wealthy at all. But in the presentaiton was said, that he gave all the money for his parties, so when he ran out of cash he had to borrow some. It doesn`t mean he's poor. 
It is also said that the Chevalier escaped from jail in Venice. This story is made to make the whole thing adventurous and more enjoyable for reading. He could have a number of politically well-connected friends so they offered a bribe. The presentation told us that many man had well-connected friends so it is not new. Everything is built on illegal actions so the society can't do anything against it.
