The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the 18th century, is often claimed to be distorted or not accurate in order to make his life more interesting than it actually was. According to Chevalier he was very wealthy while he was living in Switzerland which means that he partied and gambled a lot. And while it has been found out recently that he had to borrow huge sums of money this doesn't mean, that he couldn't have been wealthy. His property first had to be changed to money he could spend and this procedure took its time. And during the wait he had to borrow money from other people.
Another argument to question the credibility of his memoir were the conversations with Voltaire. There is no way someone could write down an exactly accurate conversations years after the actual meet. While this is true other sources tell that he wrote everything down in the nights after the conversations which means that they can be really accurate.
And even the story of him escaping a prison in Venice without the help of powerful politicians can be true if you trust other sources who thell that other prisoners had way more powerful friends and that the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired after his escape.
