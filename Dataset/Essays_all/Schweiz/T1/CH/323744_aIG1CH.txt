The first point that the critics are skeptical about is why the Chevalier borrowed money while he was in Switzerland. The reason is that even if he was very wealthy he did not always have access to his money, since a lot of the wealth existed in form of property. So instead of waiting he borrowed cash from his friends until he could get money out of the properties he owned and pay the money back. 
Appart from that critics also have doubts about the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire, they seem too detailed for that the memoir were written a long time after the coversations occured. But it is important to know that Chevalier did take notes about the conversations and used them while writting his memoire to remember the conversations.
Another thing critics are unsure about is the story of Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice, even if there exists documents that prove that the ceiling in Chevalier's room had to be repaired after he got out of it. In his memoire he mentiones how he escaped by making a hole in the prison ceiling. Appart from that another thing proves that Chevalier did not lie about the escape since there were other people in prison withmuch better connections then him who couldn't bribe  the jailers to get free.
