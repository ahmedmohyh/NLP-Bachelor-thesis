In the text the critics say that he couldn't have been wery rich because he had to borrow money. Otherwise in the presentation it was said that even the wealthiest man has to borrow money. If he sells property to get more money or for a bank account. Also in the text it was said that he had friends who bribed him free from prison. But in the same prison there were men with friends with much more inflouence and they were not able to bribe them free. And after his escape they had to fix the roof. And why should they fix the roof if there wasn't a hole in there were he could have escaped trough? The text also says that the conversations with voltair are fake because he never showed them before he wrote his memoires. But friends of him said that he kept them away from soceiety ond wrote them down after every conversation they had in the evening. The presentation says that nearly every argument the critics have is wrong and they have good reasons. So I think they're right.
