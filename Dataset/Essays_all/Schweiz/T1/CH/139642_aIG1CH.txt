Chevalier de Seingalt had written a long memoir recounting his life. But is everything what he'd written true?
There are 3 facts in the text: Chevalier had maybe distorted or invented many things. When he was in Switzeland, he'd claim that he's very rich. But he had borrow a lot of money from other people. In the presentation they've said that if you'd like to be rich, you must sell something. So waiting for money doesen't mean poverty. Another fact is that Chevalier had written his conversations with Voltaire many years later. So he can't remember everything in detail. In the presentation they've said that he'd took notes while writing his memoir and that the conversation must be true.
The third fact is that Chevalier had escaped from prison in Venice. He claims that he had escaped by using a piece of metal. But maybe Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. In the presentation they've said that the people had have to repear his chamber in the prison. So his story could be true.
So what is the truth? We don't know.
