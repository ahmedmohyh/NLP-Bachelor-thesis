a lot of things can be told about Chevalier. the more interesting question is much more wether it is all true, or if he invented stories to his memoires.
The arguments vary a lot. Take, the prison. People say he would not have escaped because of his politically powerful friends on the outside (he had no need for that). The counterargument is old proof on paper from venice. 

The audio semms to try to convince one, that he really did all those things, but the text raises more questions about his realiability. Overall, in memoires it is obvious that people tend to talk things better than they actually are, he writes down the things he himself would like to remember and maybe not for other people. 
Chevalier borrowing money however, does indicate that he did, indeed, not have as much money as belived. on the other hand he could have been a victim of inflation or he spent it all on something else.
 
Many texts fom the 1700s are hard to translate. not because of the language, much more because of the way the wrote, the manner of speaking back then
.
Voltaire is still a well known person today and i do belive Chevalier wrote down the things they talked about nicer. But there would be no reason for him to lie about ever seeing him. Like mentioned before, he had very powerful friends, so he would not need to lie about meeting him. 

the audio is really very different from the text. it seems like apparently the person talking on the audio believed almost everything and the person who wrote the text sat down with more questions rather than answers. 

this shows how much questions can be raised in different texts/audios and how hard it is to relativate which are true and which have been made up.
in conclusion we now at least know how he lived his life and some interesting facts about voltaire. although it also makes one think how many lies we are actually getting taought in our history lessons.
