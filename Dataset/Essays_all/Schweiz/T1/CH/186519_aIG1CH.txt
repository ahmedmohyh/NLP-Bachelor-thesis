In the text is written about some famous persons and also the speaker told us something about famous people who wrote memoirs. But in the text it is more written from Chevalier as a person, like he wrote memoirs and tne speech it is more generally about memoires. He told us about some aspects like first: In Swizerland are organised a lot of parties, like Chevalier did.Twice he told about conversations with Voltaire the famous writer. It is not clear if Chevalier met Voltaire or not. But the speaker said that Voltaire wrote memoires. And if we compare the text with the speech Chevalier wrote memoires like Voltaire did. And in both, the speech and the text it is about the memoires who are also critizised, because memoires are not even perfect.
