The Chevalier de Seintgalt was a swiss person who has written everything he could remember. So he wrote a long memoir of his life and adventures and about meeting famous people he met in the 18th century. It was said that the Chevalier has spent a huge amoung of money into his wealthy life and parties to seem more glamorous than he really was. 
There was also the rumour that the Chevalier was poor and borrowed money from people to get as wealthy and famous as he was. On the other hand people say that he wasn't poor. They say he had to sell and invest money in this life first to get to a succcess so he borrowed money from others while he was waiting for his own money to arrive. 
Once he was in a prison in Venice where he escaped later. Some people found it strange that soon after he escaped his own room has been repaired.
Critics are still sceptical about the accuracy of his memoir.
