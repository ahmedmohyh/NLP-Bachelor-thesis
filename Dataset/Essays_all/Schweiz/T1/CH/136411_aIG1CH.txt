The presentation just heard states that the memoirs of the Chevalier are indeed accurate, other than the text who says they are wrong,  and a very important source for historians to learn about the history in the 18th century. Other than the text, the presentation gives some very good reasons to believe the memoirs are true.
They say that while in Switzerland the Chevalier was a rich man, he just had to sell his property in order to afford the parties and his gambling, while waiting for his money to arrive he had to borrow money from the merchant. The text says that the Chevalier was not rich since he had to borrow money without a good reasoning. The text also doubts that The Chevalier could remember all his conversations with Voltaire so accurate, but sources, quotet in the presentation, say that he always took notes during his meetings with Voltaire, this statement is enforced by relatives and friends who said that the Chevalier often consulted his notes when talking about Voltaire. Finally the text says that the Chevalier is lying about his prison escape in Venice, they say he must have bribed the jailers to free him but on the other hand the presentation tells us what is more likely to be the case, which is that the Chevalier escaped just like he tells in his memoirs, because he wasn't the most influential person in prison and there is no evidence that jailers were bribed during that time, but there is evidence that the ceiling of the Chevaliers prison cell had to be repaired after his escape.
