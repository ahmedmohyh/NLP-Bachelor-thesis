The Chevalier de Seingalt

The Chevalier de Seingalt met many famous people during his life and at the end of it he wrote a long story about his adventures for his wife. His memories are very important for the knowleg we have about de European society in the eighteenth century. However, his stories don't tell really the truth. Many critics say he invented or changed a few events to make them more interessting.
Firstly, the Chevalier tells that during his time in Switzerland he was very rich. This isn't really the truth, then he wasn't poor at all, but also not rich. It is known that he spend a lot of money in parties and gambling, but the money he used for this wasn't alwys him. Often he borrowed the money from a Swiss merchant.

Secondly, The Chevalier affirms that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. Critics have never doubt that they met and conversade, but it is prouved, that's impossible to remember exactly the whole phrases from the conversation wich they held many years erlier as the Chevalier wrpte the memoir.

To conclude, also the story about the escaoe from the notorious prison in Venice don't seems really possible. The Chevalier affirms, he escaped by using a piec of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics are very skeptical about this memory. The Chevalier had very politically well-connected friends during this time in Venice and it is more likely that they helped him tu leave the prision maybe offering him a bribe. 

His stories may are very enjoyable to read, but we have also to reconiced tath they can't really always be trough.
