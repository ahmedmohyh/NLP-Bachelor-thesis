"Mermoirs can't always be reliable or accurate, but that of Chevalier is" says the women in the audio. This first sentence stays in contrast to the text above. The text implies that Chevalier was adding more events to his memoir or making his events bigger in his mermoir that it gets more entertaining to read. In the audio the women brings up some arrguments that give the events their correctness. For example is in his trip to switzerland it is said that he spent a lot of money for parties and stuff, she also thinks thats true because he had some valueable belongings which he sold and out of this money he invested the parties. The arrgument of the text says that he was poor and had to take credits from the swiss banks. She reclaims thet it may take a few days to sell his belongings so he took credits for the time of selling. 
In the text it is said that Chevalier wouldn't have escaped the prison in Venice because he had good contacts with much power on the outside who could easily gotten him out of prison so he didn't had to make this effort of escaping by breaking his ceiling. She reclaims that arrgument and states that after Chevalier escaped the prison of venice they had to renew the ceiling in his cell what also has been written down in the files. 
The third critic on the memoir of Chevalier in the text is the conversations between Voltaire and Chevalier. This is underlined with the Arrgument that Chevalier composed these conversations after several years into a text and he could have never memorized the exact words that were given. The women counters that there were many notices which Chevalier composed each evening after he spoke to Voltaire. This has also been said by many people which stood close to Chevalier.
