In the presentation and the text the memoire written by the Chevalier gets a lot of critics and doubt.
They mention three points that are not true. The first one is that he spent a lot of money while living in Switzerland but still had to borrow money. In the presentation they did not say anything about the possibility that the Chevalier might have wanted to make his life look more exiting. But they said that he would not have needed to borrow money if he really was as wealthy as he said. 

Second they mentioned the coversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire.  The text says that the conversations are not accurate because he has written it many years after so he could not remember it properly. There is nothing said about this in they presentation. In fact they said that he wrote down everything he could.

The last point is the escape from the prison. While in the presentation it is said that there were other people who had more friends who could have helped them to escape, the text says that he had several well-connected friends who could have offered him a tribe. So we do not really know if he did have friends to help him or not.
