Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798 gathered his experiences and adventures in a memoir which has lead many critics to question the accuracy of its contents, questioning wether it may be seen as an historical source. According to the audio report Chevalier spent a lot of money during his stay in Switzerland. He spent the money on parties and gmabling, he spent such incredible amounts in fact, that he occasionally had to convert his assets,back home, into money. Whilst waiting for his money to arrive he borrowed some from a wealthy merchant to continue living his excessive lifestyle. In the text these actions are interpreted as evidence for the fact that he might not have been as wealthy as he claimed to be. Critics also expresssed their doubts when it comes to the conversations with voltaire that Chevalier included in his memoir. the audio report claims that chevalier wrote down their conversations in journals, in order to use them years later to write the memoir. in the text the authenticity of these conversations are questioned, doubting he remembered the exact phrases voltaire exchanged with him. the reliability of the memoir is confirmed again in the audio report when theressaid to be evidence taht chevalier in fact did escape the prison because Venetian  records show that theroof had to be repaired. the text  although expresses that him bribing the guards is way more likely.the audio report then contradicts this by saying that not even more pomerful people in theprison whereable to bibe the guard.Is his memoir a reliable source? You may decide for yourself.
