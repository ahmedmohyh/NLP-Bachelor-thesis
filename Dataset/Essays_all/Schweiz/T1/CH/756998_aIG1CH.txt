The text and the presentation both talk about the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt and their accuracy.
The text discusses the controversity of the memoirs saying, that Chevalier made everything seem more exciting and glamorous than reality. Onthe other hand the presentation states that the memoirs of Chevalier were indeed accurate.
( Due to issues withmy headphones I wasn't able to hear the first part of the argumentation.)

While the text states that it is strange that Chevalier was able to remember his cenversation with Voltaire in such great detail, the presentation says that it believed that Chevalier always took notes during conversations and that therefore there is no reason to assume that this part of his memoirs is inaccurate. 

Another controversial part in his memoirs is him talking about his escape of the Venitian prison. The text suggests that this seemed too adventurous and that it were more likely that Chevalier bribed the jailers to free him. However in the presentation it is pointed out, that bribery is unlikely because there were much more powerful people in prison who failed to leave it. Also there was a hole in the ceiling of Chevaliers prison cell and there would be no other reason than an escape for such a hole.
