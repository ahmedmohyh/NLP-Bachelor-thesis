Chevalier

The spoken presentation explanined the critics. I write about the commons and differences in the text above and the recently heard presentaion.
For example to the critic which was first mentioned in the text. They said, that it was normal, that people had to wait until they got their money. But this has nothing to do with poorness. It was normal, that even wealthy people had to wait. And during this periode of time it was also normal to borrow some money from someone else.
The essay above critics also the conversation with Voltaire. Because he wrote about this conversation years after it has happened. In the spoken presentation the woman said, that he had make some notes for himself to remember the conversation when he wants to write about it.
And the last point which get criticised in the text is his breakout of a prison in Venice. Also about this point the spoken presentation explains what really happened. They got the information of this notorious prison in Venice that they had to fix the ceiling in the room in which Chevalier was. And why should they have fix the ceiling when not because of Chevalier?
Finally, history stays history because we will never know exactly what happend at this time.
