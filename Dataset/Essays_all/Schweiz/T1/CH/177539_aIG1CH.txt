The presentation says that Chevaliers memoir was a relayable resource but it couldn't be as correct as they assume in the text. In the presentation they put a few examples. Firstly when he was in Switzerland he wasn't wealthy as the text says and he wasn't poor at all, he just wasted huge amounts of money for parties and gambling. And at the time when he had to wait for more money to arrive he had to borrow it, but of course he would pay the one who borrowed him money back. Secondly the presentation says that it is true that he often talked to the famous writer Voltaire and so says the text but in the presentation they tell you that each night Chevalier wrote down everything and kept his notes for a long time. Later his family members and friends said that he regularly took notes and kept them. What not to forget is the escape from the prison.There the presentation hardly disagrees with the text because others in the prison had even more powerful friends than him, but not even they were able to escape and later they found out written in the venice government documents that the ceiling where Chevalier was kept in had to be repaired and that was what helped him to escape.
