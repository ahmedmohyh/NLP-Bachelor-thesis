First, they talked about the fact mentioned in the text that he was poor just because he borrowed money while he stayed in Switzerland. According to the audio  there is no evidence for this. Chevalier had wealth but he had to sell stuff before he could get his money. So while he was waiting for the money to arrive, he just borrowed some of a swiss merchant in order to spend it for parties and gambling. 
After that, they talk about the conversations in the audio. They say Chevalier took notes right after the conversation with Voltaire about all he could remeber. This notes he kept until years later so he could use them to write his memoir. People confirmed he wrote journals with notes. So it should have been possible for him to write about his conversations. This speaks against the theory that he would not have been able to remember exact phrases from the conversation with Voltaire.
Last, they mentioned his escape from the prison. There had been other prisoners with far more connections to political important people. They did not got out, so why should Chevalier? There is another evidence who supports Chevaliers story. An old document from Venice says that the ceiling of Chevaliers cell had to be repared after he left. There would not have been a reason to do that if he got out through an offered bribe.
