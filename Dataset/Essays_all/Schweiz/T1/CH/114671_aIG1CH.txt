Chevalier was a person who wrote about his life in his memoires. He had many politiacal connections and he has been used a a source for European history.
The text about him holds a position of critique against him. It criticizes the accuracy of the events written because he could have changed the events he experienced to make them seem more exciting than is really was. The presentation on the other hand, talks about the validity of his memoires and uses other sources to validate Chevaliers memoires.

Chevalier wrote in his memoires about his conversations with Voltaire. It is brought up that his memoires were written many years after the conversations had been held. But the presentation says that Chevalier held notes after his conversations, with contemporary witnesses to confirm that he had been taking notes to refer to in his later memoires.

In Chevalier's memoires it is also said that Chavalier once escaped from a notorious prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling. The critics however say that Chevalier may have used his political aquaintances to free himself.
The presentation says that in the prison in Venice held other captives with even more powerful connections, but these captives couldn't be bribed out.
And there also are notes held, saying that there were in fact holes found in the roof of the prison in Venice.




Due to technical difficulties, I was unable to gather any information from the first 30 seconds of the presentation.
