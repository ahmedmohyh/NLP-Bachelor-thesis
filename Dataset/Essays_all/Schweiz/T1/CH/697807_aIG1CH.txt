So it's proofed that no memoir can't be correct. Everybody forgets parts of an event and changes it, mostly by accident. But the Chevalier meant he could remember everything and made notes. He had an interesting life, because he knew a lot of famous people, for example Voltaire. Always after a meeting with him, the Chevalier wrote everything down he could remember. Also witnesses confirmed that he made a lot of notes. The Chevalier de Seingalt claimed that he was very wealthy while living in Switzerland. But in the presentation they said it took a few days till he was a wealthy man. He borrowed money and then he could organise all these parties. The Chevalier claimed that he escaped with a piece of metal by making a hole in the ceiling. But critics meant he only claims that, because it's a better story to tell the world. So they mean he escaped by his friends, but the other prisoners had more friends than the Chevalier so they would have escaped before the Chevalier did. Also the hole in the ceiling that had to be redone after the Chevalier escaped is a confirmation how he flew.
