They became best friends and stayed together all the time. So they organised slumber partys, pool partys, shopping trips and more.
One of those slumberpartys was legendary and they danced all night to the best song ever. They knew every line but now they can't remember. In school the were called It-girls and every other girl wanted to be like them. Rose and Rave had everything you wanted in college.The hottest boys, the most stylish clothes, and much more. They just lived there lifes and not thought about what the others think of them cause they had eachother and that was the only thing they needed. But now in 2016 Rose and Rave realised what the school meant with the words "for special teenagers" and they couldn't believe they thought it was positive. But it was a psychiatric clinic and by the time they realised they only wanted to get away from there. They made a plan and nobody can stop them.
One week later they were sitting at the beach of Hawaii. They were drinking cocktails and eating toast hawaii. Rose and Rave just feel right and everything is perfect. They don't think about what could happen in the future than their time is yet. They want to live while they're young like those other young wild girls. They want to live a normal life and never look back and when the fall the will fall together.
