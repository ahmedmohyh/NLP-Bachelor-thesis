The Person holding this heard presentation was pretty convinced, that everything in the memoir was actually true. She was criticing critics and stating a lot of  facts.
For example, It is well known that  the Cehevalier was holding a lot of parties and liked to gamble a lot. There for he needed money. As of the accusation he'd borrowed money and wouldn't have had to, were he actually rich, she explained, that because of his job he had to wait for the money. So when he ran out of it, he borrwoed some. And borrowing means beeing able to give it back someday.
Further she explained, that it would not have been possible for him to bribe himself out of prison, since there were other rich and even more influenceal people in this prison and they didn't get out. Also after he left, they had to repair his cell, which would not have been nesessary had he simply paid his way out.
As for remmembering conversations from years ago she exclaimed, that it was known, that he often talked to old friend of that time and asked them for notes of their conversations.
