In the text it's said that Chevaliers memoires, even though overall an interesting historical soure, due to his acquaintances with important leaders of the time, are most likely to consist of many fictional passages. The hearing part agrees  that memoires are never totally accurate but has three main counterarguments. First they discredit the texts evaluation of chevalier lying about his wealth in Switzerland and state that it was very possible to be rich and nevertheless have to borrow money, because he just couldn't sell his riches fast enough. The text argues that it's impossible tonremember conversations to the word after all these years and the presentation takes the point but shows up that Chevalier used to write down the conversation the evening he had them. So he could have remembered them quite well. The third point the text uses to raise doubt about the non-fictional charakter of Chevaliers memoires is his escape out of prison by "using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof . They think that he was much more likely to have had a friend who bribed one of his guards. The presentations counterargument is that in said prison many prisoner had much more influental and wealthy friends thn Chevalier and none of them escaped. Also and more imprtantly they found a document stating that Venetia had to pay the repair of the roof of Chevaliers former cell after his escape.
