Chevalier de Seingalt

Chevalier is famous for his long memoir, in which he describes his spectacular life. Although, critics blame him for having invented or distorted a lot of events. 

Take for example the memoir of his escape out of prison in Venice. Chevalier says that he used a metallic tool to make a hole in the ceiling to escape through the roof. Critics claim, that an escape through the roof is very unlikely. But there are very old documents that prove, that the ceiling had to be repared. So why would have to be repared, when he didn't broke out there?

Another claim is, that he has invented the conversation with Voltaire. There are enough evidents, that they have met and spoke with each other. But critics are sceptical about the accuracy. They say, it is impossible to write down the conversations many years afterwards. Though, some friends witnessed how he wrote down every conversation the same evening. 

The third thing criticals argue is, that Chevalier invented his wealth in Switzerland. In fact, they have evidence of him borrowing a large sum of money. But funnily it turned out, that borrowing money was normal in those times. They first needed to invest the money to then get it back in even higher sums. 

So in the end, everything makes sense, but we will never know what had happened for real and what Chevalier de Seingalt had invented.
