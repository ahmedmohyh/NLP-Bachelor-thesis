The Chevalier de Seingalt lived in 1725-1798. He was a very famous person and he was a controversial figure. Often he met famous people and he was the king of the land. All this happend in the 18th. Centuary. Later he organised events which also show how famous and well he is. After that he lived in switzerland where he was very wealth and rich. His life was valuable and no one other was so rich as he was. The Chevalier spent a lot of money into switzerland and so the hole land blew up. Later he came into a prision and then he escaped from it. Then he reapirs a sailing. 

This is a little bit strange how it seems here. First is the chevalier very rich and later he came into prison. Later he had enough money to spend it into another country and  do something well for this country. Then he also escaped from the prison while he is a famous person and so he had a bad image to the others. And also the way he escaped is not so good for him. He thinks its a good idea this way he have choosen how he could escape. So the other persons think now something bad about him. The Chevalier is also like a ,,false freind'' when he had friends in Venice and did something well for other countries. He had a bad connection to the others and now he give a bad image of him. Its not very comfortably of him and for the others. In fact he did a bad thing for himself and for the country.
