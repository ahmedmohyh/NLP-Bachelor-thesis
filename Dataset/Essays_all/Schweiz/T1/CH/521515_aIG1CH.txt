Those people in the listening said he was not poor. He spent a great deal of money of parties and gabmling and after the partieys he hasn`t got enough money. In the reading part they said that he was poor because he had to borrow money. But according to the listening he just had to wait for hes money ao he wasnt`t poor at all. The second arguement is the memory of the conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. Those in the text said it is not possible that the Chevalier can remeber the hole conversation, because his memories were written many years after the conversation. The people in the listenig said that he worte down some notes during the conversation. The last doubt is the escape from a notoriuos prison. They in the reading part don`t believe in his escape by using a piece of metal, they though he had good friends who coud have offered a bride. But that isn`t true according to the listening, he had some friends who are politically well-connectet but a lot of other prisoner had that too and noone reach the target. And after his escape they had to repair his seeling in the prison.
The people in the reading part are critics and they in they in te listening believe in all of his stories.
