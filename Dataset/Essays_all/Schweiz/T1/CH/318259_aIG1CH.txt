So the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures. But there are some  different informations because of this the critics had some doubts. For example it is not true that Chevalier was a rich person it only looked like he was a rich person. But the truth is that Chevalier borrowed money from rich humans or he spent a lot of money on gambling. In the text they say that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire wasn't exactly how Chevelier wrote down because he wrote the conversation many years after they talk to eachother. But what I heard was that Chevalier wrote drown the conversation straight after they met. His escape from the prison is quite myterious. The text says that Chevalier had a number of politically well-connectede friends wich helped him to escape but in the presentation they mentioned that there were other prisoner wich had better contacts than him so how shouls Chevalier could escaped and the others couldn't? Well the Critics are sure about how he escaped because there was ah whole in ceiling and that was the way he get out of de jail.
