The memoir written by the Chevalier is criticised in many points, for example because it was not possible to remember a conversation he had with Voltaire a couple years ago. But a lot of people confirmed he had taken notes while talking with people, so he does not have to remember everything. Another point is the escape from a prison in Venice, wich some think he did brib the jailers to free him, although other prisoners with connections to people with higher powers were not able to escape like this. Of course not every memoir is perfectly correct, but some say the one of the Chevalier is pretty accurate. To throw a lot of parties and do gambling he of course needed a lot of money and if he didnt have this money because he had to wait for it to arrive due to his buisness, hed had to borrow money, wich does not mean that he is not wealthy. 
Another point is that he gained a lot of attention because of his memoir and people then begin to be jealous because of his fame, so they are questioning everything he did in his life and if it is correctly written down in his memoir. But according to a bunch of people it was one of the most truly written memoirs existing. Also the fact that he took notes while listening to other people makes his memoir even more exact. To sum things up, nobody is sure wether his stories are 100% true or if some things were completly new invented, but the story of his life ans his adventures is pretty much how he had lived.
