Chevalier de Seingalt, born in 1725, has written a controversial memoir about his life and adventures. There are lots of different perspectives about that essay. While some say that it's invented a lot and lots of things never actually happened just to make his life more entresting than it actually was. On the other hand, There are people who belive the things that Chevalier did and have an explanation for the criticised passages as well. 
Chevalier claims, that while he was living in Switzerland, he had loads of money and spend a lot of it on gambling and parties. That fact is proven. But the more interesting fact is, that the money was mostly borrowed by a Swiss merchant and isn't really his own. The supporter of Chevalier consider, that he had invested in things but the money in cash wasn't there. His whole money was in the investments. That means, that he was indeed rich but to get to money instantly, he had to lend it from merchants because it takes time to sell investments and actually get to the money. 
The second controversial episode in Chevalier's memoir is the part, where he has conversations with the famous writer Voltaire and claims to be able to remember all the conversations they had. But some say that he has made notes while having these conversations and actually used them afterwards. Well, thats what other people said about him.
The 3rd and last controversial part is the part with the escape from the jail in Venice. He claims, that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling of his cell and then escaping over the roof. While critcs claim that the jailers bribed to free him because of his politically well-connected friends, the supporters say that after his escape, the prison cell had to undergo a renovation on the ceiling. And that could possibly be because of the hole he had made there.
