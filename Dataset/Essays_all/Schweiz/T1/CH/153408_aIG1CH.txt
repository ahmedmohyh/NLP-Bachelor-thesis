The chevalier and especially his memoir is a much debated and controversial subject which historians and critics don't really agree on.

The presentation just heard mentions that no memoir was ever correct in every detail so there shouldn't be a too high need for accuray in memoirs. Additionally it says that the Chevaliers memoir is actually quite accurate. This is controversal to some critics of the chevalier which have critised exactly the accuracy. 

Furthermore the presentation said that the Chevalier wasn't actually that poor and that he was wealthy and spent money on gambling. It was just that it sometimes took a couple of days to convert for example land they had into money and that ist why he had to borrow money. So again it disagrees with the text. which questioned the wealth of the Chevalier.

To mention also his conversations with voltaire and their accuracy in the memoirs : the debation heard mentions that the Chevalier wrote down every evening what he talked about with Voltaire. And when he wrote his memoir he consulted his notes and journals. Again this is controversal to the text. The text argues that it isn't possible to remember exact phrases from conversations many years later. However the text just leaves out the informaiton that he took notes on the conversations he had with Voltaire.

Finally the Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice. The presentation states that it could have been that the Chevalier actually escaped through the roof and not by bribing. Firstly because other prisoners had way more connections in Venice but none of them was ever able to escape and secondly because after his escape the ceiling of his old room had to be repared. So again this is the opposite of what the text said that he had many politically well-connected friends who could have offered a bribe to the prison.
