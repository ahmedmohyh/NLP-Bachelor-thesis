But Chevaliers memoir has some critics who have doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. For example, when Chevalier was living in Switzerland he had spent much money for partys and gamling. But at the same time he had to borrow money because he spent to much, even thougt everyone thinks he`s very rich. Some critics also questioned about his life during the prison time in Venice, Italy. In His memoir he claims to escapend from the Venetian prison. But in fact at exactly this day when chevalier escaped, the officers in the Prison had to make someting in his cage.

So the Chevalier memoir is very discused someone belifes in him and others won`t.It`s up to you to belive it or have doubts about it.
