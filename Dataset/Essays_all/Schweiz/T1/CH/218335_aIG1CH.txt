Chevaliers memoir is a bit mysterious. There are two different beliefs of what is true and wrong about his life and adventures.
First, Chevalier lived in Switzerland for a while and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling there. Apparently he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. According to the text, this makes clear he wasn't as wealthy as we think he was. But we also heard that there is proof that the Chevalier-family spent a lot of their money in Switzerland. Most probably he just had to wait for his money from the bank for a few days, and borrowed some until then.
The next mysterious thing about his memoir is his conversation, he surely had, with the famous writer Voltaire. Critics complain that the accuracy of such a conversation is not possible. One can not remember so many details of a conversation that happend years ago. But who sais he didn't use notes to reconstruct the conversation with Voltaire? It was said, that Chevalier often used his notes to rewrite his life in the memoir.
At last, critics also questioned if he actually escaped a notorious prison in Venice. They know about his relations to politicians in Venice and think he was offered a bribe and simply walked out of that prison. But researches tell, that there were other imprisoners which had a lot more impact in Venice. A bribary never was possible so how could Chevalier have managed that? And a funny fact about the prison: His window had to be repared after his escape worked, due to a damage.
