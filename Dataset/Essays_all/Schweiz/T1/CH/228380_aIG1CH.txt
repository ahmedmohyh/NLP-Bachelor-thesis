The lecture is critisising the text. The text talks states that one can not be sure about the truth of many things written in the memoires of the Chevalier de Seingalt and that it might be not such a valuable source. The lecture says, on the other hand, that the Chevalier's memoires can nonetheless be treated as quite reliable. She takes the three examples from the text and tries to proof that the Chevalier was right. 

First, the lecturer talks about the wealth of the Chevalier. It is known that he had lots of moneys to spend and that he sold things to get more money. When he didn't get the money early enough, he had to borrow something for an amount of time, but, according to the lecture that doesn't meen he was poor.

Next, she talks about the accuracy of the conversation that the Chevalier had with Voltaire. While the text reassures that we know these conversations existed, he doubts their accuracy because the Chevalier wrote them down many years later. The lecturer states that the Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered from the conversations with Voltaire every night he talked with him. She also says that it is confirmed by reliable sources that the Chevalier often used notes when he wrote his memoires.

Lastly, she states that the Chevailer's descritption of his prison escape might be true because we know that he escaped and that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired right afterwards. Also, the fact that there were people with even more powerful connections emprisoned shows that the probability that the Chevalier would have succeded in bribing the guards is very low, according to the lecturer.
