In the text the writer claims Chevalier's biography to be inaccurate. In the reading on the other hand they prove the opposite. The text says that Chevalier didn't have as much money while living in Switzerland as he said he did because he had to loan a lot of money from banks. Yet in the reading it is eplained that he had just loaned the money for a very short time because he converted assets and had to wait for his money to come back in. 
Also it is claimed that his conversations wih the famous writer Voltaire are inaccurate because he wrote about them years later and he couldn't posibly remember everything exactly as it was.
 But on the other hand in the reading it's mentioned that he always took notes the night after his conversations with Voltaire and wrote down everything about the conversations he could remember. 
And last but not least it's said that he probably bribed the guards to let him out of prison by his politicly well connected friends in Venice, but other prisonmates had way more powerfull connections and they were never able to escape and also the prison had to repair the roof of Chevalier's cell shortly after he claimed to have escaped through a hole he made in the roof. 
So basically in the reading everything that's written in the text is made invaluable because there's always a counter argument for all the facts that are mentioned.
