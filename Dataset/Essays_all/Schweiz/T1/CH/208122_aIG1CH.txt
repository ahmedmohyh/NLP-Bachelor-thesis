Towards the end of life the Chevailier de Seingalt wrote a log memoir recountiong his life and adventures. He became a valuable historical source about European society because he met many famous people. many people clam that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his storry more exciting. His writing is captured in three parts. The first sceptical storry is that he was really wealthy while living in Switzerland. they know that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant but he only did that because he spend all his money on parties and gambling. Critics are also sceptical of the accuray of the conversation he had with Voltaire because the memoir was written many years after the conversations occurred. It could be pssible thet he took right after the conversations some notes with some spesific sentences on it which he later coppied in his text. The last pint which critics have questioned in the memoir is that Chavailier escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. Critics claim that Chevailer's jailers were bribed to free him. In the bills of the prison they found a bill with a price for a new roof of his room. Why would they need a newroof right after his escape if he didn't escaped? 
There are a lot of point for and against the memoir but the memoirit could be true.
