In the text, many points of the memoir that the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote are beeing criticized and the accuracy of it gets questioned. 
The first critique is that even though the Chevalier claimed to be wealthier he borrowed noticeable sumsfrom a Swiss merchant, so they argue that this shows that he was lying about his wealth. But in the presentation they said that he was only waiting for his money to arrive, so he had to borrow money for this timespan to be able to go to fancy parties. 
After that, the author of the text wrote that he doesn't believe that the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier written down in his memoir are accurate.He argues that it passed a lot of time between their actual conversation and the moment he wrote it down, so he is sure that it wouldn't be possible to remember the whole conversation. On the other hand the people from the presentation stated that Chevalier used to take a lot of notes and also wrote a journal. They think that he took some notes after the conversation with Voltaire so he would be able to remember the whole conversation even after some years had passed. It is actually proven that Chevalier lookedat old notes and journals whilest writing his memoir.
Finally the text said thet he lied about his escape from te Venetian prison. Chevalier wrote that he managed to escape by just using a piece of metal to make a holein the ceiling and after that was able to climb through the roof. Critics claim it is more likely that some politically well-connected friends of him just offered a bribe to free them. On the contrary they said in the presentation that there were people in the same prison who had even more powerful friends than Chevalier, but they howeverdid not manage to escape. Ultimately the prison had to repair the ceiling a few days after he managed to flee. So this is kind of  ultimate proof for theactural accuracy of his memoirs.
