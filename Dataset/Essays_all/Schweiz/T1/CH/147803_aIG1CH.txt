Critics claim that the Chevalier was poor because he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. But this is false the Chevalier had been very rich and wealthy. He ran out of money fastly because of partying and gambling so he had to wait until the money came so he had to borrow it from a Swiss merchant during this time.

Others say that the notes from the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire aren't accurate because he rewrote the conversations many years later. Close friends from the Chevalier can confirm that he wrote after every conversations notes so they should be accurate he just gave them out many years later he kept them safely by him.

Critics say that it isn't true that the Cheavalier had escaped through a hole in the ceiling he has made with a piece of metal they say the Chevalier got out by some politically well connected friends who offered a bribe to free him. In the prison other prisoners had better contacts than the Chevalier to get them out and there is even a report from the Venetian government that say they had to repair the ceiling after Chevaliers escape.
