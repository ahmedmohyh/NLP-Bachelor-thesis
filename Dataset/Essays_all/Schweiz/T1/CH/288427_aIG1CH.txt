Chevalier lived from 1725 to 1798 and wrote down a long memoir in which he recount his live and all his adventures. 
Critics have questioned if all this stories are more exiting and glamerous recounted that they really were. In the listinig text they told that Chevalier counted in the memoir that he lived in switzerland and was really poor. But it is doubt that Chevalier couldn't be really poor and that it wasn't necessary to borrow money. When you run out of cash it could also be because you spent a huge mount of money in a person or project I think. But in the text above they say that he spent the money just for parties and gambling. Chevalier also recounted in his memoir about each particular night conversation with Voltaire but he couldn't really know Voltaire. In the text the critics say that nobody can doubt that Chevalier and Voltaire met and conversed. And the last story is about the prison from venice. Chevalier counted that he escaped from the prison but this maked not really sence. The listening text says that there were many other famous people in the prison and nobody have matched to escaped the prison. So the critics are very sceptical. Because really none of them could have bribe of freedom. But the text above says the escape is more 
logical when the well connected friends in venice from Chevalier could offered a bribe for him. So I think the listening text and the writen text have the same opinion and the memoir from Chevalier isn't really true. But they both have different informations about it really was and this informations are just theories and I'm relatively sure that there are more and it's very difficult to find out which ones are the true ones.
