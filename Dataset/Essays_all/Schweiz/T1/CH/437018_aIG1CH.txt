Chevalier de Seingalt is being accused of inventing stories in his memoir and therefore making his memoir inaccurate. However there are logical explanations for his writings.
Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant but in his memoir he's writing about the parties e was throwing at that time. A money loan doesn't mean Chevalier was poor. The resonable explanation is that when Chevalier ran out of cash he had to sell some of his properties. But the cash he got from selling took some time to arrive. Therefore Chevalier had to borrow cash to have money for that moment. 
Another story of his is the conversation he had with famous Voltaire. Critics say that Chevalier would've not been able to remember the details of his conversation after so many years. Chevalier possibly took some notes down right after he met Voltaire and kept those notes for years. Later on he used them for his memoir.
Chevalier explains in his writings how he escaped through the roof from the prison in Venice. He says that just with a piece of metal he cut a hole in the roof and managed to escape. People claim that he probably had help from the other prisoners who later wanted to benefit from Chevaliers powerful collegues. But it was found out that the other prisoners had even more powerful collegues than Chevalier and therefore didn't need to help him. An other evidence is that after Chevaliers escape the roof of the prison in Venice had to be fixed.
