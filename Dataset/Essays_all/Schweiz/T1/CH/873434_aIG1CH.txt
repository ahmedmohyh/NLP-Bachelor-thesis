Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life and all his adventures. This memoir had become a historical source about the society of the European during the 18. century. He met many famous people for example kings and famous writers. But a lot of criticers think, that a lot of the written events are invented, to make his life more interessting, than it really was. For example, Chevalier had to borrow money, when he was living in switzerland, to go to parties and so on. But if Chevalier really have been rich, why did he had to borrow money? An other example are the conversations between Chevalier and and famous people. Criticers think that it is impossible to capture so many details, because the conversations were written many years after they were happen. And finally criticers think, that the escape from a prison in Vendedig just with a piece of metal, was impossible, and such an interessting escape is more interssting for readers to read.
