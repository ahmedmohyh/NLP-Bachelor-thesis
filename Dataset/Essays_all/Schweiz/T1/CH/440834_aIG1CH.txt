The Chevalier lived in the 18th century. Therefore his memoir is a very useful source for historical information. He got critized because of many reasons, telling his memoires had mostly been invented. Obviously nothing can be written the exact way it was if you do not take notes during the whole conversation. When he lived in Switzerland the Chevalier was really into gambling, people who lived with him confirmed that. The fact that he had to borrow money of a swiss merchant is probably true as well. His memoir tells that he had to build and sell things in order to gain money, but naturally building and selling takes time, so he must have got some money in another way. The meeting with Voltaire seems to be real. People that met him during that time confirmed that he had been taking notes every evening. So it is highly possible that he wrote his memoir with those notes. But it is highly impossible to remember the exact words that were spoken during that dialog. When he was writing his memoir he used the texts he had written earlier. The escape out of the prison at Venice is probably the most unrealistic. Many people who were imprisoned there could have escaped in a similar way. Well actually they could even have escaped much easier because they had good relations to people then. A fact that reempowers the story of his escape is that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired. Some critics might be right, but the bigger part seems to be wrong.
