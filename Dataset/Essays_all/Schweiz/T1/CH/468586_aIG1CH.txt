The presentation has pointed out three arguments. 
First, the chevalier borrowed loads of money. In the text it says, no one who is rich need to borrow money. The woman says, it does not mean he is poor. H just borrowed a credit to start up his own business. Nowadays, we borrow money from the bank, in his time he used to borrow money from a swiss merchant.

On the second hand, the conversation between him and the famous writer Voltaire. The text critisises the accuracy of the conversation which was written down a few years after. They do not stick to the point that they lived and talked to each other every evening. According to this, it is possible, that he remembers parts of their conversation even years after.

Last but nout least, the prison. In the text it says, that he had connections to the higher layers of sciety in Venedig. The presentation arguments that the other prisoners would have had better connections and more important, the room had to be repaired after the escape.

To sum up, we do not know if it is true or not, nevertheless it is an exciting story and a good theme for discutating.
