Chevalier had to be very wealth! He often wrote that. It is also known that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. But how should he have been poor if he was able to borrow so much money? No one would lend so much money to a poor gambler. In the text exactely this is a proof that he had to be poor first! Why should he use to borrow sums of money if already was wealthy?
Another argumented point is that the conversation he had with the famous writer Voltaire was actually like he wrote it. Because even though the text was written many years after the conversation the woman is very sure that everything who wrote down was exactelly like it really was because it's told that he took a lot of notes during the conversation. The text though says that a lot about the conversation is made up and he can't know so many details anymore after such a long time.
However, one of the most important questions is: did he really escape from the prison in Venice like he wrote or was he actually just freed by some important politically friends? Even though the text doesn't believe at all in the escape because it had to be impossible to escape in that way and he actually had a lot of important and wealthy friends, the woman in the presentation points out that there were prisoners with much more important friends which also couldn't get free. The escape had to be the only possible way to get out of the prison.
After all, the text writes very negative about Chevalier while the text is very critical.
