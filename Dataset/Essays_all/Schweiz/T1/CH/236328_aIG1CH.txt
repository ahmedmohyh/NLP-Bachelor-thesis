Chevalier de Seingtalt
To compare the given text and the presentation I heared it is important to know which aspect of the text is the one that was analysed in the presentation. The text is a short summary of Chevaliers' life but in the presentation it was all about the critics and how to defend Chevaliers' version of hid life in his memoir. The first point that doubting people made, was that if Chevalier would have been rich, he would not have had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But the presentation brings up the thought that if Chevalier was very much into gmbling and throwing parties. And this coud explain why hehart to get the money. They argue that when Chevalier lost much money and had to pay som people back he hat to get the money very quickly so he borrowed some. Afterwards when some of his belongings and propertys had been converted into cash he coud pay is temporary debths back. Secondly critics dont believe in the accuracy of his dialoges with Voltaire. The other point of view is that Chevalier made notes every evening after he had met Voltaire and talked to him. Thisis proven by som notes he adjusted to his memoirs. And last point of discussion is his escape from a Venetian prison. Critics argue that he wrote his story about him destroying the roof and escaping this way  onely because it would make the stoy more interesting. Accordingly to the he was relesed because of his friends political powers in Venice. But in a report of the Prison there is a remark that his cells' ceiling had to be fixed shortly after his escape. Also it is sayd that other prisoners had more powerful friends than he had, but they were not released. So the way his memoirs tell it the story is more plausible.
