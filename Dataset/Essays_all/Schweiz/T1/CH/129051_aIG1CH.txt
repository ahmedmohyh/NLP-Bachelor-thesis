It goes about a man who lived in the eighteenth century. His name was Chevalier de Seingalt. He has written a memoir recounting his life and adventures. He met many famous people duing that time and at the end he has become a valuable historical source about European society.
One of his critic ponts was in Switzerland. He spent lot of money on parties. But critics argue that he didn't needto borrow money for that because he was very rich.
Another negative point was, that he met Voltaire,but he wrote the memoir many years after the conversation occured. So he couldn't remember everything exactly how  Voltaire it said.
The critics also questioned the escape from a prison in Venice. H Wrote that he escapedwitha piece of metal. But the Critics claim that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him because he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice.
I think that he didn't write the right thing
