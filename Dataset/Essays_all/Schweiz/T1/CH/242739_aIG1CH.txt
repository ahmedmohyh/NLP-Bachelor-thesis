The Chevalier de Seigalt was a historcal figure in the 18. century. He wrote a memoir which was used as a valuable resource for history in the 18. century, because he met many famous people. Some people criticise that he is not enough accurate for historical purposes because, they say, he invented many events to make his life seem more exciting than it was. There are three controversial stories: In his memoir, there is a conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. It`s criticised that he cannot capture these conversations for many years until he wrote his memoir. The second contoversial story is his story with his wealth. He wrote that he spent much money on gambling and parties. But if he really did that, he hadn`t to borrow money from some Swiss merchants. Otherwise he could have been rich and his borrowing of money could have belonged to his strategy to make money. The third controversial story is that he claims to have escaped from a prison in Venice. Critics say he could have be freened by jailers. But there is the question why there is a repait then?
