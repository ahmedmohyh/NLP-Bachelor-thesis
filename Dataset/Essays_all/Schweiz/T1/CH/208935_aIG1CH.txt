In the presentation the woman pointed out that the memoir of Mr. de Chevalier is indeed a very acurate and reliable source of information about history even though in the text they mention that the opposite is the case. In both you read or hear about his stay in Switzerland were Chevalier insists that he owned a lot of money. In the text they critisise that he had just borrowed money. In the listening instead they say that this doesn't mean that he was poor. It just meant that he had been waiting for his money to arrive because his family sold many houses and property there. 
The next point is about his conversation with Voltaire.In the heard text it is said that after their conversaition, de Chevalier had written everything down right away what Voltaire said and then summarised it in his memoir many years later. In the writing it is claimed that this isn't the truth. It is said that he indeed had a conversation with Voltaire but didn't write down anything. When he then wrote his memoir he had just made up many things Volatire should have said.
The last argument is about his escape froma a prison in Milan. It is said that he had escaped the prison in Mlan because there is evidence today, that they had to repair the ceiling of his cell in jail in the listening. In the written text they calim that he had just a lot of influence and bribed the prisond wards to set him free.
