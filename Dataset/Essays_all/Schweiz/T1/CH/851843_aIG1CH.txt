There are differences:

The text says, that first, the chevalier was poor, because he had to borrow money. Second, the notes of his momories aren`t very precise, because he took notes a few years later. Third, there were other prisoners, which had friends outside the prison having more power and were mightier. 
The presentation about the "Chevalier de Seingalt" says the oposite of these thre aspects. More precisely, e.g. they say, he had to lend money, because had waited for his money. His money had still to arrive. Another thing is, witnesses said, that the Chevalier had taken notes regularely. As a result, the memories about the life of the Chevalier are more precise, than descriped in the text. This notes are reliable, says the presentaion guy. However, it`s not sure,whether the text is wright or the prenentation guys. This is the end.
