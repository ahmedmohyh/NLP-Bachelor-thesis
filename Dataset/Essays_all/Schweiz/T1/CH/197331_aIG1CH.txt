The Chevalier de Seingalt ( 1725-1798 ) wrote a  memoire, which has become a valuable historical source. But there are some ponts in the memoire which can't be true, according to critics. It seems that the Chevalier made some of the events, written in the memoire, up to make his life seem more interesting and exciting than it was in fact. 
There were three points mentioned. The first one was that the Chevalier had a lot of money while he lived in Switzerland and he spent it for parties and gambling. But there are some evidences which prove that the Chevalier had to borrow money. According to that he can't have been very whealthy. But nobody has to be poor just because he has to borrow money. Many banks have to borrow money and they almost never are poor. But they have to wait some time before the money arrives and so had the Chevalier.
The second point was that the Chevalier wrote down several conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltair. But they appeared years after they've actually met. But it's possible that the Chevalier wrote them down and kept them without actually showing them to public. There is no doubt that they've actually met and had conversations so why can't he just have kept them for himself for a couple of years.
The third point was that it's impossible that he's escaped from a prison in Venic by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The critics think, that his number of politically well-connected friends in Venice could've offered a bribe. But it is said that just after he escaped that prison the ceiling of the Chevaliers cell had to be repaired. And besides, there were other prisoners which had more powerful friends than he did and they didn't offer a bribe.
