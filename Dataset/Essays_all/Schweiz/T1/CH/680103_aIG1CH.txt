The audio claims that the Chevalier was indeed a wealthy man. Just because he had to borrow money, it doesn't mean he had to be poor. He had a big property in Switzerland and owned very expensive things, yet he had to borrow money for his gambling, because he didn't have enough cash for that. If he hadn't been able to borrow the money, he could have also sold his property for example. 

The Chevalier said he always wrote in his journal after conversations with Voltaire. Therefore, he was able to write the memoir between himself and the writer Voltaire even many years after the conversations accured. Chevalier's friends said as well, he was known for writing journals.

Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice really could have occured the way he said. The prison once recorded a broken ceiling that had to be repared. Furthermore, there were prisoners in that same prison who had many more and better connections than the Chevalier did. None of them were able to bribe the officers in order to escape.
