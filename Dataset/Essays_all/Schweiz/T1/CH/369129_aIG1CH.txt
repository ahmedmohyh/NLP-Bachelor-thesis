I'm going to go through it in a structured way. So first of all I want to focus on the first part of the text. In the text it is said that there are a lot of doubts about the accuracy of the memoir but then again in the listening part the woman said that the memoir is pretty accurate and it is a reliable source. She also said that he did make a lot of parties and gambling so she did agree with this statement. But she also said that he wasn't poor at all. In the text it is written that he had to borrow a lot of money from different people in Switzerland and with this fact the woman also agrees. But she doesn't agree with the statement that he was poor. She said that this was a way of how to get money and how he made it. So he first had to borrow the money then again sell things so he could get money and make even more money of it than he borrowed . 
In the text it is said that he couldn't be able to keep their conversations accurately but the woman said that he wrote every conversation down and everything he could remember of it right after the conversation.So the women also does believe that the conversations which have been written down actually are a reliable source. 
And in the end we talk about the escape of the prison. As we know from the text it is said that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and then climbing through the roof. And that a lot of people critsize this statement and claim that it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. But the woman had here also a argument against it. She said that other people in prison had more powerful friends then he had but they were not able to escape from the prison.
