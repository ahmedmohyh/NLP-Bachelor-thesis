Is Chevailer de Seingalt a liar ?

Chevalier de Seingalt became famous for his long memoir recounting his life. But no memoir is in detail 100% accured. Most critics doubt that the memoir has some weakness in accuracy. Some people believe the storys of the Chevailer.

One Story is that he was very wealthy while he was living in Switezrland and spend a great deal of money. The evidence says that he often borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. Why he should have borrowed money when he had been really rich, thats what the critics claim. Some people say on that time when he waited for the money, which he earned. He borrowed from an Swiss merchant. Second Story that their are doubting is about the Interview with Voltair. They claim that the interview is written in detail that it can't be written years after the Interview was set. It could be that Chevailer wrote down everything he knew right after the Interview and after years he wrote his memoir. The other story is that he says he escaped from the jail only with the piece of metal through the ceiling. The critics say that there were lots of people Chevailer knew who could get him out of jail anytime. It's possible that he could have done that, but people say that there were other people in the jail who had much more powerful friends who could get them out, but it wasn't possible. And after Chevalier escaped from his cell, his cell had to be repaired. Why would they repair a ceiling of the cell when no one should have damaged it?

In conclusion there are many reasons that Chevalier is a liar and invented most of his storys but on the opposite there are good reasons too that he could have wrote the truth.
