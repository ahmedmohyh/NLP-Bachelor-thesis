Chevalier was indeed a very interesting figure. In his live he meet very famous people. But many critics think that  lot of it is a huge fake. 
For exemple, by the time he was in Swiss he clamed, that he had been very rich, but critics say that he got a loan from a Swiss merchant and that all of it is a lie. But in that time it wasn't unusual for wealthy people the get loans, because to get rich they had to sell some of der propeties. And by the time the money arrived, they had run out of money and had to get loans. The conversations that he had with others are real to, because a journal of him was found. He wrote a lot of journal and made a lot of notes. The evening after the conversation with Voltaire, he wrote everything down that they talked about and keept these notes for all those years. Later when he wrote his memoir he could look up all the topics. He also got famous for his prison escape. Critics think, that he had a lot of friends with a big influence and that he only got out through a bribe. But in that time a lot of well known men had been imprisonated and had much more powerful friends and didn't get out of their cells. And after he escaped the prison, the cell that captured him needed a repair, because the ceiling was demaged. This evidence shows that all storys in the memoir could have happened like this. But some of the critics aren't convinced yet.
