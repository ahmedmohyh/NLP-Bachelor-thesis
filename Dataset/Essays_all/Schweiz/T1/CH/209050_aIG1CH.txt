Arguments to the Chevalier de Seingal

It is claimed that the Chevalier was not rich even tho he spent a lot of money in Switzerland since he had to borrow most of it. As said in the listeing one is not immediately poor just because one borrows money. The Chevalier had to borrow money because most of his ownings where houses and one couldt get the monney out of them emmideately. He borrowed money while he did not have any cash and payed it pack once he had cash again.

Critics are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversation that the Chevalier had with Voltaire but wrote down only years later. Witnesses say that he wrote down the conversations every evening and there for also knew years later exactly what had been said.$

Critics have also questioned how Chevailier claimes to be excaped from notorious prison in Venice. They dont belive that he escaped by himself but that people were bribed to get him out. But there were more people with more powerful friends then him in that prison who did not get out and also witnesses said that his seeling had to be repaired after his escape.
