The text and what i heard it's about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798). He was a controversal figure and he wrote at the end of his life about his andventures and his hole life. He lived in the eighteenth century and his memoir had become a historical source. He was a person which met very famous people like kings, writers. But he is famous for his good memoir.
Critics argue that Chevalier wasn't so rich like he always wrote. For example he wrote about his time in Switzerland. He said he was very wealthy then. But Critics speculate that he had borrowed money so he couldn't be very rich. Something i also heard in the text which was spoken, is the conversation with Voltaire. Thats something very comique about. Because Chevalier wrote the text about the conversation with voltaire many years later then the conversation really was. And its impossible that he memorised every phrase so exactlly.
