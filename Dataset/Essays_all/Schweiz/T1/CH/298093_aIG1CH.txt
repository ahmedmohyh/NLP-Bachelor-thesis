Chevalier

In the presentation we first heard the part about money. In the Text it is the second paragraph. Second they mention the conversation with Voltaire and at third the part with the prison. So it is the same like the text. The text has extra an introduction-part.

The Chevalier was very wealthy. He lived in Schwitzerland and had a huge amount of money, so the critics. But in the presentation they began with poor. So they started with an against pole to the Chaveliers life.
