It was told that the Chevalier borrowed money in Switzerland because he was didn't have his own money already. He wasn't poor, he just had to wait for the money he actually had. He just only had it theoretically and not practically. 
About the conversation he was having with Voltaire, it was told that he took notes and wrote even down some exact phrases. It's also told that people have seen him reading some notes while he was writing his memoir. So it's possible that he took notes of the conversation and then used them to write his memoir with exact phrases in it.
That he escaped from prison like he described it in his memoir is also possibly correct. People claim that he wasn't the only imprisoned with powerfull friends, but that there were people with even more powerfull connections. Also, it is reported that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after his escape, and why would they repair the ceiling if it wasn't broken? So it is possible that he actually escaped by making a hole into the ceiling with a piece of metal like he described it in his memoir.
