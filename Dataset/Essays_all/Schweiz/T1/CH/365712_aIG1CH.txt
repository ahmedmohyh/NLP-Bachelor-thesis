Chevalier de Seingalt, a controverisal figur, got a historical source since he met famous people. But there are some critics about the truth of his memoir. They say, that he distorted or invented events to make his life more exciting. One thing is, that while he lived in Switzerland he mentioned that he was wealth and spent a lot of money but he has borrowed some money from a Swiss merchant. So the people who critizise him mean, why should he have to borrow money when he was rich? 
A second thing is, the record of himself and Voltaire. They do not belive that they had realy met each other. They add that it cannot be true because it was written many years after the conversation has taken place.
The third thing is the discussion about his escape from the prison in Venice. He says that he has escaped with using a metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbig through the roof but critics also have the opinion that there were much stroner humans in the prison and they couldnot escape so how should it has been possible for him? They have the opinion that it is more likely that the jailers were bribed to free him becaus he had some well connected politically friends.
