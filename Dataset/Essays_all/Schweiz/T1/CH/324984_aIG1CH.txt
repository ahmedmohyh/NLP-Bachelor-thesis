First of all the woman who was holding the presentation explained that memoirs you keep in mind can`t be correct in every detail. But big events you should remember and so did the Chevalier. Maybe some of the detail are wrong or got forgotten but there`s no doubt that the Chevaliers mind isn`t a historical source. The second point in the womans presentation was about Switzerland. She said if you want to get money, you have to sell something thirst. So borrow money doesen`t mean you`re pour. The Chevalier was wealth but maybe he didn`t have the money but land or something else, that he had to sell first to somebody who payed the price he wanted. 
The third point was about the meeting of the Chevalier with Voltair. Voltair who was very intelligent has met the Chevalier, there`s no doubt about that. The critics are skeptical about the details of the gathering. In the text it says that the text was written many years later and so the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately. But the Chevalier didn`t kept the meeting in his mind, he wrote down every single detail when he was meeting Voltaire and kept these notes for many years. Later he wrote the text about it.
At last there are some doubts about that he escaped out of a prison in Venice with the help of some well-connected friends. The woman says that in the prison there were many people with more well-connected friend and they couldn`t escape at all. But she also says that after he escaped his cell had to be repaired. So why should his cell had to be repaired if he couldn`t escape?
