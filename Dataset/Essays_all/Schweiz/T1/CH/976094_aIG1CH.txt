Just because the Chevalier borrowed money from a merchand it doesen't mean he wasen't rich, because before you can borrow money from a merchand you have to show that you have enough to pay him back and secondly, if he was trading and gambling he wuold have to wait for his money to arrive and during that time he doesen't have to wait untill it arrives, so he just borrows it from a merchand and pays him back after he got the money.
