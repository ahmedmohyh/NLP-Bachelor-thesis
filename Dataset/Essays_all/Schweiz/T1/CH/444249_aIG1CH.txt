In the presentation the speaker compared this memoirs from Chevalier de Seingalt, which are written in the text, with true facts. 
About the story that Chevalier should have been rich while he lived in Switzerland, she said that that do not have to be wrong as the text wants to explain. She said that we know that Chevalier gave a lot of parties while he was in Switzerland, so that could be the reason because he had to borrow money although he was rich.
To the story about the Chevalier and Voltaire conversation she explained that it is true that he wrote the conversation a few years after they had taken place down. However Chevalier said or wrote that the conversations were not complete because he wrote only as much as he could remember.
The story about Chevalier's escape from a notrius prison in Venice, Italy, is in the view of the speaker true. Because they are some incident, like the fact that the ceilings of the prison had to be repaired after his escape and the fact that a lot of other prisonniers had friends with much more influence than Chevalier had, which attest that Chevalier's story about his escape has to be true.
This facts, which tell that Chevalier's stories can be true are not written in the text. Only the arguments, which are not speak for Chevalier are explained in the text. Because of that the text is only telling one side, while the speaker is only telling the other side.
