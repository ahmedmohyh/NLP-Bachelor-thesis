In both the text passage and the spoken text there are three examples mentioned about Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. The text passage says that Chevalier claimed that he had been rich but experts say he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant which means in their opinion that he wasn't rich. On the other hand the spoken text mentioned both of these arguments but said that you need a certain wealth even to borrow money from a merchant. 
The second example mentioned was the meeting of Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. Both texts don't doubt the fact that they met each other but they explain differently if it's possible that Chevalier could remember exact phrases. The text passage says that it's impossible to remember these exact phrases because the memoir was written several years later. But the spoken text says it is true because of his notes, where Chevalier wrote down the conversation with Voltaire. They also claim people of that time could confirm this fact. The last example mentioned is Chevalier's escpae of the Venician prison. Both texts say Chevalier claimed that he made a hole in the ceiling of his room. The text passage highly doubts this fact and says it's way more likely that some friends offered a bribe. On the other hand the spoken texts says Chevalier's claim could very well be true because one could find a document of this prison where they could see that the exact same room had to be repaired after his escape.
