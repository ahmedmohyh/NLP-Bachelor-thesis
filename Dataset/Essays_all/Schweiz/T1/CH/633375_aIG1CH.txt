Well I didn't listen carefully in the beginning so I can only remember the last part of the presentation. The last point was about the escape from the prison in Venice. Chevalier claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof but the critics say that after his escape the sealling had to be repaired. So the question is: Why had they to repair the sealing if he escaped through a hole in the ceiling? The presentation criticizes the truth of his memoirs. For the last part the presentation is a good explanation and a reasonable possibility for the way it really happened. If the sealing had to be repaired it's probably true that he couldn't remember exactly what happenend but the difference between his memoirs and the explanation of the critics is big so another possibilty is that it's a lie and he added a few interesing and catching details to make his story more enjoyable.
