The Chevalier went to many parties and gambled alot in Switzerland, which used up all of the money he had with him money. He didn't live in Switzerland so therefore he didn't have all his money down there. The reason, why he borrowed constantly money, is because he used it all up while gambling and partying every day. For him to be able to continue having fun and spending money every day, he had to borrow some from time to time. He had to wait, till the money from his castle arrives, to be able to give it back.
The Chevalier made notes every night after the conversations with Voltaire, and wrote down as much as he could remember. People claim that they have seen him walking around with note books.
The Chevalier didn't have many friends inside the prison, nore outside the prison. He had to escape all by himself. Prison papers show, that at the same day as the Chevalier escaped they had to repair the roof of his cell. Why would they have to repair the roof, if he hadn't escaped through it?
