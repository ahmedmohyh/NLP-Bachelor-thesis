The Chevaliers memoire was pretty accurate.
He also lived in Switzerland and was a wealthy person. He had fields which he converted to money, but he had to wait to get the money. So that doesn't mean that he had no money, it rather means that he had to wait for his money. And he spent that money for parties and gambling.
He also conversed with Voltaire. He could remember the exact phrases because he wrote down everything he could remember after he conversed with Voltaire.
To the critics about the prison escape; much of the people in the prison even had more powerful connections to other people than the Chevalier had, but they couldn't manage to escape. It is known that the prison had to repair the ceiling which the Chevalier escaped from, which could be an evidence that he really made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof.
