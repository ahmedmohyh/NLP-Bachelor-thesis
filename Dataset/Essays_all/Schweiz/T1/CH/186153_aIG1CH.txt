Much has been written about Chevalier de Seingalt, most of them were praising him for his geniusness while others thought he wasnt writing the whole truth. With my gained experience of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt i will compare, answer, and solve some controversial statements from people defending or attacking the accuracy of his memoir.

First of all, people which criticise Chevalier often start with his life in Switzerland, because they thought to have found flaws in his memoir. As they say that in the memoir Chevalier claimed to be very rich and liked to spend money, although they found out that he had to borrow a lot of money from swiss merchants. People defending Chevalier claim that he was forced to borrow money not because he was poor, but he was forced to because he needed to wait some time before he could  liquidise the money from his investments. So he needed to borrow cash first to maintain is exquisit lifestyle

This is just one of many controversial parts of chevaliers memoir, but it shows how exciting his work (still) is.
