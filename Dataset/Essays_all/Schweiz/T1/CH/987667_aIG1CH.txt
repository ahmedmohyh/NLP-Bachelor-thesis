In the text they try to prove that the Chevalier invented most of his stories to make his life more fascinating. However some specialists proved that the stories were real and they also have some evidence for that. First the Chevalier lend money in switzerland although he was very wealthy and spent a lot on partying and gambling. In the text they claim that this is a sign that he hadn't all the money he said he had, because who lends money if he's ritch. But at that time if you won or transacted money you had to wait for it a few days and in this time he had to lend money for everyday living. So he was ritch but he was waiting for his money to arrive. The next point is that he wrote about his conversations with Voltaire after a few years and presumably he didn't know everything by heart and invented a lot. But actually he wrote down all the important topics after each conversation and he consulted these notes when he was writing his memoir. And last but not least he escaped from a notorious jail in venice. In the text they say that he had very good connections to politicians and they offered a bribe. But somebody found an old text from the goverment from venice and it says that they had to repair the ceiling after the escape and why should they repair the ceiling if Chevalier didn't bail through the ceiling. All in all the autor of the text had good evidence to prove that Chevalier was writing fictional stories but the men from the tape have in my mind better evidence that Chevalier really had such a crazy life.
