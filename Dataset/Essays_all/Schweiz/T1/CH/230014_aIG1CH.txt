In the beginning of the presentation the woman stated in contrary to the text above, that even though no memoir is 100% true, Chevalier's is pretty accurate and quite reliable. After that she brings the following arguments:
She agrees on the point that he spent a great deak of money on parties and gambling, but this didn't automatically make him poor. He had a merchant loan, which means that he didn't recieve money on a daily basis, but when he sold a property. This means that from time to time he had to borrow some cash while he was still waiting for his money.
After that she mentions, that every evening after the conversations with Voltaire, he wrote everything he could remember down in a kind of diary. Years later, when he was working on his memoir, he probably used these notes and referred to them. Therer are even people that have seen him using old notes. This is why it's actually possible that the conversations have occurred the way they're written in his memoir.
As a third contra argument against the text above, she states that the escape is likely to have happened. There were other people in the same prison at the same time that were way more powerful, and  they didn't get a bribe either. But soon after the said escape of Chevalier the ceiling had to be repaired, which means that it must have been damaged.
In conclusion, the oral presentation states that Chevalier's memoir is pretty accurate and quite reliable.
