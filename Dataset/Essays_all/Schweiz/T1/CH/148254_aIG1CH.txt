The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir of his life. In one of his storys he told about the time he lived in Switzerland. He said that he had a lot of money and spent it on partys and gambling. The one thing about the story that many critics doubt is that its confirmed that he had borrowed a lot of money which is very contravertial to the fact that he is rich or very wealthy. 
The second thing which is very argued about is about the accuracy of his conversations with famous people such as Voltaire. No one questions if the conversations really toke part but a lot of critics think that the conversation isnt as accurate as it really was written because it toke place a lot of years before the chevalier wrote the story he had just taken notes from the conversation and wrote the story with the help of that.
The third and final thing which they mantion is about the story in venice where he arguably escaped a prison. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to get through the seeling. Critics doubt the fact that he really escaped through the seeling because its confirmed that he had a lot of politicallly well-connected friends who may helped him with his escape. In the listening they question it again because after his escape they had to repair a hole in the seeling which could had been the hole from the escape. One thing which is also strange is that he wasnt the only prisoner with politically well-connected friends. Soo why didnt they help the other prisoners tho escape?
