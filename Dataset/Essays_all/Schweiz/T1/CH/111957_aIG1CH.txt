I red and heard some information about Chevalier de Seingalt who was born in the 18th century. it said that he spent a lot of money in switzerland and he mostly wrote about his life and memoirs. Some of the historian doubt that he told the trues because they found no paralelles to what he said. One exampel is that he was known to be wealthy but in the same time he borrowed money from a merchant. The text and the presentation don't go hand in hand. For instants, in the text, It is written that he could escape from jail because he knows some powefull men. But the presentation said that the other people in jail were more powerfull than he was. The meeting with voltaire is the other point, the narrator of the text tells me that it's impossible to writte a conversation that was recorded long time ago. The presentation was convinsed that he always wrote his memories down and that it was possible that he had tis sort of conversation with Voltair.
