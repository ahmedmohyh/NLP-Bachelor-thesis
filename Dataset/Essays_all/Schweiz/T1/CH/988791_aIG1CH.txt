The first accusation of a critic, of him not been rich at all, the explanation for that is he didn't have money alot of money in his bank accounts. Although the value of his assets, such as his house, was tremendous. 

Furthermore the second accusation of him not being able to capture excately what he said or didn't say to Voltair. This evidance is supported by his house emploies that said, seeing him document every conversation, in the evening. The third and final accusation is about him having been able to break out of prison, which makes one question it reasonabley, is even supported by the records of the prison in Venice. That stated that after Chevaliers so called escape they had to mend the chaimber he stayed in.
