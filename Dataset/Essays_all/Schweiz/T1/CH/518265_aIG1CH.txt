The doubts, raised by some critics, claim that the chevalier invented many events in the memoir to make it seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. But the points, the critics are skeptical about, can easily be explained. The point about Chevalier, claiming to be wealthy during his time in switzerland and the fact that he borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant, can be explained in an easy way. At this time there were no easy solution to carry money, so it is possible, that Chevalier was wealthy and only waited for his money to arrive. And as he had no more cash, but needed some, he borrowed it from the Swiss merchant. And also the conversations with Voltaire can be true, cause he probably wrote everything down after their conversation and used his notes when writing on his memoir. And the last point about his escape from the Venetian prison can also be true, cause the documents of the prison do say, that they had to repair the ceiling of the prison after Chevalier escaped from the prison. And why repair the ceiling if their is no hole in it?
