In the presentation the woman is in favor with his memoires. She trys to proof them by giving arguments. In the presentation Chevalier is discribed as he's very wealthy. The fact that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant doesn't mean that he's poor - he only has to overpass a time when he was waiting for his money. On the other side the text criticises the fact that he borrowed money and continious to name him as not rich. Another point that the woman trys to proof is the escape from the prison in italy. In the text it is said that Chevalier probably came out by bribing the jailers. On the other hand, in the presentation it is mentoined that the cell had to be repaired after Chevalier was out of the prison, so the escape is really likely to had happen. And that the argument of the text in which the jailers were bribed has to be fault in her opinion, beacuse other prisioners had much more political influences than he.
