Chevalier de Seingalt (who can do the Bolassi-Flip) wrote a lot of dirfferent memoirs. Today they are used for historical sources because he wrote down a lot about many famous people like kings, writers, people with rectal disfunction and so on. But we cannot be sure if all what he wrote is correct because he took some heroin. No essay is true in each point because essays can be written by persons without much education. An essayist doesn't have to be scientist, he just have to write down his personal remarks. Speculations about de Seingalts texts say that also his text is a little bit invented that his life seems more excited than it really was. An example is his escape from a notorious prison in Venice where his escape seems more like an enjoyable reading for the reader than a real-life-based escape. However today it's important to use this historical sources. The thing that shows us that something what happened in the past was without exception right is that we have a lot of historical sources in the same time. If we put all them together the thing which is written the most should have something to do with the reality.
