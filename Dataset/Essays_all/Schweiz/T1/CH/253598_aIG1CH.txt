In the memoir of the Chevaliers, there are many scenes, which critics doubt their accuracy about. It is true, that no memoir can be one hundred percent correct, but the Chevalier is a reliable historical source. There are proofs to the accuracy of every part, critics don't believe they're true. For example the fact, that the Chavalier had to borrow money all the time, makes many critics doubt that the he was as rich as he claimed to be. But we know that his fortune mostly constisted of properties he owned, so he often had to wait for his money to arrive during the process of selling them, which explains his need to borrow money. 
The Chevalier wrote about  conversations he held with the famous writer Voltaire in detail. Critics say that it's not possible to remember conversations at this lenght over so many years. Nevertheless there are witnesses that the Chevalier had written notes about those conversation the same day every time, which makes it far more realistic that those conversations took place exactly like that. 
The third part of his life the Chevalier writes about is his escape from prison in Venice. He claims that he escaped on his own, although critics say it's more realistic that one of his many friends in Venice helped him and bribed his jailers to free him. It's proven that other prisoneres in Venice had even better friends and they were not able to escape. There's also refrences that the ceiling of his cell had to be repared after he had escaped, which makes his story even more believable.
