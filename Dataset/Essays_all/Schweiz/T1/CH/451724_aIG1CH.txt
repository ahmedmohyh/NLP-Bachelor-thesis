Firstly, the teacher said that Chevalier was poor in Switzerland. She said that he was poor, because he did parties and gambling. He spent a lot of money for this activities and then he got poor. Chevalier had a very nice life in Switzerland, even though got poor. he does not think about this thing for the future.

Sencondly, Chevalier met Voltaire and spoke with him. Voltaire said a lots thing who are great for the life. Because of this thing, Chevalier wrote all things down, that he can remember all things in the future. The meeting was amazing for Chevalier, because he got a opinion from Voltaire. 

At the end, Chevalier escaped from the prison, he wanted to live in freedom. He risk his live to escape from the prison just to live in freedom although he had no money. This is horrible, because he have no money and got a lots critics.
