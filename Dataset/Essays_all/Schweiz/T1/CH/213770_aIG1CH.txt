Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir is an important source today but is it correct? Had he really so much wealth like he tells us? Were his conversations with Voltaire really like he tells us? And dd he really broke out of Venice's prison by making a hole in the ceiling? Can we rely on a memoir written at the end of someones life?
Evidence tells us that he borrowed much, probably because he hadn't any money left to spend. On the other side, Chevaliers wealth could have been not money but more something that you have to sell, so that he could have needed money just for a short amount of time because he had to sell something but he wasn't fast enough.
He tells us, that he talked to Voltaire and tells us, what they talked about. Some claim, that he would have never been able to recreate conversations like this, but apparently he took notes. He even reffered to them in his memoir.
Also, his prison break in Venice could have been romatisized and was acctualy just a bribe from well-connected friends. But acctualy, the ceiling of his prison cell had to be fixed after he was gone, so why did they do that?
I think, that chevaliers memoir are mostely correct but there may be flaws in them because Chevalier was old when he wrote it. We can trust his memoir, but I don't think that all memoirs are alike.
