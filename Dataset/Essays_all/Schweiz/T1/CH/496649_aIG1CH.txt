In the text and in the presentation is written that the Chevalier was a very controversial person. So when he lived in Switzerland, he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. But where is this money from? In the text is written that he borowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant, but we heard in the hearing that he wasn't poor. He had lots of money. He just had to wait for the money. It's not clear if he was rich or poor.
In his memoir the Chevalier wrote about his conversations between himself amd the famous writer Voltaire. This text writes that the Chevalier wrote his memoir many years after this conversations took place. But could he remember really all of these conversations? The presentation says that he wrote down every conversation the day after that he met Voltaire.
Also the facts on his escape from a prison in Venice are not very clear. In the presentation we heard that he had friends who helped him to escape but in the text he is more like a hero. He should have escaped from the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
I think the presentation is more natural and it's more like it was in reality, because the text seems to be better than the Chevalier's life actually was. So his memoir isn't really real but more a better version of his life.
