In the just heard sequence, the narrator finds arguments the actual accuracy of the memoir. 
Even though it seems controversial that Chevalier claimed he was very wealthy when he was living inSwitzerland, but then obviously had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, there is a logic behind it. Chevalier had most of his money invested in properties, which means he usually sold those to get new cash, but needed to wait until the money arrives. During these time periods, it makes sense that he had to ask for loans and then pay it back straight after. 
The accuracy of the conversation between him and famous writer Voltaire can also get easily explained. Chevalier was known to write diary and keep notes for a longer amount of time. In this case, he didn`t have to remember all those conversations as he had them already written down long ago.
In the prison in Venice, a lot of prisoners had even more powerful friends than Chevalier, who weren`t able to escape. Why should Chevalier be here an exception? Also the fact that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape definentely supports the accuracy.
