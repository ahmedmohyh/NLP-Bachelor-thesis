In the read text it is said that some parts of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs are made up and not reliable. Whereas in the sequence they say that in fact it really did happen like that. So which stories are invented and which ones are accurate?

In the sequence from the presentation the first critic point was if he really was that wealthy when he lived in Switzerland. It is said in the text that he did have to borrow money from somebody so that's an indicator for being poor. But in this case Chevalier did not borrow money because he was poor but because he just was waiting for his money that he gained to arrive.

Another controversial point is the conversations between him and the famous writer voltaire. In the text is claimed that many people say it is never possible to remember a conversation that exact. Whereas in the heard sequence it is said that Chevalier just wrote the conversation down right after. So another point which is truly accurate.

Finally the story with the escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. Chevalier wrote in his memoirs that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and escaped through that exact hole. And, in fact, his jailers were not bribed to free him, because there is evidence that they had to repaire a hole in the ceiling in Chevalier's cell shortly after he said it happened.

So with the heard sequence all points of criticism can be cleared.
