Even when he was a controversial figure in human history, there are some pieces of truth you can find in his little stories. It's pretty accurate and can be used as an historical source.

Let's have a look at the first story, when he lived in switzerland: It is proven that you need to have much money to gamble. If he hadn't had money he would have never been able to gamble. So, it's possible he borrowed an huge amount of money, but he payed it all back afterwards. 

To the second story with Voltaire: He wrote in his notebook, that every night, he had had a conversation with Voltaire he wrote down everything he could remember. and kept the notes. Years later, the friend confirmed, they had seen him writing down things and consulting notes. 

Last but not least, the story with the jail in Venice: He wasn't the only prisoner kept in the prison, some of them with even more politically connected friends. But none of them ever got out. So bribary wasn't possible for Chevalier. If you consult the notes of old Venice library, they had to repair the roof of the cell, in which Chevalier was kept. So it goes with his story about climbing through the roof. 

After the last little history was proven, there is no more space for critics,in which he is pictured like a liar. He may has invented a few things, but not the whole plot of the story.
