Some people doubt, that his memoir was really true. They say, that he invented and made up some things, that his gremoir will look adventurous and more glamourus because he exaggerated some events. It was known that when he lived in Switzerland, that he was always partying and gambeling a lot. This fact is in both the interview and the text the same. What is diffrent between the text and the interview is, that in the text they say that he was rich but he had to borrow money what can not be true, because of the fact that he had to borrow money. They assumed that he was not that rich how he pretended to be. But in the interview they talk about that he was living in such an expensive house or property, that he had to borrow money from somewhere or someone because otherwise it would be way too expensive. Another arrgument was that his gremoir is too accurate for example the conversations between him an Voltaire. But in the interview, they say that he was the kind of person who wrote everything down after each conversation what could explain the accuracy of his conversation. Friends also confirmd that he often wrote journals and kept them for his gremoir. With his prison escape there are also some differences. The text says that he could escape through the ceiling and in the interview they talked about that after his escape they had to repair the roof. They also talked about that he could have bribed some of the people who were working there but the question which came up here, was that some of the prisoners had much more political and important friends than he had so that is an unlikely situation.
