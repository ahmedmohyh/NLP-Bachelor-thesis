We heart that the Chevalier de Seingalt was a long time for the mergant poor. In the text are written, that the Chevalier's haven't a lot of money.
In the lissening comprehension they said, as example that he has a lot of money but he hasn't a lot of cash he only have a lot of mony from the parties and the gamblings.
As second in the text is written, that the Chevalier de Seingalt escape from the prison in Venece, Italy by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof and that it is more likely that the Chavalier's jailers were bribed to free him. But in the other text they said, that he wrote down all conversaitions. And because of that he could escape from the prison. His prison room were prepated.
