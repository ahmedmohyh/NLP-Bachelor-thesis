The Cavalier has a lot of critics about his written memoir. They say that the cavalier has invented a lot of things in his memoir to make his live seem more exciting than it really was. But it has a lot of arguments against this critics. For example the critics say that if he had a lot of money he would not have needed to borrow money from a Swiss marchant. But thats not true because someone can be rich and also borrow money. The second critics are about the conversations between him and the famous writer Voltaire. They say that it can not be, that the memoir can capture these conversations many years later. But the arguments against this critics are, that the chevalier has only written down the part of the conversation, that he can remember. The last critics are about his escape from a prison in Venice. They say that it is not possible for him to escape from the prison without help from someone other. The arguments against this critics are, that the prison was not really safe. So it was not really hard for the Chevalier to escape.
