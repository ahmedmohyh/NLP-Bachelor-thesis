According to the listening the Chervaliers memoir seems to be very accurate and a reliable historic source. Now the listening claims that he actually was a wealthy man. He just didn't have all his wealth in cash. First he had to convert whatever he owned, like for instance a castle in money and of course that took some time so while he had to wait, he borrowed some from a Swiss merchant. It doesn't mean that he was poor. He just didn't always have the money right in front of him.
Refering to the conversations with Voltaire. The argument they mention in the listening seems reliable. They claim that he wrote down the conversations every evening after having talked to him and later refered to those conversations. It just seems strange that he didn't mention him having written the conversations down in the evening more clearly.
If he actually escaped from the prison or had a friend bribe him free is very hard to find out. Of course those documents which claim that the ceiling had to be repared after he escaped can be accurate. But it could also just have been some other type of problem, a water tube leaking in the wall so that the wall had to be repared for example.
