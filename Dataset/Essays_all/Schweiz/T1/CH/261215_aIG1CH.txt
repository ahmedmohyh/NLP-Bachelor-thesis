The text firstly doubts that the Chevalier really was rich, even though he threw parties and was known for gambling. He had to pick up loans to finance his pleasures, but a rich person wouldn't have to that. In the lecture we get to know that the Chevalier was rich, but because he was in a business where he first had to liquidate his assets and wait for the money, he picked up loans and paid them back as soon as he had his money. That still makes him rich, so that part is wrong in the text.
The second argument about his conversations with Voltaire, is also falsified by the lecture. The text states that it would have been impossible to remember those conversation many years after they happened. But in the lecture we learn that the Chevalier always wrote down everything he remembered of the conversation, right after they had happened. He then later used his notes when he wrote his memoirs. These facts are very probable to be correct due to friends and people who knew the Chevalier, stating that he offen refered to those note later on when writing his memoirs.
Last but not least the story about his prison break in Venice. When the Chevalier was imprisoned he supposivley escaped by making a hole into the roof with some piece of metal. But he had some quite powerful friends in Venice, some say he escaped through bribery. The lecture falsifies that by saying, that many other inmate had even more powerful friends in Venice, but not one of those inmates escaped, so why should he. Furthermore, the roof of his prison cell had to be repared after he was out of the prison. That would support the argument that he really cut a hole into the roof, through which he then escaped.
