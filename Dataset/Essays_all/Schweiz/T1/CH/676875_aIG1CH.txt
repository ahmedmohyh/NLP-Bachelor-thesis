That presentation was the complet opposite of the text. 
At first the woman who is presentating says, that no memoir is correct. That's right but we will look for the other points:
The text says, that Chevalier was poor because he had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. That is right, but the reason is, that he had no cash, because he did too lot of parties. The only solution for making more party was borrowing money and give it back when he has his cashmoney again. 
The second point is the fact, that he wrote something about a conversation he had several years before he wrote the text. Critics say that it is impossible to remember everything of a conversation. But in the presentation it was told, that Chevalier had something like a diary. So in every night he was sitting on his bed and wrote everything, especially every conversation he had, in his book. That was confirmed by his relativs and friends.
The last point describes the escaption of the prison in Venice. Chevalier himself said, that he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and then he was climbing through the roof. That sounds very impossible. So he had may help from his famous friends, who payed him  a bribe. But you must know, that in the prison where also people who had conections to famous people. These people had more succes then the people from Chevalier. So it makes no sense, because the other people should also be free.
