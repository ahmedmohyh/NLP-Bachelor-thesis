The memoires of Chevalier are really valuable but had some critics about the accuracy. If we are honest, no memoire can be fully correct and believable but in  Chevaliers case his events are pretty much all true but you just don't know everything in the storys. Let's talk about the first one where he is a wealthy man in Switzerland. Just becausehe gambled and borrowed some big amount of money doesn't mean he was poor. When he as there he needed to sell some of his properties but it took some time till the money arrived to him so he thought he could just borrow some. That means this story wasn't a lie.
Now to the conversation with Voltaire. How could he remember everything about it some years later. Well, he just wrote every single detail during the conversation down and kept his notes on him. It is also said that he reguraly noted his information somewhere down again and again so that he always has them. Again this event was true.
The last story is probably the most unbelievable but it's also true. During his time in prison, the other prisoners had even more powerful friends in Venicethan he had but they couldn't get out of it. So how did he manage to break the ceiling with a pieceof metal. He was very lucky and conveniently the ceiling of his chamber had to be repaired so it was much easier for him to escape. As you can see this story was true. The problem is that some more information was needed in every story to understand everything.
