The memoir of Chevalier

Chevaliers memoir is kind of an autobiografical script which is comparable to a diary. There is no evidence that everything written would be true but the memoir became valuable for europes societies because Chevalier met a lot of kings and other important people in his life. Still we do not know how valuable his memoir is for us: What is true and what is not? Some parts of the memoir had been critisized because they are not prooved. For example is the accuracy of his dialogue with Voltaire not defined. Chevalier just tried to remember the conversations with those people. Now there are people who claim it is bad because nobody knows if itis true or not. On the otherside people think why does every word has to be litteraly the truth? They say, eventough the Chevalier exaggerated some things or even invented this or that, it can be useful to learn something from the time and the society he lived. It is obvious that there must be some details which are not true but therefore it is our task to notice which parts could be true and valuable in the following.
