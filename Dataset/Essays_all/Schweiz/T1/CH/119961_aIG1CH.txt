Chevalier was quite a controversial person and a lot of people dicussed about his memorial. 
Some say that he couldn't have been such a wealthy man like he wrote it down. Because when he was in Switzerland, where he gambled a lot, he had to borrow money from a merchant. But others argue that Chevalier just had a lot of property (like houses). It took a while to sell this property to turn it in to money. So he borrowed the money he needed for gambling. But he could pay this back and because of this property, he was a wealthy man, even though it wasn't liquid money he possessed.
Critics also say that he couldn't have written down his conversations with Voltaire accurately because he wrote his memorial years later after they talked to each other. But there is evidence that Chevalier, each night after having a conversation with Voltaire, wrote everything down he could remember in a kind of diary. So for his memorial he could just go through his writings and relate to them.
Then there is his escape from the prison, that critics claim Chevalier lied about. They believe that he just had his politically well-connected friends bribe to free him. But the thing is, there were other persons in this prison at the same time who had much more powerful friends than him. And they weren't freed either. So he must have escaped himself. Also, we know that short after the escape of Chevalier the ceiling in his cell was repared. So why would they have repared the ceiling if not because Chevalier made a hole in it?
