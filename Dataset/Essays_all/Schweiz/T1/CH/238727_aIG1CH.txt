Firstly, you can read in the text that Chevalier claimed in his memoire that while he was living in Switzerland he was a well-off person, but the woman in the presentation said that it is proved that he was a wealthy man. 
Furthermore, there is the written conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. In the text they say that you can not remember whole phrases and all points from a conversation which was held years ago. In the presentation they said something similar, but that he wrote things down a night after the conversation. 
In addition, there is the case where Chevalier could somehow escape from the prison. On the one hand it says that he wrote that he could escape with help of a piece of metal, which he used to make a hole in the ceiling, on the other hand they are shure that he had a number of wealthy and well-connected friends so they helped him to get out of the prison. 
But if you listen to the presentation they explained that he wrote that the ceiling needed to be repare, but they also think that wealthy people helped him out of the prison. The funny thing is that they think that his friends in the prison had wealthy friends and that they were not his own friends there.
