First of all, the person from the presentation claimed that Chevaliers notes were very accurate and reliable. In the text it is said that Chevalier was a controversial figure and that parts of his memoir were invented or distorted to make it more intresting. As first point the presenter talked about the wealth of Chevalier and the situation with the Swiss merchant, she said that he was very wealthy but had to wait until his money arrived, and while he waited he had to borrow money. Hoewever in the texts it is said that Chevalier did spend huge amounts of money on parties and gamlbilng, but because he had to borrow money Critics say he wasn't very rich, as he wouldn't need to borrow money if he was wealthy. The text is also sceptical about the conversations Chevalier had with Voltaire, it claims that it is not possible to remember those conversation so accurately, with exact phrases because they were years earlier. But in the presentation we hear that Chevalier wrote down the conversatons right after they happend and it was confirmed by relatives. The last point that the texts is critical about is the escape from a prison in Venice, critics claim that Chevalier can't have escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, but that he was bribed to be free by some of his politically well-connected friends he had in Venice. However, the presenter says that no one could be bribed and that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier escaped from prison.
