Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. In this time he wrote down all the special adventures of his life. But critics thought that he invented storys to get more popular. They couldn't belive that someone can writte down everything they have experianced a long time ago. Also the critics couldn't belive that Chevalier had met those famous people. One example of an invented story is, when he was in Switzerland that he was very wealthy. In fact he borrowed all the money from a Swiss merchant. So he wasn't rich. When he was in prison, he said that e escaped by using a piece of metal to break out. The truth is that he had friend in Venice which have offered a bribe.
