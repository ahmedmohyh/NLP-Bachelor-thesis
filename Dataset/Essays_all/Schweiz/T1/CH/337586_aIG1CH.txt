Chevalier de Sengalt:

The Chevalier wrote a long memoir of actions happened in his life. In his memoir he wrote, that he lived in Switzerland for a while and in that time he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. Critics say that he was not as rich as he wrote, they think he didn't have all the money and needed to borrow it from rich friends. In the presentation they explained that he used his money to get more money and he had to wait until he got it back which doesn't mean he was poor, no in fact he was rich but had to borrow money when he waited.
It is also mentionned in his text, that he met Voltaire a famous writer and that he had many conversations with him wherefrom he learnd lots of new things. Because he met Voltairea long time before he wrote his memoir the critics say that it was impossible to remember all the conversations he had with Voltaire because they look so complete. The Chevalier could have just written all the conversations down on the day he had them and then stored them for a long time until he copied them into his memoir. The critics also so question his break out from the prison in Venice because it is written, that he used a piece of metal to get through the ceiling of his cell. In fact he should have got out by the bribes of his well-connected friends in Venice. In the presentation they say, that he coulnt have got out bybribes because the other prisoners had even better connnected friends in Venice and eventhey could not get a bribe. It is also mentionned that they had to repair the ceiling of his cell and they would not need to repair it if he had not made a hole into it.
