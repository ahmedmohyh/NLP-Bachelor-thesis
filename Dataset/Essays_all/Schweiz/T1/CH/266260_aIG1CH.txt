In the presentacion they say that it is evident, that not everything is true but that much more things could be true as the writer of the text tought they were. It's true that he spent a lot of money drinking and partying and he had to borrow some. But that doesn't mean that he was poor. He was waiting for his Money. 
He really spoke with the famous writer Voltaire and the Chevalier wrote everything down. Then he waited a few years and returned to the writing. beacuse of that he knew about everything they spoke. The critics also say that he didn't escape from jail. Because of the importent friends he had that could have helped him. But in prison were many more prisoners that had way more important friends. And they didn't come free. And it's also true that, the jail really had to repair the room were he was all the time.
so some critics could bee true, but in general its possible that very much of what the Chavalier spoke is true.
