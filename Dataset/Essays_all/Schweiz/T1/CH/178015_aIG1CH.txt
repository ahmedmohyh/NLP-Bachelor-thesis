The text says that memoir of Chevalier is full with lies. It is said that he made many events and met a lot of famous people but critics said that was just beacuse he wanted a more glaumours and exiting life to tell about. It is also said that while he was living in switzerland he was very wealthy and that he spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. But he needed to borrow money so it is thought he could not have been that rich. In the lissening it says that even if he had not that much money it doesn`t mean he is poor. He could have thrown parties and then a short time he had no money till he recived a lot later from the costumers. Critics also say that the conversation between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire did not happen exactly like he wrote down because it is impossible to remember about what they talked and write it down years later. But the other side says that he went home and the same evening he had this conversation he wrote down the exciting and important phrases so he could remermber these like he did when he wrote years later about this conversation. critics also have questioned the escape from a notorious prison in venice. It is said he was using a pice of metal and made a hole in the celling an climbed through the roof. They say that he had many friends in venice and they gave hime a bribe. In the lissening it is said that there were many other prisionners with more richer friends and the jailers were not bribed to free them so why Chevalier ? Futher more they had to repair the celling after Chevalier was gone so why would they repair a room when no one broke it like Chevalier did ?
