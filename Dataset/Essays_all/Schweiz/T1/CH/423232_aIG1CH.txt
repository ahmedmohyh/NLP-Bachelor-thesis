The text is critiscing Chevaliers memoir, but the women in the presentation claims these criticts not to be true. In the text the writer says that Voltaire lyed bout being healty and rich during his lifetime in switzerland. That gets to appearance because he had to borrow money quite often. The woman tries to legitimate this critic for the sceptists. She claims that he was rich and not poor. She says he had to borrow money, but not because he was poor, because he had to wait for his money. After gambling he had  to transform his assets to money, but that appaently took a while. So for thurder gamblinghe had to borrow money untill his money gets to him. Another critic about his memoir is about the conversation between him nd a french writer called Voltaire. In the text it gets mentioned that Seingalt did fake his storys and for example the contain of that converation. As the text claims, Seingalt did write the memoir years after that conversation and it is proved that you can't keep a coonveration in mind for many years and write it down as it was correctly. The women conters with Seingalt always making notes of some situations in life. So she says that he made notes the night after the conversation and refered to them while writing the memoir. The third point of the disscussion was the prisonescape in venice. In Seingalts memoir he wrote about escaping through the wall with a peice of metal. The text is sceptical about that and claims Seingalt to had help form very strong friends in venice. The women in the presentation is sure that bribbery wasn't possible. She says that there were some people in the prison with even stronger friends than him and they couldn't escape. At the end Seingalts memoir is still a pretty accurate resscource of history and there is always space for interpretation.
