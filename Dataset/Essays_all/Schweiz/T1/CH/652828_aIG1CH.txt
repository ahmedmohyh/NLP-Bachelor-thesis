It is said that the Chevalier de Seingalt was very wealth. Indeed he had to borrow big sums of money from a Swiss merchant, but that doesn't mean he was poor. When living in Switzerland, he had most of his wealth in form of assets. When he needed more cash, he first had to sell his assets and then wait for the buyer to give him the cash. If he needed the cash immeditely and or didn't want to wait, he had to borrow it from someone who had accessible cash. So the critics are wrong. Although the Chevalier was rich, he still had the need to borrow money.

Apparently the Chevalier would take notes each night after his disscusions with Voltaire. This enabled him to have a trustworthy source with all the details when he would compose his memoire a few years later. Critics say that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from a long conversation held many years ago, but by taking notes shortly after each conversation, the Chevalier was able to accomplish that.

The other prisoners where the Chevalier was held captive had even more powerful friends than the Chevalier did, but they nevertheless were unable to be freed through bribery. This shows that the probability that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed is very small. His only chance of freedom was escaping. Critics claiming that the Chevalier bribed his way to freedom are mistaken because the prison documents show that after the Chevalier's escape, the ceiling of his prison cell had to be changed. This means the Chevalier really did escape by making a hole in the ceiling of his cell.
