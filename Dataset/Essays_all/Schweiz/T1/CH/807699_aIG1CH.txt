The text and the audition were both about the life and the adventures of the Chevalier de Seingalt. The three main topics were his whealtyness, the conversations with Voltaire and his outbreak of the prison in Venice.
In the text ther is written, that he was poor because he borrowed money. Contrary to this, in the audition they said that he wasn't realy poor because he used to gamble. He won a lot of money but he first had to sell the tokens and convert them to money. So after that he was rich.
The text also says that the conversation with Voltaire can't be talked exactly like they were in the memoir because they were written down many years later. In the audition there is said that actually is possible because the Chavalier wrote down himself some parts of the conversations and Voltaire used to consult him and look at them.
The third point that is controversary is the escape from the prison. The text says that he can't have espaped through the ceiling and it is more likely that he had some friends that helped him to escape. In the audition there is said that it's true that he escaped through the ceiling because they had to repair the ceiling afterwards and this wouldn't have been necessary if he hadn't escaped through the ceiling. They also said that there were other chevaliers that had way more powerful friends than the did.
