Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs are very accurated. He made many rumors or lies about his life. It isn't everything true what he told the people about his "adventures". Once he said when he was in Switzerland he spent his money for parties and gambling and he also was known to be rich(text). He wasn't poor but also not rich (presentation). He often had to borrow money. 
It is also said that he had a conversation with Voltaire. In the text they say that there were not some recordings from their conversation but in the presentation they say that Chevalier wrote everything down he remembered from their conversation. 
in the presentation is it told that he hadn't some powerful friends which could help him to escape but he escaped anywhere. In the text it is said that he had jailers who helped him to escape.
