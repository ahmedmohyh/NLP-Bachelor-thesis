The speeker in the presentation is arguing against the critics of the three memories of Chevalier in the text. Different as the critics, the presenter says, that his stories in the book have not to be invented or distorted. It is also commented with facts, that ensure the correctness of his stories. For example the case in switzerland where he was very rich, but borrowed a huge amount of money from a merchant. That's possible, the presenter says. You don't have to be poor if you lend some money, maybe you are waiting for the payment at the end of the month.Or the meet and greet with Voltaire that Chevalier described so exactly, that his haters would say, the conversation is invented, because he couldn't remember it after so many years. Maybe, maybe not, because MAYBE he wrote down the phrases after meeting Voltaire.
Also the notorious escape of the Prison in Venice isn't distorted, so in the presentation. Because facts show, that his room in the prsion had to be repared after his escape.
