The written text claims that, sure enough Chevalier had an interesting life, but still lied about events in his life to make it seem more interesting. Yet in the audio they claimed that the three examples that were used above are correct and they even have evidence.
In the text above they claim that Chevalier, who talked about himself as a rich person, was in real life a poor man because evidence surfaced that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. 
Another reason which makes him look like a liar is that he wrote down conversations he had with the writer Voltaire. The only problem is that he wrote it down years later and he can impossibly remember the exact words of both of them.
And last but not least he also claimed that he escaped a prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through that into freedom. Critics can't believe, this is actually true, yet they guess he must have used his contacts in politics.
The audio defends Chevalier and they seem to have reasonable evidence just as the one, that he did have money but because he might have sond something he had to wait for his money to arrive and for that duration of time had to borrow money. 
The speaker also mentioned that Chevalier wrote that most of the things that happened during the day so he actually wrote down the conversation exactly the way he remembered it to have happened. A few years later his memorial was published and those conversations that were mentioned were based on his notes that he took every day.
About his prison escape in Venice, there are forms that show, that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired just after he as released. Also there were people with a lot more influence imprisoned too and they couldn't bribe themselves either.
