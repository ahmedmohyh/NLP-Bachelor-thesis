"A teacher have to know more than students." This common saying may contain some truth, yet we have to realize how many children can better learn with other older children and have a better result in lot of tests. Sometimes teachers have an other way of thinking and that could be a problem to understand a subject in school. There are a lot of possibilities, yet 

First, as a student, who learns with younger children, I saw, that many students didn't get attention in the lessons in cause of the complicate explications of the teachers, althoug they have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. Certainly there are a few teachers, who can also relate well with students, but maybe they are on an other base and have another way of thinking. As a consequence students write bad marks and the relation between students and teacher is bad. 


At last but not least have all teacher more life experience than students. With every lesson they have taught, they give something on the students way. So it does not matter, if the the teacher has not an excellent knowledge of the subject. It is more important, that the words and explications rest in the head. It is also important to give the students a chance and enough of time to create their own solution to the subject, hence we do not need a very good teacher. We need someone, who have an ability to relate well with students.


In conclusion a lot of people all over the world might are better teachers, than people, who studied to be teacher. In addition students have to use the possibilities to help other ones. Under this circumstances better marks were writing. To sum up I am agree with the statement: "A teachers's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught."
