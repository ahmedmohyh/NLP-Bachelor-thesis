In recent days, the question about the knowledge of teachers is asked quiet often. Do the teachers have to be able to relate well to the students or not? In this essay exactly this question is answered.

First, some teachers might have a big knowledge about their subject but actually can't teach at all. Since there are so many different levels in school we have to differenciate, for example, primary school and college. In primary school the knowledge of the teacher about the subject material is not as important whereas in college the teacher does not need to have a good ability in relating with students. 

Secondly, it is no question that this relating ability for primary school children is very important as they need to have a relationship with their teacher. On the one hand, for college students it may make no sense to relate to their teacher. On the other hand the lerning process might be faster and better if they have a good relationship with their teacher. For example when a teacher knows everything about a subject and is totally into it, he could have a communication issue by trying to really teach the students. 

To conclude, every teacher has to love and like the subject he or she is teaching, but at the same time they should try to understand their students and help them. Finally, in my opinion the ability to relate well with students is more important than the knowledge of the subject being taught.
