Students will learn much more in school if they have a good relationship to their techer. Because then the school makes more fun and the students have more motivation in the lessons. If the students haven`t any motivation at school they also havet`t good marks.
If the students have problems they can go to their teacher and ask for a good answer. 

Knowledge is of course very importent to teach a class, but it isn`t everything. If you have a good knowledge, but aren`t able to relate with student`s then the students will not listen to your lessons very motivated. A student should learn by him selve and not just copy that things what the teacher tells. So it`s importent that the teacher not all the time just presentates things and the students just sit at their places and listen to the teacher.

I think that a teacher must have a good relation to their classes and a good knowlegde, because if a teacher has just one of this to things then the class won`t be able to give their best. But more importent is for me the ability to relate well with students. It`s a job you must work with students all the time and you can`t relate with them, then you`re not good for that job. Students should have a good relation to teacher, but also have respect of their teacher. It mustn`t be a relationship like between to friends.

All in all a techer need to have both, a good relation to the students and a excellent knowledge.
