A teacher should be able to teach his subject to the students. For me, he or she would be a bad teacher if a person has an important question and he or she can't answer it beause of his or her bad knowledge. Why should someone do this job, where you should be able to teach something to someone, but you can't do it? This doesn't make sense to me at all and in my opinion it is one of the most important things, that a teacher has the ability to help the students and to answer any question they have. 
But on the other hand, I think also that a teacher should be able to relate well with students. A student learns better and more concentrated if there's a teacher he can talk to without hesitate and he has a "good" relationship with. If you have a question, you shouldn't be scared to ask and if you get on well with the teacher it is much easier to do so. I have had also some personal experiences where I was happy to have a teacher who could realte well to the students. During that time, I loved to go to his lessons and I learned very well too. And for me, who has also a lot of problems with partciping herself during the lessons, it was also much easier to talk and to give answers to exercises we had to do. As a result, I had better oralmarks and this was also a motivation for me to do this in other subjects with other teachers, even though I hadn't a relationship to them that was that good as it was with the other teacher. 
So my personal opinion to this statement is, that a teacher should have a knowledge of his subject which is that good that he's able to teach it well to the students. But he should also have the ability to relate well to the students and I think that is nearly more important than the knowledge.
