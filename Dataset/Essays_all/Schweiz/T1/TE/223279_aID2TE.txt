Teachers

In this essay, I'll write about teachers, their behaviour, their knowledge and my own opinion to this subject.

The knowledge is very important. When the teacher can't answer a question of a student, he isn't good in his job. The students have to learn something in school, and when they don't, it isn't a school. But it is no problem, when the teacher doesn't know a detail, and he haven't to be ashamed to look up something on the internet or in a book.

It's also important, how the teacher teachs the students. Students must be motivated by their teacher. And when they are motivated, they learn much better. When the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students, the students automaticly listen to the teacher, and there is a good atmosphere in the classroom, where the students can learn much better.

It is not an easy question, which of these two subjects are more important. But in this case, I think, the knowledge must be there. A teacher is not a good teacher, when a student ask him something and he doesn't know the answer. In some situations it is not a problem, when the teacher doesn't know the answer.  It's also important, that a teacher can teach the students well. He has the education for this. A teacher, who doesn't treat the students well, isn't on the right place. In past, teacher have hit their students. Today, we can't imagine this, and we all know, that wasn't a good idea. After all, we must go to school, no matter in which age. This time we'll never forget, and it must be a great time of our life.
