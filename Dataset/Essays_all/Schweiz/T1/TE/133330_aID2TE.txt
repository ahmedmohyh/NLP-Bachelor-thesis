This essay is about the question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

On one hand students have a really hard time if the teacher can not relate well with the students. For example the french teacher of our class gives us huge amounts of homework and is really angry if we don't do all of them. Furthermore she does not realise that it is far too much, so we end up doing 45 min of homework for just one subject. Now, when you have 5 subject a day plus tests it is nearly impossible to do everything.

On the other hand it is really important that teachers have great knowledge of the subject or (s)he won't be able to teach. 
When i was younger I once had a french teacher who couldn't teach at all. We didn't learn anything the very same year in french, because of him.
The next year we got a new teacher. We had this big problem. We were forced to learn more difficult topics, but we did not have the skills to do so. The new teacher told us to learn the stuff at home that we should have learned the year before, but it was nearly impossible to learn it on our own, especially because we were students, not teachers.

In the end I would disagree with the statement because of my long experience with different kinds of teachers. I do not think a teacher's abitlity to relate well with students is more important than great knowledge of the subject. The best they can do is finding a balance between empathy and knowledge. So they can understand worries and problems of the students but also try to make them understand the knowledge they need to graduate from school.
