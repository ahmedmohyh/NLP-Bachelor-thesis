First of all I think that a relation between students and the teacher is really important. Through a good relation with the students you explore the needs and wishes of them. Maybe they inspire you to creat better exercises and lessons. If they have a right to influence the classes than they raise up more their hands during the lessons and in general enjoy to go to school. In my opinion if the students do not have a good relation with their teachers the teachers won`t get any attention from them. Teachers also have to present the stuff in an understandable way and this is just possible when they know their students well.

But on the other hand to just have a good relation with your students is not enough. If they notice that the teacher does not know what he is talking about they lose the respect and the teacher loses his authority. I am sure that the lessons would get very messy and nobody would really listen. A big issue is also that the students do not learn important things and when they have exams they maybe fail the tests. Some students are ambitious and want to get as many informations as possible but when you have a bad teacher this will not work.

In Fact there are many arguments which support both abilities but finally I think it is more important to havea big knowledge of the subject being thaught. Why? Because maybe you do not havethe best social skills but you know what you are telling your students and they always get an answer.
