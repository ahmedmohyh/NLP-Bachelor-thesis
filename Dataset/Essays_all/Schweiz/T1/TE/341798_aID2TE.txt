A teacher without good knowledge of the subject is of course not fully able to teach anything specific about the matter.
Thus it is very important, that the teacher does know his own subject.
As an example: a teacher can only teach English, if he speaks it himself good enough.
But a teacher must also be able to transfer this knowledge to the students, so they can really learn and understand it.
This makes it also very important for the teachers to be able to relate with their students.
An example would be a teacher just holding a monolgue for hours whilst none of the students can follow him.
It is not impossible for the students to learn something from a teacher, who isn't very good at teaching,
as he can tell them a lot about the subject, but he can't adjust the information given to the students,
so they may get frustrated because of a too fast or too slow pace or something the like.
On the other hand a teacher who knows only little but can actually transmit it in a good manner might encourage the students more.
But then again, if there is not much to teach it is again just a waste of time and would get dull very quickly.
All in all, it is hard to say, which of the two is more important as they are both needed for a teacher to be able to teach and the students to be able to lear.
Thus I do disagree with the statement above as the knowledge of a teacher is just as important as his teaching capabilities.
