That is kind of a critical statement to just say without an explanation. Of course it`s important to be well conected to the students as a teacher, but at same time it`s also very important to know your stuff as a teacher.
In my opinion, I would at first agree with the statement, that it is more important, or above the knowledge to relate well with students, because I met the other kind of teacher, who did have a huge knowledge, but no one could understand him. But when I think about it, there are some very important points. When I agree with the second statement, what is it useful for, when I`m super intelligent, or I have a super intelligent teacher, who knows all about his subject he teaches, for example: math, when he`s not able to teach me how it`s done. But on the other hand, it`s also not enough, when my teacher is so well related with me/ us, and very gentle, when he doesn`t know what to teach or doesn`t have enough answers.
In my "schol career" I met both kind of teachers, therefore I can say, both aspects are very very important for a student. If you have to ask questions about a certain subject, the teacher must know his stuff and probaly give you the answer immediately, but on the other hand, it`s useless for a student, when teachers explain you something, and you have no clue what he talks about (but certanly he understands his bussiness).
A good combination of both would be the perfect kind of teacher.
So back to the original statement: "a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" I can say now, that maybe it`s not the most important thing to be highly well related with the students, but just have a normal "student - teacher relationsship"  and at the same time you don`t need to know everything of the subject in the first place but be well informed of your subject is important as well.
