Relation over knowledge?

Students who are around 16-22 years old often speak bad about their teachers, because it's the time where these boys and girls, have a bit more problems at school, what means they get worser marks than befor. They are saying that it's all the teachers fault, because they are just caring about themselfs and not the students. Then there is also a other group of Teachers, they are kind, they help each student but at the end of the year you learned actually nearly nothimg at all. So what is better for our sociaty, for our futur?

In my Opinion a bad relation to the teacher isn't good, because then the students often do have the problem of being demotivatet at school, university or in each lesson. This means that the Teachers are telling good stuff, also in a good way that you could understand what he is talking about, but the students are just that demotivatet, that they are caring about everything , facebook, instagram etc., but not about what the teacher is saying, because they are just there to lisent all day long to the same stuff and arn't includet into the lesson. 

Even worse, what I think, is when a teacher has a good relation to the students but is just telling shit or nonsens in front of the students, because then, when they go on in their life's, they will have problem to get on well, just beacause they learned dumb stuff by heart, what is actually wrong. 

So in the end for me is the knowledge which is thaught more important than the teacher's ability to relate well with students. Because at some point of your career you must have that self disciplin to do the stuff you need to do. And if your at that point, at which nearly each student will get, you really need a teacher who know's what he is talking about.
