Is it optimal to either have a teacher who can relate very well with the students, or that he has excellent knowledge of the subject which is being taught? 
The quote "A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." says, that it is more important to have a good relations with the students. I can totally agree with this statement because i think its way more important that the teacher has good pädagogische skills than knowlegde of the subject which he teaches. For example, a good teacher has to be serious but also should be a little bit funny in a certain way. Teachers should also beable to not only teach their subject, but also samachtafang the students with hasemafing.
