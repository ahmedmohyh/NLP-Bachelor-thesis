For a teacher its important to have a big knowledge from his subject. Although he have to relate well with the stundents. 

First of all i want to talk about the "friendship".
If you as a teacher relate well with your students, its easier to teach them. Because the students like you, so they will have attention of your rules, and they listen to you, and may the learning make more "fun".
As a students its,if i wrote, much easier to lern then if you like your teacher, then you like go to school/to this subject. But if not you might don't like it. So you think "Ouuuh no I have to go to chemistry" for example. In the most cases the teacher teach to boring, so you get tired when you listen to him, and that's the wrong way.

Secondly the knowledge of the teacher
As a student you will know very fast, if the teacher don't have an excellent knowledge of his subject. For example you ask him something, and don't get a really right answer. At some teacher you see that he or she know much about his subject, but can't give to his students in an easy way.

Finally, i think it is very important that the teacher knows well his subject. He has to study it and give it in the easiest way as possible to the students. I had also teacher they can't do this, and explain you something in a very difficult way. You can't understand it. But after you realise that is was so easy to understand, the problem was the teacher and how he teachs you. 
So the best thing would be, if the students like the teacher, for example he sometimes makes a little joke and can laugh with his students. But on the other hand know much of his subject and can give it in the best way to his class.
