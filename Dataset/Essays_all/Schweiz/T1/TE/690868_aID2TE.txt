There is nothing wrong about a teacher having a good connection with his students. It's easier and more agrable for him to teach and the students aren't already in a bad mood before they walk in just because they may have a bad relation with the teacher. Probably we can go a step further and say that a good "climate" in the classroom has a positive influnce to the learnprocess. Students are more focused and don't hold questions back just because they don't want to talk to the teacher or even worse, because they are afraid of him. 

But then again we have to admit that a lack of knowledge is a big problem for the teacher and as well for the students. Because if the teacher doesn't know what he is teaching or is teaching them even wrong things, it gets really boring and what are the students then in school for? They could be at home and make researches in the internet and in the end they would have learned more than in school. What would our future look like if all get wrong or different informations? That would creat a catastrophe.
The other way round is it also kind of embarassing if a student asks a question and the teacher doesn't know the right answear. At least in the higher levels of school, as more specific it gets, teachers should be experts in the subjects they are teaching (and in most cases they are).

My personal opinion to the statement is, that there has to be bouth to reach a high level of (right) knowledge. The interaction between students and teacher has to be given and it also needs some kind of trust. Having a good relation makes things easier. The teacher must know what he is talking about, otherwise school wouldn't make any sens and it would indeed be kind of embarassing for him, if he would not know a thing from what he is talking about.
