"A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than exxcellent knowledge of the subject being thaught." This is for me a very interessting statement. From time to time this subject is discusted in the newspaper." Are the teacher in our time to nice to the students and the knowledgenof the subject gets more and more lost?"
If the students are not so good in school, it is important that the teacher relate well with the students and he should also motiwate them to learn something new. If he don't do that the students loose the happyness of learning something and they are not happy to go to school.
If a teacher is too nice to the students and like a friend for them it isn't also that good, because the students loose theyr respect from the teacher and they do what they want.
In the higher schools like the gymnasium it is more important, that he has a excellent knowledge of the subject becaus the social problems between the students aren't that high.
For me, a teacher should have both. A abiltity to relate well with students and also a good knowledge of the subject. But in the lower schools the social aspect is more important than the knowledge of the subject, because there are more social problems between the students. In the Gymnasium a teacher should have a excellent knowledge of the subject which he teachs.
