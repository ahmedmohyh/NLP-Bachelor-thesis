Most children worldwide get an education by going to school. There they face many struggles concerning their work, classmates and also teachers. Teachers have a very inportant role in schools and every teacher has a differnet way of teaching. Some are more connected and personal with the students and others are more strict and distanced. Many ask themselves the question if it is more inportant for the teachers to be able  to relate to the students or for them to have great knowledge in their subject.

Teachers with great experience and knowledge are probably most asked for and employed. They have the ability to share their knowledge with the students and challenge them in many ways.They can bring depth and really go to the core of the subject.

However if these teachers do not posess the ability to teach and relate to the students, it makes everything more difficult. Teachers which are 'connected' with the students and have a good relationship with them have other strengths.They can keep the students motivated, interested and make them feel inportant, which leads to a good atmosphere in class.

I personally think it is more inportant to have a teacher that can relate to one. I have many teachers that have great knowledges in there domaine, however their teaching skills are fairly low. This will surely depend from person to person.
