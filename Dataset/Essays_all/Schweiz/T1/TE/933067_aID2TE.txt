Teachers are the most important part of the education. In the best case, children look up to teachers and see them as their idol. The teacher, therefore, needs to have an excellent knowledge of his or her subject as well as the ability to approach the students.  However, there has been a debate, whether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge.

Some may argue that without the teacher's ability to approach or to relate well with the students it might not be impossible to teach students. In the "Kantonsschule Wohlen" this can be seen very often. Numerous teachers do not try and relate well with students. As an effect, most student start to dislike those subjects and the motivation decreases. If students reach such a "low", it appears to be nearly impossible for a teacher to get them out. Accordingly, a teacher must relate well with students. 

However, some disagree with this fact. In Switzerland students should be grateful for their education in terms of costs and quality because in other countries such as Kenia children are not able to go to school due to their long way to school or simply due to the costs as school in Kenia is not free. Therefore, a teacher's relationship with students is not the most important feature when teaching. Instead, the students must be motivated and attempt to have a good relationship with the teacher as the teacher's major role is to teach and show an excellent knowledge of his subjects in order for the student to pass the upcoming exams. 

In conclusion, a teacher needs to fulfil both factors, having an excellent knowledge as well as the ability to relate well. Nevertheless, in my opinion an excellent knowledge is the basis for being a teacher. Without having it it seems to be impossible to teach, whereas it is possible to teach without the ability to relate well.
