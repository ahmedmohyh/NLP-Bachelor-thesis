Nowadays all parents want their children to have a widely knowledge of everything but they also should relate with the teachers. But what is more important?

First of all the teacher should get along with his class, because if not they will have problems for years and nobody learns anything. For example if a teacher does not get along with a class, the class could make fun of himself and this could have the result that the teacher will be more severe and the pupils will think that they get treatend unfair. It could also be the other way around, if the class and the teacher relate perfectly and the teacher can not be objective for example at a test correction, so he is not fair about the students grades.

On the other hand, who do you help with if the students do not understand the subject being taught but they are able to relate with the teacher. So, they have no idea of the subject and this does not help them pass any exams. The teachers went to school to learn how to taught us things, so they should be able to do this. In the future students are alone and if they have no knowledge they can not have the same future as if they had had a teacher who knows how to taught and no to relate. 

In my opinion there is only one reason why teachers getting paid, because they should taught us the subject matter and not to get along with us, so I do not agree with the statement. Our parents send us to school to learn something not to relate with the teacher. Sure in kindergarden there it is important to relate with the kids and to play with them but the higher up you go in the school systeme the more the teachers should have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
