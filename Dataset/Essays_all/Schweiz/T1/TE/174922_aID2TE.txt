I totally agree with the statement. In my opinion it is way more important to have teachers with good charisma instead of teachers with more knowledge of their subject.

A Teacher with more charisma is able to relate well with his or her students and kids who like their teachers will rather listen to them than kids who are annoyed by their teacher. Being a teacher should be much more than teaching some students. Too much information will bore kids just as adults. Even more when you don't like the person who is teaching you. If a teacher is only able to talk about his own subject but can't handle the more personal problems of his students, like when they are on vacation during schooldays, he won't really teach as much as a teacher who does really care about his students.

But if you can handle the students you are teaching and all of their problems they will not just listen to the things they're being taught, they will also try to understand it. If the students like their teacher, they will put more effort in understanding what he is saying and they will write better marks, will work harder.

Also in my personal expirience it was always like that. I wrote my best marks in the subjects being taught by teachers who I liked the most. I also had teachers who I disliked and not only me but my whole class wrote really bad marks under the education of this teachers. Just because nobody wanted to listen to them.

In conclusion I can say without a doubt, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than escellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
