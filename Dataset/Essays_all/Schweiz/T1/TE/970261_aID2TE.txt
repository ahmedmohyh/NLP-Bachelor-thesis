It is much more important to get on well with the students, than knowing the subject excellent. If you can win the students for you, the students will atomatically be interested in what you say. If you just talk about a topic and the students aren't even a bit interested, it is like you would teach them nothing. At the end "nothing" would be more cool, than hearing how your teacher talks about some high topics. I mean it is of course important to have a good or excellent knowledge about what you are talking but that means nothing if the student don't listen to. So it is importante to have a mix of both abilitys. You should relate well with your students and you should also have a huge knowledge, because that's what teachers are actually payed for. I know it from myself, that boring teachers mostly teach the stuents nothing, and the result is a bad mark. Teachers have to make lessons a little bit more specific and cool. Of course it's not just the fault of the teachers. if you are a unmotivated student, you lost anyway as a teacher. Those kind of people must be very hard for teachers. But that's how life is. A few weeks ago i was in a language stay, all the teachers came every morning very motivated and that was good, because if the teacher is in a good mood, the students will be too. But the teachers there didn't have that much knowledge, that was the bad thing about it. So you can see it is very hard to balance these to abilities. You are a teacher who relates well with students or a teacher who has a excellent knowlege. That was my text about the statement.
