A teachers task is to make the students understand and keep knowing a topic. In the best of all cases, it is even fun to work on it. That is no duety, but it should also not be to boring. To make the students knowing something, it is of course necessary that you have some knowledge as well about what you are teaching. So I think, no teacher, no matter how well he can teach or relate to students, is able to fullfill his task if he has just a tiny or even knowledge of the topic discussed. But on the other hand side, if you have a teacher who knows a lot, but can't relate to you as a student well, you are normaly less motivated to learn and in the end, most don't know the topic that they should have had learned sometimes.
So I think, a mixture of both is the best, because none of the cases from above is what I want. Because of the arguments above, I think it is best to have a teacher with a bit more knowledge that social skill, because what really counts for later is the knowledge of certain things and not how much fun it was to learn it. But still you need a teacher with some social skill, because otherwise you don't learn that much. But what I think is the most important skill to have is the ability to make the students remember the stuff you told them and to not quickly forget it
