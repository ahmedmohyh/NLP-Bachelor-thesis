It is important for students that they learn as much in school as possible. But which methos is the most effective one? Should the teacher have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or is it more important that the teacher is able to relate with his students?

One one side a teacher who doesn't know something about his subject isn't a teacher. How are the students suppose to understand the subject if the teacher doesn't know a lot about it? It's impossible to know everything about it but a general knowledge needs to exist. In the best case he is able to explain it in different ways because his knowledge about the subject goes beyond general knowledge. A good example is when a math teacher tries to teach a new formula to his students. The problem; the students don't understand the formula. So if the teacher has a big knowledge he can try to explain it to his students in a different way, the chance the students will understand is is bigger. 

On the other hand it's important that teachers relate with their students. How do they want to teach them something if they can't gain their respect and trust? A teacher can't teach someone who doesn't really listen to him. If they can't relate with their students, why should they want to learn something from a teacher? For example a teacher tries to explain a mathematic formula to his students but if he explains it in such a high or difficult language, how will the students understand how the teacher gets to this formula? 

You can argue which methode is better but in my opinion the relation between a teacher to his students is way more important than his knowledge about a subject.
