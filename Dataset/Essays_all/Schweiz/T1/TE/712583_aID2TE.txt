The job as a teacher isnt always easy, you have to be well prepared for every lesson, fit it in 45 minutes time but also you have to interact with your students, even the more difficult minds, and understand them. Teachers are expected to have an excellent knwoledge about the subjedt they are teaching, but also to have the ability to relate well witht their students. But is the last point mentioned more important then the first one? 
First of all, as a teacher you have to have a basic knwoledge about what you are teaching, without that you wouldnt be a teacher, but having more knwoledge about your subject is always better. So teacher with an excellent knowledge of their subject can always be seen as better teacher.
Although the ability to relate to the students, to understand their way of thinking and to be able to explain them stuff is at least equal important. For me personally it is even a lot more important to have a good relation to your students, to make them like you as a person but also respect you as a teacher and to make the topic even more interesting by involving students actively.
You can argue with the point that without a accurate knowledge, it is not possible to teach the students the topic in the most intersting way. That may be correct, but as a teacher you have the opportunity to make your class more interesting by using lots of different way to teach, for example sometimes using the beamer, other times using the blackboard, which does prevent the class from getting boring.
In the end, i think the ability to relate well to your students is much more important then having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but still being well informed how to teach and how to make the students take part actively and not boring them. Because this ability allows you to have a good relation to your students and get theit interest for the topic, as well as make them respect you as a teacher.
