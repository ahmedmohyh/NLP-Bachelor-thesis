A class has to have a good atmosphere to work concentrated and learn friendly together. To guarantee that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

If a teacher do not really know what he is takling about in frot of the class and can not explain things properly to the stundets, it makes no sense to relate well to the studens. Because if they do not learn the subjects well, they might pass the test by their teacher, but if they need it later on in their life, for exampe in university or in their future job, they will have big problems beacuse the have not learned it properly and they can not ask their teacher from earlier, 

Aditionally to that, good explaining is a result of excellent knowledge of a subject. So if a teacher explains thing good and properly to the students, he or her will automatically build up a fantastic realationship with the stundets. Because if a stundent has success in a subject, thanks to the teacher's eplainings and accurate knowledge, it will lead to a good relation, no doubt! 

On the other hand, if the teacher has good knowledge but is mean and rude to everyone, students will start hating the teacher or even hating the subject and many will not learn any more. Therefore a teacher always has to have an ability to relate well with stundents.

I think that it is more important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught than relate really well with students. But yes of course he or her has to have a good kind of relationship to the students. In my opinion a good teacher can do both and lead their students to the target, where they want to be.
