I agree, but also disagree with the statement. 

I disagree with it, because I think the teacher has to know something about his subject, he/she teaches. Maybe a little bit more than just every adult knows. It wouldn't make any sense, when you would have a teacher that doesn't know much about his subject. When you would ask him/her questions then, and he/she could never answer it, it doesn't bring him/her much when he or she has the ability to relate well with the students, and it doesn't bring you much either. Yeah, we're also in school to have a bit fun and stuff like that, but we have to learn something for later as well. Especially it would be depressing for a student, when he/she would have a teacher with not a great knowledge in a subject, he/she later wants to study.

But I agree with it, because, what brings you an excellent knowledge of the subject you teach, when you can't relate well with students. When you have a teacher, that can't relate well with you, you don't have the motivation to do something in class, and to go there as well (just my opinion). And when the subject, don't really interests you, you just want the lessons to be over, what for both, the teacher and the students is very annoying. It then would also seems ,like the teacher would have no fun, doing his job, what is depressing for him/her as well for us. 

So I think a mix between both, the ability to relate well with students and a good knowledge of the subject,would be perfect. But perfection is difficult. So when I would have to pick one thing that seems more important to me, i would pick the ability to relate well with students.
