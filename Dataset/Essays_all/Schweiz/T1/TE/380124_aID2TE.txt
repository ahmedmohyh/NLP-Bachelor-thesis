I think the ability to relate well with stundents and excellent knowledge of the subject are both very important for a teacher. If a teacher knows much he can answer nearly every question a student will ask and that will help the student to improve. If a teacher is well knowledged he will never have trouble finding a new subject or a new task for the students. And I think when students realise, that a teacher knows what he does, they will start to respect him and do as he says.  Who would listen to a teacher, who is talking nonsense the whole time? On the other hand ,relating well with the students is a very important thing aswell. If a teacher has a good relationship with the stundents, then first of all the students will like him, he will like them and that will cause a good atmosphere in his lessons. I think that if students like a teacher they get more motivated when they go to his lessons and being motivated means listening more carefull and that means learning more. The same goes fot the teacher aswell, if he likes the class he will probably enjoy it more and that will make him teach better .Who likes to go to a teacher or a class he doesn't like?  In conclusion I think that both abilitys are very important. You can be a good teacher with both ways, but only as long as you do have a bit of the other thing aswell. I think its impossible to be a good teacher by just having a good relationship. If a teacher  knows less to nothing the students will realise that soon enough and will evetually dislike him. The same goes for a knowledged teacher, if he is being hated by his class he can know everything, but as long as noone is listening to him, he can't do his job properly. In the end I disagree with the statement I think both abilitys are as important.
