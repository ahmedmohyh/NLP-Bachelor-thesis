Every student knows the situation. You love one particular subject but you can't handle the the teacher's abilty to relate with the class. Is it because he or she can't communicate with the class, he/she is taking his/her job too serious or is it because they try to keep the school life as it was when they started teaching, which was like fifty years ago.
Eventhough school life is more enjoyable when you have teachers that you like, it won't help you when it's time for the exams. A teacher who is nice and understanding isn't a help for any student when he/she can't bring the knowledge to the students. 
On the other hand, the teacher has to build a bridge first to the students before the serious teaching starts. They have to know what kind of class it is and mustn't see the class as a grey mass but as a group of individuals where everyone has his/her own way of studying and progress the knowledge.
In my case, I really enjoy it, when the teacher gets along well with me and my 24 classmates. We had a teacher in chemistry once. He was one of that calm and nice teachers. Eventhough I liked to go in his class, after one year of chemistry my level was quit low. Now we have a new teacher, a woman, about who was told that she was some kind of dragon. Very strict and tolerates nothing. After 4 lessons of chemistry with her, I have learnt more than in one whole year.
So my summary is, that a nice teacher relates well with the class, a good teacher has an excellent knowledge but an ideal teacher knows how to bring this knowledge to the students.
