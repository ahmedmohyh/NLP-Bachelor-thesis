Many people underestimate teachers. I am sure a lot of us have thought about becoming a teacher once in our life because we thought it would be easy and fun. But is it really easy? Which qualities define what a good teacher is? Is it important for a teacher to be empathetic or does he just have an extended knowledge of his subject?
In my opinion, the easiest way to approach all these questions is by thinking of the worst and the best teachers we have had and why we felt that way about them.
Usually, people tend to love the teachers who smile a lot, the ones who are easy-going and nice, the ones you dare to talk to whenever you feel uncomfortable or scared. First of all, when this kind of teacher wins the students sympathy, they will be much more open minded and willing to pay attention in the lesson, that's why the students perform better in exams. The teachers who are very social and friendly also know exactly how a person might feel since they are used to be around people. So when a teacher knows the way their students think, it will be much easier to teach. It is like when doctors diagnose a person, they are only able to do this, because they have a better understanding of the human body. 
In my experience the worst teachers are quite introverted, they do not seem to know anything about authority, the terrible ones, are awkward and get angry easily.  This kind of teacher, lets say we are talking about a mathematics teacher, has been studying maths for years, so for him, everything is crystal clear but they do not understand, that everything is new for the students. 
I think it is a lot of work to be empathetic, therefore, I admire all my teachers. Finally, my conclusion is, that the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with the students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is true.
