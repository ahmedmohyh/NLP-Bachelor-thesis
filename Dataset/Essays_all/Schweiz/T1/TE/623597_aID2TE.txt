The ability to relate well with students is very important because you must understand the student that want to learn something from you. When you relate with your student you can more easily teach him. The student will better understand the topic. The teacher could help him more easily when he understands where the problem is and why it is so hard for the student to understand. An excellent knowledge of a subject is important too. Because when you understand the subject that you taught, you can easily know where the problem is and how you could solve it. When you know so much about something it's good for the student because he can ask how many he want and you will ever have an answer. I think a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than an excellent knowledge because when you understand a topic that is very easy to you it's hard to explain it for someone that don't understand nothing in this topic. If you understand something it doesn't mean that someone else could understand it so easily how you do. It's often that you can't teach someone when you don't relate with him, why it is so problematic for him to understand the main topic. But a knowledge is important too without a knowledge in a subject you can't understand it. How the student should understand when the teacher doesn't understand it. My opinion is that a knowledge is important but the excellent knowledge without the ability to relate well with students isn't enough.
