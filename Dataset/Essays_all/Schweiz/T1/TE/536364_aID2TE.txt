Teachers

Should a teacher be a friend? Should a teacher have excelent knowledge? When do you really like a teacher? Everyone has diffrent imaginations of a perfect teacher. But everyone wants a friendly and clever teacher for sure. And ones may say that one qualitiy is better than the other.

It is very important that the teachers have a good relation with their students. They have to motivate them and encourage them to learn. But if a teacher is too much a friend, a student might lose the respect to the teacher. Maybe the lessons would be too loud and stundents, who have problems with understanding might lose their motivation of learning something new, because they can't concetrate properly. Even though, it is not good to be emotionless towards the students. They shouldn't be too bossy, but they should keep up their authority.

Knowledge is not everything in life. If a teacher is unfriendly, but have excellent knowledge, there wouldn't be a winner either. The students would lose their motivation and they wouldn't work properly during the lessons, because of the bad mood in the classroom. It would be the same case if the teacher is friendly but has no knowledge. If the teacher can't explain doubts of the students, the class might lose confidence and respect. The teacher would not be able to have control over the class and whether the class, nor the teacher would be happy. 

In my opinion, there has to be a healthy mixture of good relation with students and excellent knowledge. I think the secret weapon of teachers is their knowledge. And to keep up a human relationship you need nothing, but kindness. If a teacher is whether friendly or not very bright, this person is doing the wrong job. Both qualities are equal important to give their stundents a enrichment in their lifes.
