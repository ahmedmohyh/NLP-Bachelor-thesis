The question if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject can't be answered with yes or no.I made experiences with a teacher who had a good relation to us students. He were fair, he helped us if we had any problems and if we didn't feel ready to write an exam we wouldn't write it. It was no problem if we haven't done the homework and during the lessons we could "work" outside the classroom. It was fun and easy but in fact we didn't learn anything. If we finally wrote an exam half of the class would be under a 4. And this wasn't just beacuse the teacher permitted us so much, also because he couldn't explain the subject, mathematics. He made many mistakes by solving an exercise with us and if we asked he didn't know and couldn't explain. And finally we will have to write the Matur and then it doesn't matter if the teacher was friendly or not, then the only thing that matters is how much you've learned.
But is it better to have a teacher who knows everything of the subject he's teaching but can't relate well with students? I'd say defenitly not. If a teacher doesn't get on well with his students it can be because he's unfair, because he can't imagine how people of this age are and feel or because he's not interested in his students and of course many other reasons. Such a teacher can cause that students start to hate the subject because of the teacher. Maybe they start doing nothing during the lessons to protest. And in the end it's again the student who looses because he has to write the exams and finally the Matur. 
My oppinion is, that the best teacher is the one who can do both, relate well with the students and teach the subjects or even have a good balance of the two things.
