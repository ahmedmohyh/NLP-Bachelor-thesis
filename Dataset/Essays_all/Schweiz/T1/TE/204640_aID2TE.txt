From the age of six till the age of 15 children have to go to school. These are the most important years in childhood, because in this periode of time each child gets more mature and learns the most importent things for their life. They learn easier and need a role model to which they can  look up. Praents, teachers and as well siblings are such role models. 
The most statements of children about primary school are: It's boring. I don't like school. Teachers are soo mean. But these statements aren't worng as far as I can remember my primary school years.
Some teachers are old and close to retire. Their lessons are boring and mostly really strict. The pupils don't have convidence to ask questions and are scared of the teachers. The gap between the teachers and the pupils is somehow too big and there isn't a relation. As well the lessons aren't actual. They use sheets from twelve years ago on which the whole lesson is built. Other teachers are more like a collegue. They can handle the pupils easily and know how the react on what they say.
In my opinion its really important that teachers can relate well with the students. You first need the attention of the students or pupils and then you can have usefull lessons. The knowledge of a techer is important as well. But how should a teacher teach  students if the don't have respect and attention of him?  It's impossible and that's why it's firstly important that they have their respect and attention, as well are like a role model and then they can teach their knowledge to them as good as possible.
