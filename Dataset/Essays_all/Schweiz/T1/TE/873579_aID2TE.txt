Right now, everyone in my age knows exactely about the relationship and the contact with teachers, because we are or were in school in our age. So we know the differences between the teachers very well. For example the differences between the strategy tea of teaching and and the personal contact with the students.
Basically  the target of every teacher is to give the knowledge in his subject as good and clear as possible to the students. But there are very different ways they are trying to reach this target. From the point of view of the students, its much easier to understand the stuff, when the teacher has a good base of personality with the pupils, because in that case you listen more interessted and more concentrated. So, like its written in this statement.
In my opinion, or to say it more exactely, in my eperiences, i liked a subject much more when I get on well with the teacher, because I liked to went in his lessons, then to go to a lesson with a teacher, with who I dont get on well.
In the most cases these teachers who are on the same psycological level like the students, will understand the students better, so like, they are more "human" and have a more human thingking than other teachers who are realy fixed on the stuff they have to teach. Like itsmeant in the statement  with the excellent knowledge of subject being taught.
But otherwise when a teacher is too friendly or too less focused on the knowledge, you will also learn nothing. SO the teacher has to find a good midlewax to create his arte of teaching and bringing his knowledge to the students.
So to concluse this essay, I would agree this statement, because finally you learn more with a teacher you get on well.
