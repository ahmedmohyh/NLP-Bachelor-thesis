It's really important to relate well with students. Students feel more comfortable and talk more in lessons if they have a good relationship with their teacher. The school lessons are more about discussions and not only theory. This leads to higher production and efficiency from students. 
Of course a teacher should have well knowledge about the subjects he or she teaches. In my opinion it's impossible to know everything. If there comes up a question which teachers doesn't know an answer for, they should look for it and tell it in the next lesson. But when teachers seems to know to less about the subject, it will become problematic. If they doesn't know every third question, they're maybe not qualified to teach or to teach this specific subject. 
Another important point of view is when a teacher has the excellent knowledge and explains in this way as well, it's hard to follow for students who have problems in this subject. Because a teacher can't understand, for example in maths, that the "easiest steps" are hard to work out for a student. They do a good job for the ones who are great in maths but not for the ones with weaknesses in this subject.
Therefore I agree with this statement. Because no one is able to know everything and always has an answer for every questions. A student may make a teacher think about a statement, for example in history, in a totally new way. In my opinion it's better when I notice, the teacher thought about my question and gives me a serious answer. A lesson which is good is for me one in which we are able to discuss andtalk about different point of views and there isn't only right or wrong. I feelmuch better in such lessons and it makes me listen.
