Which subject do I prefer? Math or biology? Of course math. You ask me why? Because of the teacher. 

I think it is very important that the teacher relates well with the students and also that the students like the teacher. Students are more looking forward to a subject with a nice teacher then to a subject with a teacher they don't like. The teacher doesn't have to be a friend but a person the students can talk to and of course also laugh with. 
In my opinion our class is more interested in, for exemple, italian then in other subjects because our teacher relates very well with us so we like her. 
But I would not say it's more important that the teacher relates well with us than what he is teaching. I want to learn something from my teacher and don't have to see a friend in him. So both are important. The teacher has to find a good mixture between "realating well with his students" and "teaching well and interestingly". And of course there isn't THE PERFECT TEACHER. Every teacher has his own methode of being a good teacher and not for every student THE PERFECT TEACHER means the same. So maybe I prefer our math teacher but my friend prefers our biology teacher because he relates better with him. I can't answer yes or no to this question, but my answer would be that a teacher who can find a good mixture is quite a good teacher.
