There are alot of diffrent types of theachers in this world and they all have their own style of teaching. Now its to decide which of them is better and helps the students more and which not. It's hard to really say because almost every style has it's good and bad sides. But is it more important to be able to relate well or to have an excellent knowlege of the subject? 
I think it depends on the knowlege the teacher, who is able to relate well with students, has and on the level of the school he's teaching in. But in general the excellent knowlege of their subject is more important, because students go to school to learn something and therefore they schould be taught correct things. If the teacher doesen't know his subject, his students won't know it either. Its true that students learn better and more willingly if the teacher relates well to them. But they learn for nothing because after school they can't do anything with wrong knowlege. They have a better and less stressful time in school but is that worth a lack of knowlege? 
I don't think so because the school is here to prepare for life as an adult if the stundets come out of school and can't do anything they'r lost. The school and therefore the teacher has to help and even educate joung people. If they don't get that they need help afterwards and aren't able to stand on their own feet.
