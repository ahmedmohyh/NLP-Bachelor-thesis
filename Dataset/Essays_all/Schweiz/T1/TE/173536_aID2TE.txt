This is indeed a very controversial topic. In my opinion there isn't a wrong or a right answer. The profession of a teacher includes both of these two abilities. 
Of course we can discuss which one is more beneficial to the students and which one is more is more important to their success in the future . 
Being a teacher isn't just about having an excellent knowledge in certain subjects. It is also about teaching and passing on that knwoledge. 
It is important to have a good connection to your students otherwise they won't actually listen to you or just not be that concentrated. If you are a teacher you really should like kids. You should be able to relate well with them and have an understanding of what they like and what they don't. 
You shouldn't work in a zoo and not like animals. You shouldnt work on a boat and hate the sea. You should like the things that surround you when you're working. As a teacher it is also important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. But it's not as important as the social skills that are required in this profession. I want to ask you dear reader. Have you ever had a moment in your childhood when you were at school when the teacher was just being an absolute idiot. Did you care about his excellent knowledge or did you miss the teacher's  ability to relate well with you.
