First, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important. Because, if a student is afraid of his teacher, he can not speak with him about problems in the class. 
Oh the other hand, it is also very important that the teacher knows what about he tells and explains. Otherwise the childern will learn something wrong and they won't be able to go to an university later.
In conclusion, this is a very difficult statement, then for me are these two points the most essential ones for to be a good teacher. In my opinion it is not possible to be a good teacher, if he can not relate well with his students or can not explaine very well  and everyone can understand it.
