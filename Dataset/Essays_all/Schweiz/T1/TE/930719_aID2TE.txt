In the first case, you`re going to school to learn something and not to have new friends like teachers.  You want to learn more for the thing you`re going to study or simply for yourself. That the teacher has to know more than the students is usual.

But I think you could say that it`s more important that the teacher relate well with the students. The teacher knows how to teach that you think it`s important and it could be funny. He knows how you have motivation and how he has to work with you. I think when the students are in the classroom and they like the `climate`, they are more motivated to learn new things. And if something is unclear you aren`t afraid to ask. And if the teacher also did`t know, it`s no problem to look it up in books or in the internet. Teachers are also only people, and it`s usual that you couldn`t know everything.

So in my opinion I think it`s more important for students that they relate well with the teacher, he don`t has to have an excellent knowledge. But that shouldn`t mean that he have to be nice every time and he only have to give well grates. He has to be the priority person in the room. But how I told you, I`m very more intressted when the teacher is sympathic. I like it very much more to go to a lesson where you have a nice teacher, who understands us/me and knows how to teach it that we understand it. So he didn`t have to know everything. So I agree with the argument.
