This is a qustion which is highly disscused by all the students, especially our own class. The opinions varry a lot and it really depends who you re asking. Now however; I want to state my opinion on this topic

For me the "excellent knowledge" is more important than a very good relationship with the teacher.I am here to get my Matura so that I can go on and study at a good swiss university, due to that I am very focused on my studies and especially on my grates. In case you have a very chatty and nice teacher you will not make as much progress as you would like to, eventhou you really enjoy going to these "fun" lessons. The point of going to a gymnasium in Switzerland is not how I already said having as much fun as possible. If you have a teacher who is really focused on the subject and one who is really well informed, every student will tell you that he or she actually dont mind going to these teachers. All the students just know if the they have such a lesson they have to be more focused and should just keep quiet. Further more it can be said that the  working atmosphere is way better compared to a very chatty and friendly teacher where it can happen that you walk out of a lessons finding you ask yourself "what did I just learned in these 45 minutes?"

On the other hand it also must be siad that the lessons with teachers you really get along with at the most fun. For some students this is more important than being best prepared for university. In the case you have such a nice teacher it actually doesnt mean you dont make progress at all. It can be very helpfull to have one or two teachers like this because they can really motivate you in case you re a little bit down in the dump.

The best for me is really a good mix between the both types. In my opinion in a lesson should be space to have fun, but the study part should not be forgotten.
