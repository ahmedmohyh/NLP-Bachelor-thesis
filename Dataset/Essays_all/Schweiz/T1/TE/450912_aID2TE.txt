Yes, I think so. If you have a teacher who is not able to socialice with students or even talk normal to them there won't be a big succes by teaching them something. I think it is good to comunicate well with your teacher, because on this way you can get rid of conflicts and further different aspects in meanings. Especially in primary school its important to relate with students that they can communicate in their future life. As a teacher, your main exercise is to teach your students in their subject, but if you're not relatet to them there is no way to teach them without having an akward tension between them. The knowledge is realy important but in the end you can say, the realtion is more. In most cases the teachers with big knowledge are like nerds and not capeble with social life.  As secondary school teacher the relation is less important and in further schools it also gets less or at studying your teacher don't even knows you by name. So we can say that the contact between student and teache gets less. One reason therefore is that the students are getting older and are no children anymore and mostly look for theirself. But back to the main question. In our school, there are similar situations. For example: With our teacher in mathematics I'm less relatet than with our French teacher. I think its because the maths teacher has big knowledge but less relation to us, on the other side the French teacher is well relatet to us and has the same knowledge. So in the end I can say, I like the French teacher much more than the guy who teaches us maths. This could bee a prove for relations beeing more important than knowledge.

ps: don't tell the teachers ;-)
