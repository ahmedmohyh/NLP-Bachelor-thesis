A teacher shall know about his subject. Because if he doesnt know about it, how is he going to teach the students? But also he has to be able to relate well to students. This leaves us to the statement: "A teacher's ability to relate well to students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught."
On one hand, a teacher has to be able to relate to students. If there is no chemistry between the teacher and the students, the working moral goes down and the students get unconcentrated. It is important to give the right amount of homework and to leave the students certain freedom. If the teacher can't relate to his students, he won't be liked by them and they won't participate during the lessons.
On the other hand, a teacher has to know everything about his subject, right ? It is not important that a teacher has to know everything about his subjet, not even a lot. He has to know and understand what he has to teach the students. If the teacher chose that specific subject to teach, he should be interested in that subject, or why did he choose it? And if he doesn't know something once, how we are often told: "It's not a shame if you don't know, but if you don't ask."
Or in this case google.
My opinion on this, is that relating to students is indeed more important than excellent knowledge about the subject, because of the arguments mentions above.
