For children it is far more important to look up to someone and who would be better than the teacher himself. Children do not need to have an excellent knowledge, just the basics should be fine. To move on in our society people always need new knowledge. But when is it too much? Children should not be surpressed with too much information. Children should be able to express themselves through actions and not through knowledge. A Child should enjoy his childhood and not be forced to stay at home and learn every single thing by himself.
But for adults or people who go to the university an excellent knowledge is far more important than the ability to relate well with students. With that age most people know the basics if they went through school. So if they go to the university they want the whole knowledge and not just the tip of it. If we do not have the full knowledge how should we advance in our lifes? how could someone who does not know every thing about a specific topic teach other people something about that specific thing? A good qualified teacher for the university should rely on his knowledge and not on his ability to relate with students. In an university the teachers do not know you through your name or your looks, they know you through numbers. Teachers will not associate with you like they did in the highschool or the elemetry-school.
The ability to relate with students or children is also some thing you can lear at any age but an excellent knowledge is something you are going to have a lot more problems when you get older. So you could have the full knowledge and learn the ability to relate with other people later and do both things at the same time.
In my opinion, the most important thing for someone who is teaching other people something should be his excellent knowledge and wisdom and not the ability to get on well with me or other people if he does not know what he is saying.
