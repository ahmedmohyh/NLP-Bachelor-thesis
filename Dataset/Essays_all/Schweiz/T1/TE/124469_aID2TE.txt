A teacher is a person who needs to bring knowledge to their students.
They should relate well with their students.
This relation makes students happier and let them not dislike the teacher.
This is important because if the students don't like their teachers they usually don't like the subject as well thus they learn less.
That's why teachers need to get on well with the class but they should still know something or else they can't teach anything.
If they don't know much the lessons might become boring for some better students.
There must be a balance between the knowledge of the teacher and the relation with their students.
So basically the ability to relate well with students is as important as knowing much about the subject.
It takes both to maximise the learning-speed and efficiency.
It's never good to focus only on one thing.
A teacher must adapt to become the perfect teacher.
