I agree in a kind of way with this statement. For me its very important that teachers relate well with their students. Not only the students should have a nice behaviour and should pay attention to their teachers. The teachers should do this too. Its not helpfull to tell them of because they're doing their work wrong or don't pay attention to anything what they're doing in class. You should talk with your students. Everybody has problems in their dayly live. It might be a problem at home or in school or any kind of problem which causes the bad work or bad behaviour. As a teacher you have problems too, so why don't you talk with your students about their problem. Maybe some students don't want help from a teacher, I understand that. But sometimes its very helpfull, for the teacher and the student. Its not only good for your relationship with the students, its also very good for your class who pay more attention to you. If you help them with severall things, they will respekt you more. They pay attention to your lesson and maybe get good marks too, because of well relation with them. But as a teacher you should know also about your subject which you're theaching to the students. You may be good at relating well with your students, but when don't know anything about your subject you're teaching, the students won't do anything in class. You have to make your lesson exciting and with a lot of joy. Then the students will listen to you. For me its very important to relate well with the students, but also to know abit about your lesson, than you're a good teacher. Atleast thats what I am thinking.
