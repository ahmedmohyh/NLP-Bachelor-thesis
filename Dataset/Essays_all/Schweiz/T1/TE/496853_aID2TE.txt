   Many students think that a teacher is able to explain something better if he has an excellent knowledge of his subject. But there are others who think, that if a teacher is that good in his subject, everything is very logical for him, so he doesn`t really know how to explain it for the people who don`t have as much knowledge as he has. 
   These argument lead directly to the second one and it is one for both sides. If the students don`t understand everything, they hopefully ask questions. But if they think that the teacher can`t relate well to them, they maybe won`t ask it. On the opposite, if they ask a very complicated question they might think that the teacher won`t be able to answer it if he doesn`t have that much knowledge of the subject.
   It is quite intersting if a teacher can give his students much more extra information and if they can just ask him anything of the subject and he will be able to answer it. But often people who know very much about something and try to tell you about it, just start speaking and can`t stop any more, because they try to tell you about EVERYTHING they know. This is often too much and students don`t understand everything.  
   Personally I think that it is more important for a teacher to be able to relate well with students. Students will be much more motivated to come to your lessons because it gives you the feeling that your teacher is working together witch you and not that he is just speaking and you need to learn everything yourself.
