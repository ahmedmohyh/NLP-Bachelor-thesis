Teachers

In this essay I am going to write about how important is the teachers ability to relate with students.
I think this statement is neither correct nor false. It depends on the students. Some students work better if they have a good relationship with their teacher and for other students it is not important.

Especially in primary school it is important that children like to come to school. At primary level your teacher has a great influence on you and what you want to become. In this case the teacher should have the ability to relate well with students. The knowledge of the subject is not that important. The teachers have a less high education than the ones at secondary level or university level. The teachers can not be good as the others.

At secondary level you have to know the subject well. The students have more intelligent questions and they rate everything you say. Knowledge has become more important.

At university level you do not have to relate well with your students. The only thing you have to do is to know your subject well and be an expert. The students do not want to have a role model like in primary school. They just want to know facts and scientificknowledge.

I think that teachers are role models for their students. In primary school more than at university. A primary school teacher has to know many things in different subjects. A teacher there can not know everything. The ability to relate with the students is more important.
At secodary level a teacher has not got so many different subjects anymore. Here you have to relate well and on the other hand to have a great knowledge. I think it is half knowledge half to relate well.
At university level all that counts is knowledge. You have not any familliar relations with the students and the professoronly has one subject to be good at. So it is easier to know many facts.

My opinion is that the statement depends on the situation of life the students and teachers are in.
