This is an all time difficult statement. Of course it's really important that a teacher knows exactly how to treat a student and how they can have a good relation. If a student notice, that a teacher spends a lot of times for the problems of his students, he will be a lot more motivated for school and his personal ambitions will increase. For example if a student is unmotivated, it's a big help for him, when he can talk with his teacher about it and find a solution together. 
Another pro aspect is, that the students, espacially in secondary school, have a lot of problems as growing teenagers. They have troubles at home, are in love or are desperate and don't know what to do in life anymore. A good, friendly teacher takes care about all of these problems and maybe even talks with the students about them. 
On the other hand the quality of the teachingis is an important thing too. The students go to school to increase their learning and to learn new things. When the teacher has no skillin teaching for example maths, it's not worth to visit this lesson. 
Also the students haven't always the same orientation and goals. Maybe one of a class wants to become a doctor or a scientist and it gets on his nervs, when the teacher isn't that high qualified and if he always cares about the problems of the other.

All in all a good teacher have too stand between these two qualifications.Both are important and both stand for a ordinary teacher.
In my opinion the ability to relate well with students is even a bit more important. But maybe just for me, because I also prefer teachers, with who you can talk about personal things and who take you serious and take time for you.
