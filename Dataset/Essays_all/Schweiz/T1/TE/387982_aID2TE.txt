Teachers are often seen as allknowing people, but infact they are also just humans. They can't know everything and they aren't perfect in the social sense. In this text i will talk about whether it is more important for a teacher torelate with the students than having a big knowledge.

First of all the teachers main task is teaching, which means he has to learn the students a lot of things. Therefore the teacher needs a big knowledge. 
On the other hand the students won't learn much if the teacher just talks about all the things he knows and the students get bored. Moreover most of the students learn better if they like the teacher and his way of teaching which includes relating to them. It is undoubtedly important to relate to the students and see their point of view. In contrary to that a teacher can't always be relating and full of empathie for the students, sometimes he has to be severe and just get them to learn without thinking of how they might feel with that. 

In conclusion you have to say that the ability of a teacher to relate well with students is very important, it helps to get the students to learn. Apart from that a teacher wouldn't be in the position he is without having an great knowlegde. My personal Opinion is that a good teacher surely needs both abilities, but I wouldn't agree wih the statement's given. Overall the teacher needs to each and he can't do that with no appropriate knowledge about the subject being taught.
