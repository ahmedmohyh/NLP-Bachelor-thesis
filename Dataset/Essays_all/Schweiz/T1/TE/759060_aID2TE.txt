If the teacher doesn't relate well with the students, the students arn't willing to learn something. They won't pay attention and sometimes they even try to make the teacher mad.The chemistry between a teacher and the students has to be good.
But the knowledge of a teacher is also very important. How should somebody teach students, when he doesn't know much about this subject. The marks of the class is the most important thing and with a teacher with less knowledge, they won't be very good.

For me, both things are very important. The complete teacher has to teach the subject in a way, that the students can understand it. But he also has to be able to anwer correct to questions of the students. Maybe the knowledge is a little bit more important, as long the teacher isnt horribly bad in interacting with the students. Because the teacher hasn't to be a friend or something to the children, he has to teach them things they didn't know and to answer their questions. I also think that, je older they are, desto more important is a excellent knowledge and desto less important it is to relate well with students.
