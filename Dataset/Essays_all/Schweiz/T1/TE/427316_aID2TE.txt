First of all, I totally agree, with this statement. It's now my 12th year at school and I have to say that it aren't the informations who are thaught in a certain subject that matter. If I like the teacher of a subject I also like the subject itself. So as an example, in my first two years at the Kanti Sursee, i didn't like math so much, but it wasn't because I didn't like math itself. It was because I didn't like the teacher who thaugth us math. My marks weren't very good, and I really didn't enjoy going to the math course. But after two years we got a new teacher and he was much nicer and almost every student in our class realted well with him. Personally I also liked the teacher, so my math mark got better and I enjoyed, going to the match class much more, than in the two years before. Of course a good knowledge of the subject isn't necesseraly a bad thing, but I don't think people who have a doctor or even a professor title are also the best teachers. For example my physics teacher is a doctor of physics, so of course his knowledge of this subject is absolutly huge, but despite all of that I don't think he's a very good teacher. That's because he can't explain the exercises in a manner, that his students are able to understand it and solve such a exercise themself later at the test. You can have the best knowledge in the world in a certain subject, but if you are not able to explain the subject to your students that they understand it, you're defenitly not a good teacher. It is absoluty not random, that my worst mark is from physics. In my opinion the best type of teacher is someone who loves his job and also his subject. But he should be able to explain things in a easy and understandable way and he should be nice to his students. Of course only if the students are also nice to him.
