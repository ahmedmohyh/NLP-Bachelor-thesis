Don't you know this feeling,  to have a teacher you just don't like and you aren't going on well with? There is a big discussion going on, wether the teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

During my middle school time, I was having a, in my opinion, really bad English teacher. I just didn't like the teacher's personality and she wasn't able to connect with me and my classmates, which directly affected our motivation and our love, passion to the language English.  Having a good teacher in English, a teacher you get on well with, often is directly connected to wether you like the subject English or not. In that case, students are likely to be more motivated to learn something in the subject and to make better progress, compared to having a teacher, that can't relate well with the students.

On the other side, if the teacher's knowledge just isn't that well, you aren't likely to learn as much. Especially on a higher level of English, the teacher must have a good knowledge of the subject in order to help the students out, so they are still able to make progress in the subject and get a better understanding of English.

So let's get the facts together, if you don't have a teacher, who is able to relate well with you as a student, you aren't gonna be very motivated to learn something. But also, if you have a teacher, who has a great knowledge and who is more likely to help you out is also a big advantage. To be a excellent English teacher, you probably gotta be able to have both of the abilities.
