Teachers

I agree with this statement because if the students are feeling comfortable in class they're learning more and they're probably asking more if their teacher's ability to relate well to them is good. I can concentrate better if I'm with a teacher that understands us as humans and not just as their "work".
As I said, it's really helpful if a teacher can relate to his students, but of course it's important too that they have a good knowledge of the subject being taught. Otherwise some students are getting lazy or won't listen to the teacher anymore and think they can do anything in class. I guess a good teacher is one who has a good relation to his students, but at the same time a good amount of knowledge to teach them. Some teachers have to learn that not every class or student is the same and try to change their methods of teaching if it doesn't work and not doing the same things since they're teaching for like 20 years of their life.
Another thing is that it's not very useful if a teacher knows really much and is a nice person but can't explain it in a good way. It's better to teach less or slower  than really much and  complicated and at the end nobody understands it.
