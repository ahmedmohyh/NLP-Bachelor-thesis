The knowledge of the subject being thaught is extremely important. A teacher we have, for example doesn't know barely anything in his subject, what doesn't make it easy to teach the subject. As a consequence of this fact, he can't answer questions wich are a bit more deep. So the teacher will have to look the answer of the question up by himself. But that's not what teachers are here for because otherwise I could just look it up by myself. 

It's not to underestimate, the teacher's ability to relate can do. Because in that case it'll be a lot easier to work for them because they don't have too much or too difficult things, that you do in a lesson and the students aren't bored. This is especially important in the language subjects. Because in teaching language, you can do so many things to teach the language just as reading a book, learning vocab, talking to each other, etc. But the art is to pick the the one things in the right measure, so that everyone can carry it. 

Another important ability of the teacher in my opinion is the ability, to entertain the students to a certain degree. This has the effect that afterwards, the students are way more motivated: it has the same effect like a break on them and you can concentrate way better. Because if there is no entertainment in a lesson, it is deadboring, but teachers also have to pay attention, that they don't entertain too much. In that case nobody can concentrate.

In general I would disagree with the statement that a teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. I'd rather say a good mix of all of the ability is important and for some classes you'll need more of this and for some more of that.
