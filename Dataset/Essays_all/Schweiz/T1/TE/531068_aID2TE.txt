It's importaint that a Teacher knows much of the subject being taught. If he don't know what he should tell the students he is a bad teacher. The teacher becomes money for beeing a teacher so he has to teach the students. But if the teacher can't relate well with the students, the students dont' want to go to school anymore. The teacher job of the Teacher is to teach the students, so they can make advance. But if they hate the teacher they don't learn much because they don't come to school. If the teacher want's to be successeful he must relate well with the students. So in my opinion the teacher must relate well with the students but he also has to know what he is telling the students. But if I have to decide between a teacher who can't relate well with me and a teacher who don't have excellent knowledge of the subject being taught I would prefere the teacher who don't relate well with me because I'm in school for learning. So I'm not agree with the statement. But if I have the decission between a teacher who can relate well with me and knows what he is telling us and between a teacher who don't relate well with me but He knows what he is telling us I would prefere the teacher who also relate well with me. So in my opinion the best teacher is a teacher who isn't perfect in one statement but who is good in the two. I don't like teachers who don't relate well with the students.
