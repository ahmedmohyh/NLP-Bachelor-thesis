The teacher must have both of these two things. To relate well with sundents is quite important. If the sudents think they aren't understood by the teacher or they can't ask things, then the overall lesson or school isn't good. What is ''excellent''? Excellent is word that have many meanings. This word sees every person different and from another way. So we can't definite excellent. But a good knowledge about the subject is very important to answer quetsions and help with problems. I think it is more important that the teacher can work good and efficient with the sudents. When the teacher has a very excellent knowledge but don't relate well with the sudents then they don't ask for questions or anything else. But when the knowledge of the teacher is so bad that he can't help on a problem or a question then it's also not good. I think that a teacher can work as a teacher he had to pass many exams so he had a good knowledge. But the knowledge about human beings has not everybody. So I think both is important but to relate well with the students is more important than a excellent knowledge
