A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

There are always teachers who are more popular among their students than others. Whether it is because of their way of teaching or other reasons. 
Of course students are more willing to listen to a person they like and respect or feel respected by and this works best if the teacher can relate well to them. Another reason for students to respect a teacher however is for his knowledge of the subject he teaches.On one hand they really enjoy being taught by someone who understands them and can relate to them. But on the other hand students do not have to like a teacher to get taught something by him. If the teacher has a great konwledge of the subject he teaches and is even passionate about it and able to answer all the questions he is being asked students are also willing to respect him.
If everybody likes a teacher because he is really nice and relates well to his students they may like him. But if he does not know very much about his subject they can not learn anything from him and might not respect him either.
All things considered i do not think that a teacher's ability to relate well with his students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches because his job is teaching his students what he knows which does not work if his knowledge is not very good. What is more is that if he does his job very well his students will notice immediately and respect or even like him for that.
