This statement is reals interesting, because there are many different opinions. 
The students have to go to school, because they have to learn. The have many different lessens and get cheked many times. So it is nessesairy, that the teatcher know what he is learning them. Aderwais the students don't take him/her for real and don't listen to them. There are a few times that the student know more than the teacher thats funny for the child but not for the adult. Would that be always like this, thene it's get very embarasingfor the teatcher. Thats mean they have to be beather than there students, they have to know a lot. It's the main subject.

But if it isn't importent to relate well with the students why we don't use a roboter in part of a teacher? It would be cheeper.
Another question is, if the children realy learn good, if ther just a brain as a teacher in the front of the class. It would be alot more motivation, if the teacher have a conect with them. It would make fun to go to school. They wouldlike to learn and they would have more respect from ther teachers than when they just do the minimum. There is a test how prof that we can learn better whit fun.

My opinien is, that I agree with the statement. Fun is a importent part in our life and the school also, so we should conect this two to one. Shure the teacher have to be smarter than the students but it's not worse when it chance onece. I also want to became a teacher and for me it is importent to make itbetter them my teachers I had. Shur not all of them weren't good but a lot didn't conect whit us. So I will do it better.
