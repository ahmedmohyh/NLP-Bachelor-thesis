It`s true that a good teacher has to build up a connection with his students. He has to know who his student really is. How fast he is in learning and in which subjects he`s better and in in which not. If the student realises that the teacher gives him some respect he can give it back. Because if he teacher is always grumpy and rude the student could feel offended and so refuses to try his best. So the only way a student can take profit from school is with a good relationship between student and teacher.
Many scientists have discovered that every student learns individually and has is own speed. So if the teacher is desintrested and it`s obvious that he doesn`t like his subject the stundents can be getting bored or can`t understand why they`re even learning it. 
But if the teacher hasn`t an excellent knowledge in his subject he woudn`t be able to teach something. And it would get hard for the students to learn something that is right or improve in this subject. So why would somebody want to teach children when he doesn`t know anything? Why is he even a teacher then?
So I don`t agree completly with the statement because it`s getting on your nervs too if a teacher doesn`t have a clue what he`s talking about and you always have to check if it was true what he was telling you. But it`s important as well that you feel that the teacher is supporting you and enjoys what he`s doing. That even makes a big difference if you like the subject or not. It could be the most boring task but if you see that the teacher cares about it and tries to make it entertaining you may even start to like it as well.
