I think it is really important for a teacher to understand his subject. He has to have a good knowledge and he has to be passionate about it. He has to be able to answer the students questions. he has be excellent at his subject so that he is able to make other people excellent at it. 
But on the other side he needs to connect with the students. he has to break down the subject on a level so that any person could understand it. Because if that isn`t the case you can`t call him a teacher, then he is only a person with an excellent knowledge who works at a school. 
But if a techer knows nothing about the subject he is teaching, why would anyone call him a teacher either? Then he is just a person who is able to stay in front of a class and read something that they could read by themselves. 
So in my opinion a good teacher is a mix of those things. Both has to be there. But i can still say that i agree with this statement. 
i would rather spend my time with listening to what a teacher has to say about something that is related with my life, than listen to somebody who tries to explain to me abstract that i don`t really understand and that i will never use again in my life. i would rather know less about something that matters to me than a whole lot about something that i will never use again in my life. because what is the reason of learning, when it doesn`t affect you life?
