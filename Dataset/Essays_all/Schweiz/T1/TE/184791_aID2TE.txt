The working atmosphere between a teacher and the students is very important. For example if a student has a question and the teacher won't help him, the student can't learn that much as if the teacher answers the question and react to it. A teacher has to know his subject well, but he has to cooperate with the students. Else the students aren't able to learn as much as they could.

If a teacher only knows his subject, even if he knows it very well, and can't teach it in a way the students understand what he wants to tell them, they won't learn anything. Maybe the teacher has many things to tell the students that are useful in life, but if he teach in a monoton way, the students can't profit from his knowledge.

Another important point is the activity. The teacher shouldn't stand in front of the class, speaking all day long and the students can't participate. The teacher should ask something to see if the students understand what he meant or the students could have some presentations. It's important that the students can bring their own ideas.

In my opinion both things are important but the ability to relate well with students is even more important. The teacher has to have a certain knowledge of the subject but if he wants that the students learn something he has to relate very well with them. If the lessons have some different themes, if you look at a theme from different ways or if you work in different ways, the students will be able to learn much more. The teacher has to involve the students in his classes.
