A teacher must have excellent knowledge but he must also can relate to his students. A person with knowledge can't teach his students if he can't understand them. But a person without knowledge can't teach anybody anything. So wich of the two abilities is more important?

If a teacher has an exelent knowledge he can help his students by explaining with examples. He can explain in more details to let his students get knowledge on a other niveau. You an go to a teacher with an excellent knowledge and ask him for his opinion on a matter. If he's a specialist there's a bigger chance, that you get some helpful advise. For example if a student wants to get more information about aspecific matter, he can go to his teacher and the teacher can help him with some more details.
A teacher who can relate with his students can make his lessons much more interesting. He can improve of his students reactions and help them in the best possible way. If he's missing the ability to relate, he can't help his students with their specific problems.For example if a student doesn't understand a math problem, he can go to his teacher who can help him with an individual explenation.

So a teacher mus have good knowledge and he must can relate with his students. A person with excellent knowledge doesn't have to be a good teacher. A teacher needs to relate with his students.
