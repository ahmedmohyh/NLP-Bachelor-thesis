Is a good relation with teacher and student more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?

If the teacher and the student have a very well relation, the student won't be better. At the test the teacher won't ask what his favorite color is or something like that, he will ask the students knowledge of the subject being tought. Maybe the teacher give him better markes because he like him more but not in case of his knowledge. After school the marks counts for the first job, so they should be good but when your knowledge don't go with your marks every person will see it. I think the lessons will be better than when the teacher don't like you because he won't ask you if you don't know the answer and don't blame you in front of the class when you're not listening. The most important point I think is, that the student will go in this subject and "don't must". 

I also had great teachers and teachers who don't like me and I don't know why. I can say that I go much easier to school when I know that the teacher like me and teach me a lot of his subject as then when I know I have the subject I'm bad in and the teacher isn't nice to me. So I think it's importent to go well with the teachers but either for great markes in case of my knowledge and my learning sessions I have done and not for plus points because you and your teacher have a good relation.
