knowledge versus relation

What's better if the teacher knows everything about the subject or if the teacher doesn't know everything excellent but knows how to relate well with his students. 
I think that both would be the very best, but if I had to choose I would pick the teacher who can relate well with the students. So I agree with this statement. I agree with it because I think you only learn things well when you are intrested in the subject. And it's the teachers job to make the subject interesting for the students. And then no one cares if the teacher don't have an excellent knowledge about the subject, because they can't even learn everything the teacher knows.
The next problem is how good can they explain things to the students. And I think teacher who have a good relation with the students understand better what the problem is or what the students don't understand. The teacher can know everything, but he has nothing from it, when he doesn't can explain it well.

It also always depents on what teacher are meant. If kindergardner, primary school teacher, secondary school teacher or gymnasium teacher. I think all of these three teacher should rather have the ability to relate well with the students then have excellent knowledge of the subject. Only in the universities and the "Hochschulen" the teachers should know everything of the subject.

And that's the difficult part of being teacher because you can't learn it like you can learn things about the subject. And I have much respect of teacher who can do this. k
