If you ask a student, he would say that it's more important for a teacher to relate well with students than to be a specialist in his subject. Because a student learns more when he likes the teacher. Then he likes to listen to this teacher and is able to keep the informations the teacher taught. If the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject but doesn't know how to make it interessing for the students, they won't learn as much from him as from a teacher with a good relationship with his students. Because if the students don't understand what the teacher is sayaing, they won't like his classes.
The parents of the students might say that it's a good thing when the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject. They might say that the students will learn more from an expert then from a teacher without an excellent knowledge. In some cases they are right. But most of the time students learn the most from teachers who can motivate them. And that can only a teacher who relates well with students. I know that from my ovn experiences. On one hand I have a teacher who teaches two different subjects, but he has only in one a really good knowledge. But if he hadn't said that in the beginning, noone would have noticed it. Because he knows how he has to deal with students and how he can motivate them. Even if he is not an expert. On the other hand I have a teacher who is a real expert of his subject, but what he teaches is ways too complicated. You can only pass the exams if you look some things up by yourself. Things that he should teach you. And because I don't understand much, I don't really like his classes. And this has also an effect on my grades. So I totally agree with this statement.
