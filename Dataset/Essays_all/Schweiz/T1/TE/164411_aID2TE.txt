A teacher's ability to relate well with the students is important, but also important is that the teacher knows everything about his subject.So what's the thing that is more important? 
If somebody has questions or doesn't understand the subject, the teacher needs to explain it to the student. And if he hasn't an excellent knowledge, it will be very hard to answer the student's questions. The students need a high knowledge about all the subjects and they don't have plenty time to learn it all by themselves, that's why the profs need to have a big knowledge. 
On one side it doesn't matter if the teacher has the ability to relate well with students. But on the other side it does and it's very important that the teacher and the student cope well with each other. Because if they don't cope well there will only be a small chance that the student will understand the subject. Students won't ask the teachers any questions if they don't understand it and they know that the profs don't like them.
I think that the profs need to know almost everything about the subject. If they don't, how did they even become teachers? But out of my sight it's also very important to cope well with students. It's hard to learn anything when you don't like the teacher or the teacher doesn't like you, I know it from my own experiences. And if you write bad grades the teacher doesn't like you even more because he thinks that you don't pay any attention, what's not true.No human being has an excellent knowledge about something and knows exactly every detail about the subject, the main things are the most important.Thats why the excellent knowledge is less important than the ability to relate well with all the students. If you have a base knowledge and cope well with the students, it would be perfect.
