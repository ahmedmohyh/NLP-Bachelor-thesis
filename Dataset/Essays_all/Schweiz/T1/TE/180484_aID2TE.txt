How much does a teacher really know about his subject? How importent is the exact knowledge of his subject? Or does he just have to be a good teacher wich understands the stundents and knows what is the best way to teach them without an excellent knowledge of every theme?
Teachers are teachers because they went to school and studied afterwords. They really have to know what they are talking of. But there are also things you learn at an university wich they`ll probably never teach. But there`s something you can`t really lern just by going to school. It is to understand other people, know how to communicate and also how to teach that the students really listen and want to lern something. For me it is clear that teachers wich can`t relate with students also can`t be good teachers. Teacher`s can have a very big knowledge but what is it for if they can`t teach it to the student? And anyway, also teachers are just humans and they still can learn thing. It`s not like that I say teachers can have nearly the same or a bit a higher level as the student. They have to know much more than them. But I think after the long way of school and university they did they really know a lot. My oppinion is that if the students like the teacher or the way of teaching they really more like to go to school and they are more attentive! If the studens don`t symphasize to a teacher, he`s giving homework which the students don`t understand, he doesn`t speak clearly and so on, I think that the students learn less, also if the teacher has a big knowledge, than by a teacher which doesn`t know every detail of a theme but wants to help the students and understands them. So the teacher don`t just has to "teach". He has to understand the students and the students have to understand the teacher. For me its very important that I really know what I have to do. So I think that the "relation" between students and teachers is more important than a ecxellent knowledge of the teacher.
