Almost everybody goes to scool and has more or less good teachers. Some of them know everthing about the subeject, but can't relate with the students, other teacher can relate very good with the students but they don't have very good knowledge. So what matters more to be a good teacher? Excellent knowledege about the subject, or the ability to relate well with the students?

Good knowledge is sometimes important but not always nessescary to be a good teacher. For exaple if a teacher knows everything about his subject but can't interact and relate with the students, the students don't learn anything. So no matter how good the knowledge of the teacher is,if he cant relate with students, the students don't learn anything.

The ability to relate with stundents ,does really help to be a good teacher. If teacher have the ability, the scoollessons are much more interesting for the student. But only the ability to relate with students doesn't make you a good teacher , because if have a very bad knowledege the students won't learn a thing because the teacher doesn't know waht he is talking about.

So good teacher needs both, a good knowledge and the ability to relate with the students.
