The question if the knowledge or the way the teacher can relate with his students is more important to be a "good teacher" is often asked in school. So what's more profitable and what leads to a bigger success to really learn something of the teacher? 
 
There are pros and contras for each answer. If a teacher has studied a subject for a longtime at a university, he has a big knowledge about that subject. That can be an advantage because the students can be teached with a bright diversity of topics with a lot of detailed informations. In this case the students have the ability to ask their questions which can be very intresting for all the students and with an excellent knowledge of the subject the teacher has a bigger chance to answer their question. For example by teaching biology, if the teacher doesn't know certain things and has to taka a look at the internet first every time, then he appears as a uncertain person who doesn't have a bright knowledge about the subject he teaches. So the students are starting to doubt his answers. 
The excelent knowledge counts also as an advantage when the teacher can discuss about a lot of different topics with the students. 
But in my opinion the teacher's ability to relate is more important. If a teacher has a very big knowledge about a subjects and studied very long for a subject but doesn't have  the ability to teach, it is a disadvantage. Then the teacher isn't able to teach the topics correctly to the students because of the superficial of teaching..
