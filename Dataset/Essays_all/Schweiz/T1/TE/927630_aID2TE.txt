A bad teacher can take away the whole energy and passion of a student to learn and understand a subject. It can be very frustrating when one person messes up your favorite subject which you dream about as an dreamjob. But then there is this one person which destroys your future, your dreams. She might be disrespectful , chaotic, can't explain things, or has favorite students. Soon you will hate this person and also the subject which he or she teachses.
Imagine a teacher who is alwys joking, laughing, has a good relationship with his students, every student likes this modern, young teacher, which owns good humor. But often he he isn't able to give you information about the current topic or he can't explain the things you didn't understand. The two teachers I mentioned where both a bad example for a teacher, maybe the first has an excellent knwledge but he isn't good in explainig topics, the second is a great guy in person, unfortunately he hasn't enough knowledge to give his students for their futur job or their own knowledge. In conclusion the students which walk out of the class of example one and two hadn't learn enough in their classes for take on a future job which includes the topics, teached of the bad teachers.In my opinin the perfect teacher is am mix of the mentioned characters plus a few other positive aspects. He or she should be good at explaining, has a great knowledge and with whome you also can have great laugh.
