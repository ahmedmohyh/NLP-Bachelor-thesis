A teacher's work is it, to teach the students as much as they can but still trying to do it in a way the students are feeling comfortable in their lessons. For me, I really like the teacher and aswell the lessons if they have alot of information to give and if they know something about the subject they teach. So I think it takes both, a perfect knowledge of the subject and a go
At the Kantonsschule Stadelhofen there's a teacher, let's call her Mrs Lyreco, and she's not really adored by any of the students of our school. I hate going to her lessons and I don't know if it's they way she teaches the subject or if it's that she's just cruel but I'm always panicking if her lesson is next up. She knows so much about the subject she teaches, she taught us so many things and she really would be a perfect teacher, if there wasn't the side of her which is always kind of bullying her students and is embarassing them in front of everyone. On the other hand, the subject history is everyone's favorite. It's really interesting and the teachers has exactly the right amount of humor but at the same time she is really strict and we have to pay attention so we can keep up with all the information.
What I've been trying to say is that the teacher's should try to bond with the students but not too much so they are still being taken serious by all the students. At the same time the lessons should be filled with a lot of information. And that's what makes a teacher a good teacher and lesson an interesting lesson.
