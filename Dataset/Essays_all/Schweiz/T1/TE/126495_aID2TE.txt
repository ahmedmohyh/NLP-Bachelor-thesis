The education now a days is very important for everyone. Everyone wants to achieve their goals and want to have a good job, so that they can nourish their family and don't have to be dependent on someone.  But it really depends on how we get along with the teachers and how they're going to teach us the things, so that we'll be able to have a good mark and will pass the matura exam.
The way teachers are going to deliver their knowledge is very important. Because it could depend on your motivation. If you like the teacher, you'll like the subject. That's how it is.
If every teacher would be very strict and wouldn't make any jokes, every student would be too stressed and maybe, who knows, will get a burnout or something like that.
I think a teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important. But it's also important that the teacher is an expert of the subject, so that he or she can deliver the things right. It would be terrible if the teacher would teach us the wrong things. Every student has the same matura exam and just because a teacher hadn't had an excellent knowledge of the subject we wouldn't pass the exam.
So my opinion is that it's more important to have a teacher with an excellent knowledge than a teacher who's funny..
