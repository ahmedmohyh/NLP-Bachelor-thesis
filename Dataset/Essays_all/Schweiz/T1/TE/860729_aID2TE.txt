I will show arguments for and against this controvers statement.
An argument that agree with this argument is, that if someone can not relate well with students, it is really hard for them to understand the topic, because the teacher can not really explain it.
An other argument for this statement is, that the relationship between the stundents and the teacher is really important to learn better, because of the interaction between the teacher and the students. For example when someone needs help, that he can ask the teacher and he can explain it well.
But on the other side it has also a lot of arguments against this statement.
An argument that disagree with this statement is, that it make no sense to have a teacher, who has not a really good knowledge of the subject, because he propably don't have all the informations about it and he can not answer all the questions.
An other argument that is also against this statement is, that students of other schools have a better knowledge because of the teachers. So it is easier for them later in a university or something similar.
I think both things are important for a teacher and it needs a good balance between this. For me they are same important and i can't say what is more necessary. Both sides, agree and disagree, have good arguments and I think all this things are important for a really good teacher.
