Teachers who have a good relation to their students are very wishable. If there is a functionable relationship between students and their teacher many things are getting easier and better. For exemple when they are discussing a subject in class the debate is more interesting because the teacher is able to interact better with his students. 
But the importancy of the teacher's knowledge is as important as the ability to relate well with students. The teacher needs to know what he's speaking about. If this isn't the case, the class gets bored and they don't believe him anymore. When they ask him something and don't get an answer their interest and curiousity may disappear. 
If the teacher just talks about his own opinion and his life, what he has already seen, what he made last weekend, he bores the students. They are going to school to learn something, this should be in every teachers mind. This is the maintarget they need to claim. 
So in my opinion it is necessary for a teacher to have a good relation with the students to have a better atmosphere for learning. But they also need to know what they are teaching about, so the knowledge of the subject enjoys the same importance as the relation. I think a teacher should have a good mix of these traits.
