First of all I want to clearify that both points are important. A teacher should be able to relate well with his students but its also important that he he can teach them as much as possible no matter what the subject is. Because students go to school to educate themselves and the purpose of school is not to become clueless about anything.
But the thing is: If a teacher is able to teach the students the important things but he`s not getting along with the students, the students wont be more motivated. Thats something that I realised from my own experience. A teacher can be very intelligent, he could teach good stuff. But as long as I am afraid of them or if they try to bring me down, I automatically hate the subject. And I think there are a lot of more cases. 
At the other side, there are a lot of teachers that try to be as friendly as they can but in their lessons students learn anyway nothing helpful. Or nothing that has something to do with the subject. And that's not that what every student wants. A student goes to school, like I said, for education but I think that communication and our good attidude is also something that we can bring to our school. I think school and their kind of lessons should be more than just sitting in the classrom and waiting for the lesson to end. In fact, a teacher should learn to combinate both points from the statement. He should bring knowledge into the lesson but he should also know how to relate well with students. Cause that's their job.And if he does his job, we students do our job.
