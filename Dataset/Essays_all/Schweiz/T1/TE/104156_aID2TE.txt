In this essay I'll talk about the problems in schools. I will show you the advantages and disadvantages of a well related teacher and I'll explain my thoughts about this topic.

Nowadays most children aren't really motivated going to school. Often they are moaning about boring school lessions, a lot of homework or to many tests. So i can see the problem, which a huge number of teachers have to complain with. Young people often are rude and not concentraited, only interested in gossip, making party or going shopping. In my opinion it's very important that the teacher is well related to show kids the important things in life. When he makes them laughing and having fun they are more motivated in learning something new and they forget quickly how boring school can be. But I think it isn't most important to relate well with young people. To have an excellent knowledge is the basic thing a teacher has to have to be a good idole for his students. Often teachers are speaking very slowly and boaring in front of the classrom so nobody is listening, but if they would make some jokes everyone would have more fun.

To end this text i want to say for me both is very important. It would be great if there were more teachers who could relate well with kids and making them laugh but also telling them the important things of life and making them improving their knowledge.
