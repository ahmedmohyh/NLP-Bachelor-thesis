It is said that students learn much better if they are motivated. It is the best if a teacher can interact with the students. He also should have the knowledge of the subject. This should be but some teacher are unmotivated or can't controle a class. 

It's the best if teacher understand the students and can teach them well. It is importent that they can imagine how students are. He doesn't have to know their whole life but the characters are different. Every person learns different. Students aren't machines where you can program anything and they can do it from the beginning. So yes, it could be better if a teacher realates well with the students. There is not the excellent knowledge needed to comunicate well with students. 

But if you don't have any knowledge of the subject it could be difficult to teach something. The society wouldn't need any teacher. The students wouldn't have to go to school because they don't learn anything or not enough. Knowledge is important to give it to an other generation, so they can teach it to their children. 

I think if there is not much knowledge we wouldn't go to school just to have a good relationship to our teacher. But teachers should also comunicate with students in a good way, so they are motivated and want to learn something. Of course motivation is not only because my teacher can motivate me. Students also have to interact with the teacher. There are people who are born to teach. Not everybody can do it. They should have a mix between knowledge and a good relationship to their students.
