I'll start with the positive things that I can think about this topic. First of all, if a teacher can relate to his students and maybe feel a little bit what is going on inside them, that makes a teacher much more sympathic. If a teacher is sympathic the students are more likely to participate in his class and have a better connection to the teacher. The students are also more likely to go with schoolish or non schoolish problems to a teacher they like and they think can relate to them. Also, if a teacher doesen't know everything about his subject he has to find answers himself, maybe with the students who asked a question, so he can explain it to others. If a teacher has to find answers to questions his students asked, this could make them feel better because the teacher also didn't know it. 

But to every good there is a negative part. If a teacher has not a excellent knowledge of what he is trying to teach, he can't bring it over to his students correctly and maybe, which would be even worse, teaches them something wrong. Maybe he can't give his students answers to their questions and really, how would you feel when your history teacher can't answer your question to the first world war? If you don't have a teacher who knows what he is talking about, you are more likely to get distracted by the windows, your phone or you start talking during class right? If a teacher knows his subject he can make classes very interesting and bring in sidefacts or can help you with more specific questions which go deeper in the subject. 

In my opinion a teacher has to know as much as possible about his theme so he can bring it correct to the students brains and make classes interesting. Me, I like even to have an boring class with much inforation more than a funny teacher who doesn't know anything about what he is talking. A really good teacher can make class interesting and fill it with information without the lessons getting boring.
