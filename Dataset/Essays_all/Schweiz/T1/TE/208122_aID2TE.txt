A Teacher is an important part of a students life. Is it important to have a good relationship with a teacher?  Or is it more important to learn excellnet knowledge of the subjekt being taught?

Students go to school to lern something. In school they learn the base knowledge for life. Therefore it's very imprtant that they have competent teaches. This teachers should have themselfs an excellente knowlege of their subject they should love what they teach. I think if a theacher really loves his subjects and really wants us students to understand the matter he will automaticly relate well with his students. If a teacher can cooperate with students and also acceps their fools stundents will aotomaticls like him. if a teacher just wants to get rid of his knowledge we turn off and nothing goes in our had. i think for the most students it's really improtant that they learn something in school because thats the reason why we go to school. It doesent't needs to be excellent knowledge we anyway don't understand it needs to be good knowlege we can ceep in our heads forever. School should be fun aswell. in school we spend so much time of our childhood and I think children grow up to fast. They get to much responsibility and decision making processes to early. School doesn't need to be to stiff. In school we schould learn and get the changse to learn the way of getting adult and getting so much responsibility. We are adultsfor the whole life. 

I think school is a big part in our childhood and therefore knowlege is really important. In school we learn things nobudy will ever teach us again in life. Teacher have the ability to show us the way from childhood to the life as an adult. They don't need to teach excellent knowlege they need to teach good knowlege and everey teacher should have the social feeling to relate well with students. Teachers should be a little like parents.
