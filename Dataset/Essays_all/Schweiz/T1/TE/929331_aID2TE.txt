TEACHER

Teacher are stupid, but they can explain all. There are teachers having much knowledge of school and there are teachers having no idea what to do with boys and girls during the lesson. It is likely that teachers who can explain more than others may be better for students, because they come along with the subjects of the lessons. In my opinion, teacher's job is to learning students for their life. 

Firstly, I want to say that teachers who are well-knowing can not everytime explain the theme better to students. Sometimes there are teachers who know very much, but for them it is all so easy that they do not think about that for students it may be very difficile and go along with the next theme. So it could be better to having teachers who are not as excellent as other teachers, but a teacher who can explain it.

Secondly, I want to say that tough teachers are more likely than others. If there is a loud class, teachers often have to use much time to looking for the loud students and this time goes away by the exercise time. In Mathematics it is important to making many exercises that students learn. In this time teachers can explain the topic and some scenes again. So that the students can learning much and hear the¨grammar again, this is very important.

To sum up, I want to say again that it is important to have teachers are well-known, but they should not being to good, that students came not along with it. Finally, be quiet in school and listen to the teacher!
