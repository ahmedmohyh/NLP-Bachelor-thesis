It is important that the teacher has a good realtionship to his students. If the students feel comfortable and safe, they more likely want to come to school and have more motivation. The atmosphere in general helps them to work and the results may be better. Also if they trust the teacher, problems can be solved much faster. The tipical fear of bad and cruel teachers wouldn't exist.

But if the teacher's knowledge of the subject isn't good enough, what's the point of being the teacher? He/She has to be able to explain the subject to the students properly so that they learn more about it. If the experience isn't there, this isn't possible. Of course the teacher can't know everything about it since he/she is also a normal human being. But what's important is that the teacher himself is confident in this subject.
Another point is, if the teacher becomes too close with his students, it might happen that they lose the respect to him/her. They see them like a good friend and not like a teacher anymore. This can be a disadvantige and lead to the opposite effect. The teacher has to have a certain state and be superior. Otherwise the learing effect wouldn't happen

The main goal is to lead the students to a certain knowledge. It has to be the highest priority.
I think both aspects are important. If one doesn't have a good realtionship to his students, it's impossible to work with them in the right way. But besides that, it's much more important that the teacher has the knowledge which is needed to teach the students. If a teacher finds the perfect balance between him/her and the students, the endresult will be the best.
