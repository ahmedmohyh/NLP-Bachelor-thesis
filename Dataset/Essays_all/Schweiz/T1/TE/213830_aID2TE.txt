A good relationship between teachers and students is important because it`s able to make the lessons more interessant and to make the students work more efficient in the lessons. If a student likes his teachers and stands in a good relationship to him it`s likely that he has more fun by learning the subject and it`s also more fun for the teacher to teach the subject. I think students don`t like the their teacher and if the teacher don`t like his students, it isn`t possilbe to create a good atmosphere for learning and the lessons aren`t that efficient as they might could be. So a good relationship between teachers and students isn`t necessary for learning a subject but it`s quite helpful and important.

The fact that a teacher should have a good knowledge of the subject is enormously important. A teacher must know what he is talkind about that he could teach his students properly and efficient. For learning a subjects it`s quite important that the students understand what the teacher is talking about so that the teacher is able to explain the stuff as good as the students understand it also. And a teacher also must be able to answer questions of his students about the subject. If the teacher isn`t able to explain the stuff cleary and properly it`s quite difficult for the students to understand what the teacher is talking about. So it`s also important that a teacher improves and refreshes his knowledge of a subject regularly.

So in the end I don`t fully agree with this statement. Of course it`s important that teachers are able to relate well with their stundents but in my opinion the knowledge of the subject is even more important. Because a student don`t understand the stuff if he is good related with a teacher who don`t have a good knowledge. But naturally the best way is that a teacher includes both, a good knowledge of the subject and also a good relationship to his students.
