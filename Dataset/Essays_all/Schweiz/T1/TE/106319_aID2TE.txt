When someone has arrived the sixth or seventh living year he or she has to visit the primary school.
Everyone remebmers the first day in school. So my first memory I had in school was how nice and gentel my teacher was. Since than I was alway looking forward to go into math class. The problem was more that I understanded nothing but I was still willing to learn and make my homeworks.
On the other side I had (also in primary school) I had e second teacher and we had not had a good chemestry. She was teachng us German ans History. She had very much knowldge but she was realy enoying and I felt like she does not like children.

If you go into school a very big theme is the teachers you have. On th first day go go around and ask like "Hi, do you like our teacher". Mostly the students knowfrom the first moment if they like the teacher or not. But that has something to do witch their behaivior. If they are nice open and try to help you speak with you like you are a person who wants to learn something, then they like the teacher and they are enjoying the class. They make the homework and go on well in class. In this situation the teachers get on well with the students but it can be that he has not that much knowledge he can give away. That is something wich is not good because you are going into school to learn and have the mature. If a teacher does not prepare you well, you can not make the test.
So if a teacher has very much knowlegd but he is not good in beeing and talk with people, he or she gives you so much important things. But if you do not like him you are maybe not willing to learn. But in case that you watnt to have good marks you are learning anyway.

I think it is more important that the teacher is fair and has knowledge. Maybe he is not that nice but in the end ther are always diffrent oppinions about teachers. They like him but the others do not. Everyone likes different kind of peoples so do I.
