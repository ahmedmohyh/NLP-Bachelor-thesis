Students always look for the perfect teacher. But how should he/she be like? Is it more important that he has excellent knowledge or that he has the ability to relate well with his students? 

Obviously a teacher who has a good relation to his students is most likely to be loved but that's not the only thing a teacher should be good at. If he doesn't know what he's talking about in his lessons he's not really teaching his students and having the ability to relate to them doesn't make the situation better.  
So a teacher who has the knowledge of the subject he's teaching is pretty important. If the teacher doesn't know anything the students won't learn anything either. 
People say that you have to like your teacher because otherwise you don't like going to his lessons either. But is this really true? As long as you understand what he's talking about it shouldn't matter that's what the say. 

In my opinion a teacher should have a mixture of both. Out of my own experience going to a lesson where you like the teacher who teaches the subject makes it way easier to concentrate but if he doesn't have any knowledge about it you obviously won't learn anything. And having the opposite situation where you don't  like the teacher makes it really hard to attend their lessons.
