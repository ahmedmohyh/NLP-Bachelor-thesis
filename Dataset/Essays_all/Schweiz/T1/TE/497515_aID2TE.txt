My opinion to the statement: 
I think for a teacher and their students it is very important that they are at the same wavelenght. Students need a trustwurthy person because we are all in an age which we are grow up very fast. The teacher see us everyday sometimes for many different years and I think many students like it more to go in the school when they have a good teacher. The lessons are more interesting when you like the person who are teaching to you.

For me it is also very important to learn something new in the lessons. This is the reason why I think it is important that the teacher have an excellent knowledge of the subject that they are taught. I mean I learn everyday so many new things and sometimes it is impossible to remark everything at the evening and then it is easier for me when I like the teacher because then I tell some funny and interesting stories to my family and I think this is the best way to learn the new things.

I think both sides are very important and it is a hard work for the teacher to find the best way. Some students are just in school for learning and the others need sometime a trustfull person.
