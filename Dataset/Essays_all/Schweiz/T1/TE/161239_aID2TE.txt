The relationship between Teacher and Student is something very interesting. Why do students like some teachers and dislike others? Is it important that teachers are interested in their students and try to relate with them?
Take our math teacher for example. He comes in to the room at the beginning of the lesson, sits down, wishes us a good morning and we start correcting the homework with him. If we don't do our homework or talks whilst he is explaining the new theorie, most of the time he doesn't care. Neither is he interested in our private life and at the end of the lesson he just leaves. But still, in these lessons our class is as quiet as in no other subject. Everyone is occupied with keeping up with the theorie.
A bad example for this, also exists. We have a teacher, who knows very much about his subject and he likes to talk a lot, so most of the time we are just sitting in class and listening to his monolog. Sometimes he doesn't even remember, that he already told us this story, that he is currently telling. Lots of students don't really like to be in this teachers lessons.
An other teacher that we have is very interested in us and likes to get to know everybody. Every semester she talks to us about our oral marks and wants to hear our point of view too. In these lessons everyone is quiet too, because often we talk about things, that could also happen to us and we learn a lot about life. 
Also another teacher who trys to relate to us,because she wants our class spirit to be at ease, sometimes forgets, that she should teach us other things. She just can't keep us quiet. If we are too loud, she just starts to talk louder too and this doesn't come out well mostly.
I think the most important thing for a good teacher is, that he is interested in his subject, but also wants to help his students understand the stuff that we need to know for the next test.
