In this essay i will discuss the up standing question.
For me most important about my teacher is that i like learning in their lessons. I dont really care if they do not know everything in their subject, because they just have to explaine it to me. And if i have a question the teacher cant answer i dont have a problem waiting for the answer. It is human that people dont know all the things which are going on. For example a fishermen mostly just has to bring fish home and earn some money, this fishermen mustnt be able to explain me how to catch fish. Because it not his job to do this. But a teacher has the job to give me knowledge! So if the teacher is a computer, which can search every question you have and give you the right answer, he got a excellent knowledge of the subject but i probablly woud learn nothing in this lessons. Why? Because I do not have anymotivation. In my opinion the biggest challenge for a teacher is how to motivate their students. But how shoud somone who is not able to relate well with me push me forward? He can do it with beeing a strict teacher. Everytime when somone dont do what he wants you to do, he punishes you. But i think noone likes to be threaten like this. And most people will resist. They will start to hate the teacher and the will build a mental wall between them and the teacher.
I hope its rational for everyone that we do not need people who teach us like this.
