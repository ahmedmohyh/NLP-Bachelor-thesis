Who does not really know how to do, this person teachs.

I hope the this statement is not true. Then in my opinion teachers should be experts of the subjet which they are teaching, because their students should be able to learn form them for their life. Occasionally, for me, a teacher shoulds not only have an giant knowlege of his subject, eithermore he has to have a well relation to his students. Because in general when the teacher is nice human person, the students have more fun in the lessons and they are more motivatet to learn something

In my own school-life I had only two very excellent professors. The first is Mister Miller who was teaching me History and Misses Senn whos was teaching me French in secondary school. Both of them loved teaching and as student you really recognzied that. M. miller was alwasy saying that he is teaching us for life and not only for school. And so he did not teaching us only ennoing swiss histroy. In fact we lernt also a lot about politics, right and economy. 

Furthermore I think it is quite importent that the teacher has a kind of humour, as our new chemistry teacher Mister Schimd. He si a real genie at this subject and has also a doctor titel in physic and maths. And all this with only 37 years. In my class are only grils and not even one boy, so we are not really interesting in chemistry. but since M. schimd has begun teaching at our school this changed. Because we are girls he explain very complicaded models of atoms and so on with the example of cosmetics or something else. This make our chemistry lessons really exciting and now everyone listens better at him.

So in my opinion the teacher has to have a good knowledge of his subject, but it is also really importent to have a good relationship with the class which they are teaching.
