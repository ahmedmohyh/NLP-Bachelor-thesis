A theacher who relate well with his students is very importent for the learning-process. The students listen to him, they talk about problems and question and they say something when they didn't understand something. They are fine in class and the teacher is fine in class too. So the theacher plans his hours with the students better to and have fun while is job. And the persons who has fun while there jobbs do there jobs better than the persons who havn't fun while there job. On the other hand when the teacher and the students have a friendship together then the students havn't any respect of the teacher and they don't do what the teacher says anymore and this isn't really good for the learning-process. So a teacher has to be a person who says the students what's wrong and what's right but in a friendly and respectful conversation. So when the teacher hasn't any knowledge it isn't a good teacher neither, beacause then he can be the best friends of the students but they wouldn't leran anything. So i think a teacher has to be a person who has a good knowledge and can learn the students something as a friend but also as a teacher who has to be respected from the students and they listen what hey says. I think a good teacher needs both sides.
