A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, is the hypothese and I'm sure some of you all wish that you have had a nicer and more gentle teacher in your class.
I agree with that because if the relation between the teacher and the students is well, the communication will be a lot easier, and the students want to go to school more often. Furthermore with a better relation the teacher could lead the students to a better class and a better classspirit. In addition to that, there will be a better understanding of the subject, if the teacher are well in communication and not as cold as ice in with students, so even the classlast can become better in school. In contrary with that, the classbest can't become better, because the classlevel is to low, and if the level of knowledge is to low, they will not be able to go an a better school or a university afterwards. Furthermore, the students wan't go to school for theirselves, but for the teachers instead. In my opinion the students wouldn't feel responsible for their bad marks afterwards in other schools, if the teacher relates to well with students and the subject is on a to low level, because everyone will get a good mark, but the level of knowledge is to low. Therefor I think the teachers should be good in teaching, and not in relating well with the class they are teaching.
