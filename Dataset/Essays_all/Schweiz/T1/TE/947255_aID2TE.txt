Following this statement there are 2 different types of teachers. One type is the type of teachers who has excellent knowledge of what he's teaching and what he's talking about. And the 2nd type of teachers is the one who can relate very well witch students. More ofter the students like the 2nd type because it's just more fun having class with that type of a teacher.
But in general both types of teachers are good but it depends on the subject. If a language teacher can't relate with students but has excellent knowledge
the students won't enjoy the class lessons at all. And for a subject like physics excellent knowledge is more important than the ability to relate well with students. But teachers who relate well with students can be a danger for the students. The students might feel too comfortable in classes and won't do anything but even a teacher with an excellent knowledge can be a problem for the students because the teacher knows alot and the students just can't follow him because the don't understand everything. It's just really hard for a teacher to have the ability to relate well to students and have an excellent knowledge I would even say that it's impossible.
I would say that a teacher doesn't need just one of theese 2 things. Just beeing able to relate well or to have an excellent knowledge is not enough for beeing a really good teacher. You need a good mixure of both of them to be a really good teacher. I totally disagree with this statement. I wouldn't say one of theese 2 things is more important I would say that they are equaly important.
