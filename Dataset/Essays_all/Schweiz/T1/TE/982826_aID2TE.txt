A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
What is my opinion about that statement and why?

I can exactly say in which classes I learn the most about the subject being taught. In a class in which a teacher has brilliant knowledge about the subject being taught I often feel silly when I dont understand what he tells us. And when I feel like that I just dont ask the teacher my question because I would feel much more silly then. So I just don't ask and don't learn anything in that class. 
In a class in which the teacher relates well to us, we often chat and it's much noisier than in other classes. So it's obvious that I don't learn very much in that classes either. 
So I guess the perfect teacher is a mixture of both of the characters. In a class in which the teacher has good knowledge and he or she also relates well with us, I learn the most. It's like studying makes a lot of fun. It's not a to strict atomosphere but it is also not to noisy. Everyone is concentrated but in a nice way. 
I recognized that when a teacher is a perfect mixture of both of the characters, I listen to what he or she says, I do my homework very good, and most important thing, I really want to be good at that suject. 
Lucky us, that at our school we do have a lot of that "perfect-mixture-teachers". I really like going to school now. Before I went to the gymnasium I didn't like going to school and I wasn't good at school, because
