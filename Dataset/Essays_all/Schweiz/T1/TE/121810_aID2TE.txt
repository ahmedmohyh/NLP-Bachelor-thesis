Well this question is a really good one. There are a lot of different ways to see that. There are really a lot of arguments for a teacher who can relate well with the students but it is also very important to have a lot of knowledge especially then when you want to teach other people something.

First of all it is terrible when you got a teacher who isn't polite or nice to his students. You don't have to be best friends but it is much worse if you are enemies. So it is also with the knowledge. If your teacher knows everything then you can get a huge profit from it but in contrary if he isn't really intelligent you just waste your time. In conclusion there are four main situations.

If your teacher can relate well with the students but knows nothing it would be nice to speak with him but not to lern something. If he is nice polite and intelligent you've got the jackpot. You can learn very much from him and the lessons are also funny. It is worse if you've got a teacher who knows a lot but is really mean to you and your class. So the students don't want to go to school. But they have to because they want to learn somethig. The worst case scenario is if your teacher is mean and don't know anything. So maybe the best combination is if you are polite and nice with your students but you also want to teach them. 

In my opinion it is very important that you can talk with them and for the students it is much easier this way to motivate themselfs for learning. And a main part of school is also to learn something. If you've got a teacher who can't teach you the topics you need it's terrible. So as a student i wish that my teacher is nice and polite to me and that I can learn something I didn't knew before.
