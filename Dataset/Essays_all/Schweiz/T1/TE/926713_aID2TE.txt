A lot of investigations about our brain and learn capacity has been going on for several years now. But a rather unknown question, which I will be writing about in this essay is, if the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
Imagining myself being traped in a class room for the whole day,I of course would rather enjoy a lecture with a teacher who you also know on a personal level. But does having a teacher who is acting like my friend, really help me  studying at my highest efficiency, or would a teacher who I dont like at force me to concentrate and work even better?
Out of personal experience I  unfortunately need to say, that having a rather scary and unlikable teacher is better for my grades ( in most cases at least). Because not feeling conected on a personal level results in having to respect the teacher more and on concentrating more on the subject that is being taught. 
Of cours the ideal would be that a teacher could connect with his students and get them to like him and also is able to excellentely teach them the nececary knowledge of the subject. But these kind of teacher really are rare to find nowaday. Either they are really strict and will not allow the students to have fun and connect with each other nor the teacher himself or they will also get lost having fun with his/ her students and will be able to concentrate 100 percent on what should be taught. But weither a strict teacher is more valuable for ones' future than one who was able to relate with students is debatable. Maybe we either gained interest in the subject who was taught by the likeable teacher or we lost interest due to the fact that we were not forced to put up with the subject even if we liked it or not.
