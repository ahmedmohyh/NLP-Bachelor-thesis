I think both are important. If the teacher doesn't have the ability to relate well with his students, they won't be interested in this subject. And if the teacher doesn't have the good knowledge about the subject, he wouldn't be able to make good classes and bring the students forward.
On the other side the teacher doesn't have to have an excellent knowledge, to teach his students. It's totally enough if he knows what's in the book and if he have a knowlegde about the current threat. In this case, he should be able to awake the interest of his students with a good relation.
But a teacher doesn't need to have the ability to relate well with his students, if he or she have an excellent knowledge and knows more than he or she have to. In this case the teacher awakes the interest of the students without doing anything else than talking about the subject. 
But this case is very rare, and only in the gymnasium you may have a chance to get a teacher like this, a  teacher that knows more than he or she should.
So the statement can be true, but it isn't a general thing. 
An example is our history teacher, he doesn't care about us and isn't really able to relate well with us. But he has such a big knowledge about history. He can talk for like an hour, to answer one question. And since we have this teacher, more students like the subject history and are interested in this subject.
