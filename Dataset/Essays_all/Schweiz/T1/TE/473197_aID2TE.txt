No,i don't think it's more important, because a teacher has to know what he's talking about, while he teaches the subject. 
Of course it's great for the students when a teacher can relate with the students and their problems, but it's not the teachers job. His job is to teach them his or her subject right, so the students can succesfully pass their final examination. 

After all, everyone wants a teacher who is able to help you if you have a problem you don't want to discuss with your parents, especially if there exist any problems with learning or with other classmates. Then the teacher is the best person you can talk to. You shouldn't have a teacher who's "relating ability" is like the relating of a black leather glove. In a nutshell, a teacher has to teach his subject, but also needs to have a "human" side. I perfectly agree with that. In primary school, I had a teacher, who will not be named here, who had his own "favorite child" list. So, the ones who where on top of the list, could do anything they wanted to. Mainly the more intelligent ones. The others, which weren't the brightest in school, were bullied by the teacher whenever there was the chance to bully. So for example, they had to stay longer in school because the came five minutes late. While a student on the list never had to stay longer and could go home immideatly. I was pretty lucky, because I was in the top of the list, so I was never bullied by the teacher. But one of my best friends was sometimes treatened like a piece of shit.
