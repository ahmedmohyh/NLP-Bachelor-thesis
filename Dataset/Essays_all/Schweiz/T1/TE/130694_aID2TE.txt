To be a good teacher is important that you has both. To relate well with the students is sometimes difficult, because the students also must want do work with the teacher. If the teacher knows absolutly nothing about the subject he want to teach, he could have a perfect relate with the students but it use nothing. In my opinion is it very difficult to find a good way beetwen the two subjects. I can't learn something from a teacher that know not much about a subject because than the teacher also can't answer every question and it's much more difficult to have a good grade in the next exam. For example i have a teacher that just speak with the class about the world and special events at the scool. And one or two days before the next exam he remind that we should do extremly much themes to can challenge the exam.
