In my opinion this statement is not completely true, because I think a techer who knows a lot about his subject is more passionate than a teacher who is good in relating with students. For me passion is very important, because if a techer is passionate, mostly this subject is more interesting. But of course sometimes too much knowledge is not good. For example the lessons of math teachers which are really passionate but they can't explain anything because they explain it too difficult, are very bad and probalbly very boring. I think everybody would prefer a techer, which is nice and understands you but just if the lessons are interesting.

Another point, why I think the knowledge of a teacher is more important, is that I think that it's nice if you have the feeling that you can always ask your teacher any question, and he could answer. It's impressing if somebody knows a lot about a subject and maybe it motivates you to learn more about it.

My last point is that I think, that it's depending on the students, If you're teching in a university or in a very good school it's more important to know a lot, but in primary school it's more important to relate well with the children. I think that it's fine if teachers don't know everything about it in primary schhol. But afterwards I prefer having competent teachers, which have an excellent knowledge.

In total I would say that both points are important. You can't be a good teacher if you're not able to relate with students and you can't be a good techer if you don't have an excellent knowledge about your subject, but like I said before, it's also depending on the students.
