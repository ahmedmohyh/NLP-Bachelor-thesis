Being able to relate to your students as a teacher is very important, but having excellent knowlede of the subject is a big part too. In my opinion if you can't relate to your students it's harder to help them with problems to have or even understand the problems they're having. For example if students have multiple tests in one week it is hard for them to also complete alot of homework. Mostly this causes stress which you schould be able to relate to and try to narrow the homework accordingly so stress is less of a problem. At the same time it's harder to understand the problems they're having if you have excellent knowlede of the subject, because if you are excellent, you most likely have very high knowledge of the subject wich can mean that you can't explain the "easier" parts of the subject. For a rough example, if a math teacher has excellent knowlede of algebra it might be harder for him to explain the easier multiplications whithout the use of letters.
I think it very much depends on which level they are teaching, because if your teaching the complex parts of a subject it is easier to explain if you have excellent knowlede. Plus you most likely will be teaching this to a big learning group, where you don't necessarely need to relate to the students, whereas  when you are teaching in a lower class of around twenty people you mostly need the basics of the subject and there it is more important that you can relate to your students and explain the subject to them.
