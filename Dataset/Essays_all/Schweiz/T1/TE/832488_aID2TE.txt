I starded thinking about our school system. And then the question came up if it is better to have a teacher who has an excellent knowledge or if it is better that the teacher has a ability to relate well with students. On one side it is really good when the teacher has an excellent knowledge so he knows what he is taking about and he can answer the questions the students ask him. But we also have to see the other side .What is when the teacher knows to mutch and he explains to fast because he thinks it is simple to understand. In this situation it has to be told that it is also an important thing that the teacher tries to go in the situation of the students and then takes time to explain it to them. I have my own experience with this. I have a really nice and smart biologie teacher. He knows everything about biologie and he loves his subject. But for him it is really difficult to explain it to us , he thinks everything is easy to understand and that we already know a lot about what his talking about. But it is definitely not. He explains it to fast so nowbody understands anything. 
Now to the teachers ability to realate well with students. I think this is the most important thing . A teacher has to explain what he knows in a way the students understand it and he has to go (as I already said) in the situation of a student. So he can explain it in an easy way to understand.
