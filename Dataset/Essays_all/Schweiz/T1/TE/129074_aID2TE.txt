There are teacher who really well known their subject. If your have school in their lesson you notice that. But they can't conect with the students. It's like they don't know how they could bring the informations to the kids. They try to give as much informations as possible, but for us it doesn't make sens. Then they would learn more if they would google the things and learn it at home. If u have a teacher, who really can connect with the students it's much more easier to learn, because you understand the topic and the important things from begining and at the end you don't have to learn as much as if you don't understand it from begining and has just too much informations. 
You can see it from the other side, where you take think it's more important you have the subject skills then the connection to the students. If you have less informations and skills to a subject i's harder to bring that to students, beacause they will ask him things and he couldn't answer the question because he won't be enough skilled. If u have really good skills and know all over an object, the lessons could be really intressting for the students. Because the hteacher would know so much different informations.
I think the sentens is right, because i know the situation, you are sitting in the class and the teacher who really wellknown the topic is telling all the stuff. He really knows what he is talking about, but the students don't understand it and the teacher don't notice it that the class don't got it and he speaking more and more and nobody is listening to him anymore. I like if teacher know relly much about a topic, but they have to bring it on the students well, can connetct with them, makesome discussions and get the students into the topic.
