Our math teacher has two doctor titles. One in mathematics and another in physics. So she knows a lot about the subject. But her ability to relate with us, isn't that well. So one half of us likes her, because she knows so much about maths and the other half doesn't like her, because she isn't a lovely person. I try to find out what is more important.
First of all the students go to school to learn. So the teacher has to know a lot about his subject, he should answer all questions of his students.
The stuff the students learn, is also that, what they will need in their future. These two arguments are for an excellent knowledge of a teacher.

But students just listen to the teacher when he tells it friendly. That the students listen to the teacher is one of the most important things.
Further the students need to ask questions if they have ones. Many students are quite shy or haven't the courage to ask questions. But when a teacher has a good relation to his students, they ask. Students have to trust their teachers to one hundret percent. 
The motivation or to like or dislike a subject often is related to the teacher. If a teacher has a friendly personality, most of the students like him and so they also like his subject, because they like to go to his class. In contrast, an interested student can be influed of a bad relation to a teacher. Like in a lot of situations in a humans life, relations are the most important thing. 

But a friendly teacher without any knowledge is also useless. Because he should teach something and not be the friendly man. So the school has to find teachers with a good knowledge and a feeling how to treat students.

Finally I think that the excellent knowledge is less important. Because human relations are the most important thing and students can also learn something about relations in school. But of course teachers must have a knowledge, but it isn't necessary that it is an "excellent" knowledge.
