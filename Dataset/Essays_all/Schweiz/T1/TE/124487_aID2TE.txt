It is very important that teachers have a good relationship with the students, but this won't let you pass the final exams.
To talk to a teacher a bit more personal, is mostly funny and helps also in the lessons and with the oral mark. It is also usefull if you need or want something from the head teacher or the deputy head, so your teacher can talk well of you or your class. I am in the student organisation (SO) at Freudenberg, so I look that I have it mostly good with all teachers and with the head teacher and the deputy heads, but I don't go to class to many of them, so I don't need to learn there subject.
Because if the teacher is too focussed on having a nice talk with his students in class, instead of teaching his subjects with an excellent knowledge, you won't learn enough to pass the exams and you need to do all the revision alone. So it is better if the teacher makes a nice and clear "frontal teached" lesson with his subject in mind. Because he need to teach to the students what they need to know at the exams, so they really don't have enough time to play around in class with the students. Especially at the final exams (in Switzerland called Matura) which are not made by your teacher (don't care if it is your "best friend" or an asshole) you need to know everything about this subject, that you can pass them. And if the teacher is not ready to teach it perfect to you, you will fail them.
So I think it is on the one hand usefull that you have good relationships with the teachers, but in the lesson they should teach and not talk, so that you can pass the final exams and that you are prepared for a life afterwards f. e. at the university (where you will not have any relationship to the lecturers, nor good nor bad).
