In fact; Teachers are responsible for our future. Of course teachers have to do their best to teach us excellent knowledge but for shure it's also important that they get on well with their students. In my opinion it's much easier for Teachers to teach if they get to know that they are accepted. If there's kind of sympathy between each other, Students will visit the lessons with excitement.  
Every Student I've ever known had their favourite Teachers in their best Subjects. It just shows me once more that there's a huge importance between these two things. My own experience is nearly the same. I got on very well with my math-teacher in high shool and had marks above 5,5. Now I don't get on well with my math-teacher at all and my marks are below 3,0 most of the time. It just stops me in a way from being motivated and learn for the tests. 
In conclusion I think to relate well with students isn't more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught because it's in a way their own responsibility to get it, but it is important to get on well for the quantity of the stuff being thaught. It's important to pass the lessons easier, if you know what i mean? But in the end teachers are paid to teach knowledge.
