In this essay, I'm going to write about the statement, if a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being tauhgt or not. 

Today, most of the students are going to school and want to learn more than they already know. I think it's important that we learn new things in the lessons to improve for example our english. When you have a teacher who knows much about the subject, the students are intersted and want to know also this things. If you have an intelligent teacher, the students can ask many questions to learn many knew things about the subject. 


When you have a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject,it's also possible that he hasn't got a good relationship with the class he have to teach. When he doesn't take care about the students or when he isn't friendly, the student don't want to go to this lessons and they are bored. They don't want to join the lessons and they lose their motivation for learning new things.

On the other way it's also important that the teacher not only looks for his students, for example that he only tells funny things so that the students like him. Maybe sometimes it's good when the students can laugh about something, but the students don't go to schoolto have an comedian lesson. The teacher must give his knowledge to other people because it's his profession.

Know I want to tell you my opinion. I go to the gymnasium to learn more than I already know. So I want also a good school where people working with a ecxellent knowledge. For me, it's also important that he has an good relation to the students. I think it's very important that he can motivating the people to learn new things or to improve what we already know. When I enter into a classroom and see a teacher who is smiling then I think that he likes his profession and want to teach us.
