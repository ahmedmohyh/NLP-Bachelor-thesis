In my opinion it is more imortatant that a teacher has a good realtionship with a student. If the student doesn't like the kind how the teacher teaches and the student doesn't like to visit his lessons, he also won't like this subject so  much.of course it depends  on how much a student likes the subject, but if he doesn't like the teacher, the student doesn't like to visit this course and so the student doesnt  like the subject as much as be fore. if are good in ignoring things like that, it won't be a problem for you. you can ignore the way he teaches and just listen to the intersting things of the lesson. otherwise you can see it as  a normal school, a place where you have to learn as much as possible, not a place where you should have a nice day, with some friendly teachers.  but at the end I have to say, that i think it is more important, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject.   A teacher doesn't only has to be intelligent and knows much in the area. it is much more important that he knows the best way to teach and to talk also with the students about their familiar problems and stuff like that. as a teacher you aren't only the person who learns the kids mathematics or german or whatever, you are also like an idole in this subject. the more time a teacher has with a student, the more important it is to have a good relationship. I think in general there are too many teachers, who have an excellent knowledge in their subject, but the way they teaches is not very good. they just don't know how to explain difficult things and make interesting lessons.      foreor
