I think it's very important to have an excellent knowledge otherwise you can't teach children whatever they need to know. Kids are going to school to learn stuff and that's the top priotity I think. For example if the mother has no manners, how could you expect her son to have some, even if she tries to teach him how to have some, he won't listen because why should he act like that if his mother doesn't act like that too. There prbably seems to be no reason behind having some for him. That's not exactly what I wanted to say but how could you expect a teacher to teach her students something she doesn't even know herself. And saying that's just the way it is, just accept it already, isn't gonna help a kid to understand afterwards whatever they asked about.
But as we all know, no one likes a strict teacher and the way to success seems to be having patience and smiling friendly. This way, kids are more motivated to go to school, don't mess around and might even pay attention and have fun in class.
In my opinion it is so much more important to have a good knowledge than relate well with the students. Sure enough the opposite of a nice teacher isn't good either but still, it doesn't matter if the children listen to her as long as she can't answer any questions because she doesn't know them herself. Even if it's hard to behave the students in the beginning, discipline is going to bring a brighter future. Somewhen those little kids need to learn how to behave anyway and the longer you wait, the worse it gets for the ones that need to learn behaviour and rules. Also the kids have parents at home which should be nice to them and treat them friendly, the job of the teachers is only to educate them. So as you might have guessed already - I disagree with this statement.
