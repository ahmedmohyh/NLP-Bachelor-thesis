I think this really depends on which level the students are and how old they are. For example in the primary school it is much more important that the teacher can relate good with his students. The older the students get the more knowledge of the subject the teacher should have. When studets are young they can learn much more from a teacher that has a good relation to them than from a teacher that knows all about a subject but can't really explain it to beginners. But later when the students are getting older and their knowledge of the subject is getting better the teachers knowledge is more important. A teacher that is as good as his best student in his subject can't explain difficult things to his class. It is also important that teh teacher don't have something like an enemy in his class and he shoouldn't have favourite student. 

A good teacher should have a good knowledge of his subject and a good ability to relate with students. But he should also have a good knowledge about other subjects because so he can explain things of his own subject better to his class.
