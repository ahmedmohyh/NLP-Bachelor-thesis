A teachers profession  is to give his knowledge to his students, not to be the one who provides the most fun, he does not have have to be friends with all his students. Of course it would be optimal if both would be possible at the same time the have a lot of fun in class but it is much more important the learn in school. However a teacher is not a good teacher if he can't give a class a good working climate, which means to have a good relation to the students, otherwise the motivation of the students will result in the same problem as bad teaching, bad marks!
On the otherhand maybe you could say that the learning climate created by the relationship between teachers and students has a bigger effect than on the students than a not so good teaching and they learn a little less, but they learn that part better, but again the teacher must be able to teach at the highest level possible and make his students profit the most possible.

This statement can not be supported in such an extendl! It is of course very important that a teacher is able to sustain a good climate in his classes because otherwise the learning effect for the stundents is minimised since motivation to listend well and work concentrated is not given, but a teacher must exactly know what he is teaching and must know how to teach the students in a way they understand. The goal of the teacher must be to find a good mix between both qualities.
