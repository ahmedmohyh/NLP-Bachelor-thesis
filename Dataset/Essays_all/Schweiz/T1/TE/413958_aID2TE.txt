The following sentence is the subject of this essay: "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."

I disagree. Just start with the meaning of school. Why do we go to school? To make some friends? Yes, it's great if you can find some, but that isn't the key. We go to school to learn something, to get clerverer. So if you are doing well with your teacher but he can't teach you something, where's the point in being a teacher? Teaching other students is their job and not being friends with some kids. 
Teachers get money for their job and I don't think that my parents would give some adults money to be friends with me. 

So, an excellent knowledge about his subject is very important for me. First it's kind of embarassing if I have questions and he never knows the answer. On the other side it gets boring if we don't do something serious during class. My class has for example a teacher like this. We really like him, but he gets on our nerves. We talk about everything but we don't learn something. And we are still in school for learning and it's our time we waste with this inefficient teaching.

Yes, I think it's important doing well with the teacher, because it helps you to learn and concentrate. If I would hate a teacher I automatically would hate the lessons too. So the best thing is when we like each other and students can have fun with the teacher, because so you are more motivated. But between the lessons you learn seriously. 

So at the end I think, that the respect between teachers and students is important. It helps both, because they automatically like more doing their job: Teaching and learning. But the most important thing is the excellent knowledge about their subject. You can't do your job if you don't have an idea what you're talking about.
