Nowadays, students spend a lot of their time in school. Everyday they wake up early to learn about new subjects. Their teachers have a big role in this. They are not only teachers, they are more like people who help us during our learning process. Their ability to relate with students and the knowledge of their subjects are both important things. Which of these abilitys is more important for a successful student. 

Students have a lot of different teachers. For each subject there is another person. It is hard sometimes to understand the amount of information school gives you. Sometimes the knowledge of teachers is immense and students can be easly overwhelmed by this. In order they are not able to understand the topic. Only if the teacher is able to break down the information on an appropriate level for students, they can understand and connect the information. Therefore the teacher must be able to relate with student and understand their strenghts and problems. It helps him to understand their needings and to create perfect, class-fitting lessons.  

The teachers, usually well educated, have a great knowledge of their subject. But that alone does not help the students understanding the topic they are learning about. It needs far more than this. Only if a teacher can relate with his students, he will be able to teach well. So in my opinion, the ability to connect with students and understand them is more important. But this is not possible without the knowledge. A teacher should have both abilitys to successfully cooporate with his students.
