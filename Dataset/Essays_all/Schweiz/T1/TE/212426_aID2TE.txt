We all want good education, the students, the parents, the governement. But what can a teacher do to make sure that he teaches the best way? Is it more important to be able to relate well with students or is an excellent knowledge more relevant for a good performanceof the students?

On one side a teacher surely needs a certain knowledge to be able to teach the students what they need to know. So a lot of people say it's very important that a teacher knows as much as he can about his subject. On this way his students can learn as much as possible. Isn't the aim of education that students learn as much as they can? Often you need to have a great knowledge to be able to go to a good university. 

But what is a great knowledge when a teacher can't relate well with students? Teenager want to be taken serious by their teachers and they want to see that a teacher is really interested in their performance. A good relationship is a foundation for a good learing process. If a student likes to go to school because he likes the teacher studying gets so much easier. 

A lot of things are important for a good education. But if we only concertrate on a teachers behaviour I think a good relationship between student and teacher is more important than a excellent knowledge. Surely a teacher needs to have a certain knowledge but if a teachere can relate well with students he is able to teach them on a comfort base where school isn't a duty anymore. And that leads often to a higher interest of the studets for the subjects. Because who would like to go to a school where the teacher knows a lot but can't relate with you?
