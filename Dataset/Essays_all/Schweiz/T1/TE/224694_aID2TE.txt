How should teachers be?

We all know it. The lesson started. You enter the class and the first thing you'll do is to sit down. The teacher starts to speek about the new topic he introduced yesterday. As always after already 5 minutes it gets boring, you don't really listen anymore and the teacher continues to speak and speak and speak. Soon you realize that you have no clue about what the teacher really talked the whole time.

A teacher's duty is, like the name says, to teach, and to teach you have to have the ability to relate well with the students so they learn something. But what is the point of a teacher when he doesen't even have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? Well on one hand he forces students to pay more attention to what is being thaugt, because it might not always be easy if he can't relate well to students and so they learn how important it is to be entirely concentrated. On the other hand students with some concentration problems would have even more difficulty following the lesson if the teacher brings for example difficult words that he doesen't explains because his relation with the students in general isn't the best.

In my opinion you need a middle way, that is a teacher that has a pretty good knowledge of the subject being thaugt, while also having the abilty to relate well with students. There is no point in having a teacher that has a perfect knowledge of a topic, if he can't teach it to the students. A teacher has to have the ability to relate well with students so they learn it.
