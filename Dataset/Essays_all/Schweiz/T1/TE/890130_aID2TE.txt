I think that this statement is true, because when the teacher is a sympathic guy and can relate with his students, they will listen to him more than if he doesn't have a good relation with the kids.
For example I have a teacher who knows allot about his subject, but in class nobody listen to him because you have the impression that he speaks with himself. The hole lesson he's talkin and you don't know if he realize that it has people in front of him who should listen to him. Probably it is very interesting what he's telling us,but our attention isn't with him durring the lesson, we're more interested what our neghbour tell us.
Somtimes I have problems with concentration, it isn't easy for me to listen 45min to somebody without talking to my neighbour, and I'm not the only one.
So it's important,  that teachers have a good relation or connection to their pupils. The stundents must be interested in what their teachers tell them, he have to create his subject in a way that the stundents hang on his lips the hole 45min. The stundents aren't interested how much their teacher knows about his subject, but how he talks about his knowledge. 
I think if students also want to have that excellent knowledge of a subject, they will learn it probably at the university one or two years later. 
A teacher who gives lessons about a subject in school, knows anyway enough about the subject. He hasn't to be excellent, shure it can also be interesting but it isn't a must.
