I agree with this statement because if a teacher relates well with students they pay more attention I guess. It's easier to listen to a person you like than to one you don't like. The students would have more motivation and they want the teacher to like them so they will give good answers and follow the lessons. Excellent knowledge being taught is really important too of course but a teacher knows his subject anyway, otherwise he hadn't become a teacher. I think the knowledge how to treat the students is something a good teacher should have. Also the lessons are more interesting when teachers and students like each other. Maybe when they don't relate well there would be conflicts and conflicts have to be eliminated, that needs time and like that lots of lessons are lost because of talking. My opinion is that when I have a good relationship to my teachers I'm more productive and the lessons are great. Also the motivation to get up early in the morning may be bigger because waking up thinking of the teachers you don't like isn't that nice. But when you wake up and think of the good atmosphere at school and the lessons which could be really interesting it's so much easier. I think the good atmosphere is always really important because for example in the labor market you also pick the company you think you would fit in and you would feel comfortable. In school you can't decide to which teacher you want to go of course but when the atmosphere's nice and he relates well with students it's much more fun for everyone.
