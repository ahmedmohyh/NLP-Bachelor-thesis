The most teacher's i know have a very good kownledge of there subject but no idea how to learn it to there students and the class often understands nothing. In my opinion it's so important that a teacher relates well with his students, because wenn you only have a excellent knowledge of what you've studied before you can also talk to yourselve, because the students will not understand you. And then they go home, googling the Subject and hope that someone from the internet will better teach them.

I think that shoulden't be the solution. The teacher must have a special feeling how to learn students something and relates well with his students to have a good teamwork. Of couse, the teachers must have a excellent knowledge of the subjet being taught, but they also have to learn how they can bring it to the students. Bouth of them must be given. So i disagree with the statement.
