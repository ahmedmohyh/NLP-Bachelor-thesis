The students will learn more, because they are more motivated, when the teacher wants to relate well with them. But it is also possible that they don't have any respect and maby they think it's not important to learn anything, because the teacher only wants to relate well with them.
Maby if this statement is important for the teacher, then he likes to teach classes and likes to go to school every day to see the students and have fun with them or talk to them. But it could also be that he doesn't teach well anymore and that the students have problems after the school, when they want to study. Lots of universities have a high level and when the students want to study this subject, because it was a cool subject before, where the teacher didn't teach well and they didn't know, than it is a big problem and they realize that they didn't learn anything in this class.
I agree with this statement and in my opinion, it is a good thing, when the teacher wants to relate well with us. I learn more when the teacher is nice and helpful than when he only wants that we have excellent knowlegde in the subject. There are also other students, who need teachers that are more serious and not so related to their students, but I'm not a person like this, so I like it, when teacher is interested in me and asks me about my life and other stuff. But the teacher also has to be serious about his subject. So I think something between is the best. The teacher should be interested in us, but he also has to be serious and teach the subject correct.
