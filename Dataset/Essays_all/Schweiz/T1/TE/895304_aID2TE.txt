Teachers

It's monday morning, very early and everyone is still tired. The class takes a seat in the classroom and the teacher enters. I think nearly no one likes mondays and early morning  lessons. But if your teacher is able to motivate you and is able to make a lesson intresteing , even if its morning or monday, its a real talent. You see, if the teacher has the ability to relate well with students, the students listen, they  doesn't just pretend to. Its a thing of your head. If you walk in a classroom , knowing this is gonna be a boring lesson, it will be a boring lesson. But if you know, there is a teacher who understands students, is able to speak to the students and talk in an interesting way, even if hasen't an excellent knowledge about the actual subject , its diffrent and you listen. Let's have a look at this situation :you're in a lesson with a teacher who is hoplessly in love with his own subject, loves every single detail about it and knows everything. I mean thats great but its kind of a waist of knowledge if he isn't able to teach his stuff right and nobody understands what he's talking about. But there is something inbetween: Its not good at all if youre teacher is too "cool". He really has to know something, and has to know what he's actually talking about. Because i know an example,where there was a teacher who said:"Oh , ask your real teacher, he can explain this better ( the real teacher was absent ). But in the end i really do agree with the statement " A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
