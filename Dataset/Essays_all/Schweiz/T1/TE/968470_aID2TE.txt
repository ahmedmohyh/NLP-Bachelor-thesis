Both kinds of teachers have their good and bad sides. There are teachers who relate very well with students, but they have a bad knowledge and can answer only a few specific questions. May the students like him or her but they know that he hasn't a good knowledge and they don't take him for full.
On the other side there are teachers who know everything and they can answer every question you have, but they don't make any jokes during the lessons and they don't help you very much. Teenagers don't like this kind of teachers because their lessons are always very similar and it isn't easy to consentrate. 
But there exist a few teachers who have a good mixure of both. They are very kind and helpful, they can laught with you and be spontanious and they also have an excellent knowledge. In their lessons, it's interesting to consentrate on the subject and involve yourselfe.
Of course there are many teachers who are somewhere between my examples. There are theachers who have an ecellent knowledge in his or her subject and others have a wide knowledge about many things in the life and not just about his or her subject.

I disagree with this statement because I think both is very important to be a good teacher. Of course it's very important to relate well with the students and when you don't have this ability at all you haven't understand what a theacher is in my opinion. But when you just have a very small knowledge of your subject, you can't teache at all and your stundents won't learn anything.
So I think both things are very important and you can't say that either of them is more important than the other.
