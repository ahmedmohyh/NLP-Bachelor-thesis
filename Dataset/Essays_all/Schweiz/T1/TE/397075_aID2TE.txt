A good relation between the teacher and the students can make the lessons more exciting and the students will listen more carefully and stay activ. If the teacher doesn't relate well with the students the lessons can be very boring even if the knowledge of the teacher is very good. But for shure there is also a link between what the teacher knows and what the students think about him. If the teacher has no idea about his subject the students will notice that and don't relate with him anymore. Probably a good combination of the both is the key to succes. Personally I think the most import thing is that the teachers do what they are interested in. Otherwise the students will never be interested because it doesn't seem natural if the teacher teaches something just because he has to.
If the teacher talks about something he also likes to do independant of his job, the students can relate much better to it and it'll be much more easy to learn because they can associate it to the teacher.
I am much more interested in the subject if the teacher teaches it naturellly because he likes it. The knowledge of the subject should be good, but the relation is more imbortant to me. If I like a teacher learning is very easy.
