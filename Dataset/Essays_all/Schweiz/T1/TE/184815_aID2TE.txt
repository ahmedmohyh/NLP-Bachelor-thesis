Everyone has a teacher during his education carrier who they likes or dislikes. This depends on the personalities,but students tend to feel more comfortable around teachers,who can relate to them because they seem to be more friendly and helpful. Why?

People who have  been to primary schools have usually good memories of their educators. The teachers try to sympathise with them, so they can understand the topic. As a child they feel more comfortortable and pay more attention in what they say.

The education from a teacher who sees their students on the same wavelength will  much likely be better remembered than from someone who does not.
They speak to the listeners and that makes the topic interesting for everyone. If a there is a question the students will receive a satisfying answer, because they responder knows how they feel and try to adapt their way of learning.

In contrary the stuff the teacher talks about will not be worth listening to. In the universities there will be more lectures and the students have to adapt to their educators. If that succes the quality of education will be worth the effort. 
The reason for a proper education is gaining more knowledge and has not necessarely to be pleasing. 

To resume it, it is important to have an educator who teaches sees their students on the same wavelength but depending on the education level, it is rather less welcomed.
