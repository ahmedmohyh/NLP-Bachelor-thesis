First of all, what does it mean "relate well with students? There are actually some teachers, which have more ability to be sympathic with their students and there are the bad teachers, which are career or money orientated, or just have the disciplin to do exactly, what their boss said to them.Especially these teachers are the most hated people in schools. This facts are based on own experiences,trust me. 
But let us talk about the good ones now. They are often the older ones, which were doing this job for a long time. Bacause of that, they don't have to be afraid of loosing their job, can relax more with the students and don't have to be accurant with the lessons. 

The definition of the second argument is easy to understand. This is also important for the teachers. Their job is to clear all the questions and problem in their students heads. They don't only have to know, what they supposed to know, they have to be experts in their subject.

I think both of the specialities must have a teacher to do a great job. There is no use to whom, which are like friends with students but can't give a complete answer to them, because on that way, going to school would be useless. And otherwise, a very hard teacher, which every student hates is also unnessecary for the students. If you hate your teacher, you automatically don't listen to the thinks they talk about.
