In the following essay it's about our teachers. It's something very important because we have to deal with it every day until we get out of school. 

Teachers often only know the facts about that what they have to teach. Sometimes they are some real genies. This is great but if you're a genie in something, you don't think that it's difficult to solve a problem or to understand those subjects. But if you're a student, you might have some problems you can't solve or you don't even understand what it is about. And because the teachers cannot relate with the problems of a student they won't even try to figure out what our problems are. As a student you are going to get worse marks just because you cannot ask your teacher. Sometimes there are students that are afraid of their own teacher just because the teachers do not understand the problems from the student and so they are maybe giving them the the feeling of being dumb or annoying. 

I think it's very important, that the teachers can relate with us. If I can ask a teacher something without that he's thinking that I'm dumb, I can trust him. But if there's a teacher at the school that is going to yell at me when I'm asking something, I'm getting cuite quikly annoied and angry. I also think that it is very important that teachers should  be able to relalte with their students because if not the students aren't looking forward to school and this is very sad if you're pissed off every day just because of your teacher. We also have a teacher in our school and everybody is afraid of her just because she's a genie and nobod can ask her something because every one is afriad of the answers. She also is able to get students crying or something like that and this is not very comfortable for us all.
