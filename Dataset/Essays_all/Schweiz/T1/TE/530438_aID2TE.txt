First of all, a lesson is more interesting and funnier for a student when the teacher doesn't teach just very straight and focused on the school stuff. It's nice when the lessons sometimes are a bit funny and you do not feel like you're in a prison and just follow the advices of your teacher. For me as a student, I learn better for a subject where I like the lessons and therefore also like how the teacher teaches than for a subject where the teacher feels like a policeman or someone else who just tells you what is right, what is wrong or what you have to do.
On the other side it's important that students learn the stuff they have to know for their Matura. When there is always this lazy and funny attitude you won't learn anything because it more feels like free time than school for a student. Also when the teacher is always making jokes and doesn't give you his knowledge, you can't learn the stuff you need to know for your Matura.
Another point is that I think it's nice to have kind of a connection or relation to your teacher. It feels good when you know that your teacher is interested in what you do and what's going on. Worst thing for me is when a teacher doesn't even know your name because he's just very focused to teach us the things we should know.
How serious you take a subject depends also on the teacher and not just on wether you like the topic or not. It's important that there is some space between teacher and student. When you get on a level where you're more friends with your teacher than he is really a teacher, I think the teacher looses his authority and you will not take your subject serious anymore.
In my opinion it's difficult to say I agree or I disagree with this statement. The best way for me is to find a middle way. It's nice to have a good relation with your teacher but there should also be a little distance so it doesn't feel like your friend is teaching you.
