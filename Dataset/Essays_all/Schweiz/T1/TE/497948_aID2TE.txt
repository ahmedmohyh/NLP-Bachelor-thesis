First of all, the best case would be that the teacher is able to master both of them, the relation with his/her students and the knowledge of his/her subject.
But if I had to argue for one of them I would say that the more important aspect is the knowledge, because you can't teach something you don't know and it will allways look better when you know what you say/taught. If a teacher relates very well with his students, but he can't realy explain the matter of his subject or he has a lack of proper information, the students will immediately recognize this and won't take him/her serious and also won't learn anything. So in this case I see way more negative arguments than positive.
And how I said on the opposite, when you as a teacher have an excellent knowledge of your subject the most of the students will automatically take you more serious and will listen to you and remember your stuff. It's also easier to learn how to develop a good relation to your class than earn a proper knowledge of a whole subject because if you're a teacher for long enough you will automatically learn how to relate better with your students in class because you know how to interact with them.
So, my final conclusion would be the following: Even if you can't relate very well with your students if you have proper knowledge of your subject it will allways benefits you and your students.
