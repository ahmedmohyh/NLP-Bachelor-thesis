I don't think that it is a teachers job to relate well with his students. A Teacher when he wants to become one realls do needs to be able to talk and connect to the children or his students but no further. He's not a friend and doesn't need to be one during class. He needs the minimal abilty to talk and understand students but he doesn't needs to relate on a friendly base. Kids don't learn all the same there are a lot of ways to taught them. If you want to  study you shouldn't think that a teacher will help you after class or even know more about you than your name. I personally think that there needs to be a profesional distance between the Students and their teacher. Of course Humans aren't robots we do need to realte with others try to understand them and help them when they need it. We humans connect enough socialy with others, so I don't think that teachers need to be that close to the students. Because only if they don't know you they can grade you for your Achievements and not for your personality. A teachers first job is to taught you the subject eversthing else comes after that. When I finsh my class it's more important to know the subject than having some funny conversations with my profesor. Because that's the point to learn stuff to have a brighter horizon and to leave school with a wide general knowledge. A teacher can make a class more funny and entertaining and it can help so that the students like going to school and have more interest in the subject but I think that's cheating. 

A teacher should be able to teach a subject without jokes or offering free candy. But it is also important that the students dont relay on having a fun time they should study the subject and don't have any expectations that the class should be funnny, because they are there to learn an nothing more. That's why I think that a teacher's ability to realte well with students is important but never as important as the excellent knowledge of the subject they're being taught.
