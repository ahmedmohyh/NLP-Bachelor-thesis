First of all, it is very important that there is a positive relation between the teacher and the students, because if there is not, the teacher may not be this engaged he should be. Secondly, the students might not listen to the teacher carefully when they do not like him and this would be negative for both, the teacher and the students. Furthermore, it could be that the teenagers want to sabotate the lessons of the teacher, for example by damaging the computer or anyting like that and then they do not listen to him and he can not show them anything. 
However, it is also very important that he knows everything about the subject he teaches, because if he does not know anything about it, the students might not take him serios and the lessons would not be very productive. Aditionally, the teacher may not want to show the teenagers that he does not know everything about the subject and then he could tell them anything wrong acout the issue. And last, but not least, when the teacher does not know enough about the theme he teaches, it would also be very bad for the students, because they would have a huge problem at the final exams.
In conclusion I can say that I agree with the statement above, because In my opinion a pleasant relation between the students and the teacher is the base for a good and memoriable schoolyear. When the students sho respect toward the teacher and he shows respect, too, the teenagers listen to him and they learn a lot of new facts.
