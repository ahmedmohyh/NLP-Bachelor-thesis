A teacher has to know what he teachs the students, thats logic. But, do he has to know the subjects perfect? An argument that disagree with the statement is that there are no perks when a teacher gets very wellwith the students but they learn nothing because he has no clue of the subjects he has to teach. Sure it's a good time for the students, they don't have to work in the lessons. But one time they have to know these things, they will have a problem when they got another teacher or when they have to write a test. That's an argument that someone could bring, but it's not that what the statement tells. It's not nessecary that a teacher knows the subjects perfect, because most of the students wan't understand perfectly what they learn in school, so it's completely enough when the teacher don't know each detail. And that's what I think, a teacher who don't know the subjects he has to teach excellent but he's good at explaining and the students like him is better than a teacher who's very intelligent but the students don't understand his thinkings and he can't explain. Also important is that people learn better when they like it. One funny hours of maths is more effective than two hours but without fun. And a teacher who relates well with the students can bring a subject to the students with fun automatically. So my opinion is that is't more important that a teacher relates well with the studens than he know the subjects very well.
