The abilitys to relate well with stundents and to have an exellent knowlegde of the specific subject being taught are very important, but which one of them is more important? The ability to relate well with students or to have an extremly well knowlegde of the subject? In the following essay I will write about why I think to have a knowlegde of the subject is much more important and why.

First of all, the ability to relate and to communicate with stundents is very important for a teacher. If they don't do that, the stundents won't like and maybe won't even listen to them. If a teacher build kind of a realtionship with the students it's much more easier to be active in the lessons and don't have to worry to say something wrong.
But on the other side, if the teacher is too good to the students, they'll probably lose the feeling that they are in school and won't learn anything. When the teacher know about what he's talking it's easier to ask questions, because as a student you know that this teacher has a exellent knowlegde of this subject. In situations like the students can profite of the lessons and afterwards they can write a good mark.

Like I already said in my opinion the knowlegde of a teacher have much more priority then how he relate with students. Strict teachers are more effective for students, but that doesn't mean that they should be afraid of the teacher and even worser that they are afraid to be a part of the lesson. The best way is to combine this two things. Like this student profite alot of the subject and the teacher have fun to teach them something.
