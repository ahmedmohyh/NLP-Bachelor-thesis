Teachers are important figures in the life of any student, they pass on knowledge and influence them in many ways. But sometimes teachers don't have to just have knowledge about an certain subject they also have to relate to students and put themselves in their shoes so they can pass that knowledge on correctly. 
Any person can have excellent knowledge about a subject but that doesn't mean they have the ability to teach and pass that knowledge on to others. If you can't be pacient and relate to the person you are supposed to teach something to then you can end up being the worst teacher in the world. 
It is the abilty to relate to the student, to understand how he thinks and how his learning process is that you are really going to pass on your knowledge the best way possible. And this is the most important thing of all. Of course the teacher should have an excellent knowledge about the taught subject, but if he doesn't have the ability to put himself in the shoes of the students he will never be able to reach them correctly. Therefore all the knowledge he has is for nothing, cause it can't be passed on. 
On the other hand if a teacher doesn't have full knowledge about the taught subject but can relate to the students it doesn't help at all, cause there is nothing to pass on. It is the combination of relating with the student and having knowledge that makes the perfect teacher. And this can make him more than just a teacher, but also to a person the students will respect and, if they are children, they'll use the teacher as an inspiration figure. 
Nobody forgets a good teacher. He passes on his knowledge to us students while relating to us completely. He understands our struggles, questions and any other emotions and thoughts we may have, making the learn process a fun and enjoyable experience and the teacher to a succesfull person in his line of bussiness.
