In our career at school we meet a lot of different teachers who have all an other point of view, especially how to teach and how to handle students. In my opinion this is very important and makes the daily school-life a little bit more interesting. 

Firstly, I want to clarify that it is very important that a teacher has all the knowledge he needs to teach the class specific themes. Obviously, the students will recognise if the teachers abilities are weak and the knwoledge is not on the level it should be. At this point are the students very harsh because if they see that the teacher is not able to teach something they will take full advantage out of this. Sothe point is that a teacher should be well prepared and clearly should have all the knowledge he needs for his daily work otherwise it will not be funny for him.

Secondly, I want to emphasize that for the education of students it can be very important if the teachers ability to relate with students is well. On the one hand a teacher should be very human, nice and positive on the other hand the teacher has to be strict and sometimes also strict and severe. So it is up to he teacher if he finds the right way between being a nice friend to the students or just doing his job. 

In essence, I can say that the job of teacher is not being friends with all the students and relate well with all of them he has to teach the stuff he knows even the class hates him. So in my opinion it is more important if the teacher has excellent knwoledge of the subject he teaches than his ability to relate with the students. All in all we have to know all the stuff for maura and we will not have any advantage out of it if the teacher has not taught us anything in the last years . So as hard as it sounds we are just at school to learn for university life and not to be friends with teachers.
