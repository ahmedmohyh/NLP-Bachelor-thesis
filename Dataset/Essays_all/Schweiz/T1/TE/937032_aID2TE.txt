What is more important? That the athmosphere in the classroom is better or that the teacher realy can teach the knowledge.
There are many arguments.

What speaks for a teacher who just wants that the students know all the grammar. Whis such a teacher the students will learn a lot, learn how to learn and will have disciplin. That won't help them just in this subject, it will help them in many subjects and in many other situations in the future. But would the sudents like this subject? Maybe not. Because it's realy hard to be always concentraded without breaks. They will loose the motivation to learn.

But when there is a teacher who's friendly the students will like the classes and will be motivated. it's possible, that they learn a lot more than with a realy straight teacher, because the atmosphere is good.

My opinion is, that you can't answer this statement with a clear answer. I don't want a teacher, which always is realy straight and gives many homeworks. but on the other side I neither want a teacher which is always friendly, but can't teach the knowledge. So I prefer a mixture. It's important, that the teacher is straight, because if not the students won't have much respect. But the teacher sould also be kind and should make some jokes. That creates a nice athmophere in which the students can learn a lot
The two aspects which are written in the statement should be well balanced.
