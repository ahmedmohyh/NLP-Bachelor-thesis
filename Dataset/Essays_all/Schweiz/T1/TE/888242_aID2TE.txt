I think this statement is true, because I am conviced that the students pay much more attention to the class when they have a good relationship with the teacher. It is clear that the teacher have to know the subject very good but I think that a person who had difficulties to understand certain things in a subject understand the problems of the students because the person had the same problems. Also I think that a genius in the subject can't understand how the students don't understand the subject because it is so easy for a genius and he got that quickly. 
So also I think the students don't chat with each other or do stuff the shouldn't do during class when they like the teacher and they have the feeling that they really learn something in class. I think it is important for good classes that the teacher know how he can interest the students.
Also when the students come good on with the teachers they go much likely into school. So they have more motivation for learning something in school and then they actually do.
