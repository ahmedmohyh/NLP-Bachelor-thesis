I both agree and disagree with this statement. On the one hand it is very important for a teacher to understand how their students learn and how their minds work. They need to know how to make their subject interesting to us and to do that they need to know us and our way of thinking. So relating well to students is an important aspect in the tacher-student relationship. Without that the situation can easily become frustrating for both seides. The students get frustrated because they don't feel understood and/or respected, which leads to a bad learning environement, which can then lead to the students disrespecting the teacher. And as a consequence the teacher is then frustrated aswell beacause the students don't do what they want them to do. And in the worst case everyone is unhappy with the situation.
On the other hand it's also important for the teacher to have great knowledge on his subject. If they don't know what they're talking about it's impossible for them to teach other people. You can't explain something to someone who's never heard of this before if you yourself are not an expert on it and fully understand every aspect involved. I find it very frustrating when teachers can't properly explain something to me and I have to try to teach myself instead. This makes even the most likeable teacher annoying to me because i feel like I have to do all the work in the learning process when it should be teamwork. This just like my other example leads to a bad learning environement. 
In conclusion I think, as with everything in life, a healthy balance is key. A good teacher has to understand their students in order to bring his subject closer to them. However they also need to have excellent knowledge of their subject because that is essential to be able to teach it, and teaching is what they're paid for after all.
