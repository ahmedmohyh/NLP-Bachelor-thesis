One often asked question is whether the ability to relate with the students or the teachers knowledge is more important to teach a subject and make it understandable for everyone. What are the arguments for and against each of these abilities?

A teacher who can relate well with their students is able to make the lessons and the subject more appealing to the class with different ways of teaching because the teacher knows pretty well how which ways are more efficient. Especially young teachers who had a similar system of school and teaching themselves and who still remember their time in school have this ability to make the lessons more interesting and appealing to the students.

A good relation between teacher and students is also important to make sure that both sides respect eachother. Students who are not happy with their teachers start to ignore them and maybe even make fun of them. And on the other side single students who don't behave properly may lead to unfair behaviour of the teacher. 

But you must not forget that the main purpose of school is teaching the students the subject with your knowledge. There is no benefit from a good relation when the teacher doesn't know the subject and teaches wrong things. In the exams the wrong theory might still be marked as right because the exams are made by the teacher but later in life maybe even at a university these faults are fatal.

Secondly, a teacher has to be able to explain the theory to all the students eventhough some students might not understand it first. With a really good knowledge of the subject it might be easier to find a way to explain it to single students.

While I think that both abilities are really important and you can't be a good teacher without both of them the more important ability to me is the knowledge of the subject. The main purpose of school
