I think it`s very important that a teacher has a good relation to his students and that he knows how to motivate them.
Of course it`s excellent when he has a good knowledge of his subject but for a student it`s more important to have a good relationship to his teacher so he can discuss with him or ask questions without any problems questions. If the teacher doesn`t know how to handle his students and how to wake they`re interest for his subject the student`s won`t be too motivated or showing they`re interest because the subject seems to them like the teacher does: boring and not necessary for life. Of course a lot of people say if a teacher hasn`t an excellent knowledge about his subject he isn`t able to give the kowledge to his students and the students won`t learn as much but what sense does it make when a teacher has an excellent knowledge but he isn`t able to give his knowledge to the students?
I also think that on the human side it`s much more important that the teacher has a good ability to relate well with his students because it makes a good "clima" in the class and I`m sure the students will be much more interested in this subject when they like the teacher and can do some jokes with them, even if he is a person with autority. 
But on the scientific side it`s of course the knowledge of the teacher that counts and just on second place his "social competences".
So at the end my opinion is that you can`t say that statement is right or it`s wrong, it depends what`s your perspective and on your own experiences.
I also think that a good combination olf those two would be great. So you can stay motivated in front of a great teacher and his knowledge isn`t probably the best but it`s enough for school, and let`s be honest most of what we learn at school doesn`t stay long in our brain after we wrote a test about it. :)
