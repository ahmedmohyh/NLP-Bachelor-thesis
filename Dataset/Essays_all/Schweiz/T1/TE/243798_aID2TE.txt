I think it's important that the students like their teacher because than they pay more attention in his lessons. But it's also necessaire that he has an excellent knowledge of the subject he is teaching. A teacher who doesn't understand his subject can't explain it good enough. So it wouldn't make a difference if the students pay attention or not. Another reason why it's important that the teacher and the students have a good relation is that if students don't like or even hate their teachers, their knowledge isn't as good as it would be if they would like him. Thats because they hate the subjects being taught by him, they learn less for the tests and they ask less questons when they something don't understand.
In my opinion the teachers ability to relate welll with his students is important as having an excellent konwledge of the subject being taught. So I have to disagree with this statement.
