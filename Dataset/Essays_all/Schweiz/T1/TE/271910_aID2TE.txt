Yes, and No

I have had many different teachers. All of them are unique. Of course, because they are all humans(I am not sure about 3 of them) and every person is different. They all have just one thing in common, they are teachers. Some of them are very nice and can communicate very well with us student, the others have a knowledge enormous(and then are the ones that are just bad).

We have a test next week and I think it is obviously that the teacher has to us the right material for learning and the theme that he or she is going to test. The goal of a teacher is to teach the pupils, so that they know what he or she might trying to supervise.
The personality does not matter, it is about the learning stuff. The teachers can be strict and mean but they should ame for their goal.

In fact I am also a teacher and I know how hard the job. Teaching well is a art. You have to have the right feeling for it. Without the right knowledge you might 

In my opinion both things are very important for a teacher. 
A teacher, that can't teach, relate, communicate can not be a teacher.
But a teacher that that has no knowledge, that means nothing to teach, can also not be a teacher.


From my own life experience a teacher should have both.
