A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught

The atmosphere in a classroom is very important. For example if the students feel comfortable or not, if they have friends, fun and if they like the teacher which is teaching. We all know how important the teacher is. His is able to make his subject interesting, he is the one which teaches us the things we will need in life.  If the students like the teacher they can better learn and pay more attention. The subject becomes more interesting and they learn more and that is what we want. But what if the teacher has the ability to teach things, but his knowledge is not sufficient? A sufficient knowledge is more important at this point, is not it?

Not everyone should be able to become a teacher just because he has the "ability to relate well with students". Your konwledge must be on point. You have to know what you are talking about and teach the stuff to your students. The students registrate if you don't know what your are talking about. They will not dare you anymore. That would be the worst case. To teach the stuff is  your mission. A big knowledge can passionate too. 

In conclusion: it is important that the teacher has a huge knowledge, but we should not underestinate the power of a teacher which is popular with the students. He has a big influence and a biger ability to teach the stuff the students have to learn. But to be able to do that he has to have a big knowledge. I would not say that one of this two things is more important. I think a mix between both is the best solution.
