- good relation, better learning
- not good knowlege
- school in the background
- isn't a teacher, like a friend

If a teacher was only there to relate well to students he hasn't to be a teacher. Every person that can handle good with other people could be a teacher. The job wouldn't have got such an long study and you wouldn't have to know extremely many things about your subjects you thaught. When you have a good relation to a teacher he's may more like a friend and in situations like tests he isn't like a teacher. It might be that he hasn't the same strenght than if he hadn't had such a good relation. If you can handle very well with your teachers may you won't learn so much as if they are concentrated on the stuff in their subject. Maybe the relation gets so well that the school falls in background for you and you think you needn't learn all this things. You think that your teacher will make that good and wont make a difficult test or he gives you a good mark whatever you've done because he likes you. He doesn't know all the themes and parts of the subject exactly. That could be a problem. He could teach false knowledge and he isn't sure what he's exactly doing.

It also has positive aspects to have a good relation to your teacher. You like it to go into the class to this one and you can learn the stuff he teaches better. It is easier for you to concentrate and you like the way of lessons the teacher does. It motivates you that you come out well with your teacher and you would like to make your work seriously and good to show the teacher that you learned the things he wanted to teach. If you have bad marks it's also easier for you to go to have a chat about this with your teacher. You know if he likes you and you also like him you can talk to him every time and he'll understand and help you with your situation.

My opinion on the statement is that you can have a well grown relation to your teachers but you mustn't think that you are friends now and you don't have to learn much and so on. You have to concentrate on the knowledge your brain has to have until your final exams. I think the teachers should have an exact knowledge about the subjects they teach because only than the students can be prepared the best for their life after school. It's very bad when for example your brother or sister who is older than you knows other things about a subject and you are retarded. That is not good if you want to learn a good job later. Maybe you have to get extra classes because of this and this wouldn't be good.
