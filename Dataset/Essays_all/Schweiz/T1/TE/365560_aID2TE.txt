A teacher's ability to relate well with students is really more important, because if the pupils haven't got any motivation, they won't learn. Of course it's important too to have a bit of knowledge, or at least it makes it easier to go ahead.But if the teacher doesn't see how to teach the children in the right way, everything can go wrong and you can't go ahead anyway.
There was a study too in India, where they had compared the teaching of English somewhere in Europe and in India. The Europeans were more fixed in grammatical aspects, the Indians more in speaking and hearing. Some years later the result was that the Indians could speak much better than the Europeans, because they used it everytime.
 So I agree with this statement. The knowledge of a subject isn't as useful as long the teacher knows how to bring the pupils to use English in their daily life. Knowledge is needed for the basic but then you should use it instead of confusing others with more and more aspects.
