If a teacher has a good relation to there students it's very good so the student would also listen more. But if the teacher trys to explain the subject tey are at butshe doesn't know a lot abot it that's not good for the student. but when the teacher has a good relation the students would not try to tlk with others during the class, well mabey they do but not every one. But when they try not to then its also better for the student to consentraid himself. When the teacher just know a few thing about something and she/ he wants to talk about it with student, then she/ he should first go and make some researches befor she/ he learns them something completly wrong. Of corse it great to have "cool" teachers to talk with and lath. I think when the situation is like that more students would like to go to school with pleasure because it makes someone happy if you have a great teacher which you practically see everyday. But when you go to school then you are not just going to have fun and make friends but also to study somethig for your life. And I don't think, that you study something for your life if your teayher is incompetent and unprofesional. 
So my opinion is , I think I made it very clear, of corse I'd like to have a great teacher but when i go to school I would like to study new things form my future life, or also for my future work. But the teacher should also can explain it and know a lot about if not just a few things. Well of corse a teacher can't know everything about a subject but he/ she should be so profesionsal to just teach us the rigt thing and let us build our own opinion about it also if his opinion is coplitly else.
