When it comes to teachers opinions are very different. Since students do neither have the same strengths nor characters it is difficult to tell what is more vital for teaching. Some people are desperate because of the teacher's inability of getting along well with their stundents. Other can not understand a particular subject because they are not teached in the right way.
For sure knowing his subject is essentiel for being a good teacher. However the necessity of its extent can variate depending on the level a subject is tought. For instance a history professor at a university must have a bigger knowledge on certain events in Russian revolutions than a primary school teacher at basic level. As a matter of fact universities will not employe a teacher without a high degree in a specific subject.
As mentioned before depending on what level stuff is being tought the teacher's requirements are different. In primary school teachers' challenge is to encourage children to learn and have faith in themselves rather than teach them to have good grades.
