The statement says that it's more important to have a good relation too his/her students than being well in his/her subject that he/she wannna teach.
I think both is important for being a teacher. If you're not good in the subject you wanna teach you shouldn't become a teacher. But if you hate children you also shouldn't become a teacher. You're a teacher to help other people learn your subject and in my opinion it's very important that you have a good relationship too them. 
If a teacher gives me the feeling that he/she doesn't like me gives me the feeling that he/she doesn't wanna teach me something.
I recognize when a teacher doesn't like me. This makes automatically that I'm not very interested in his/her subject. The teacher must show interesting that he/she want to teach me something and if he/she doesn't give me that feeling of wanna help me to learn something for my life why should I wanna listen to him/her? I mean why should I listen too a person that gives me the feeling of being unable in the subject?
A teacher who doesn't have a big or very well knowledge of her subject but is able to teach you the things and gives you the feeling that he/she wants to help learn you something that you can use for your life and shows you interesting is for me a better teacher than a person who shows you no intersting. If I feel that someone is trying to teach me something I want to learn it and I will more try to learn the things he/she is trying to teach me. 
So for me is a good relate too the students more important than a perfect knowledge in the subject you're teaching.
