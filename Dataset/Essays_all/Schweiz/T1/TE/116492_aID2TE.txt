It's important that a teacher knows what he's talking about, that he knows about his subject and that he can answer questions not only about the things he is teaching at the moment.
But much more important than that is his motivation. His way of explaining things, his passion about his subject, his way of treating his students.
Because a teacher not only gives new information and knowledge to his students, but also is kind of their mentor. I can see this every day myself. The teachers who love their subject, who not only talk about the themes they have to, but also about the daily application of the subject or quotes from experiences they had, who interact with me and my classmates  are so much mor appreciated. They not only give us more knowledge but also motivate us.
A teacher that treats me like a person and makes jokes, gives me a motivation to listen, a reason to study, because I can see where I am going with it, I can see a use and my gap of motivation gets filled.
I think that I am speaking for all students when I talk about a gap of motivation, because everyone has it and one of the few things that helps it is a  teacher who gets on well with us, who doesn't make us bad in front of others and treats us nicely.
Nevertheless, it is very important for teachers to have a lot of knowledge, especially the older the students get, because we're in school to learn something, if they don't know what they are talking about he can loose his students' respect and the main subject of school (learning) is missing.
So thats the thing; A teacher needs both of them: The right amount of social skills to bring his knowledge to his students, to get them interested, but he also needs to know something, otherwise kids won't learn anything and thats why they are in school mainly.
