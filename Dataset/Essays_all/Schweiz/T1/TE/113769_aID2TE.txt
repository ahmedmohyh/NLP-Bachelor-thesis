A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Some students are not happy with their teachers. Some are telling:"My teacher is not able to explain something." Others are talking about that teachers are not able to relate with the students. But which of these two things is more important: Good explanations or nice teacher?

If students have to go to subjects they do not like because of the teacher it is more difficult to be motivated. If the teacher is not able to explain anything, it is hard work to get a good mark in the tests. It is worringly when a student has to teach a teacher, but somtimes it seems to happen like this. So the important question is: Why is this teacher allowed to give school? Maybe he was good in study but just unable to explain something. Furthermore there are some subjects which are more difficult to teach like maths or physic, so it is important to get a good teacher there.

It is possible that there is an other problem with teachers: If they are just unable to get the controll about the class it is not funny for a lot of students. Because when it is allways loud and not attentive anybody can learn something and then it is not important if the teacher is okay and get a big knowlege or not. When you get a teacher like this you have to learn a lot by yourself. Nevertheless there are also teachers which are extremly strict and are not looking to the students problems.

In my opinion the teacher is not the only reason for a good note but it can be a motivation. Everyone has to look to themselves and there are other posibilities to be good like looking on the internet.
