Teachers are just crap. They always want attention, which leads only to more laziness. Learning stuff in a teacher-student relation is not the real thing. Furthermore teacher often tend to do the work for themselves and do not want thô help students. So teachers are just an unneeded person in the room.

Students are able to learn difficult stuff without the help of a teacher. In busy lessons, students often cannot follow the teacher's learning pace. As a consequence they are going "offline". They do the stuff at home, when there is calmness. Teacher are just not able to relate well with students. That is a fact. There is the difference in the age and a completely different attitude towards work. Teachers often do the work for themselves. So students must learn alone or in groups.

Excellent knowledge of the subject is the most important ability for a student. That is as well what teachers are expecting of students! Teachers could help in the learning process to get to excellent knowledge, but as I said, they are not able to do this. For example a 16-year old student wants to understand biology stuff, but in lessons he cannot follow the teachers explications. So he ask his friends or he do it alone by watching some nice youtube videos or reading the stuff again.

To conclude, teachers are not able to relate well with students, because of different attitudes towards work. Students must learn alone and they do it well.
As a result teachers are not needed in future. Roboters will replace them. Nothing works forever.
