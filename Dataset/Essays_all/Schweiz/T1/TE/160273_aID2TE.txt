Everyone learns and can memorize the same school subjects in other ways. For one class there is only one teacher. So is it more important that the teacher can interact with all the students while teaching or that he knows everything about the subject?
In primary school the main work the teachers have to do is teach reading, writing and simple maths. Besides this they form the children by teaching them behaviour rules. I think that a primary school teacher does not have to possess a  university master, but  he has to know much about interacting with young children. 
The school subjects gain more and more importance while growing up and changing to high school. The subjects become more diffucult and complexe. It is neccessary that the teacher knows enough about what he teaches. In high school the students are young adults and often do note have enogh self confidence. So it is also important that the teacher guides them through this period of time by helping them to become adults. 
After the high school you decide in which subject you want to specialize. you go to the university. The teachers there have a big knowledge about the subject. This is necessary because the educate the new scentiests of tomorrow, so the have a bigimpact on the future. the univerity studentsare adults, so no one has to tell them what they should do.
In my oponion a good teacher has the right amount of knowledge of the subject and ability to interactthat is necessary for his grade. Lately I had a maths teacher who was a university professor, but he totally failed in teaching us. He wanted to apply the same way of teaching university students to us, high school students. So he explained too complexe. Besides this he did not have the ability to interact with us, because he normally teaches adults not young adults who sometimes need the supportof a teacher.
