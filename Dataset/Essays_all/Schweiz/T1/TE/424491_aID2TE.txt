It is quite a controversial topic. Both of the above mentioned qualities of a teacher are important. While some people might say it is more important that a teacher is lenient and understanding, others might find it more crucial in the education of a child that a teacher is all-knowing on the subject being taught. I do agree with the statement, because even if the teacher doesn't have excellent knowledge, they can still answer the majority of the questions being asked by students. Being able to relate to their students is a good quality in my opinion, it actually helps a student more than just going with a structured plan and not falling out of that line. If a teacher relates to the student, they know that you cannot excel at every single subject or even a specific grammar form for example. And then of course there are the quick learners and the slow learners, and I find it important to give both their own time and not move on too fast if some haven't caught up yet. The atmosphere is considerably more pleasant as well if everybody gets their own time to think and understand something, and a teacher can help a lot with that. Now on the other hand, some parents or people from different cultures could find it unnecessary having to relate to a student, they've maybe never known that in their lives and expect better results with a strict teacher who teaches the students what needs to be taught, and if the students have any question they should be able to answer it, as it is their job. But I don't find that a necessity, one can ask a teacher a question an if they do not know the answer, one can always research, or the teacher will make some inquiries and answer the question on the following day or class.
