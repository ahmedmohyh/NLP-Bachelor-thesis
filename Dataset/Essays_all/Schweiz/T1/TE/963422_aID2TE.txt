Teachers

Do I agree or disagree with the statment that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? My opinion is that I can't answer just with "Yes, I agree" or "No, I disagree". Because both is important. A teacher should have the ability to relate well with students but also excellent knowledge of the subject is important to handover the knowledge to the students. And with that ability to relate well the time with the teacher is much more fun for the students. If the teacher just stand in front of the class and talks about whathe know and the students don't, then there is no sense to lecture, a monologe won't bring the students any further. But if the teacher don't have enough knowledge to lecture in that way it makes sense and easy to understand that won't help the students. So I think both is important to have for a good time with for both, the teachers and the students.
and also the the age plays a role. In the young age, I think that the ability to relate well is more important than knowledge, because they students also needs to learn how to relate well with other people so they should be able to learn that from the teacher. But further in life you should be able to manage that and the knowledge gets much more important to keep going forwards. So there is no yes or no, there's just a perfect harmonie of both but it is very rare to see that in reallife
