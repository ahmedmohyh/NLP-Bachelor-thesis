If a teacher is able to relate and connect to his students it's easier for them to listen and be concentrated during his lessons. The students maybe even like the subject better if they like the teacher. But is it more important for a teacher to relate well with students than to teach them his knowledge?
I personally like the subject much better if the teacher is nice. But in some subjects where the teacher is nice, the lessons can get really boring. In my class it is true that the students pay more attention to the teacher if he or she connects with us and not just stands in front of the class and talks about a particular theme. I think in our age stundents really have to get involved in the lessons, otherwise they won't be listening carefully. And it's not even enough to be just a nice person and joke all day long because if stundents don't get challenged, they won't be interested in the subject being taught.
My geographics teacher for example is a really nice guy but his classes aren't interesting, in fact they are quiet boring. And on the opposite there is my biology teacher who is a strict person with a huge knowledge but he just can't relate with his students and you have to push yourself to stay concentrated during his lessons, even if they are really interesting.¨
So I think it's more
