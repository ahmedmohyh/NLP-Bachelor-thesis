When I went to primary school we had a realy nice english teacher. He liked to make jokes and to play games with us during lesson. In this age, my opinion about the teacher was very positive because he tried to make the lessons entertaining, funny and a bit easier. We all liked his lessons and we got on realy well with him. But the parents weren't the same opinion. My parents noticed that my english was worse than my brothers english. I always did the same mistakes and my spelling was realy bad. The teacher never realy liked to studie the english tenses with us and if he did, he couldn't explain it. So the tenses were a problem for me too.
When I came to highschool, I understood my parents wories. My classmates where much better than I was. When we talked about some english tense, I noticed that I've never realy heared something about that tense and my english teacher had to correct me realy often. That's why I didn't like to go to english classes. I always felt like there is no chance to get as good as the others. 

In my opinion the teacher should have an excellent knowledge of the subject he teaches. The teacher should explain the subject in a way that the students will understand it. If a teacher's ability is to relate well with the student, I think it's no problem as long as they still learn something. If they teacher won't teach them in a serious way, they will have a gap later and it will always be difficult to get as good as the others.
