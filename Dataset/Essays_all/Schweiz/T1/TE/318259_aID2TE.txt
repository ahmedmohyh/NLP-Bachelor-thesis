This question means a lot for the students then it is all about the teacher how they learn during class. It is an important facility to relate well with the students. When the teacher can't teach in an interesting way, the students won't listen to the teacher even if the teacher has an excellent knowledge. There is a wall between students and teacher. The teacher is talking about his subject and the students are sitting on their chairs and aren't listening and it won't change because the teacher don't care he just do what he have to do and thats talking about his subject. But if he relate well with his students it's easier for the students to learn and also they want to learn because the students know it is possilbe and not too difficult to understand. Of course the teacher shouldn't get into trouble when he don't exactly know the answer of a students question. But thats not as terrible as a teacher who can answer the question but the student still don't get it because of the way how the teacher explained him. People can say if the teacher teachs in a more difficult and serious way the students have to learn how it would be when the students are in a university or an higher level of school. So they write down the informations they get and learn in afterwards. But school is the place where you learn the basics and if you don't understand the basics it is impossible to go on and learn the new stuff. 
In my opinion it is more important when the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students than an excellent knowledge but not the ability to teach his knowledge the students.
