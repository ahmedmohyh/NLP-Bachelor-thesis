The job of a teacher is very important. Teachers are able to affect the working life of their students, positive or negative. Due to that, the question of how the students should be teached is very important and a thing that should be discussed. 
Without an excellent kowledge of the sebject being tought, a teacher can't teach his students well. If you have knowledge of the subject, your're able to answer difficult questions and give your students ploys to know how something is made or used. But the most important point is that you can explain the things, that the students are able to understand the subject and maybe also become an expert.
However, with a good knowledge but without tha ability to relate well with students, the students don't know what you're talking about and they will not understand the subject at all. If the students don't like you the most of them won't listen to your explanations and won't use your knowledge. 

In my opinion, the relation between student and teacher depends on both abilitys, the one to have an excellent knowledge and the relation between the students and the teacher. Without the relation frome the teacher to the students, the students are not going to know the subject at all. If the teacher relates well with the students but hastn't got an axcellent knowledge, the students will listent to the teacher but they'll not understand the subject as good as if you would have both abilitys. 
The teacher has to be both. That's how the students are going to write good marks and still know the subject after a while.
