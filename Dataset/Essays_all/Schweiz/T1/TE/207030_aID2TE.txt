First, we have to agree that teachers should possess both abilities. A teacher is inclined to to do a lot of things at once. It's important that there is a connection between the student and the teacher. The student should be able to trust the teacher and should not feel any disregard. In any situation, the teacher should offer aid and good advice, because a lot of students feel comfortable talking to the teacher, more than with any friend or their parent. So I am not saying, that the teacher should befriend the students, instead they should look out for them. But that is definitely not the sole purpose of the teacher. Teachers should prepare us for our future. They should be able to transmit their knowledge to us without confusing or worrying the student. It is an important ability, that the teachers actually understand themselves what they are teaching and know, if it's correct or incorrect. But these days it feels like they are forgetting how to be a ''good teacher''. There are tremendous teachers with excellent knowledge about the subject they are teaching, but they don't really know how to share this big knowledge with their students. Their explanations are weak or they do not even seem to be interested in being a good tutor. And it is just sad going to school, sitting their for a mere nine to ten hours without learning anything, even on days when there doesn't even seem to fit in more motivation in the face of their students. So in the end I don't think I can agree with that statement, because both are equally important in the scolar system nowadays.
