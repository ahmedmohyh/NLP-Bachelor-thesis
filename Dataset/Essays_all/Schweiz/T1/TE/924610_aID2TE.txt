 The job of the teacher is to teach a specific subject. So why would it be more important that the teacher could relate to the students hr or she is teaching?

In our present culture the importance of social and intellectuel confrontation is strong. If you consider that, then the statement given makes sense because we view it as important that the pupil or student gets support from his or her teacher, with school material but also by understanding the current social situation that the pupil might be in. By understanding the pupils cause of stress for example, the teacher might be able to lend support and make it less difficult for him or her to concentrate on the present subject that is being taught. Which in long term will be able to raise the grade of the pupils. In our quickly changing world and surrounding the students of today are the future. And we want them to be ready to further improove life for mankind. It  all starts with the the teacher having more understanding for the students and being able to relate to them that will mold the future for the better of the world.
On the other hand a teacher with unquestionable knowledge about a subject can show his or her students a new perspective of things that an ordinary theacher couldn't. In our rapidely changing society a new perspective could reveal the solution to problems like over population or global warming. These problems won't go away by just not thinking of them. We need a new generation with more open minds than previously. A generation that is capable of solving problems with extensive knoweledge of certain relevant subjects. This knowledge can easly be aquired be a teacher with exellent knowledge.

By relying on teachers to socially support and relate to pupils we might be making the next generation soft and poorly prepared for their future.
