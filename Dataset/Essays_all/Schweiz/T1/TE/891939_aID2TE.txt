On one hand it's very important, that the teacher has a knowledge about the subject, because school makes our future. Teachers need to teach us subjects in the best possible way, that means they need to have an excellent knowledge. After all we need to understand the subject as perfect as possible, so we can write good grades and successfully pass the year.
On the other hand we can't forget the importance of the relationship between students and teachers. It's relevant for the teaching clima in class. If the relationship is good, it will be much easier to teach for the teacher and much easier to understand for the students. Classes will be much calmer and much more interested in the subject. If the relationship is bad, and in the worst case students hate the teacher, because he can't relate to them, there will be a really bad clima in class. Students won't pay attention anymore. The consequence is that the teacher will have difficulties with the teaching and students won't learn much about the subject. Students will try anything to annoy the teacher and the teacher can't control the class anymore.
In my opinion, the good teaching is based on the clima in the class. I think the teacher should have the abbillity to relate with the students, because at this point students will be more interested in the subjects. That means they will also have the motivation to learn and make good grades. If the teacher has a lack of knowledge, in example if he can't answer a question of a student, he can always refresh his knowledge and answer the question in the next class. That way teacher and student will both learn something new. That's why I agree with the statement.
