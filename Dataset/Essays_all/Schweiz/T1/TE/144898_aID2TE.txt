I think both is important, but the knowledge of a teacher is more important than the ability to relate well with the students. When a teacher has no knowledge of the subject he's teaching, but he can relate well with the students, the students will learn wrong stuff or in the worst way nothing. A positiv point is that the Students will love the teacher, because he knows what the students want to do in a lesson so that they really want to go to school and they're very motivated i think. When your knowledge of the subject is very good but you can't relate with the students, they will be unmotivated and it's very exhausting to teach something to an unmotivated class. They would hate to come to your lessons because they know you're a strict teacher and when they're not learning anything, they think your exams are very hard so the're will be unmotivated more than even before. At the Beginning i said it's both important, because when you have the ability to relate well with the students and your knowldege of the subject is very well, you can perform very helpful lessons with motivated students. You can teach way faster when your students are motivated, because they learn faster and they understand the topics you're talking or teaching about very fast. So I disagree with the statement, not because it's 100 percently wrong, but i think it's both same important. In my Opinion I would love to go to a teachers lesson, who can act well with the the students because, as I already said, i would be very motivated to go to school, but if i learn anything, I have to ask me, why do I go to school? To have Fun in the Lessons? No, I'm going to school because i want to learn something for my future and i can learn more efficiently when the teacher is good at his subject he's teaching and also how he can relate with the students.
