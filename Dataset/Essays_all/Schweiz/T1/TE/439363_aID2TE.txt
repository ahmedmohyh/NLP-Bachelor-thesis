In my opinion it's important that the teacher relates well with the students. I think especelly in primary when the students have the age between seven and eleven years. Than the teacher is an important person for the students. In this age the teacher should be a mix between parents and a friend for the child. It should be a relationship. Beacause then a child is motivated and have fun in school. But later, I would say in the age of twelve the relationship between a teacher and a student should be more serious. The teacher doesn't have to be a very serious person who never laugh and can't joking with the students and the teacher should stay a very important person in the life of a teenager. But in the age of twelve it becomes more important for the students that the teacher understand his subject very well. Because at this age the students begin to ask difficult questions. And for this questions the teacher must have an excellent knowledge. Otherwise the student won't take the teacher serious and the students won't believe them. 
So at the end I think the teachers's ability to relate well with students is very important for little students in the age between seven and eleven. An at this age the knowledge of a teacher is less important. But students become older and at the age of twelve the teacher should has an excellent knowledge and the teacher's ability to relate well with students becomes a little bit less important.
