The teacher's knowledge of the subject he teaches is very important. If this knowledge isn't there we could just open some books and learn what's inside wich isn't that efficient but costs much less. If the teacher is able to relate well with students but does't have excellent knowledge of the subject he could open some books himself and re-study the subject. After that he is able to teach about the subject well with his ability to relate well with the students. But if the teacher has an excellent knowledge of the subject but is not able to teach the subject or relate with his student's he can't just open a book and after that he knows hoe to teach.

Imagine you sit in a french lesson and a teacher walks into the classroom says that he can't talk french and tells an interesting story about politics in german. After the lesson everyone in that room likes him and his way to tell stories but you haven't learnt a single french word. This french course isn't really useful is it? But on the other hand a teacher walks into your classroom stands by the blackboard talks 45 minutes in perfect french about french grammatics but the class doesn't understand a single word. Also isn't that useful.

All summed up i think the teacher needs a nice mixture of being able to relate with his students and the knowledge of what he is talking about.
