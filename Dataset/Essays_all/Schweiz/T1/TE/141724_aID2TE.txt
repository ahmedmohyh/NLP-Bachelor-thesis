In this essay, I will explain, if the ability to relate well with the students is more important than the excellent knownledge of the subject, or not. Although I go to schol almost every day, I never asked myself this question. For me it was always natural that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students and has an excellent knowledge of the subject.

First it is important that the teacher has a good idea of the subject he teachs, if he has no idea of his subject, it is completely sensless to go to schol. But to teach a certain subject at an "Gymnasium" a teacher must have studied his subject himself, so it`s guaranteed that he knows his subject well.
Although it is important that a teacher knows his subject, he can prepare himself for every lesson he gives. In case he isn`t complettly sure of a certain subject, he has time to study it before giving the lessons.
But more important is the ability to relate well with the students. If a teacher relates well with students, the`re are more likely to learn something, because the`re more interested and pay more attention to the subject.

So, in my opinion the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject. A teachers job is in first case, giving knowledge to a younger generation, if he can`t relate well with students, the students are less motivated and less interested. A student is more likely to like a subjrct, if the teacer can relate well with him, but if the teacher only give worksheets and barely interact with the students, they aren`t interested and in the worst case start to hate a subject.
