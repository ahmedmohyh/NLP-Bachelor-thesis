In our modern world teachers have to be more than just competent in their subject. They have to relate well with their students and having an excellent knoledge in their subject. But what is more important? For my opinion it is quite clear. The ability to relate well with the students in the most important skill a teacher has to have.

First of all, I think every teacher just want to make his or her life easy and relaxing. So the main point why teachers could have stress or problems with their kids is because they have a bad relation to their stundents. So the first thing how to solve that problem is to get a better atmosphere in the classroom.

For another point, It is totally clear that when you are a teacher your biggest goal should be to prepare your students well for their next way in life. So like every teacher know the students are happier to learn and make an effort in school when they like to listen to the person who should tell them all the important things. But this fact just works when the teacher and the students have a realtionsship with each other.

At least, I think every teacher knows how difficult it was when they had a teacher, which wasn't interested in making his students better. The lessons were boring and the only thing he did was to critisize all what the students has made. But when he knows how to create the lessons and how he should speak with the studens, I think he has much more fun by working.

To conclude, the whole process of teaching students beginns with a good relationsship between the students and the teacher. I think this ability should be the biggest subject a teacher should learn about during his education.
