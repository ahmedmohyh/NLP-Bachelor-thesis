It's questionable if a techer does't even know his own subject well, because if he doesn't know it how will he teach other people? that will either make you question his education or if he's even willing to teach students because if he really would want to make students understand his subject he would put more effort in learning his subject in order to teach his knowledge to his students, wouldn't he ? 
And how come a teacher who doesn't have excellent knowledge of his subject earn more than an average employee who knows his work more than himself and really lilves for it. That's not fair either right?

On the other hand the job teacher is being associated with psychological knowledge and inquires working with students all the time. It's only logical if you'd get along well with them. Also a teacher who has excellent knowledge of his subject but doesn't own any bit of psychological skill to cooperate and handle students won't make it too far, because after all we, the students, are his job.

As a student i can really approve that statement because my experience has shown that teachers who not just get along well with their students but really show their interest in teaching us their subjects and believing in us even if we don't, are over all being respectet and verry appreciated by us students.  because we notice if a teacher has that quallity and that really motivates us to actually study more and be more concentrated in his class because that's the least we can do in exchange. Because there comes a time when you can't bear disappointing that particular teacher who always just wanted to help us.
