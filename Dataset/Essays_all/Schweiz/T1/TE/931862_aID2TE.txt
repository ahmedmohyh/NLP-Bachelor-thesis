I think it is a mix of both for example you're teaching French but you don't speak nor understand French, you just care about the students, that isn't a good mix because you won't teach the students anything good. But if you can't relate with your students and you don't have a good teacher-student relationship, they probably won't be interested in the subject anymore, which means the won't listen and they won't be good at tests.
If you have a teacher that doesn't undermine you like most of the teachers do, students will be more interested and have fun in class. The atmosphere will be better and the teacher will be able to help individual problems better. The teacher will be able to see if his students understand what he says or if they don't.
But the teacher needs to know about his subject as well, he can't teach the students something he doesn't know.
And I think if the teacher cares too much about the students, he becomes more of a friend to them and loses his authority as a teacher.

For me personally both aspects are equally important. I want a teacher who understands me and helps me with my problems but for him to do this he needs to know about his subject.
