Is a teachers ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught? First of all it is important to say that teachers usually do have studied the subject that they are teaching, which should have provided them with a solid basic knowledge. That means, that a teacher who can relate well with his students but doesn't have an excellent knowledge of the subject, still should have a solid knowledge about it. Then again a teachers job is to pass knowledge along to younger people, who may use what he teaches to them for the rest of their life. This is a big responsibility. Considering that, most people will think that a teacher should know everything there is about the subject he teaches and expect him not to make any mistakes. On the other hand again, it has been proven that students with a good relationship to their teacher, are able to learn more and better during his lessons. They are more likely to do their homework, because their motivation is bigger than it would be with a teacher who doesn't relate with them at all. Another argument for a teacher who can relate well with his students is, that he is more likely to understand what a student is trying to say - even if that student can't find the right words at that moment. On the other hand, most students are surrounded by people who can relate with them all the time in their daily life and there is no need for a teacher to be just one more. It is not a teachers job to be nice as long as he can make his students learn something during his lessons. To sum it all up, it needs to be said that neither one is "more important". Both - the ability to relate with students as well as an excellent knowledge - are very important qualities and should both be given, if someone decides to become a teacher.
