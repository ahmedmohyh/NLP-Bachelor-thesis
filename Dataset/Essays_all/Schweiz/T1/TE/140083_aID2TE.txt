It is very important that students heve a good reraltionship with the teacher but also that he has a excellent knowledge. In this essay I have wrote why im thinking that a huge knowledge is less important than a good realtionship and that he can understand the students. 
It's very important that the teacher has a good relationship with the studentsbecause when the students like the teacher they learn a lot more because they are listening better. but actually it depends in which classe you are. When you just started wtih the school it is really importent that the kids like school and a good tacher is for that very important. One thing which is really important is that he understands the students. That he is able to help and explain it correctly. You can know everything but when you can't explain it correctly it is useful for the students. When you are older you have already decided if you like school or not and you know how to deal wit a problem. So then you are more interested in having a teacher with a huge knowledge. However it is also very important that you have a good realationship with the teacher. 
If the teacher has a good ability to relate to students but hasn't a huge knowledge you could make less progress in the subject because he has not the ability to teach you very good. But normaly he should be good enough to teach you the importent stuff. 
In my opinion I'm more interested in having a good teacher that can explain really good and with one that I'm having a good realtionship. It is useful when he has a big knowledge but can not explain something right. It is basicly also very important that he has ha excellent knowledge but it isn't necessair. It's enough if he is an expert in his subject.
