Relationship between the students and the teachers or an almost impeccable knowlege about his topic he is about to teach? It's certainly an interesting question about which the differnet secondar schools have discussed alot.
Being able to relate well with the students is of course important in order to have a good atmosphere, which not only helps the lesson, but it might also give thestudents more courage to ask about certain things they did not understand. If you don't relate well to your teacher, you may not want to ask about your problems, because you fear that you might embarras yourself and infront of the whole class. That way most of the students will not have a joyfull time in class and neither during the tests, given that they didn't solve their problems till then. 
On the other hand though, if you lack the knowledge of either knowing how to teach them your subject or not fully understaning your subject to the latter, it will heavily impact the students. How can one explain to others about a certain topic if he doesn't know it himself perfectly? He might, of course, explain the theory very well, so that most of the students will comprehend the topic, but if, and in my opinion you definitely should, switch to praxis, only the lower percentage of the class will be able to solver all the taks given. The other ones will come up with questions and if you are not prepared to answer them, then a healthy relationship with your students won't help you either.
Overall I would say a good mix of both would be the best but if I have to choose between one and the other, I would say an excellent knowledge counts a lot more, even if it won't be as funny or as enjoyable to go to these lessons I think the focus of the school should be rather on teaching than on friendship. Also maybe having a mix of lessons in which you have a teacher you can realte to well and lessons in which you get to know a little bit more in detail.
