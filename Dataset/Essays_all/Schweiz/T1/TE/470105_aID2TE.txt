This is quite a complex statement. I have often thought about this question. On the one hand it is true, but on the other hand it isn't.

Being able to relate well with the students as a teacher is essential. It allows you as a teacher to understand your students, adapt your teaching methods to them and pass theyr knowlege on to them. It often shows, that young teachers are more likely able to connect with the students because they often grew up with the same technology and norms that we have today. Elderly teachers tend to disconect from todays media and because of that the students and teachers can drift appart.

But, if you as a teacher don't have the knowlege, you can't pass it on to your students, even if you can relate with them. And as a teacher it is your job to pass the knowlege on to your students. Also if a teacher can't relate to the students, he still is able to pass it on to them. 
The students most likely won't be as interested in the subject if the teacher can't relate, but it is also in the students responsibility, to use the knowlege. 

I personally think that teachers should be able to relate, but I also think it is very important to have the knowlege you need. I think both being able to relate and having the knowlege leads to a successful education. But if the teachers don't relate at all, it could be possible that the students get discouraged and stop studying completely.
