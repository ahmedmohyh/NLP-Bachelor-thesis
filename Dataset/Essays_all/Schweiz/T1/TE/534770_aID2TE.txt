To say at the beginning, the ability of the teacher to relate to their students is important. If teachers and students are not on the same page, the teachers can't really understand the students problems or questions. The most important thing is that the teachers and students show each other respect. If they don't, neither the students nor the teachers want to teach or learn something. It also could go so far, that teachers and students don't want to work together anymore. If teachers are strictand don't relate to the students it can be an advantage or a disadvantage. For some students it's better if they have strict teachers, because than they will work harder. For others it's better when they can be independent and work how they want to. On the other side is the knowledge of the teacher about the subject they are teaching also important. What would we do if the teachers suddenly couldn't teach their subject? There wouldn't be any good or excellent schools and no learning. Children go to school to learn something. That's the foundation of today's life. I disagree with this statement, because even if you as a student can't relate to your teacher, you are in school to learn and not to be friends with your teacher. Of course it's nice to have a good relationship with your teacher and it will be more fun to go to school, but you can't be friends with all of your teachers. You will like some of them and others not that much. But just because you can't relate to someone that good, it doesn't mean you have to hate them. Because of that I think It's more important that teachers know their subject well, than to be friends with the students.
