"I don`t like this topic" Billy claims. "I don`t care what you like and what you don`t like Billy!" the teacher shouted. The situation of Billy is a situation which every student knows verry well. A teacher who doesn`t care about his students.

An excellent knowledge is important for anybody but especially for a teacher. For example, when you are sitting in your math class and have a important question to the angle of this quadrat. You ask the teacher about it and he couldn`t give you the answer because he only knows things strictly from the learning plan you aren`t able to learn more about this topic.On the other hand if a teacher can`t relate to your problems you haven`t enough motivation to pay attention in the class and maybe miss some important things for the next test.When your teacher is always mean to you maybe you become shy and don`t want to go to his class anymore. But if you talk to him like to a friend of yours, you lose the ability to respect him. Maybe you also lose the focus of the lesson and take it to easy. It is an advantage when your teacher knows a lot and is able to answer your questions beside the lessons. A disadvantage is when he knows too much. Yes this could happen. For example : Your teacher is also an ETH professor and a very bright man. In this situation it might be possible that he have way to high expectations of your skills and makes tests which are too hard for your level of knowledge.


In conclusion it isn`t easy to answer the question which aspect is more important. I personally think that both sides are important. As a teacher you should have an excellent knowledge but on the other hand you should be able to relate with your students.A balance between these two aspects would be perfect.But If you are ablento be a teacher only time will tell.
