A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

Is excellent knowlegde less apreciatable than the ability to relate well with students? I don't think so. Both are very important but is it possible to get away with only one of this conditions?

To have excellent knowlegde about a subject, it needs to be studied for a very long time. You have to be interested and ambitious. If you'll be teaching it, you will be with children and then it's also important to know how to get along with them. How students are in the lesson is really important and if you just talk the whole lesson and they just have to take some notes, and don't get questionned, is really boring and not even that good. For examples: in history class it's also very important that you don't tell false information. To apreciate the knowlegde you've got, you should prepare worksheets and other things. So when you talk, they still take notes but afterwards they can also do a worksheet to approve that they got it.

But what also very important is, is that when students have questions, you have to be able to explain it so that they can understand it. How you talk to students also has an effect on how they like the lessons. If you relate well with students you can work out their strength and weakness in the subject so they get better. I have the impression that when teachers can give good explanations, students are motivated for the lesson because they know, if they don't understand something, the teacher can explain it. For example: In Math, it really depends on the teacher because if he can't explain, students which don't understand are lost.

I think both things, knowlegde and the ability to relate well with students are important.
