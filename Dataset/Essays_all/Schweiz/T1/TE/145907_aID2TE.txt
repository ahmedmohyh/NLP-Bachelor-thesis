I think the statement is not really correct, but it`s not necessary wrong. I mean it`s kind of importend to relate good with your teacher, because you have to spent many hours a week with this particulary person. But a good teacher needs to relate well with his students and also have an excellent knowledge of his subjects that is being taught. I think it needs to be someting between being a nice teacher who relates well with his studens and have a great knowledge of the subjects as well.
For example if a teacher is very mean to his studends and doesen`t treats them well, but on the other side he has an extremlely good knowledge, the students won`t like to visit the classes and they won`t learn much from a mean teacher. In the opposite, when the teacher has a good relationship with his studens and makes fun with them  but he can`t teach them as well because he has less informaitions to give to the students or they even more worse they don`t exept him as an autority person they also won`t learn very much. So you see the perfect Teacher needs to be very kind and nice to his studens but he also needs to have the ability to give his exellent knowledge of the subject being taught to the students and making sure they leran as much as possible. 

If I could make my own perfect teacher he would need to be nice, make some fun from time to time and he needs to have a great knowledge, because i`m going to school because I wanna learn something and be able to learn as much as possible.To have a great job some day and be succsessful in what i`m doing and for that I need to get sure to have a great education.
