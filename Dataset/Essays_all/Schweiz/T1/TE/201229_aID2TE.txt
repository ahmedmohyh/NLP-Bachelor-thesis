Great knowledge of a subject does not nessecarily lead to being a great teacher. Being great when it comes to relating with students without having knowledge of the field also does not make a teacher excellent. The importance lies in the ability to combine both, but without relating to students, a teacher can not be good.

While I am sure that a rocket scientist knows a lot about physics, I do not think that he would do a better job at teaching me than my physics teacher. The reason for this is simple, my teacher had a long education on how to explain things properly and manages to relate greatly with students. He is able to see himself in our shoes, without his knowledge and find examples which we are able to understand without having to know everything about physics. 

In addition to the better explaining, being able to relate with students also gives a teacher a more human aspect and makes it easier to talk to him about problems, not only in school but maybe also regarding one's private life. Having teachers like this makes going to school more enjoyable and it is a great advantage for the class climate as well as the students' respect towards their teacher.

Surely a rocket scientist would know more about the subject, but at least on our level this is not needed. University knowledge does not have to be existent to teach a high school class which has trouble understanding the basics of friction. I assume that the teacher who is better in relating still has decent knowledge and in that case he is good enough for the job and arguably better than a person with more knowledge

To sum it all up, I think that a teacher's ability to relate with students is more important than pure knowledge of the subject, because it makes the class more enjoyable and easier to understand. Even if he has to google an answer every know and then, as long as he is able to explain well, he is very much the better fit for the job.
