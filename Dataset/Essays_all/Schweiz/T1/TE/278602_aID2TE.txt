In school we learn more than the subjekt itself. Teachers taught us how to treat them respectfully and correctly. There are many rules in a classroom, the students have to obey to. So it is possible that a student leave the room and has learned in this class more about rules than about the subject itself.
An example could be: Anna took during the lessen a look at her mobile phone and the teacher saw it. As a consequence she had to give her mobile phone to her teacher.
I`m sure she learned in this lessen more about the timetable we are allowd to use our mobile phones than the repetition of some grammmar rules at the blackboard. 

On the other hand knowlidge should be at the first place. Respect correctness should be part of the education. Things like the big bang or how an animal especially is build of we only learn at school.

So I just partly agree with this statement.Both parts are important but not both are part of the school education.
