Television has been a big thing over the last fifty years and with the TV there came the advirtising. It is very important for companys to promote their products so that the people actually want to buy them. The question is if this manipulating advertisment is harming for little children?

On one hand children aged 2 to five are of course very easily manipulated which can lead to annoying children beggin for money to buy those things. Its important that children not get affected by those ads so that they not get the will to have everything they see in this world which is already filled with greedyness.

On the other hand children need to learn as early as possible that in this world you have to learn how to resist and to know what is good for you and not fall into every marketing trap they show you. Its for sure that those ads also helps the children to get to know all those products.

All in all it probably hasn't the best impact for little children and I think you should keep them away from this marketing stategies as long as you can but I also grew up with television advertisment and it hasn't caused to much harm in my case. I believe the parents have the responsibility to explain their children that what they see isn't always how it isin real life when you actually buy those things.
