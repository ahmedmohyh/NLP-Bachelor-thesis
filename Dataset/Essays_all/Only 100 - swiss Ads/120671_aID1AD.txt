Using media especially television is a often discussed topic which is good because we're confronted with it's advertises and problems each single day. We're living in the year 2017, television has become a great method to entertain young, annoying children. But don't we have to accept the fact that it's a generation which we aren't able to stop?
There have always been things that haven't been accepted by the last generation but once it was invented for a while people got used to it and didn't see any problems with that because it  was part of their daily life. The same scenario can happen with television. Some parents nowdays are still not used to this huge consume of television but time will come when nobody will talk about television as a problem. 
A lot of parents use television because they are to lazy to look after their children and take care of them. They put a TV in front of their childrens bed so they can watch Hannah Montanna all day log. But what if children have questions nobody answers them or they a frightend of anything and none of the parents is there to explain things.
On the other hand, television is a great way of entertainment for parent that don't have a lot of time because they have to be working a lot to gain their lives.
The most important arugument to me is that it is proven that TV series such as Spongebob makes our children stupid because they start to believe that it's possible to make a fire in the sea.
Alltogether i think it's not the right way to watch a lot of TV while we're young but I don't agree with the statement that it should not be allowed because it's our generation.
