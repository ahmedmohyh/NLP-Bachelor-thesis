I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because young children can be manipulaited very well, because they to not notice that not all the television advertising is the true. Therefore when a person in the television something said a young children can not know is it true or false. But a older person can say that is true or false.

Young children also become more wishes, wich the parents have to buy for the childrens and when the child does not become his wish, it will be sad. 

Childrens do not know how much something is and something cost, with five years you start to learn to count at ten, so they can not know how much, for example fourty, is. Therefore they have no feeling for numbers, so when the person in television said that the price is very good, a young children would trust him. 

Children have also not a lot of money, so the can not buy a lot. When a five year old child buy something for example for ten francs, it would have no money left.

So I think that the advertising in television about children products, should be directed towards the parents and not at the young children, because the partents better know what is could for their child and they also have enough money to buy something. Therefore my opinion is that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
