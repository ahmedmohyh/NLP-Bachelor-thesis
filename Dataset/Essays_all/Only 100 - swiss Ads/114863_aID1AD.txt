Young children should live their lifes and should not have to build their own opinion about something. I think, they don't even care. They are so focused on their playing that they don't even see those advertisings. If a bank hangs up their poster to get people attached that they open up an account at their bank, and they specialise the advert for children, if the grew up they do it at this bank, it is too much. Children at this age don't care for this. There is no reason that they get confronted already with such econmic things wich they however don't understand.

But if it's for a good reason, for example WWF, why should they not get informations about their environment? It's good to know, in this case now, that there are animals whose species are in danger. Most of the children love animals. That's why it is easy to attract attention only with a poster. The children grow up and have memorys at these posters and go spend their money for organisations like that. 

In my opinion it depends on the field for what the advertising wants to get a look on it. If it's something with that children have nothing to do about, the advertisings shouldn't direct towards people who doesn't even have to know about such things yet. If it is easy to understand and it is for a good reason,then I think it is okay to influence the children a bit that they know about it later.
