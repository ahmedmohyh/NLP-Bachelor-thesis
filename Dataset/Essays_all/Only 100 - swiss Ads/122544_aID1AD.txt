I think television advertising is not a bad thing. But it's a problem for little children because they are easily convinced. If they see an advertisement they would love to have that thing and it's difficult for the parents if they are in a store with them and doen't want to buy toy's. But in my opinion that's a problem for any parent because of the big and coulourfull packages with advertisement on them. This even happens to parent's with children who doen't watch TV. So television is not the main reason for that sort of behavior. If the society thinks that's a problem al sort of advertising directly toward young children should be forbidden.
It's the parent's resonsibility that there children doen't watch to much television. A child between two and fife should not watch more than half an houre a day in my opinien. In that short amount of time they normaly doen't watch to much advertisement. From that point of view it's irrelevet for me personaly that the television advertisement is directed toward young children. 
I think advertisent on TV towards children is not good but it's the wrong way not to allow it.
