I think my children will never watch TV until they're over 6 years old. My parents threated me like this and I have the same opinion.
For those parents who will let their children watch TV before this age or they watch with them in a very young age, the eyes of the kids will develop in a bad
way. I used to watch TV when I was 12 I think but now I don't watch anymore because there aren't good programms anymore. 
Maybe there are some good series for kids which can help them to learn speaking or reading that would be great but i don't know if it's better when they learn this in school.  I also think that children in the age between 2 and 5 should either play with real toys like a car or puppets and  I think it's especially important to be outside in this age. 
For example I played a lot of soccer with my dad and my sister was dancing everytime, for me things like that are better to do in a childhood.
Maybe also to learn some threatments with other young children. Like me and my sister, when we were five years old, we were staying outside at our neighborhood playing with a lot of other young kids with the similar interests.
