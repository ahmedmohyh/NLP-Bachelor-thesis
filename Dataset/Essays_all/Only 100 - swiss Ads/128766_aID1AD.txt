I don't agree with this sentence because I think it can be helpful for the young children to learn some manners or to learn a language better. When the children listen to an English and German cartoon, they can learn two language at the same time and I think it's more easy to learn a language when you are young than when you grow up. It could be that some catoons are not good for children because of the bad influences for example people who are rude to the others or it could be that children start to act bad and don't understand the moral of a story. I think the parents have to look what their children watch on the television. I think when the young children watch cartoons that show the young the world and how to behave good or when they learn new words and new things it would be a good thing. But when they watch TV series for the old or cartoons with bad things then it's not good. And something that are very important is that the parents shouldn't leave the children for a long time watching TV series. A little bit is okay but when the children only watch TV and don't go out or don't do something else it is not good. Children should learn to play with other children or learning new things like baking with the mother or do something else.
