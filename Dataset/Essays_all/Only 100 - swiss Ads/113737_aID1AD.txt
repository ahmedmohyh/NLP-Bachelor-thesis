If you turn on your television, you usually see at least one channel on which there is advertisment running. There are so many different typs of advertisment, so that can be sort them by the things they present or by the possible future client who should buy the promoted thing. Nowadays, even young childeren (aged two to five) used to look thier films or soaps on television. The television channels exactly knews who is watching to them, so that they can show adverts for the watcher. In this case for young children. But isn't it manipulation? Should adverts towards young children should be prohibited?
Firstly, even enterprisies who produced stuff for children should have the right to show their products on TV. They also need a good reputation for selling thier things and how could you present your things better than in an advertisment? 
On the other hand, we must say, that children don't have a feeling for things they really need. So if they see something on TV they really want to have - they are unstoppable.
An other thing is that, children often look television with thier parents. So the parents could see what they could buy for the sons or girls next birthday or christmas.
However, at the end there are almost everytime the parents who decide what they would or should buy. The biggest problem would be the child who's crying until he or she has seen something better, maybe in the next advert.
Finally, it may be a problem especially for the parents. In my opinion, advertising directed towards young children shouldn't be prohibited. The children could learn, that they can't always buy the things you want and at the end, there are always clear thinking parents.
