In the following essay I`m going to talk about the question if television advertising directed toward children, aged two to five should be allowed or not. The most of us probably don`t like advertisment at all, especially when watching a good film and being interupted by an advertisement. But we all know that in this century it is the best way for companies to do their marketing and to finally sell their products. But do our little children really have to be confronted with advertising?Isn`t it enough if we are confronted with advertising every day?

First I think, for economical reasons it does make sense to allow television advertising direct toward young children  because they would like to have everything if they could. It`s easy to convince them of posessing this product is nessesary. 

On the other hand I think at their age they should have the right to watch television without any confusing advertisment. Furthermore it is important not to only care about money. And that is exactly what we do if even the youngest of our society have to watch television advertising.

In conclusion I could say that I`m absolutely against television advertising directed to young children because it isn`t good for their developpment and they should not be treated like teenagers or even like adults.
