Pro:
In the 21th century, a big amount of people have a television at home. It is more and more likely that young children watch television and that they are used to electronics. There are a lot of films and series for children and babies. So why not television advertising directed towards them?
It`s more fun and interesting for the children to watch advertisings about games and plays than about mobile phones or restaurants.
With advertisings it`s also easier for their children to make their birthday wishes or christmas wishes when they see new stuff on television.

Contra.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. The children are too young to watch televsion. They should go outside and play with their friends or someting like that. The society should not treat them like adults, they should have a different life. They are too young to be influenced by the media.

My opinion:
I think that it should be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children, but I also think that it isn`t necessary. These children are too young to realize and remember what they see on television. Children don`t make their opinions about the media. They enjoy watching films but afterwards, they are not interested in the advertising. If they want something new to play with, they see it in a store or at a friends house. So on my opinion it is not very useful to make advertising directed towards young children.
