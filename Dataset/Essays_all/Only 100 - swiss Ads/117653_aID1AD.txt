Probably the first thing we tink about is: "is it good or is it bad for the children?" - But before we think about the children I want to take a look on the other side... If it wouln't be allowed to do Televisom advertising the Television-Business would have a big Problem. They would not be able to keep on streaming. They get a big part of their money by getting those TV advertising on! 

An other point of view is if we don't allow Television adversiting to young children they'll never get used to it. I mean we all know those stupied or boring adversiting but we are used to it and we don't bother if we see. It's somthing we see all day and little children should be able to see it too.
We live in a time where everything is bad and getting worse but the truth is that the older generation had to go through the same things and they are still alive...so please don't make a drama out of everything!

On the other side we all know that television for little children is not that good. Some people even say that its very unhealthy. They have a problem with understanding everything and we all know that a lot television advertising is real shit. Some are filled with black humor others with sexuell jokes I don't know how children are supposed to understand anything. 

It also makes some people and even children addicted to it. They start buying things out of those Television advertising and can't stop doing that... 
Addiction to television is something really bad and if children suffer from it they need halp!

My opinion is that children should be allowed to watch television even with Tv advertising in it I mean they should get used to it... if we make everything kids-friendly they never get used to the real world!!!
