Television advertising

Today we are discussing about:"If Television advertising should not be allowed directed toward young children.Is it goodwhen young children watch advertisings in the young age? Or does that no matter?

I think that is an important point to discuss, because the advertisings can influence their mentions. That can be bad in the future because think thatthis things are real and they going to be naiv. That will have bad consequences, because of that the society will change in a bad direction.

On the other side, it helps to be more creative, because they see in the young age a lot of creative things in the advertise. But they can also be creative outside, for example painting pictures om the street or build things in the sand. I think it is better, when tehy are creative outside and not by watching televisoin.

I think, that in that age they are they should not have to much time in front of the TV. It is better when they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age. If they pass too much time in front of the TV, they lose to much time in their young age.
