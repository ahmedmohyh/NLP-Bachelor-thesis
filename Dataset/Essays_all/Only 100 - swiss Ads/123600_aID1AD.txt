Day for day humans are constantly influenced by advertisment. For a grown up person this seems just normal but how should we handle advertisment directed towards the youngest ones of our society?

To start off doesn't it seem unethical trying to use little children to make money? This may be true, but are little children after they've seen an advertisment really going to take their money and buy a cool new race car? No they are not at the end of the day at the end of the day the parents are the ones to decide and little children at this age usually have no money. So television advertisment directly towards little children from two to five could be more seen as an advertisment for their parents and what they could maybe buy for their children. 

On the other handy when a small kid sees something it really likes it isn't going to let go from it until his parents buy it for him. Now we would be at the point saying the advertisment influences the kid, who as his next step tries to "blackmail" his parents to buy him stuff to play with. Looking at this argument wouldn't that just be bad parenting by the father or mother if he or she agrees to every of his little kids wishes? Yes kids at that age constantly see something new exciting the really want and there may be crying if it doesn't get everything but that is all part of growing up.

In my opinion little kids from two to five may be influenced a lot by television advertisment but at the end it is still its parents who are going to take the decision wether to buy  something or not. So as long as television advertisments fit to the age of the child and include no sexual content etc. advertisment is totally okay.
