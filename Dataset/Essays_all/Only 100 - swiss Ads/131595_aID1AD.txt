With the time, more and more advertising has been showed in the television. Today, almost every family has a television at home. More and more parents let their kids watch television up to several hours a day. 

It is easy for the parents to let their kids watch television so that they have some time off. But the kids can get addicted to it. In this time when there is shown so much advertising, the advertisers know that there are also many kids watching television, so they try to make advertises towards them.
The kids belive what they saw in the television and they then want their parents to buy the product in the advertise. The people who make the advertises know that the kids will show this behaviour, so they use it to make money.

The products in the advertises directed toward young children are often toys which they will like because they claim that it would do something special. But kids in that age are not able to see a difference between things they need and things they do not need. The parents have to decide what is good for their children but the kids will not stop asking for this toy, so when the parents are not a bit strict in that they will waist a lot of money for unuseful things.

But it is also up to the parents if they let their children watch much television or if there is a limit for them. They could for example let their kids watch just a series and when it is finished and advertises are shown they can turn it off. However, it is not possible that the kids will not see any advertises.

I think it should not be allowed to make television advertising directed toward young children because they belive everything they see, so the producers of the advertises just use it to make more money. But it is also up to the parents if they let their young children see televison.
