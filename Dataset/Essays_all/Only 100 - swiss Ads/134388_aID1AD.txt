I disagree with the statement for the reasons I show you below. I want to show different aspects of the cause of advertising.

For young children it is much more difficult to unterscheiden the reality from fiction. They are more likely to misunderstand the advertise and get a false impression of the world. Children are influenced by everything they know espacially from what they see. So it is easier to get them wanting a product then it is to get adults.
For a child it is not good to see those advertisings on television and they get addictect to a world of consume.

On the other side we have to look from the advertisers view. As I said, kids are much easier to influence. Like this advertisers get easy new customers. The kids really want to have a cool product they saw on TV. Also parents will buy more often things for their child then for themselfs. Like this not only the child will become a new customer, the parents will too. So companies can make very efficient advertising for less money.
Ads for kids are not only important to many companies, many TV stations need it too. If there were no ads like these, stations like KIKA or other stations for kids would have to close. Most of their advertising direct to children and without them they get no more money.

In the end you can not forbide ads directed to young children. It would cause too much damage to the industry of television and the toys companies. I know this advertising is not really good for a child but if parents think like this too, they can easily forbide their children to watch stupid TV-shows all day long.
