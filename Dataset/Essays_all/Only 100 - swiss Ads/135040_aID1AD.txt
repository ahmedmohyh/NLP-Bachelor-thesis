Should television advertising be allowed toward young children?

The advertising has a big influence on everybody especially the young children who have little knowlege about the world and it's dangers. Companies could use this advertises to influence our society early on, and make a whole generation dependent on their products. But it might not be such a big problem because the young children don't have the money to even buy these products and if the parents reject to buy them the children will fastly forget about them. It is also questionable if the children, which are aged two to five, would even understand what this advertising is all about. If the companies manage to get their slogan inside the mind of the children in the way that they will recognize it when they see it in a shop, they will beg their parents to buy this specific product even if the quality and the price are worse than the other ones. In this stage I think it comes to parents wheter they give in or they take their time and explain the children why this product is worse. This is an importent part of childhood and if this is missing it will be a problem for the child, when it has to manage his own earnings. So I don't think that it has to be forbidden to show advertises to young children, it is about the parents to teach them enough about life so that they can deal the right way with their funds and the advertising that is nowdays found evrywhere.
