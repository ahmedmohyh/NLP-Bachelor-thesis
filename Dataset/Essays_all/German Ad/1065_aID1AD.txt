Television advertising directed toward young children can be allowed.
On the one hand there are many reasons to support an advertising free TV programm. First children in this age even do not understand, what advertising means and, how it can influence them in a bad way. That's why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period. Not every parent is able to do so, because they can have lots of work outside the living room.
In addition to that, there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not. Because it isn't not really neccessary for the once, who want to advertise their products. And why should someone pay so much money just to show such things like toys to children, who sometimes even can't talk in their age.
But one the other hand they can learn new things like new words or something about food just by seeing it, because they do not see such things in their movies. Advertising keeps contact to the reality while fictional movies don't. Also there is the chance, e.g. when there is TV advertising for a specific toy, that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them. And it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the TV off, because there will be a five minute break full of advertising, which is boring to see, anyway.
In my opinion it's not neccessary to show little children television advertising, but it doesn't have to be canceled. The parents have to decide, what is the best for their children. That's enough.
