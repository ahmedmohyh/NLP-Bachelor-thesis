Today I am gonna write about my opinion on if television advertising toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.
On the one hand side it is obvious that children can get influenced easier than a normal adult person. For example when a children sees some sweets it might just wants his parents to buy him them and if not it would may begin to cry because of that. 
Another problem could be that there are some advertisements that are not even made for childrens attention and could influence them in a bad way. 
On the other side there is to mention that you can not disallow an advertisement for just one explicic target group.
In my opinion advertising has to be allowed to be seen by everybody and it should rather not exists advertisements that interfluence the behaviour of children and all other target groups in a bad way than that advertisining should not be allowed toward a special target group. I also saw a lot of advertisements in my childhood, but it had not got such a big influence on me, so I think it is not that tragic as many people think.
