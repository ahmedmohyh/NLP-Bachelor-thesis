Today many children watch the television and so they often see advertisements. The majority of these advertisements is directed to older people for example to their parents but there are also advertisements directed to young children too. But should that be allowed? 
First of all there is always television advertising, nearly on every channel and for everyone at any time. So why shouldn't the be advertisements for young children too?
A problem could be that toddlers can be easier influenced by the advertisements than older people because they understand less and often take everything for real. This fact could be used in a bad way. 
But on the other hand children at a young age usually don't have the ability to purchase anything anyway, so it appears as if  the advertisements, children see in have no effects, but children could try to influence their parents to buy them things. 
Although this could be, parents have to control what their children watch and they are responsable for their children. 
Moreover children often don't understand the avertisements directed to older people and it would be nicer for them to have advertisements directed to them too. 
Furthermore it isn't that easy to say if an advertisement is really directed to children who are two to five years old and them forbid them. There are many grey zones and it would lead to more work and costs to control the television advertising. 
In my opinion advertisements aren't that dangerous to watch for children and I'm not concerned that children are badly influenced by what they see on the television. Moreover I think it is better if there is television advertising that they understand than only for older people. All in one I don't think that television advertising should not be allowed.
