In the following text I will give arguments to the quote in the task and give my opinion as a conclusion.

As a first point there is to say, that children in this age are mostly not able to think about the products, that are shown in the text. So the advertising can influence the children that much, that they want these product so much, that they ask their parents whether they can get it. If the parents don't buy it then, the children can be so angry, that they have a big argue with their parents. So in a worst case scenario, it can have negative influences on the relationship between the parents and the children in the future, if this happens very often. Another reason for forbidding the advertisements is, that children can't even buy the products theirselves and so the advertisements doesn't have any impact on the children. They aren't interested in advertisements and just want to watch television. So the only effect of advertising is, that the children are bored of watching television because they can't watch their favourite TV show without having some interruptions by advertisements. A reason against the quote is, that the children get a first knowledge about some products, that are shown in the advertisements. In some cases it can effect that the children get a better education or that they have a better knowledge. Another reason is, that the children can't buy the products theirselves. So the products, shown in the advertisements have to be bought by the parents, which can decide, whether they want to buy it or not. 

In my opinion, advertisements should be forbidden, because it is boring for children and can bring problems to the parents.
