Directed television advertising. We all know it and it is often making the target group think, that the advertised object is the best and they shuld buy it. But should children aged two to five really getting influenced by that?
Television advertising, which is pointing at young children is trying to inflict an young childrens mind to the point, at which they believe without questioning what they see. Trying to inflict a children which may not be able to difference between advertisements and the truth, is questionable. But who should decide wheater this is an advertisement, directed to children at the age from two to five, or to children aged between six and eight? A law to illegallice television advertisements to children aged from two to five could lead to missunderstandings of advertisings and conflicts between the law and advetisers.
But isn't the real question wheater children aged from two to five should watch television anyway?
Anyways. I think that directed television advertising at young children should be highly restricted, regardless of the fact that it is in the freedom of a television advertiser to make advertisements directed to children.
