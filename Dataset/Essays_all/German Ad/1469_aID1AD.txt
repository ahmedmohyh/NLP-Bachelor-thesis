Televison advertising towards young children?
First of all, do young children understand what the media says? Because they don't really have a good memory so they won't remember a certain advertisemend when they are at the toystore to buy a new toy. If they see the advertisemend they would properly tell their parents so they remember they'd like that toy. So later on they maybe get it that's how the world works you ask your parents if you can have something and then you get it. That's how the world works, isn't it? No that's not how the world works. Then he would never learn how to save money from a certain income to get something he worked for. Some would say it is a bit early a the age of 2 or 3 but i think it can't be early enough to learn how the world works.
But on the other hand I loved my childhood it was such an easy time you could eat, sleep, play with friend and do what you want, so that's what childhood is all about. The advertisemends only showed me at home what I could be looking for at the toystore. So even today I don't really see any problem because if you want something, as a kid, you ask your parents so they have to dicide whether you get it or not so it is a question of education not a question of advertising. Blaming the adventisemends would be too easy. 
Thats's why I over all think the television advertisng directed to young children isn't a problem and blaming it for the huge amount of toys someone has is just way to easy. It is a matter of education!
