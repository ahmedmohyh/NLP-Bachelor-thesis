Many people have a television and watch TV every day. Allthough many parents take care of the children because they don´t want them to see bad things from which they will get nihtmares. Because of this many people discuss about the question, if it should be allowed to show television advertising toward to young children between the age two to five.
One thing is that it is unnessacary to say that only children betwee´n two and five are not allowed to see this advertising because many young children don´t realize what they see in tv. It would be more logical to make this persicion for children between six and nine.
An aspect for that theme is that the children collect in the age many expierience and talk about that in the kindergarten and some advertising they couln´t understand and maybe they are confused about what they see.
An other aspect against this is that young children shouldn´t sit for the TV the whole  day because they can play outside or meet freins and so on. So it would be really unnessacary to make advertising for that agegroup.
because of all these themes I have the opinion that it should be not allowed to make advertising directed toward young children aged two to five.
