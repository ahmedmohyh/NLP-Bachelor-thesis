I agree with the statement above because of many reasons. You can influence young kids easily because in this age you are very naive. Now if kids see advertisments on television about toys and how cool they are they want to have this toy too. They will ask their parents and annoy them untill they buy this toy. You can say almost anything on telivision and small kids will believe it. But if you don't allow ads on television you also shouldn't allow ads on posters or in magazines because they have the same effect on kids. Big companies shouldn't advertise their newest product to influence children. Parents should think alone about what they can buy for their kids but the kids will see new ads for toys very often and want their parents to buy it. On the other hand parents could just be strict and not allow their kids to watch that much TV or just don't buy every toy a kid wants.
