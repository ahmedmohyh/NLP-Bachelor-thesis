Advertising at the TV is a very useful way to speak to the people, but can young people, children, stand against the advertising?

At first you have to say, that young children should not watch TV to much. If a child doesn't watch TV, the question of advertising you don't have to ask. 
In addition children can find a present for his next birthday or for next christmas. It would be eassier for the parents to chose the right present, because they know, what the child wants, for example a new car or a new barbie.
Futhermore the children learn to say no to the things the advertising wants to sold you. This knowledge is something they have to learn for their live, so why can they learn it aged two to five?
On the other side it give also many arguments, which are against the advertising at the telivision toward young children. 
The children have got many toys with they could play, but if they see the advertising they are not proud of their toys anymore. The toys on the TV are much better then their one, they think, so they want it. This argument followed to the main statement you have to say at this topic. Children want everything. It doesn't matter, if they have a car or a barbie, the toys on the TV shows better then their one, so they need a new. Children don't understand it, if they don't get it, because they have something at home, but the parents can't buy everything, which is shown fantastic on the TV and this doesn't understand a child.

So in my opinion advertising for children between two and five should not be allowed, because the prior arguments. If the children a little bit older, they can decide, which they really need and which not.
