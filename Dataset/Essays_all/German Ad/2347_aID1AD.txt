I agree with this Statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
Children in the age of two to five shouldn´t watch television with advertising directed to them.
If children see that, the think it´s true. 
Because they often think, that what adults and older persons say is the right.
If it is with toys, the children whats that. And they can be manpuled.
For example is KIKA, its a Kids Channel on TV, and there are only movies und no TV advertising directed toward young children. 
Kids gets influence through it.
But there are some kids channels with `werbung`. If there are toys, the kids say that they want it and so some parrents wants that they only look ´KIKA´ because they shuldn´t see the ´werbung´.
