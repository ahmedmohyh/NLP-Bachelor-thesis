Television advertising which is directed to young children (directed to children aged two to five) should not be allowed because the children are not able to understand this adverts because they are just too young to understand. Maybe if there is an advert for a new game for young children aged up to three or five the children thought that they just have to own this new game because it is new and brillant but if the parents buy this game it is used maybe once or twice because after playing it it can be boring because you know what happens and how it should be used. So just the parents of the young children have to decide if they will buy the things or if they will not. The Children are not able to  decide wether they would have this things which are directed to them in adverts maybe in TV or in magazines because the parents have to decide if the new things are good for their own children or if they could change the children in a bad way. If there is any new food in an advert which is pronounced as healthy and good for children only the parents could decide if their children gets it because it could be bad for their children because of an allergic reaction or something else. So my opinion for the question if television advertising which is directed to young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or should even not be allowed is that it could give some adverts for that aged children but i think that this should be not much because the parents should decide if they would buy it for their children or even if they would not buy it for them because it is not good or healthy for children. Maybe once or twice a day television advertising could be directed to young children between two and five years because children should not watch television all day because the childhood is just too short to watch television all day. Children should play outside and went playing with their friends because friends are a very important point in life so you have to use all time you have in life and make it brilliant.
