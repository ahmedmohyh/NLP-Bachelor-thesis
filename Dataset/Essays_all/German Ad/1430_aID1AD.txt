Nowadays, on nearly every TV programme there is advertisment and some of it is directed toward young children. However, some think that this should not be allowed.

One reason is that young children who are only two or five years old are not able to understand everything they see on the television. But when they see something they particualery like, they want to have it. Even some new technology that their parents wouldn't allow them to have because they think it's unnecessary. Furthermore, one could thinnk that these thinks are what other children of the same age have. So, when they see it on television advertising the don't want to be outsiders. This advertising spreads the idea that it is normal for children to have the things that are shown on television.
On the other hand, one might say that advertising doesn't hurt anyone. What's the problem if children see television advertising? They might want to have those things, but advertisment does not force them to buy the products they have shown. It is a good way to show what new products there are and what there are for. If parents don't want their children to see television advertising, they can just make sure that the children watch only programmes without any advertisment.

Personally, I don't have a problem with television advertising toward young children, but it's possible that I would see this differntly if I had young children on my own. Right now, it has no influence on me and it's nothing I have thought about before.
