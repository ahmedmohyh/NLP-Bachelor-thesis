i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all. they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television. in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet. my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat. its scary because when you say to your child stop watching television and go outside  they have no idea what to do. advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its also bad for adults. the advertiser are very tricky and they know exactly ho to catch the people to buy things from them. advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped. advertising should not be allowed for kids up to 18 because its very dangerous and many kids buying things that they dont knew they really buy.
Finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible.  Advertsing is too big in the society today. The only thing we can do is to take our kids away from the tv and take our time with them so they dont want watch tv anymore.
