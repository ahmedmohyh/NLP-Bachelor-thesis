In he following I am going to tell you if children in the age of two to five should not watch Television.
Children in this age should not watch Tv because it is not good for them. All of these children programms on nickelodeon are pretty uselles and that stuff they should learn by watching this Tv-show they can learn in a book for children. In this age the children should not waste their time by watching Tv-shows, they can go in a park with their parents or just meet with other friends. There are enough options they can do. But if the children at the age of for example three start to watch Tv there is higher chance that they will get dumb and if the parents will not say anything against that the children are watching so much Tv the children want to watch more and more. And later on they will not learn that much for school because they are too interested in watching Tv so they will worse grades. The parents should simply just put them in a childhood while they are at work and after they finished their work they can bring the children back at home. When they are back at home the parents should play with the children so it doesn´t need to get bored. If the parents are exhausted by their work they can ask the grandparents of the children or the parents from a good friend of the it if they can for example play together. It is important to show that what the parents are saying has to be done and the parents need to demonstrate this power. The first step should be to not allow Television advertising for young children. It is the best thing for the kids.
