If you've ever accidently switched to a TV channel for kids while watching television or have children yourself, who  watch these channels, you've probably encountered the high amount of long advertisment blocks in which products like expensive toys, sweets or lemonade are being presented. In today's world a lot of parents use modern media to entertain their kids, because of what it is important to question the effect of these advertisments on the younger generation, especially on the not yet developed children aged two to five.

These ads are a big part of the marketing campaign of the toy and sweet manufacturers; banning them for being inappropriate would seriously harm these companies as there wouldn't be many ways left they could reach the kids, there target group. The ways left would be the internet, which is also often used by young children, and the direct advertisment in the streets.

Yet, one should consider that the advertisments are always flashy and show the happy children who use the product. They never show what effects the lemonade has on their health, if it is unhealthy and full of sugar. Their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldn't allow their kids to buy the advertised product. It is wrong to sell an unhealthy product to innocent children.

Also important is that the children aren't really developed yet; they haven't had many experiences with money and aren't able to decide whether the board game they wan't so badly is overpriced. Often, the parent would give in on their child, which is not going to give up on that toy.

Considering all of these facts, it is somewhat clear, that the target group of children aged two to five isn't yet ready to be influenced and also manipulated by the toy companies. I
