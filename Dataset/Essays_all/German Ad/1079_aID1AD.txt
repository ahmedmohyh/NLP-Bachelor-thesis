In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

On the one hand you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age. They learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.
On the other hand you can say that some of those toys and products are extremly fictional. Because the children learn so much from them and sometimes want to be just like the character they are playing with they often try to do thing like them but are not able to do so because they are humans.
Another example why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with.

All in all I would say that television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed as long as the products or toys are helpful for children in this age so they can learn from them.
