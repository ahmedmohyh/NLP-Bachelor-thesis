The latest dolls, pets with fluffy fur and much more things children love are shown in advertisings on tv. But is it really smart and ethical correct to direct television towards young kids?
On the one hand one has to admit that it is the producers' right to present their articles. And television commercials are one of the most effective ways to do that. Therefore it would be such a disadvantage to forbid this kind of advertisement.
On the other hand the way of presenting is very manipulative and even makes grown-ups buy things they have seen on tv. And children are even faster attracted to things and easy to lure into something. Therefore, seen from the parents' point of view it can be nerve wrecking to always have to discuss the need of something their children saw on tv which also can lead to a bad realtion between children and parents. Furthermore kids should not be forced into this kind of thinking at such a young age. Advertisings they see could lead to the attitude of wanting more and never getting enough.
In conclusion it is not responsible to allow television advertising directed toward young children. But instead of forbidding those commercials completely you could just direct them towards the parents. By that the producers also do not have a disadvantage.
