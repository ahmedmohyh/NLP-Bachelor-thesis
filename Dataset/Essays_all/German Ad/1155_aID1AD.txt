Television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers. But also young children use it for education. There are many movies or series with an educating backround. But the question is if it is so good that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five years) and if it should not be allowed? In the following part i will explain and answer these questions.
Firstly children get influence by television. And specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these. Children aged two to five years start to speak and to create their own personality. 
So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children. For example If young children watch 'Teletubbies', who aren't speaking with words the hole episodes, they maybe also wouldn't speak. This discussion about the 'Teletubbies' are public in the world and politiciens think about stopping the production and to stop selling the DVDs.
But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life. They can learn about the right and the wrong. What is easier to understand when you watch it. How to handle with another children or how to prepare for school. So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life. 
So I'm disagree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children. These are a too important education source for them. There are more positiv follows for young children, who watch TV than negative ones.
