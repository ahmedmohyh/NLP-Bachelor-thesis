The  question is, if television adversting directet toward young children should not be allowed.
You can see this point on two different sights. in following i will try to cover these to pages.

If you were a buisnessman you want that children see the adversting, cause you want to get money. And that is easy with kids, because if they see the adversting in TV, the children ask their mother, if they get these toys for example. And the mother said nearly ever yes, to make the child happy. On the other side are the parents. They don't want that their kids see adversting in TV. It could be a reason that the fear of poorness is there. Or they want to safe their childs for the industrial society. Another point is, that I think it is really hard to turm off the screen every  time, there is adversting in television.
I understand the problem with kids and adversting in television, but i think it is really hard to realise.
Kids with five years are able to watch alone TV, and you cant safe the kids from the adversting. And where is the difference between television advertising and advertising in the city ?
All in all i think its not able.
