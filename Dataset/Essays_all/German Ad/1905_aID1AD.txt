In the following essay I will show arguments for and against allowing advertisment for young children (aged two to five).
Not allowing young children to watch advertisings in TV is really hard for the television concerns. This concern live from advertisments, so they need them. IF they could not show every ad they want, the could get bankcrot and this means in the long run that will kill the television. 
On the other hand it is not good for young children to be influend by advertisments in young age. In this age childrens try to learn from thinks around them. If this thing is advertisment, It could have a not so good effect on them.
My opinion is, that partens should watch out what they childrens look in TV.
