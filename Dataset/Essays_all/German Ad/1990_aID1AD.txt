Advertisments take a long time span in the modern TV. Often the adverts are personalised for the watchers. For example on the childen-television-program there are shown adverts for games and toys. But hasn't got this a bad influence espacially on the little children who are easy to manipulate?
Well, the economy wins a lot of money because of those little children that force their parents to buy them this specific toy or that specific game. This is good for the economy of the whole world and means success.
They also know what they want. A child that watches advertisments would always know what it could want as a birthday present.
And maybe an advetisment break would have the effect that those children would switch off the TV and they would go outside because they're bored of the long advert-breaks.
But this would only mean for a very few number of children. The children that continue watching would always want to buy the things that are shown to them. This could summon up fight in the familys and would influence the relationship between the parents and their children. 
In addition these children espacially from age two to five are in their learning process. The adverts would teach them that they are what they have. They would know that wealth is everything because you would be able to buy much more to improve your pride and dignity. This would mean that they wouldn't know that family and friends are much more important and that they wont ever be happy without them. With the believe that wealth is everything they would work all their lives and would always want more. They wouldn't ever be able to be happy and satisfied.
So in conclusion advertisment shouldn't be shown to young children that much. It would influence them a lot and escpacially when they are that young it could have huge effects on them and their whole lifes. They could be much more happier if they wouldn't watch that much television.
