Television advertising - Is it too bad for young children?


Television is a big part in our daily lives. The TV program und advertising have a very big influence on every human. Even young children, from age two to five, are influenced big time. 
Because of that there are opinions telling how bad the big influence on young children can be and that especially advertising for those "kids" should not be allowed. 
Of course this is an understandable opinion, but are children really influenced as huge as it is told?
Surely they do behave like it is told in television sometimes. But furthermore I do think the biggest influence on them is really given by their parents. They are the ones telling them how to behave and how to have a good life and not the television advertisements. 
The children should be able to differ between advertising and real life. Often there is a not existing world shown in television. This is the biggest problem of those how have the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed, I guess. 
But they do have to think about the way children watch television. "Kids" at the age of two to five do not understand everything shown in television. They just look at the little "movies" that advertisements deal with.
Because of that I think advertising for children should be allowed in a helping way. They should show the "real" world and not the fictive worlds because it is very difficult for the young children to differ. 
But all in all television advertising is a normal part of our ilves and even their lives and it should be allowed, even for younger children.
