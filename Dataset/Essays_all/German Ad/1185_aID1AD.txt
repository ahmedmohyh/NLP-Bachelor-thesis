Should television advertising be directed toward young children? This is a well discused question and in the following I try to answer it. 
On the one hand a pro argument of showing these advertisings in Tv is, that the products have mostly a pedagogic aspect, so the child learns new things. There are, for example, dolls, that talk with the child and it learns to speek. Another good thing about the advertising is, that also the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids. Something they might not found without watching the advertise. On the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence. The companies could sell them whatever they want, if they make the advertise colored and happy enough. At his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad, so if their hear for example: war is good, they maybe think this is true. Also children in young years should not watch television too much. Making advertising for them, shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it, maybe not as much children would watch television. Watching too much tv is at this age not really good for the evolution. Last but not least, the kids can become mad, when they see what the advertising offers and what they have in their room (e.g.toys). They wont be as happy as they were, because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents.
In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed. I think kids at this age should go outside and play and not watch Tv the wohle day, and if they do, they should not be influenced by consumorientated companies, which just want to earn money and do whatever they can do to get it.
