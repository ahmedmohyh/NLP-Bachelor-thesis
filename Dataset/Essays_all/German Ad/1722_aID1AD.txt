In my opinion televesion advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because I think it´s the job of the parents to decide how much television advertising is good for their children. 
So in my opinion it could be allowed for young children if they don´t look that much at the teleevision and  if they look films or other tv-shows which are acceptable for their age and not with violence or other things which aren´t good for children at this age.But if the parents don´t do that so that their children look a couple of hours at the televsion, then it should not be allowed for them to look that much. I think it´s difficult to say whether it should be allowed or not. I think the important thing is that it isn´t too much, but if the children look one or two times in the week at the television from two to five). So it isn´t possible to say it for all children.The most important fact is that the parents are so responsable that they can decide how much television is good for their children.
