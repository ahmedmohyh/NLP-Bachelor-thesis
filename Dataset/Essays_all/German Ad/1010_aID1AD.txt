The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.

Imagine, young children sitting infront of the television. If those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising. Although they are directed toward the children the ads can be usefull for the parents. 
But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this. Even adults are influenced by advertising because it sticks to your mind and you can't influence which advertising you watch. So young children who aren't grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings. Furthermore if the parents don't control their kids they watch many of those ads so that in the end the children have a complete wrong view of the reality because they think thst those ads show the reality. 

In my opinion, I would forbit those ads because I think that children should grow up without all the influence and should do other stuff then watching the tv. So, I as a mother, would not want that my kid watches all the ads which show my kid a different way of the reality.
