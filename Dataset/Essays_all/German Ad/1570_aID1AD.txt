Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed;because it is to early for these young kids to watch television. In age two to five the children cannot react on this television advertising and dont know about the story of this movies. in this age they should need they time in other way, for example play with friends or take time with the family. in age of two years you are to young to watch TV. When you are older you should need the television for the news or other things, but not young children.Young children want to see comedy movies an not interesting serie;which you inform about the most important topics in the world. Comedy Movies or zeichentrick series exsist, because of the entertaining. Those young children should not have enternaining in this way, they should read a book,which help the kids learning to read or preparing the kids in age of 5 for the school stuff. When  the young children start watching TV, they cant stop and want to see more and more, They are in other word addicted to the Television. In my view it is to early for this kids, to be addicted of something. In this time of life the kids dont understand the critics of televgision, so the partents of them should be very strict in topic Tv. Also it gives other ways to be entertaint, for example play not technological games or listen some CDs. In this way the eyes of the young children wont be bad. Some parents have not enough time for them children and put them in front of TVs  .When they sit in front of televisions, the parents shouldnt care about them. But I think in ages of two years the childrens need die Nähe of the parents. They need alot of care and Zuneigung. Early watching of Tvs lead the children in the future also
