Should television advertising directed to young children be banned?
On the one hand it is good for the industries to present their products in all ages. It will stay in the brain and also things for older people are known years later. If this is banned they does not sell much as possible to pay the workers.
But young children can not control their brain as much as possible to know what is good and what is needed. So they are easy to quote as a buyer.
But they can not buy it because they are too young. So they asks their parents to bring it. The problem is that parents have  an other seeing to this because they see the real function wich is not much as good as the one from the advertisement. So they stay strong and does not buy it. Or they have not the money to make their child happy. So the children gets angry and "hates" their parents for the next time. This happends only because of the advertisement. Many advertisements can inspirate and the parents can build their one game with the children. Others can buy it if they want. So everybody can do what he wants. But many games are too complex to create by their own. Or the advertisement shows an animated film that doe not complain with the real one. So it looks like a very nice game but it is not. 
To put it in a nutshell television advertisements for children are often not good for the familys but all kinds of children adversising can not be banned because of the industries wich does not can stay without their advertisement. So the parents have to handle it with the right words and ore make their children happy with a present.
