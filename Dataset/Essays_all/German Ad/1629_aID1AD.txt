I am of the opinion that such advertising should not be allowed:

Firstly, it targets young humans who are not able to critically engage the content of the advert. In addition to that, an adult may be able to tell whether or not he or she is manipulated as adults are capable of self-reflection, while such abilities are absent in young children.

While some may argue that children would not be easily manipulated as they can tell fantasy and reality apart, this argument neglects the hyperrealistic nature of many adverts today, making it hard for the child to tell apart advert and reality. This could lead to developmental impairment as the development of critical thinking may be slowed down by such a delusion.
Another argument that could be brought forth is that such a prohibition would harm the market by shutting off a portion of the customer base. This argument, however, fails to mention the negligible purchasing power of young children. Instead of targeting the children to get them to nag on their parents, the adverts should be targeted towards parents. These parents are the ones buying the advertised good either way, which would probably not lead to a noticable decrease in the sales of the products.

This could even lead to more sales, as parents could be directly advertised to, convincing them directly of the advantages of the product.
Such a ban could also harbor benefit for the children: A large number of young children are obese, probably tied to fast-food adverts targeted towards them. A ban on these could significantly improve the health of children.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement because of the potential harmful effects of such adverts on both childrens bodies and minds.
