Today the television is not that popular like in the past. Especially the youth views much more Youtube videos or videos on social media plattforms in comparerision to the television. But one big problem for all this media plattforms is advertising. Sometimes it feels like there is more advertising than the movie itself. The question of the essay is if television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should not be allowed.
First of all how should it be controlled which channel the kids are looking? The only possible way without beeing really expensive is a channel especially for kids aged two tow five. The young kids should not watch television at all. They should play with other things because in this young age it is important to learn basic things. Although the advertise is made for everyone. Only the advertise for people over 18 is late in the evening. 
I would say advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should not be allowed because they should learn the first steps about life. There should be a channel for kids with kids programm only and without advertise.
As a conclusion i can agree with the statement.
