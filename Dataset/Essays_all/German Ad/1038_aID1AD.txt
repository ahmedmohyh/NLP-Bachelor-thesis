Advertisment has an big influence on our society. It can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on. So should young children at the age of two to five have contact with advertisment for their age already?

First advertisment directed toward young children would be very effective, because it would reach not only the children but the parents as well. Parents are often not able to resist the wishes of their children. That is why the profit of companies selling for example toys would rise.
Futhermore advertisment is needed to inform the public about new products. It is important to inform the customers, buying toys, clothes and everything else for young children, about new products and innovations, too.

On the other hand young children at the age of two to five can not make their own buying decisions and they are not able to handle money. Becauso of that it may be more effective to publish advertisment directed to middle-aged people, because they as parents decide instead of their children.
Even though young children have contact with advertisment every day, advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior. They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement. That is why they can be manipulated very easily. Advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later.

Summarising all points I can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad
