In this essay I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". Often the television advertising for children are for toys or games. 

In my opinion the statement is right because young children especially children between two and five years are too young to understand what the television advertising would like to say. Also young children can not differ between right or wrong. An other argument for the statement is that kids are very easy to influence they get easier excited for example for toys than adults and because of this point it is not okay that television advertising for children is alowed because the children exploited from the big concerns.
 But there are not also arguments for the statement. An argument against is that children could learn what they like. Also advertising for kids are very important for the economy because kids are easier to influence and because of this point parents often buy the toys wich are shown in the television advertising and the concerns earn much money because of the advertising. You can see the last argument has arguments for and against the statement it is just a question from which side (childrens side or economys side) you look.

But all in all you can say that the statement is right. An other point is that I think that children between two and five should not look television because they are too young for that and also too young for television advertising.
