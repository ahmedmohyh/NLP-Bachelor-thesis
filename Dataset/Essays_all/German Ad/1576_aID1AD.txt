The statement Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is in my oppinion very controversial. In the following essay I will discuss the topic and its controversy.

People of all ages are influenced by advertising every single day in out lifes. And its not just television in witch we are contacted with advertisement. It has become a part of our lifes, if we want it or not we just simply cannot escape its influece. 
Therefore I believe it is unnecessary or even impossible to protect our children anf younger people in generell from advertising and its effect on the individual.
I believe it is in the hand of the parents to reduce the advertisings influence on the young generations by not allowing them to watch certain types of channels or going on specific websites that promote advertising directed towards children. 
In our socirty it is in my oppinion not possible to compete with the advertising industry.
But of course we are capable to protect our children from advertisement in our private lifes. 

As a conclusion I would say that it is necessary to raise awareness to the negative effects of advertisement, especially to young paople but I do not think it is possible to stop advertisement directed to children in generell.
