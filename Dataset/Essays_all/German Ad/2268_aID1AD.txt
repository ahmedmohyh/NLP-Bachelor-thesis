I agree with the statement Television advertisement directed toward young childreen (aged two to five) should not be allowed. 

Because when they get contact with the television they can easily get addicted to it. And they do not know the danger of this media. It can give them false illusions for the real world or they do not get out of the world of the TV show. They can not see the wall between reality and the TV.
If they get addicted to Television the just want to watch it and do not something else, like playing with friends and create their own universe with them. They get the universe from the TV and do not create theit own. They also want to get rid of their friends because they want to wantch the TV show. And they get quit their hobbies, if they have hobbies like sports in this age. And their creativity will not be upgraded. 
Also the TV sends dangerous beams into its surronding, which makes it dangerous for the childreen. It is not necessary that they get in touch with this media in this age, they have time enough to explore it in their future years. 
I did not have a TV in my childhood. And we have it also not now. And I live. I had a great childhood, because I was a lot outside, playing in the sand or with my toys  in my room or with my parents. I also think that my brother (8 years old) is addicted to the media because he always want to watch his time on the tablet or play it. He started this when he was five or younger. That is why I am against the statement.

To put it in a nutshell I agree with the staement and would go a step further, that the media should only be allowed for childreen at the age of eight or higher.
