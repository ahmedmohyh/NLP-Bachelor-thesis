Today, it is normal that televison advertises directly toward young children. In this statement, I want to discuss the question, whether it should be allowed or not.

First, it can be useful for parents to occupy their children while they are doing other things and can't give attention to them. The kids also find television very interesting so it is not hard to keep them watching. However, it can't be right for parents to sit their children right in front of the televion just to occupy them. The young children can totally be affected by it and can getting used to it. Furthermore, it is damaging and can't be healthy for a young brain which is not completely developed. If they are always watching TV they will be used to it and don't know anything else. In addition to that, the children are obviously too young to understand everything which they see. If they are getting older they finally understand most of it but the main problem is that they believe everything they see, so if there is a person in the television who comes very often, he or she could become a role model for the kids. They will take it very personal and the advertising will stay in their mind. They also want everything if there is anything that seems nice to play with.

To sum up, I personally think that advertising in the television toward young children should not be allowed because there are just so many arguments against it. Finally, it is about the health of our children and we can't let it affected by the modern technology.
