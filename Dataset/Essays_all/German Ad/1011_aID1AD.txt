Did young children bacame addicted to modern technic? 
In the following text I am going to discuss the question and will give my own opinion about the statement wether television should be allowed to young children or not. 

I recognised that many children grow up  different since I bacame older. Some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside "I build my one garden" or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination. They replace their imagionation with a cartoon instead of thinking on their own. I think it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child. Many young children are not really recognised by their parents. Instead of spending their time with them they make their life easier and put them infront of a television. I know that it is not easy to raise up a child, but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not. You know that a child will bring up problems and(verantwortung) ......  It is not bad for the child if it watchs TV a few times a week, but it has to be controlled the time and easpacially what kind of TV they are watching. Otherwise I think it is not possible to forbid television for children under five years, because each parents have their own way to let their kid grow. It does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his/ her following development. 

Finally I can say that I do not agree with the given statement, bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting. You have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way. Prepare your children right for the modern world.
