The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed." can be seen from two points of view. 

The first one is the one of the parents or maybe just grown-ups in general. If their child sees something on tv an they want to own it, it's their parents fault when they won't buy them evry single thing they see. Furthermore a child might take the advertisment the wrong way. In many advertisments for young children there are other young children playing with the product and it seems like they're having fun so the child who's watching the adverisment thinks, it can only be happy when it'll be able to have what they have. 

On the other hand those advertisments are mostly shown on channels which are also for young people and what if they would just show advertisments for grown-ups on those channels? Would it be okay to show a five-year-old an advertisment for sex toys or something similar to that? Because advertisments will be there to finance the channels.
Nowadays it's normal for everyone to see advertisments everywhere and whether or not they are directed at us, they often catch our attention. So even if certain advertisments which are directed towards young children aren't allowed, they would still see advertising. The question is, what's worse for them? 

In my opinion advertisments for young children are fine. It's not the best thing they'll get to see on tv but it's also not the worst. Channels for children should have children friendly content and if that includes advertisments that's okay. Therefore I don't agree with the statement "Television advertising toward young children should not be allowed."
