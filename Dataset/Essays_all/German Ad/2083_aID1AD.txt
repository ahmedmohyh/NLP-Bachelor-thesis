No, I actually wholeheartedly disagree with the statement, since I see no harm in products which are aimed at smaller children, being advertised. 
For example: a family which is already making plans on what to buy for their newborn or young child will atleast get a new idea or direction for what product would be best suited for their child, rather it be food, clothes or toys. Especially young mothers may not be entirely informed and secure on whether or not they are making the right the decisions when it comes to saciating her childs needs.
So on the note of advertising a product, although it may not convince the viewer to buy the specific product in question, I can atleast appreciate that the advertisement gave the viewer another reminder of thinking about the products they might be buying for their children.
But of course it would always be advised to get information from other media/sources since advertisements on television are often times just short, pretty and very staged for the sake of mass appeal for a massive audience (although it is still specifically targeted towards parents, the advertisements are played for everyone)

The others sources I mentioned should be a doctor with knowledge on nutrition and health for small children and also the internet in order to see whether or not cosumers of the product, which the parents are interested in are satisfied with or not.
The internet is also useful for when you need advice from other parents who have already made mistakes or who know exactly how to answer your question and can give insightful advice on how to deal with the problem you might be having or the difficult decision you have to make.

And that would already be all of which I have to comment on or have come up with.
