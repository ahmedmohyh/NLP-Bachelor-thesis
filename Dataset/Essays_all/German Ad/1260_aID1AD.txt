Today more and more kids watch TV, play video games oder do other things on technical devices in their freetime. Also the young children in the age of two to five oftne watch TV. But is this really good for the children or should they better watch TV if they are older? 
In my opinion young children shoukd not watch so much or best no TV, because they should use their freetime otherwise. They should go outside, meet friends, talk and play with them. Today there are a few programms which only shows series for young children.  Often the series in TV are not important to learn something. They tell stories which aren´t important for the kids and their future, maybe they are bad for them. Most of the kids usually don´t understand this storie, because they are too young for understanding them.There are already a lot of television series for young children, in which they can learn the number oder the ABC. But I think it would be better if they will learn it in an other way, maybe in kindergarten or from their parents or later in school. If the children often watch TV, they want to watch more and more TV and one time they just wanted to watch TV the whole day. They don´t have any friends, they just sitting in their rooms the wohole day, do´t get any fresh air an activity. Today technics are more and more important and the most kids are sitten inside in front of them but this is not good for their body and for their sociality. 
So in my view the young children in the age of two to five should not watch TV they should do other (importanter) things in their life, which they only can do in the young life to play outside with friends and something like this. Also in older age, people actually should not watch so much TV, they sould go work, do sports, meet friends ore travel and don´t show it wrong to the kids.
