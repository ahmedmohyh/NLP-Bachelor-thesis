At first it is to say, that young children are in the phase to copy all things other people do. So if a person do anything for example ironic, the child will do that too. It is not good because they are learning bad behaviours in  front of other people without knowing what they did wrong. If a joung child is watching TV in the night, there is mostly advertising with pornographic content wich is not good for children because they can get scared for long time. At the other hand children ignore the advertising in the TV because they only want to see the series or movies. When there is advertising, they change the channel to another series or movie. When they have to see advertising they wuld getting bored and they do another activity while the TV is running.
In my opinion it is okay that young children are watching advertisement in the television because they mostly do not even know what is going on and only want to skip the advertisement, so they do not even see advertisement. They do not watching TV in the night because they are sleeping and hopefully the parents are protecting them to watch TV at night. And the things they are learning from advertisements is mostly goodlanguage what can be no formal language but they learn the all day-language of all people wich is not wrong to learn. The series, the children watch in TV should not be allowed because they are getting more stupid per every year.
