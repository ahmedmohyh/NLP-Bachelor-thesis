In some talkshows they worked with the question whether <<television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed>>. 
So the question is still very interesting for many parents who have growing childrens.

At first it is a kind of freedom to make advertisings for products in the style that every customer think about it. There weren´t a rule for a long time period against it and it damaged nobody so why should it be changed now? Young childs also wants to be informed when there are new toys on the market. Further on the parents pay attention on their childrens in these ages and they do not have their own money to waste it for well done advertisings. But on the other hand the young childs are getting influenced by the advertisings and because the childrens are only interested in toys and sweets. So they propably spend their small count of money to buy some cheap but useless toys. As a result to stop the growing influence on childrens by advertisings in a digital world it might be useful to not allow these kinds of advertisings. 

I personally think, that advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because it is a kind of force to disallow these advertisings. Further on I don´t know childrens who are seriously influenced by these advertisings and who were damaged by them.
