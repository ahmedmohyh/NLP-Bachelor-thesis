The statement that children at the age of two to five should not be allowed to watch television is not easy to answer. There are many reasons why it should be allowed and many reasons why it should be forbidden.
Kids at the age of two to five are in a part of life in that humans learn a lot and create their own identity.
Televisionn could be a big help on the way to learn how speaking works. Today there are many TV-shows like Dora which are helping kids to handle different situations of life. But it is also important to learn skills like eating alone, go to toilet alone and so on. It is way better to learn together with your parents instead of learning alone in front of the television. Everybody knows how hard kids can be and if the parents need some freetime to calm down or something like that, the television would be a good point to give the kid something to do.
I think it would be a good compromise to allow kids watching TV but just a special type of TV-shows which are made for kids and maybe with a time limit of 1 hour per day.
I think it would be the best if the parents are finding a good balance between learning together with the kid and let the kid learn alone.
