Television advertising for so young children has good and bad sites. It's important which progam they are watching and what kind of influense this program has. It is good when the children watch a television program that prepares them for the school but television that has an bad influense and dont prepare them is not good for them when they watch it too often. The parents have to controle the children and what they are watching, so that they can protect them towards those programms with such a bad influense.
But it doesn't make sense when the parents of these young children don't care about what their children are watching and the producers of these television programs often don't care too cause they only want money.
It's not important wether the children sometimes watch those series or movies which don't teach them so much like series who prepare them for the elementary school or the complete school in one thing but they shouldn't watch the too often.
I don't agree with this statement because i think that children should have fun and a good childhood.

Some children are very good in elementary school because they watched such teaching children-series like "Dora" or "Toggolino" and some are not so good and too hyperactive because they always watched series like "Spongebob Schwammkopf" and only that so that only this fictional cartoon character was they
