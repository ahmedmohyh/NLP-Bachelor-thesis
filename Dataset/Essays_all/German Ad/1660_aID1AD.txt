It is widely discussed whether young children (aged two to five) should be confronted with television advertisement.
A reason why many people are against it is that children are often more easily influenced by their surroundings than children of an older age, teenager or adults as they are still at a strong developping stage.
As advertisment is often used to manipulate people into wanting certain products or buying them,there is indeed a difference in trying to manipulate adults that know the sake of advertisment and are able to reflect about the things they are facing rather than children that take most things in without questioning them.

Yet, there are people older than the age of five years old that are still as easy to manipulate.
Eventhough you are not as strongly developping at the ages of 6 and everything above compared to a toddler, you are still developping.

But shall it therfor be forbidden directing advertisment towards young children?

As we are living at the age of social media nowadays. Children are often introduced to the 'world of social media' at an early stage. So it is not possible for them to not be confronted with adverstisment at all, whether it is directed towards them or not. What toddlers see is what they most likely want to have. Whether it is the phone their mother is holding in her hand or whatever they see on television.

Also earlier or later they will be the ones who the advertisment is directed at, at some point (as they will reach they will eventually reach the ages of 6 and older )
Whenever that may be they should be prepared and used to the advertisment. When advertisment is part of your daily life, you start to not listen to it that exactly anymore. It becomes something like a backgound noise rather than something that takes up all of your attention, as it is new to you, made extra interesting just to influence you.

That is why I am for advertisment dirceted toward young children.
