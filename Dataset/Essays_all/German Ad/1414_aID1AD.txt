Television advertising that is directed towards young children has positive and negative consequences. On the one hand it should be allowed for everyone to advertise any of their products, and not limit it to a specific age.
This is also difficult to manage or judge about, as it is never absolutely clear to whom the advertisement is addressed. Assuming a decision in court would become necessary, judges must decide to which age the commercial appeals the most, which the advertising company might refuse to accept.
However, children at this kind of age (two to five years) are very easy to manipulate. They believe nearly anything that is being told to them in the advertisements and are not able to polarize between wrong and true facts that are being presented to them in the advertisements. Additionally, when watching TV, children are mostly alone. Therefore, they do not have a parent that tells them what is false about that commercial.
Although here it is necessary to respect that most advertisements are not as aggressive, direct or manipulative as others. These most definitely must be an exception. For children at this age, an commercial is called manipulative way earlier than for adults. When children are being manipulated on this way, it might result in a different judgement in their later life as well.
Concluding all of these arguments, I think that it is not a solution to generalize about this topic. A relatively free economy, as we have it in Germany, needs to maintain that right and be able to advertise to everyone. But as soon as it comes to manipulating young children, companies must be restricted in that freedom. Overly manipulative commercials should be banned at especially this age, because it destroys the free judgement of the children watching.
