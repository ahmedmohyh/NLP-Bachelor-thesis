As a child i enjoyed to watch television. The moving pictures realy atteched me, even if it was just a annoying advertisment. But should those advertisments be allowed for children?

First of all you have to say that it won't matter if the advertisment is directed to a child or to an adult. If a child want something it saw in the television, it has to ask his parents who will say yes or no. Anyway some people will say that this advertisments are used like propaganda, but should'nt they ask themself if the advertisments for adults are the same? In addition those advertisments for children are most of the time very colourful and creative. So if a child watch this advertisment and tell his friends what he saw they will make a fun game out of this, so you can say that this advertisments will teach the cild creativity. Neithertheless you have to say that the desire for the thing the child wants could cause trouble in the family. The child could get angry and uncontrolled and destroy things in the room. This is a common problem for parents who can't control their children anyway. 

As a result i would say that it should'nt be not allowed for advertisments to use the young generation as the person they want to get to buy the things they produced. After all the parents will choose and not he child so advertisment industrie should ask themself if they "talk" to the right people.
