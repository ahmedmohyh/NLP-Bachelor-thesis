In my opinion there should not be Television advertisments for young children, because the parents have to deal with all the stress to find these things ot they will have to tell theire children why they will not buy these things.On the other hand  if these things are good for the childs evolution, like learning how to talk or how to write or read it would be a great idea. But often these advertisments show onlky things you do not really need,like a talking puppet or something like this. Another argugemnt against is that many people does not like these advertisments because they have to wait untill they can watch theire movie or theire series. Also many people does not even watch these advertisment and they will zap to another channel. An argument for it is that it is easier to find things that youre child likes.So you know what you could by for his/her birthday. If you loook at it in the point of the guy who buys the time to show his advertisment you can see that he has to make these advertisments so the world knows that he is here and that he has some "really cool things" like fast cars or an airplane for example,because he would not get as much costumers as if he would have his advertisments and commercials only in magazines or in the radio for example. My last argument agains advertisments in television is ,that there will not be so much people who comes to his shop just because he has some advertisments in television. He has to have a nice shop, good prices and maybe a page on the internet. so as I told you earlier I am straight against television advertisment.
