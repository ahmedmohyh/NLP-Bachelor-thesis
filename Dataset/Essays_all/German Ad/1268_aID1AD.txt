My statement is about televisoin toward young children. Is ist bad or not?
My oppinion is that it must be allowed because children would watch TV either. Maybe they go secretly in the livingroom to watch TV and if this is the cause the children would watch television for adults and no program for them. The television advertising is directed toward the children with learning programms so the can learn something for a better understanding and knowledge.

An argument against it could be that the children watch TV oftener as usally and didn't go out to play for example with a ball and friends. The parents could use it to get the childrens quiet if they will be noisy and loud. It's a pitty that the television is mostly about witches and stuff that didn't exists.

Many people say that television make people stupid. But if the television is direccted toward children and have an lerning effect I would disagree to the statement that youg children should not be allowed to watch TV. It must ju be so long.
