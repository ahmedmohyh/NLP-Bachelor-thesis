The following task is to state whether I agree or disagree on the quote "Television adv ertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. First of all, it is important to know which gengre of all the things shown on the tv are shown to the kids watching tv. In some reason it is important to contrast also young people with television and its dangers. They have to get the chance to grow up with all possibilities of getting a bigger knowledge than others once. But you also have to state the fact, that children with the age of 5 or even younger cannot desicide what is good and bad or even desicide anything. So parents have to take care of them and only those can descide what their children are allowed to watch on TV or not allowed. They already got the knowledge of advantadges and dangers in contrast to their kids. They have to handle the problem if their kids watch some really awkward stuff on TV and cannot sleep at night or kids who are influenced by TV in another way. But they can also desicide what the kids are allowed to watch and it could be very helpfull for some of the kids if they learn something new, helpfull and also informative on TV to get a great knowledge. So all in all, you can say that there are lots of dangers in case of watching TV like dangers are our all problem in the whole world, but nevertheless parents have to take care of their children until they are 18 years old and live their own life. So parents should also handle the kids consumption of watching television. Maybe parents should get some help by specific people who know more about the consumption, dangers and its reasons. To sum it up and state my own opinion, I totally agree with the given quote on the top which says that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
