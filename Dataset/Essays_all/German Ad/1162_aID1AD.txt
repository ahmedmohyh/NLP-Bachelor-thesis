First of all, I would say that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is directed toward young children in the ages from two to five.
Televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they don´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child. 
But on the other hand, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the TV, such as toys or electronic devises to play with. If they always want more toys, the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true, which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before. They also wouldn´t know the value of these things.
My opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped. Furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch TV. Watching TV in these ages can also be discussed, whether it´s good for them.
