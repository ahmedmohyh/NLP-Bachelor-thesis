Today I write about the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". One the one hand there is the fact that television advertising could change the mind of a child. But one the other hand there is the fact that they couldnt buy anything alone even if they want to.

Everybody knows that advertising is a piece of our live. Everywhere we go somebody wants to advert for something. And we all know that there are good reasons for it because it is very easy to change peoples opinion about something. And to change the mind of a young child and make them to want something very badly is just more easy than to do it with adults. So I dont think that advertising directed to young children is fair because they are easy to manipulate.
I think it is okay to advertising toward adults because they know about advertising and the fact that it is very manipulative. But I think that advertising toward children, especially young children, is kind of unfair. Otherwise there is the fact that young children cant buy expensive things by themselves. Theire parents do it for them and they arent manipulated by the advert that is directed to young children. So they have choice to dont buy. 

In the end I think that televison advertising directed toward young chidren isnt a good or fair thing beause of the manipulation fact but there are the parents who have the choice so there a more badly things than it.
