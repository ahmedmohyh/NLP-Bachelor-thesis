Everthing what a little children sees, he or she wants to have. The question is: Is it right to show thus little children an advertising?

I agree with the statement above, it should not be allowed to show a television advertising directed toward young children because children can not buy the toys themselves because they does not earn money. They are dependent to their parents who earn the money. In contrast to that the children also need their toys and they should decide themselves which toy they want to have. On one hand colours and sounds are everthing what children want to hear and see and these things lead the children to their decision. Following everthing with colours and a nice sound many children want to have. They do not think about the question if the toy is useful. Thus the toy they want to have is usually useless. But on the other hand the children have the right to have an own opinion. For example they should decide if sounds and colours are what they want to have and if they only want to have colours and nice sounds they should get the toys which they see in the television also if they are useless. Finally you have to mention that children do not bear responsibility. They are not old enough aged two to five. They can not render an own decision. They are not responsible enough to buy their own things. For that part of their life they have their parents who have to decide it. And althoug if they want to have an own opinion they can go with their parents together into a shop and buy their toys there.

To come to a conclusion I still follow my first statement that it should not be allowed to show a television advertising directed toward young children but only to their parents.
