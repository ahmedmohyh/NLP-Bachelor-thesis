Today really every children has the chance to watch TV. It's not important how old they are or some thing like this. When there parents watch TV the children watch it too. Now is the question, should television advertising not be allowed directed toward young children?
Young children aged two to five are in a phase of learning. They learn new thing all the time but it's better if they learned things by a book or from their parents. They could watch eight hours TV but i doesn't think, that the parents will watch children TV for eight hours. So, the young children must watch the TV for older person and this isn't good for children most of the time. In this series or movies are things, which aren't for their young age.
For childrens is it better, if they play outside or play with a friend. It's more important for children to play with a pet, but to watch tv isn't the best thing. In the age of them it's important to be in action and to find friendships. they must be social and not alone. But TV has also good things for children. In children series like Benjamin Blümchen they could learn something over friendships, pets and other things. 

It's absolutly ok, if young children watch TV, but they must have a limited time and specifical channels, which is only for young children. also they parents must bring the children to make sports or meet with friends.
