The statement 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed' opens a very complicated topic. In one hand, there is a big responsibility for older people to protect younger children against television programs which could have a bad influence to younger people. But in the other hand, there are also interesting television programs for young children which could be helpful to learn a bit better or something like this.

In generall I would say that the most television programs are not so good for younger people, so we need to protect our younger people, so they cannot see them. But in my opinion, there are also some programs could be very helpful for them, so we shouldn't be allowed to hide those programs to younger people.

Another interesting argument to agree with the statement is that younger people shouldn't waste to much time in watching television. I agree, because there are also many activities like readings books or doing something outside for example which are even better than wasting the whole day on television.

But I'm not quite sure whether we are allowed to hide something to younger people, because these people could find another way to do this things when they want.
