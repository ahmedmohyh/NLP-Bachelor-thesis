Should television advertising not be allowed for children in the age of two to five?
A main point against this restriction is that young children could learn to ignore and get immun to those ads because they're watching them since their early years and know how to don't get influenced by it. On the other side though, the influence could be so strong that those children don't think for their own anymore because they don't have to think. They get leaded by those advertisements; which shampoo you should buy to fix your hair or that you really need to buy this pretty barbie doll. Those advertisements also try to use tricks to let the products look cheap but actually they're not and if you watch those ads as a young kid they could lose the awareness to see those tricks. 
If young children watch TV ads it could change their 'view at the world'. At some time replaceable things could be more important than the actual important things.

I think TV ads should be forbidden for children in the age of two to five because you just don't know what effect it's going to have later. Adults who can't think by themselves will probably bring major problems to the world.
