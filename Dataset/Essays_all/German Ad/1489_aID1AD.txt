In the modern era of technology a massive influence is lead towards children, starting from a young age. Through television, mobile phones and social media a new way of entertainig is presented. Should advertisement directly chosen for children of young age (two to five) be allowed? In the following essay I will present the arguments pro and contra the statement and lastly coome to a personal opinion.

First of the television is a great way of advertisement and information. When children get personal advertisements they know exactly which toys they want to buy as an example. The children can see the toys or other stuff. It is a better way than magazines because you have more than just one picture.



There is also a contra side to that theme. Children get easily influenced by certain things like advertiment. The product is maybe shown in a really good way, but when that product is bought it is not that fun to play with or only the positive things of the product are presented. A children of that age could be to naive to consider that, because it has not enough life experience.
On top of that children should not start to watch television at that age. Children at that age just started to live and when they are getting there own advertisements they clearly watch to much television. As already said earlier because they are so young firstly they need to gather experience in life and learn certain things.
Maybe they even get addicted to television and can do nothing else than watching tv when they are older.


After thinking about both sides I come to the conclusion that children should not watch television at that age because the arguments against it had more impact on my opinion.
