In the last decades the fast developing of technik and its masive relevance in the modern worldand influence on the personal life of every individual has lead to veryous kontrovers questions of the use and monopole of techniks and especcely when it comes to the relationship and influence of media towards children there are always many critical voices but also people who defend the nem developing. One of these controverse aspects can be clearly seen in the television advertising toward young children.
On the one perspective it is clear and profed by studies that children from an age from two to five are very easy to influence, so that this practice can imensly lead to a change in there personal developement in a way the producers intend it through the shown stuff and also keep this in mind while producing. In generall and again proofed by science Television is not good for very young kids and should just used limited from an age of eight because based on the braindevelopement kids younger than four can not even understand what they see in television and untill six or seven(forgot the exact number) they have problems to see the difference betwheen it and reality. The medical effects a use of television in to young age or too big amount can reach from anything like headache, unability of concentration, underdevelopement, sleepingproblems, realitydisconection two overweight, agresivity and in extreme cases even paranoja or psychical illnis.
On the over hand it is clear that in our technological based world every child also in a young age should learn how to deal with any kind of media and while televison seams to be a less dangouress media in difference to the internet where through a personal interacting of the user much more can happen this should be the media to introduce kids with it first. In conection to this generall aspect it is also importened to teach children a critical view on the media and the knowledge that it tries to influence them, so if this happens by the parents kids can learn how to deaL WITH IT WHILE YOU CAN NOT KEEP THEM AWAY FROM IT  
Finally i see my personal view completly in this last aspect but would like to add that this from my perspective should start in the age of primary school and not from an age of two untill five, when kids have better thinks
