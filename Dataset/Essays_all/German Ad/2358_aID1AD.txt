The topic of advertisements for young children aged two to five is very controversal. 

Some people might find advertising directed to young children completly fine and don't see a problem in that. The children get to see e.g. toys which they might like, so they can wish for them. This is very helpful for the parents because this way they know what to get their children and won't buy things they wouldn't like.

But that's not the only opinion on this topic. Others might argue, children of that age don't know what it means to spend money on certain things yet. Even though they got something they wished for because they saw it in an advertisement, they might want something completly different the next day, after seeing something else on television. They don't understand why their parents won't buy it for them so it will make them very unhappy. This way the children don't learn to appreciate the presents given to them. 

For me personally a reason to be against advertisements for children is that children will eventually be confronted with so many advertisements when they grow up anyways, it's important to avoid them for as long as possible. That's  why I think, television advertsing directed to such young children shouldn't be allowed.
