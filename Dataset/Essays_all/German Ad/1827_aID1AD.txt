One qustion is really often asked. Shoud TV advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed? In the following text I show my opinion about this topic and present my arguments.

First of all, many people may say, TV advertising toward young children could be a negative aspect on the child´s development, also it might be boring for parents or other adults. Another point is, if the breaks between the episodes are to long, the children would likely lose the interest in seeing this channal.

This arguments clearly show the negative aspects, but in the following part I show the other side´s arguments.

Firstly, TV adverting could be helpfull for the children learning to speak. The children could also speek about their birthday or Christmas wishes and this would be very great action for parents, who don´t know, what they should give their children. Secondly, the TV advertiving toward young children might help in the education to modern, western mass consumers, it would help the children to assimilate themselves into the mass consumption community really early. Thirdly, the children would be selected by their gender und could get differnet advertising, the gender mainstreaming would be sificantly helped, the children would be helped in their development. Finally, it is the parent´s decision, if there children are allowed to watch TV and advertising, no child is forced to see TV advertising.

In conclusion you see, although there are aspects speeking against TV advertising toward young children, the most arguments are for the advertising and this is exactly my opinion about this topic.
