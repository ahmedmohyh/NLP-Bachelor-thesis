In the following part I want to write an Essay belongs the toppic "Television advertising directed toward young children should allowed or not be allowed".
In my oppinion this topic is a very difficult topic, because some children in this age can handel this elctric influence but many of them in the same age can´t do  that. 
In that way i think that television toward young children should be not allowed, because the kids can´t choose between fals and right TV topics. They believe in that what they see in the Television. But if parents are next to the kids and they choose the serie or the catoon or what they watch together they can reflect if the show what is in the TV is good for the kids or not.
When the kids watch allone some parts in the TV, I think that isn´t good for them to be influenced from many different and coulorfull advertising breaks.
All in all I agree with the Statement, because young children from two to five shouldn´t be as much as older persons be confrontated with big names of products and with their firm strategie to sell more products and to make more money with the small kids and their wishes.

I hope that these answer is to some parts correct, because I dont really understand the topic of this task.
