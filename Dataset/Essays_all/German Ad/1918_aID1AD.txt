In the course of this study, I was asked about my opinion on the statement that advertisements on television tailored towards children between the ages of two and five should not be allowed. I will form an opinion at the end of this essay after carefully evaluating the arguments and counter arguments.
On the one hand, companies with a demographic between the ages of two and five should be allowed to advertise to those children since those are the people they want to sell their products to. Telivision is the perfect medium for this because of channels specifically made for that age group and the ability to produce especially exciting advertisements utilizing both audio and video.
On the other hand, children that age are very easy to manipulate making this practise morally questionable since the children can not see through obvious marketing ploys at that age.
Also, the children are not the ones spending money - It is the parents. And since, as I said, the children will fall for advertisements much easier, the companies are basically just exploiting an easy way to get peoples money; Instead of marketing to the harder to convince parents directly they market to them through a proxy - their children.
To conclude, I have to say that I agree with the statement that TV advertisements directed to children should be disallowed. The children simply can not make informed descisions on potential purchases yet and can be tricked to easily. Of course in the end it is still the parents descision but once the child wants something the parent will likely try to appease it by making the purchase, especially if the child is that young.
