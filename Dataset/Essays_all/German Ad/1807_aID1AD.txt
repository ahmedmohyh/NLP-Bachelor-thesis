In the following text I will write about to agree or disagree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."

First of all there are many advertises for young children, not only in television. For example in the city, in the radio and you can see advertising for children on the internet. That is nothing new. There are so many children in the world and it is a big group companys want to make money with. 
Watching television is for many children something really important and they do it often very much. So why should companys must not use this way of advertising anymore, esspacialy in the end the parents decide to buy the product or even not. 

But on the other hand, there are sometimes advertises wich are not that good for children in this age because of different aspects.

I do not agree with this statment, because of the aspects in the text aboth.
