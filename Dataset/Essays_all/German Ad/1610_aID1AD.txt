Most of the time television channels have to decide which kind of products they would like to advertise. Certain factors are looked upon to choose which advertisement fits best to the content of the channel. Problems seem to occure though, because people are not sure wether television advertisement for children should be allowed or not. Obviously children should not have access to advertisement for cigarettes, alcohol or any other kind of drug which could potentially be damaging. But if a child is able to watch channels that present such products, it probably shouldn't be allowed to watch those channels either. Depending on the age group television channels show advertisement that fits best and also advertisement where the companies can be sure that the viewers will buy their products. So when a child watches a channel meant for kids it will probably see advertisement for dolls or cars or other new games that are available on the market, which isn't a problem at all. On the other hand though some people think it even is controversial that young children have the chance to watch tv. Out of fear, parents don't allow their child to watch tv, thinking that their child could easily switch the channel and see something they aren't meant to see for exemple advertisement for the latest horror movie. In conclusion advertisement can be damaging for a child, but with the newest security systems on tv it should be possible to let a child enjoy children's channels and seeing avertisement that is directed towards their eyes.
