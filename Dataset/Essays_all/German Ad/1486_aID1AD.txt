In this Essay the positive and neative agruments on the question if television should be advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed are going to be presented.
The first argument that agrees with the statement is that chidren should learn from their parents and not from the television, because the stories that are told could be disturbing or teach bad habits to the children. Secondly the children should not be depandent of televion in such an young age, because sooner or later it will happen anyway! And the third argument  is that children will want to see more and more from his/her superhero and will want to wach television all  day long, wich will have consequences on their health, because they do not go outside enough.
Now the arguments against the statement will be listed.
The first argument, why children should have their television shows and so on, is that they can have something they are passionated about. But of course they can have other things they like. Secondly they slowly get used to modern technology and are not overwelmed by it later on. And thirdly, they have other influences than their parents, books or kindergarden.
All in all I think that chidren should be able to watch television even in a young age. But in the end the parents can decide what they watch and if they even are alowed to watch. That way the possibility is there.
