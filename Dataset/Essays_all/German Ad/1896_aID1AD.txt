An argument aigainst advertising would be that children just have no idea about what they really need and what they just want to have at this young age. They see happy kids playing with the newest barbie in the advertising for example and want their parents to buy it. They just get influenced by advertising too easy. It could also be that the parents of children have not got enough money to buy their children what they want. So when children see something in the advertising that they want to have the parents would have to explain them why they are unable to buy it to make them happy. Espacially if all the others playing around with it in the kindergarden. A child would be unable to understand such things in such a young age.
But in the other hand the parents could also give attention that their children do not watch the advertising in the TV or even do not let them watch TV anyway to be sure there is no problem with that.
Also the parents can see what they might buy their children and can decide what is good and bad for them.
So in my opinion advertising for young children is not really a big problem, because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that.
