In the following text, I will argumentate for and against the statement if television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed. At the end, I will also show my own opinion for this statement.

On one side, children aged two to five normally don't watch television. The are some senders like 'Super RTL' or 'KIKA' in german free TV, which is especially for children, but you can normally see films and series for children aged six or seven. In cause of that there isn't a high rate of danger for children watching TV.
But on the other side, a danger is, that younger children will watch more and more often TV, when they see in the televison advertising for example a trailer for films and series in the following days. They wish is also to watch these films and will sit more often in front of the TV.  
But if television advertising for young children is not allowed, children could be also protected against agressive advertising, for example advertising which is especially made for boys like fights, crimes and more. 
In addition to that, you can see wissensreiche advertising and information children can learn from it. They can also be prepared with its new knowledge for school and the normal life. 

In my opinion , television advertising should be allowed also directly for younger children. I think that the advertising you can find especially in german TV is very altersgerecht and not agressive. You can let your child watching TV without having any bad thoughts. There are also advertising about school life, so that also children of younger age could be prepared for primary school.
