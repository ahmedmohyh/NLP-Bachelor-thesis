It is a difficult question whether television advertising directed towards young children affects them in a positive way or not.
On one hand it is very profitable for big brands to direct it towards them as children are easily affected by bright colours and more likely to believe what they are shown.
Many children probably learn about most of the offered products simply by watching television.
Quite often, though, through those advertisements children learn completely wrong stereotypes, for example for their gender or their age group, their body images or materialism.
Images transported through televisions like exaggerated nudity, sexuality in a wrong way and today´s beauty standards already affect them in bad ways that result in eating and personality disorders.
