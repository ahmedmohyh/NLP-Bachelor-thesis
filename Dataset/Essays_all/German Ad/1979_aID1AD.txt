Television advertising is often critizised especially if it comes to children and their media consume. That's why many people think it shouldn't be allowed, but is it really necessary to permit television advertising directed  toward young children?
          For the factories it is much easier to let children think they need for example this new roboter, even if they already have one, than to let adults think they need something new because adults know what television advertising want to reach and they have a better feeling about money.
          Additionally children should also have a chance to know what's new on the market so they can make wishes for example for their birthday or for christmas.

On the other hand it is a problem that young children are so easy to manipulate. The factories use it to make more money and let them think the toys they already have aren't good enough.
           The children want everything that seems cool to them and if they can't have it because it's for example too expensive, they are disappointed. So the factories take this risk only to sell more toys.
            Another consequence is that the children can't be happy with the toys they already have because they saw all the new things on tv and want to have them and only want to play with them. That makes the children unhappy and they can't appreciate their toys. The factories send a wrong message to them.

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed because there are so many reasons against it. The most important thing for me is that the factories only want to sell more things and don't think about the children and how it affects their happiness.
