Advertises are often shown in the TV. They adress all ages even really young children. And that might be a problem as many criticers say. 
Young children are easily influencable by television advertising. So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour. 
On the other hand we could say that it is part of the parent´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the TV, to give them the right values. 
Another point might be that children aged two to five are not interested in advertises and even if they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents. So the parents can control their children nevertheless. 
And every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the TV is good and that they can not get anything what they want. This is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier when it starts as early as possible. 
So I would say that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the TV activity of their children.
