In the following essay I am going to discuss the question if television advertisment for young children should be allowed or not. 
In many families even very young children are placed in front of the tv so that they do not molest their parents. Of course they see their favourite new toys in the advertisment so they go to their parents and nearly force them to buy new toys. This sometimes ends in a difficult situation for the adults: Should I buy every new toy from the advertisment to make my child happy? What to do with tv advertisment for kids? 
Firstly, there are multiple arguments against tv advertisment for kids. For example, one could say that tv advertisment is bad for the childs development. If you buy new toys for your kid every time they see something in the tv, they will end up with the attitude of getting everything they want right away. So tv adverts should not be allowed to save the childrens education and behaviour. 
On the other hand, tv advertisment for kids can also be very useful and absolutly great for their development. If you control the tv-consum of a child and explain them why they cannot have every toy they want, Children can learn that one cannot have everything by watching tv! So they can accept a "no" when asking for a new toy from the advertisment. 
In my opinion it all comes down to the question how children are raised by their parents. If they have a good education and understand how advertisments can manipulate ones mind I think advertisment directed towards kids is absolutley fine.
