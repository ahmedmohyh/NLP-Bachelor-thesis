In the following text I will give a statement to the debatte about telivision advertising for children, but first let us watch at the positive and negative aspects about this theme.
At first you can say that everybody needs to have the same rights. So why not for children? When there is advertisement in the television just for adults, many children will lose their connection to toys. Grown up they will not have any memories about toys or things they can connect with their childhood.
Childrens have also a right to be informed about the outcoming of a new product. Many childrens love a speficial firm, which products a rare type of toy and there is no way for childrens to actualise their mindset. 
On the other hand childrens can be easier influenced and manipulated. Many firms build on the simple-stricted mind of children. They used to put only the good facts about the products and hide the negative that for example that many worker in China have to work for this product for low money.
And why should they not? Everybody puts his positive qualifications in the front and his negative in the background. This is a normal human behavior, but the differance is that childrens are not able to notice these things and adutls are. The adults are also a very important factor of firms in television advertising. Adults will be forced to buy toys, they actually do not want to buy, but do it anyway just to make the child happy. 
In the end you can say that television advertising should be allowed. All rights for everybody and if the parents have the feeling their childrens get manipulated by this advertisement, they should inform their childrens about that.
