In this century television becomes more and more important esspecialy for the younger generations. Now I am going to comment on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."

An argument for this statement is that children in this age can be influenced very easiely by what they see or hear. That means if these children watch television and see specific advertising for a new product they will be very interested in it. On this way the television can have a big influence on the children. But it is also important to say that this influence can be very positive. For example if there is an advertising for things you use outside like an bike or something like this. This child wants to play outside where it could meet other children in its age and make some new friends. This is a very positive influence on the social life. An other argument against it is that children in this age are to young and have not enought experiences in their lifes to know what is good for them and whats not. That means that the child does not know if it is positive for him or not.

To draw a conclusion I can say that the influence of televison advetising is very big on children. So it is very important that the parents, but also the television, have a closer look on what the children see there and if it is good for them or not. It is not possible to take away every influences from
