The statement where I want to show my opinion is "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". In general I agree with this statement.
The children who watch this advertising in TV probably get wrong information because they believe in everything which is showed to them. If you can buy a thing for which is advertising made on TV which one child wants to have you can manipulate them when you say to them that this thing is very cheap but in real it is very expensive.
When you do Television advertising for young children also they can get more information about the other parts of the world. So they become a better world view in their younger years not like the others who dind't watch these or don't have a TV. 
An another fact which agree with this statement is that the young children don't know what they have to think about that advertising. These children who looked the advertising probably have a thought which makes them angry or something. The children also sit a lot more time before the TV because of these advertisings who make them watching the series or something which the advertising shows.

In general I am against the Television advertising direct toward young children because the negative consequences are too big to ignore them.
