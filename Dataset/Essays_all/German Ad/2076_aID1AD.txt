Many people say television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed anymore. But why does it need to be stopped or does it even?
On the one hand side advertisement directed toward young children is very helpful. It isn't helpful for the children but for their parents. The parents are often watching way more television than their children and they are the ones who buy the products shown in the advertising. They get attention on new and better products for their child and if they buy it the child hopefully will be happy which leads to joyful parents.
On the other hand the children get this kind of wanting everything that's new or seems to be better. They get integrated in our "world of consume" far too young. Children in that age can't decide wether something they want is useful or wether they need it or not. They only see it on television where the products are shown as "perfect". Negative sides of the product like becoming less creative are left out and the child only sees the good things. The child becomes a consumer in an age it doesn`t even know how to care about itself.
I myself think that television advertising directed toward young children isn't something you have to stop. Children in that age just shouldn't be allowed to watch that much television that this thinking of needing everythink can take place in their brains. In my opinion it is in the parents might to let advertising not be a problem, but something that informates and is interesting for themselves.
