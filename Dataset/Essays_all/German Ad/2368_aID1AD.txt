Today there are many advertises for toys and stuff in programms for children, but is that okay?
In the following text I will discuss if it should be allowed or not to produce television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five).

For the economy it is a very good way to earn much money, when they produce advertises in channels for children like disney channel for example. The reason for this is that the cildren if they see well looking toys in the advert, they really want to have that and ask their parents so long after that until they will buy it for them. So you can say that the big concerns programmed something in the head of the children and they are a part of our economysystem. But I think children should just be children they should play outside and should start living their lives without being part of a system where everyone just want to earn money. 
Another reason for this point of view is, that children should learn to be happy with the things they have and they should not always want to have new stuff just because it is in the television adverts. This is also bad for people with less money than others, becaus they can´t efford to buy their children all the new things from the adverts and than the children become unhappy. To avoid this  it´s a very good idea to don´t allow television advertising directed toward young children I think.
