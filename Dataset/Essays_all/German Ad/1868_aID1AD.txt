When young children see things they can´t think about it in an abstractly way. They take it as a true statement. So it would be the same, when they see a television advertising. Surely there have to be positive aspects. For example the point that they learn early to decide what is right and what is only made for advertisings. Their parents could and of course should help them by learning it. All in all it is the excercise of parents to take care for their children. Commercial creator try to show prducts as good as possible. It is like the zine at supermarkets at the end. Children are the best chance for advertising creator to sell new products. On top of this no mother or father could say "No!", when ´their children want to have something and look to them with their big blue eyes. so you can´t say wheather it is true or fals to show television advertising to kids. Of course when you show ut, it have to be the right advertising , which is "good" for they age. The topic bring an other topic with it, the question how long children from age two to five should sit in front of television. Television and expecially advertising show a picture of life children don´t know how it´s really is. When they sitting all days the whole day on television they have no time to go outside. They can´t explore the wourld and get own experiences. 
To put it into a nutshell I would say that it is better to show children aged two to five as less as possible of television advertisings. I think it is okay to show children programmes or show in television, but when thier is an advertising break they should go outside, so that they can learn early in their lifes to make breaks and find out that their are a lot of ohter things to meet next to the television.
