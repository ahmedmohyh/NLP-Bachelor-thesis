Television - everybody watch it, no matter how old they are. And everybody knows this situation when you watch a movie or series and then the advertising break starts. Especially young children are often annoyed of this. Young children don't watch so much TV, but when they do, they watch Disney Channel or something like that. Between the different series there is often a advertising break. The breaks shows toys, magazines, sweets or books for young children. But should television advertising be allowed to be directed toward young children?

 On the one hand, everytime seeing the lucky children in the TV with the new toy (e.g. Barbie), they want to be as lucky as the children. But how can they be as happy as them? With the new toy! So everytime when they see an advertising with a toy they like, they want it, too. And everytime their parents get annoyed of that because they have to pay for all the toys. And they are expensive!

 But on the other hand, they see new toys and when you buy this for your children (e.g. for christmas, birthday), they will be so happy and thankful. And the shining eyes, little cute smile, and laugh will make your heart melt. Only this is a reason why television advertising toward young children should be allowed. They will find some new toys, books, magazines, which will make them smile. It doesn't have to be expensive. Sometimes the little things make you smile.  

 To sum up, when I was younger I loved television advertising because I found new stuff I like and when I get this, I was so happy. So in my opinion television advertising should be allowed.
