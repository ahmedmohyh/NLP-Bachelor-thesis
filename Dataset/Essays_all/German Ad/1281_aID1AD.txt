The statement"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", is a dificult theme for the childrens and for the parents. An advertising with the Television is a good option, which every body could see. But should it be allowed for young childrens?
First you have to say that television advertising directed toward young children is a reason for the them, to watch more television or play some games in the internet, because they recognize that somebody directly talk to them. They  will sit more inside in the house and maybe dont go outside and play with some friends in there age. You also have to say that television advertising toward young children is a trick against the parents. When young children see something new or something they would love to have, they may go to the parents and ask directly: Pls buy this or these for me. But you have to say that televison advertising toward young children also have good reasons. With the television you could talk to everyone all over the world. For example, when you see something in England in the television, you can order it when you are back in your home country. As a parent you dont have to run from shop to shop to see the new things for the young children, you see it in the television and then you will order it via Internet. 
You could say that television advertising toward young children is good for the childrens but not for the parents.
