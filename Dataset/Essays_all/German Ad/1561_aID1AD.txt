Now it´s my task, to write an essay about the topic "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".

In my opinion it is good idea that television for children from two to five shouldn´t be allowed, because so the most parents are going to do more outside activities with their kids, which would cause an better relationship to the people outside. The kids could learn more about the inviroment or get new friends. in the real life the kids will learn how to react in different situations, which they maybe can´t handle with when they are just watching it on television. Most of the TV series now a days are not ideal for litte children from the age from two to five, because they can just see an situation but can´t experience it in tzhe real life for theirselves. Maybe it is possible to find an compromise between watching TV in this age and getting advertised by the real life with real feelings and real situation where thy can learn from others how to react right.

So all in all I would say that is an good idea to forbit TV for little children, but not for all the time. Maybe it is possible to have some time at the day where they can watch TV an some other time where they have to do something else, like playing outside.
