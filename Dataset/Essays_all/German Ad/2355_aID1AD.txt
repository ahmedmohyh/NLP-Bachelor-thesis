Nowerdays children cannot grow up without any sort of device or television. In many cases when children don´t get what they want, they just watch TV because this is an easy method for the parents to calm them down. The parents can´t force what exactly their children are watching. In some cases the children watch ads which are not really appropriate for them. The statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." can´t be managed but it can be forced by the parents i think with the following reasons.

The televison thinks, that showing the ad is going to make the children wanting to watch the movie or whatever it was advertised for. The children convince their parents to go to watch the movie together because they don´t want to miss it. In the movie-breaks there are new ads which are doing exactly the same again. They get addicted to the television. The children watch more and more TV as they grow up. They learn a lot from it but still the parents can´t gurantee what exactly their children are watching and the things they see is what they wantet them to see anyway. The parents cannot control their children. 
There should be a better way for the parents to control this part of TV. One way to sort the problem could be that for money you can buy a television-programm that doesn´t show any ads. Then parents would have the ability to see what their children are watching. There is already some sort of ad-free chanel. With netflix you can set in the settings that you want to have a childrens channel. The children can now only watch children-movies. 

So if parents think it is necassary for their children to have an ad-free channel, they can buy it but if they are fine with the ads they just leave it. It is the decision of the parents what they do with their children.
