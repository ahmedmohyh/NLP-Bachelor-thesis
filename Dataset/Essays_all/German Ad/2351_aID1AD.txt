Lots of people watch everyday television. Even really young chidren spend hours in front of the tv and companies use this for advertisements for their products directed toward the young children. Some people critize that. In the following I am going to dicuss wether advertisements specifically directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
Marketing is a really important part of the success of a product. Companies can sell products a lot better if they make advertisements for their products. If you prohibite the companies to make advertisements directed toward young children at the tv they might make less profit.
On the other hand products will also be bought even if there aren't advertisements for them. At least if they are really good or nessesary. If there are advertisements on TV directed toward young children these children are forced to decide if they want to have the product or not. This is really problamatic because young children aren't able to build an own opinion based on facts and real arguments. This is the reason for which they are different laws if they commit a crime. How could young children really decide in a good way to buy a product? They can be easily manipulated. The companies can use this for their advertisements.

Personally I think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. I think it isn't a good idea to let young children being manipulated. They can't decide on their own and therefore should be protected by the law. Instead the companies can make advertisements toward the parents of the children who can already base their opinion on real raguments and aren't manipulated as easily.
