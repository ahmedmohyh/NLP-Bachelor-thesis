Television advertising has a huge impact on our life, since we all get influenced by it. The following statement says that television advertising should be forbidden in case it is directed toward young children. So on the one side we have the parents, who want their children not to get in contact with advertising at least at this young age, since advertising has a deep impact on our minds. On the other side we have big companies, especially those who focus on producing toys. 

From the parents point of view, the only positive aspect is that the child knows better what kind of toys it wants on his/her birthday, if it watches a lot of television commercials. But the negative points are much more important and strong than the positive ones. So for example television advertising, focused on little children, mostly is based on saying the name of the product many times with a ''cool'' voice in order to bring it into the viewers mind. This means that the toys, your child wants to have are complete trash in most cases. Another point is that, as a parent, your child will get on your nerves every time you are in a mall with him/her, because he/she wants you to buy these toys. An other aspect is that it generally is not good to let children, which are these young, watch that many television. Otherwise it will be a normal process and the kid will not be able to live without electronic devices. 

On the company's point of view advertising directed towards little children has the negative aspect that they have to produce special spots just for these group of people, which costs a lot of money in most cases. But on the other side a positive aspect is that you can earn a lot of money because one can influence little children very easily. This means with good advertising spots many children want to get your toys. 

But actually producing advertisings for children aged two to five is rather bad than good, because it has important negative aspects for the parents.
