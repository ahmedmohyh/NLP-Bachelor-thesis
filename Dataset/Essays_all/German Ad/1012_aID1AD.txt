In the following text i will discuss if "Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed"
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it. At the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.
But i also think that children with two years do not recognize the advertise so well than children with five years. The two years old children will not react like five years old children, maybe they will strike or something like that,if they do not get that product. But the two years old children will forget it and maybe their parents will buy another toy/product which is better and cheaper and the child will also be happy about it.
I think that the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is right in a way, but i think that children until three years do not have the knowledge about that stuff, so that´s why i think young children until three can see television advertising, but for older young children until six or seven, when they come to school,it schould not be allowed, because they have the knowledge and can discuss withe their parents about it.
