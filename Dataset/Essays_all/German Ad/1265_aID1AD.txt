The question whether or not televison advertising directetd towards young should be forbidden is a quite controversial one, as young children often enough can't voice their own oppinion and there are good arguments on both sides. 

A point against this would be that the mind of a young child can be influenced way easier, than an adult mind, what could potentielly lead to big companies showing ads directly targeted at young children, so that those stick to that very same company for their rest of ther lives as the memory about this company ,and how good it presented itself, is deeply ingrained into the childs mind leading it to subconsciously preferring the products of a certain company in their adult lives. This can be seen especially good in the buying behaviour of old people, as they often tend stick to a certain brand for the rest of their lifes, that they know from their childhood on.

Another argument against this is that children can not actively protect themselves from those advertisements, as they often even don not know, what they are being shown. Furthermore most parents can not protect their children from those advertisements aas well, as they can not check on theri kids every five minutes, as a matter of fact there are even parents who do not controll, what their children watch at all, showing a rather careless attitude.

Then again there actually are arguments for advertisemenst being targeted at children, because it just can not be avoided, that at some point iof its life a child watches an advertisement. So the actual question is, do we want it to see a child friendly advertisement that will trick them into buying the products of a certain company or do we want advertisements that could be potentielly harmful to a childs mental health, causing them to get anxiety, certain phobias and so on. An example for this would be the advertisement for a particular violent game or something comparable.

Personally i think that, there should not be advertisements directly targeted at children and if so they should not be too influential, because either outcome can be bad for a child.
