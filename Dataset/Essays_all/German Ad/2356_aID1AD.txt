In our todays life the television is a big part of our world. We´re always surrounded by series, movies, variety shows and of course by bright, coloured, most stupid advertisements. Everybody reacts different to them. But how do little children between two and five react to advertisements, which are just exactly for them? And should it been forbidden to make advertisement for such young persons?

Of course it´s not okay, to make your money with producing irrelevant stuff for little  children and manipulate them so much, that they couldn´t think about something else.
But I think, that little children do not understand, what advertising means and I actually think, I would regulating what my child watches in TV. And I´ve got the money. I don´t think that my little child, which absolutely hasn´t got any idea what money is, could buy whatever it wants. I think, I would know, If my child used to have the Super bright fluffy flying Unicorn which spies Glitter, when you squeeze it. 
Maybe there are parents, who are buying their child everything it wants to have. But that´s actually not my problem.

I think, that the television advertisements for children between two to five should be allowed, because in the end the parents decide, what they want to buy or not and the children are also much to young to understand the world of capitalism.
