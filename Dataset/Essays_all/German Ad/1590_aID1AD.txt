First of all it´s important to place one thing on the top: advertising changes us all daily and it has such a big influence on our behaviour. It became so usual for us that we can´t imagine living without, because we don´t realize the gravity, like blind children who believe in everything. 
But now we have to ask the question: can we live a life beside all those advertisings and medias? Should we especially protect children from this influence?
On the one hand we have to realize how much responsibility we have for the children of today, because they are the strong ones of tomorrow. Adverts influence their point of view more than the point of view of adults, because their knowledge about deciding between good and bad is much smaller. Children believe nearly everything they hear or see and that is the dangerous point. 
Another problem is that we never know what the advert a 4-year old child sees makes to him and how it changes his future. Maybe in one hundred years the people behave like roboters, because the future generation is on that "consume trip" since childhood. 
On the other hand we have to live in reality and we have to see how far technologies developed in the last years and how our society changes with them day by day. We can´t take our children to a different universe and we can´t make them close their eyes. Sooner or later they have to live with advertising in media and they have to learn how to handle them. 
At all I have to say that I can understand the statement and I see the affect behind it, but I don´t think that it´s possible to create such a law. Not today, not in this world. 
Coming back to the question above;we can´t protect our children, because we all bahave like children in this society.
