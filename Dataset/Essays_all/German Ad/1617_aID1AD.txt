Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
First of all, I think that it is important to mention that the children are very young and could get influenced by the television advertising. For example when they see a commercial of barbies, they want a barbie or want to look like it. Moreover they get to know a very wrong role of a woman like looking good and being thin, cook all day long and think thats all they can do.

On the other side not many young children in age 2 to 5 watch TV regulary so it minimizes the chance to get influences by wrong roles. Many parents just want their children to read and hear music and not watch the TV. So they don't get influenced. In addition the young children do not think so much about the things in the advertsing so they do not know whats behind it and just want one thing. It is more dangerous later, when they are teenager and think about the roles and being thin.

I think that the parents should not allow their children to watch the TV so early and when they are so young. My opinion is that the advertising is then no problem. Later it is a problem in puberty when the children think about it, but it can also start very early. It is a very controversial theme, but it is the best solution to not allow the children to watch the TV so they do not get in touch with advertising.
