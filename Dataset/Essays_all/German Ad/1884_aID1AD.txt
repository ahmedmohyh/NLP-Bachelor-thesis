It`s definitely okay to have advertising directed toward young children in television. 
On one hand it`s something clever, made by the industries. They want to attract children as soon as possible to get caught by there advertisements. 
But on the other hand children get caught by multimedia anyway. I know quite a lot children in the age of 3 years whose birthday present is an iPad so they can play games on it. But then I find it even more irresponsable to leave his child alone with an iPad than letting him or her watch a spot about barbie dolls in the televison.
Most of the children in our times don`t play with Playmobile, Lego or dolls anymore so I don`t guess that advertisements about toys will influence them badly. I rather think that it`s a good thing to show the other possiblities about "playing". So that they can see there is even more than electronical stuff to spend time with.
For sure its another periode of time we`re living in and its mostly based on multimedia but is that a reason for keeping children away from real toys? I don`t guess so. 
For that reason a don`t agree with the statement above because I think that there are even more dangerous things than advertisments for children. It`s just a reminder of the real things children should actually play with and in my opinion these things aren´t computers, iPads, mobile phones or anything like that. For sure these advertisements are presented in multimedia as well but I think it`s rather okay to let children watch some TV than letting them explore the whole internet by the use of those already named things.
