Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden ?
My first question is, who and how should that be controlled ? Like, turning the TV off when advertising comes ? Only watching a programm for children without any advertising ? Or just beeing able to watch a certain time of the day where no advertising at all is playing ? It just makes absolutly no sense. Isn't the better question, if such young children should be allowed to watch televison at all? Not every advertising in genereal is bad, and, true story, not every serie or film playing in the television is bad, but if parents let their children watch television, then there will be advertising. And that it not a problem, because why should it be ? Almost everywhere is advertising, in the supermarket, on the childrens toys, in every shop they go all they see are colofull adveritses. Even on the street are big (plakate). There is no problem with that at all. For sure, children want to have things that are advertised in the television and that can be stressfull and expensive for the parents, but when they let their children watch TV then it is their problem. And if there wouldnt be any advertising in television, then children would see other things they want in a shop, at a friends house, on the street and so on. You can't protect a child from what they are going to see or what they are going to want.
So no, television advertising directed toward younger children should not be forbidden, because it is normal in our period of time.


Advice for parents which are saying that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed: Let your children play outside instead of watching TV all day, then you didn' have to deal with such questions.
