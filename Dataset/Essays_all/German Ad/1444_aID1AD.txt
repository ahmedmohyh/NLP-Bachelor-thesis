"Advertising" 

Times have changed in terms of raising a child. New technology has come and nowadays can't be ignored. Kids from young age on get used to a TV, a mobile phone and the computer. With the use of the new technology comes advertisement. But advertisment isn't only just bad and not good for the kids. It gives them, for example ideas for christmas or their birthday. It gives them something to dream of or talk about with their friends. And this can also happen to children aged two to five. Channels and companys need advertisement to promote of finance themselves. There is no difference between going outside and seeing a huge board with advertisement or wathing TV and have a small spot between your show. 
But there's of course not only "good" advertisement. Many try to controll kids and promote things which are not only heavily overprized but maybe even bad for the children because it contains small things that they can swallow and in the worst case even die. 
In my perspective advertisement should be sorted. The age from two to five is one of the most important phases of a growing children and it's a learning phase in which they more or less believe everything you will say. As a child I watched TV aswell and the ad-breaks weren't the most fun so I did something else. This shows you that ad's have of course a impact on the minds of little kids, but they also have a own opinion and won't be controlled by the advertisment. It's all about how and what you promote and what is allowed to promote. That's is why I think that advertising isn't always bad, but should definitly be sorted. Also it's pretty rough to only ban ad's for young children, because not only young children watch those channels and others who were wathing could be offended because they acutally wanted to see the ad's.
