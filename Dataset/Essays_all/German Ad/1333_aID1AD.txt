The question is: " Are Televersion advertising should be allowed toward young children"? In the following I am going to explain my opinion about this topic. 

Children programms are in general good and important for kids in the age of two to five years, but in my mind advertising are not a good idea. 
Everybody knows that problem: You watch a movie and a part of this is very good and then a advertising cut this moment.
But Yes, advertising is in a way good and present marks of communities. In the supermarket it can be helpful and the person knows the product that he/she buys. The person knows the price and the function and has an exactly picture in his/her head. Advertising is a good way to relax and to be happy about the last part of the movie.

But the movies or series of children are not very long and advertising is not a good method. Advertising let things or food in a better light and children want to have nearly everything. Parents should be able to make an diccision for their kids. "Is this food/thing good or not good for my children"? That is the important question. 
In germany we say "Advertising make dump" and i have got the same opinion. In my mind advertising is a good way to present something, but children at the age of two to five are too young. Children programms should be good for they, the kids have to learn something and advertsing have to make a good break to the reality.
