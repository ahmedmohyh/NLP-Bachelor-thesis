Some critics believe that television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed. 
Reasons for that statement could be that when younger children see the advertising and commercials on their TV immediatley want to get the item that is advertised even though they don't fully understand want that item, often a toy, even is. The children could get unsatisfied with the toys they have at their own house, since children always want new things they can play with. But since not all parents have the money and/or abilities to buy their child a new toy everytime they see one on TV, it could be better if the children didn't see any commercials on Televison. 
But that could also be achieved in another way. It is easy for the parents to make sure the children only watch TV channels that don't have any commercials that are directly towarded to young children. 
Private channels only make money off of commercials and ads which is why there is no way around showing them. In my opinion, it is better for a child to see commercials they can understand and get entertained by than an ad about something they don't understand or shouldn't see because it contains graphic or sexual content.
In conclusion I think it is important for the parents of a young child to know what their child is watching on TV. It should be their decision whether or not they let their child watch TV. If it was my child, I would make sure it is only watching channels that have child appropriate commercials and TV shows. 
All in all I don't think advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
