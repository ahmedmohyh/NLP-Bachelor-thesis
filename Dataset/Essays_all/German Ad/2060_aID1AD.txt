I´ll discuss in the folling essay the statement ´´Television advertising directed toward young children (aged to to five) should not ne allowed.´´
First of all you have so say that nerarly everone of us watched television in young age. It was like the highlight of the day if you could watch in the evening your favorite disneyfilm. 
Furthermore children learning a language easier on television. For example many immigrants in germany let their children watch televsion, so the immgrant kid´s are leraning the corect pronunciacion.

But television isn´t the only way to learn a language and a bad excuse for letting children watch televison for many hours.

Fact is, when you watching televison you are not doing something, just by hearing a lenguage without practesing speaking you are far away from actually correct speacking.
Television advertising is the only way to gernerate money for the film/television studios, so why should be everyone able to show advertising and earn many accept the moviemaker for children? 
In conclsuon advertising is really important for the televesion studios and they can not not use them. If you don´t want that you child is watching the fucking advertising, turn off the televesion and play with your in the garden or whatever.
(I can relate :D)
