The question if television advertisment should be directed to young children or not can be seen in different ways: On the one hand side children can tell or show their parents what they think they will like and what they will not like before the parents go shopping, so maybe the parents save a bit of money. It also is the parents' choice if they let their children sit in front of a televison or not, so they decide if it is acceptable to let their child watch the advertisment on the televison. On the other side people in advertisments sometimes do impossible things which for example would cause injuries, but as children do not know that, they could copy the people in the advertisment and could hurt themself. It can also influence their social life: If some children are not allowed to watch televison or less than others and they do not see an advertisment about a product but everyone else does and gets it, they could get excluded by the others. Furthermore it can influence a childrens life in a bad way, especially as they cannot see the dangerous things inside the products the advertisment is about. If they watch televison alone and the add comes up and then later they go with their parents grocery shopping, they will not understand if their parents do not want to buy the stuff because inside is something dangerous. If the parents let the child have the product they saw on televison and the parents do not check what inside the product is, they could eat or touch toxicated things.
