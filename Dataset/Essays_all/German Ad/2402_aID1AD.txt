In the following I will discuss the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed: An argument for this statement is that a young child wants everything they see or everything that is hyped. So they can get easily manipulated by firms. Because they can´t know what they really need they are wanting their parents to buy all the nice stuff from the ads.
An argument against this statement is that big concerns just want to sell their products. And if they are selling things for children they should be allowed to show it to them. But my main argument against this statement is that young children have to learn that they can´t get everthing they want.They must know their parents aren´t aible to buy all of the things from the ads. So they are learning how to handle with money and that you have to do something to get little presents, e.g. cleaning your room.
To put it in an nutshell I think that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed. At first you may not see it but there is a huge learning effect.
