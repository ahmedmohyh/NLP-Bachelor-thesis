The question is if it shouldn´t be allowed to show advertising to young children in television. I personally disagree with that, but there are of course statements for pro and contra in every argumentation.

People who say that it shouldn´t be allowed always mention that this is a trick used by producers to lure the children. Young children are often naive and listen to things they hear in television. They are easily impressed by commercials with the result that they want to buy toys or other things shown there. Often the parents don´t allow it what makes the children scream and cry if they are disappointed. That destroys the bond between parents and children. Furthermore it is possible that they see the advertising also at other locations, for example at a friends house or somewhere else. And today there is also the internet a problem where children are able to see everything.

As already said children want to buy the things they see in the advertising and do a lot to get them. If parents allow that after long discussions they are obviously the ones who gave up which makes it their fault that they paid money for useless things. Parents know that this things are usually very expensive and useless. But for parents it´s their duty to teach and inform their children.

Finally you can say that there are arguments for and against advertising like this which makes it harder to decide, but I will stay with my opinion from the beginning that I disagree with the presented statement.
