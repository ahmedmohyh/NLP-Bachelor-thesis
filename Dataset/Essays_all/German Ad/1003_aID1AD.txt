 For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.
 The television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids. So they can lough and be happy. They show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something, and the children are learning something. But also there are some advertising that aren´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave. Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldn´t learn. A situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and don´t know what he could do. He saw an advertising where this happend and the solution was that the child hurt the other one, and that is not ok. In reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car. So it´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it... 
They should show how to play a game or to take part in other plays where he can play with other children.
Also I think that children who are at the age of two to five shouldn´t be allowed to watch tv because it´s not good for their eyes. It´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum. There are some little things that could make them happy... for axample spending time with their mum, so they can build a better feeling for each other, because they get to know each other better.
How I said in the begining there are some funny and beautiful advertising which make the children smile and be happy, but I think that they can do other things for being happy. 
So all in one I think that the Television advertising should be allowed, but those who make the children learn something they shouldn´t learn shouldn´t be allowed. So the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged two to five.
