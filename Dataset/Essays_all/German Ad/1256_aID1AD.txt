YOung people shouldn't watching television because it isn't so good for young people to watch the hole time television. The children should go to the outside and to enjoy their life and to play with their friends. 
If the young people wathing a documentarie in the television it doesn't matter because they learn something about the world or something about the nature.
 But some families don't watching a documenteration because they like to watch cartoon or to watch some movies for a example a roman or a thriller, it doesn't help their child to learn about the life or something like else. Children should read more, because thats better for their life and it helps to be better in school. As I was a childreen I was playing the hole time outside with my friends and I hadn't time to watch television or playing with a gameboy.
To watch television the hole time isn't so good for their future because the most children aren't so good in the school if they looked as a children the hole time television. To read a book is even better for their future and it helps to understand the world and the nature. In some countries in the school the used televisions or computer for their lesson, because they tink it is better for the students, but to sit the hole time in front of a telivision isn't so good for the eyes of the children. 
And the most children are at home and wathing television and now why the schools do this. So it's okay to watch television but not the hole time and to watch series about the world or something like else.
