Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed! Is this statement true? We can remember the situation when we where young kids and our parents allowed us to watch tv. As everyone knows if you are watching tv their is so much television advertising that is driving us crazy even after a short time. But this was not the same thing when we were young because all these twelevision advertising influus us. We wanted to have everything: The new Barbie, the mini car, and the singing pink teddy. So we often had an argument with our parents because they thought that we already had enough things to play with. Also hopefully childreen are not allowed to spend much time with watching tv and it is not cool if they want to watch the new a
episode of Barbie but most of the time they have to watch a stupid but for christmas very inspiring television advertising. On the other hand maybe kids can learn to handle money if they are confronted with television advertising. They can understand that they can not own everything make decissons what they really "need" and work for there gifts. (Santa is not coming to you this year if you are not a good kid, so go and tidy up your room! Thanks Mum...)
So all in all I agree with the statement at the top. Childreen who are only two to five years old should not watch television advertising. They are getting to much inspired by them and it gets to expersive for the parents. They are to young to handle it! I think that there should be no more television advertising on the childreen channels at all!
