Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television. Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.
The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.

A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.
There are some products that may not be shown to children. For example alcohol. Children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented.
Advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else - the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult.
An easy way to prevent children from this danger is a regulation of the time a child is watching TV. Too much TV time leads to a bad eyesight and maybe to a bad social abillity because of the fact that a lot of kids are watching TV for hours and hours without speaking to everyone or to get in contact with new friends or kids.

For me advertising towards young children is not a problem. The parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a TV and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.
Imagine that there would not be advertising anymore - where is the money for the channels coming from ? Some channels would not be even able to exist.
Advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as before.
Another point that can be discussed wether good or bad is, that children get inspired for their whishes on christmas.
I think this is something that can be as good as bad.
