Since the media plays such a big role in our current society and you cant prevent young children from watching TV and being influenced by its advertisment I am asking myself wether TV advertisment for children should be forbidden or not.
First of all
People could say that poor familys made not be able to make their children happy anymore because of their growing expectations of what they see on TV and that they could get into some financial problems because of that. These children however are not going to be able to stop watching any other commercials either so they would have to deal with advertisment for the adults which is not better at all.
Children could be tempted to think that everything they see on Tv is the truth and that they can believe what the TV says it could lead to the point where they think everything they do has to be like in the comercial they saw and maybe are going to lack creativity for example. 
But this could also be used in another direction where the children learn how to deal with advertisment at a very young age because they are going to be confronted with it for the rest of their lives so it would be bad to just throw them into the cold water. 
The advertisment could lead to surroundings where children jugde each other by how many toys they have from for example specific brands they saw on TV like "Lego" or "Playmobil" and that this could lead to them always wanting the newest and the best toys there are because they want to be accepted by the others.
But when they see the advertisment and get all the information about the toy they want, they know how much it costs and they can compare that to other things they see on TV so they could learn how to be responible and to get the best there is with the least amount of money or affort so they get a feeling for how much the toy they play with is actually worth and they learn to respect that. 
Because of the arguments I stated I think it would be useless to try to not allow advertisment for kids on TV.
