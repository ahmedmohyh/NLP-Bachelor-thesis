In the following essay i shall examine argument for and against the motion "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed". 
The first argument that agrees with the statement is this advertising should not be allowed because it does support the high amount of watching TV which can have health impacts on the development of the children. If there is for example a special ad of a toy which a kid loves it wants to see this ad and wants to watch Tv more often. Another pro argument is that the manupulation of the consumer with advertising gets support because the industry does start to influence the children from a low age to for example ask their parents to buy a certain toy. 

An argument against the statement is that a ban of the Television advertising would not solve the main problem: Children would still watch too much TV instead of playing in the nature or with toys; even the eyes or the brain could have health impacts because the motions and colours on the TV could be too much for these young children. Another argument against the stament is that only the advertising has not a bad impact on the children because it is only seconds long and also has not any unfitting content like for example violence. The last argument againt the stamenet is that if these advertising can not exist anymore the economy and companies could get problems. Probably less people would buy their products because they do not know them or are not convinced of them.

In my opinion, the advertising should not be allowed anymore. First, this advertising supports watching often TV at a young age which in my opinion is not good. The consumer should also decide and have his own opinion to products and not get influenced companies and their advertising especially not at a yong age.
