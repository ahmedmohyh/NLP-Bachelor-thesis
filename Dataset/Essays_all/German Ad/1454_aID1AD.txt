Children often don´t know what to do. So parnets put them infront of a TV. But is this really the right thing to do when your kid is between aged two to five? If the parents have many things they have to do and the child is only annoying then it is a good thing to show the kid a serie. It is not okay to think that your child is annoying but that is a different subject. Through TV- shows kids can learn many things, e.g. colours but also cultural normes like sharing to other peoeple or that it isn´t okay to hurt somebody. There are also some shows where kids can learn other languages. But on the other side scientists found out that kids could get ill from watching TV. Young children can only see many many pictures which changes very quickly. They couldn´t realize what happens and can´t understand what a TV is. Also there is a lack of communication when children watch too early too much TV. They can´t say what they feel or want because they have less words to use. And in general it is better to care about the children. When parents decide to have a baby then they have to spent time with her/him, even if it is a difficult situation. Kids learn a lot when for example the parents read them something out. They know how to listen and how to learn by heart. I think it is okay for young children to watch TV once a week but only for half an hour and only if the kid wants it. The shows must be checked by parents if it is a reaaly good one and don´t get the children be stupid (like the Teletabbies). But there are many other activities to do. The kid has to learn how to do something alone when he has nothing to do, TV aren´t allowed to be the answer. He has to get a social life even it is a young person. Otherwise they don´t learn how to share in real life or all those cultural normes. So I would more agree with the statement that Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
