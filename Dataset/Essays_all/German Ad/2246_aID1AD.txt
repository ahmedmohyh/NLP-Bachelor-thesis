The sentence ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be not allowed'' have people who agree with and disagree with. Maybe it is the right way for young children to grow up whithout TV because they have maybe a better childhood because they play more often in the nature and with other children as when they watched just TV. 
On the other side it is totally okay when children in this age watched maybe just one hour on the day TV. When they play with other children in the afternoon and watch maybe just an hour before they have to sleep it is okay. 
I think one hour to watch TV in this age is okay because I do not see a danger for the child to see an hour maybe spongebob, barbie or other series for kids. When they have fun to see this, they are allowed to do this. But children have to become fresh air and they have to go outside for a bit time. People should not to be so (streng) with their little children. 
Okay I understand when parents say that their children should not to watch TV because they do not like the series they are watching or they think that they become stupid when they see this. But then they should show their children which one they will be allowed to watch. 

So in the end I can say I disagree with the sentence ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed to''.
