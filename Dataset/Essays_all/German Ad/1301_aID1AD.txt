Television is a general tool of modern society, but it might not be as beneficial to young viewers as it seems. Escecially cirtain advertisments aimed specificly towards children and infants are a constant controversial topic. Many parents and adults suggest that they should completely  be banned, in order to protect the savety of the younger generation. But is this really a necessary procedure or might advertisments not be as dangerous as they are portrait to be ? 
I  personally support those who are against advertisments directed towards young children. Because in my opinoin, children have to learn how to develope an own opinion and those advertisments could be a threat, manipulating children with colorful pictures and loud voices. Young kids are very likly to follow the lead of the people in their environment, viewing them as an athority and if people in television tell them to buy things and act cirtan ways, it might cause children to develope bad habbits, such as being to reliand on konsumism, always wanting the newes toys and best games. But showing them those images from advertisments aimed towards them could also cause them to have low self-esteem because they dont look like the people on televisoin or they dont want to play with the dolls the kids in those advertisments play. Children would grow up thinking that there is something wrong with them. That they are differnt from others and by banning those advertisments, kids would be able to grow up in peace and without constantly worrying about fitting in. Because I think that being yourself and accepting who you are is very important, especially at a young age, where you are already trying to find your place in society and by banning advertisments aimed towards children, they would have the oportunity to do so, without being manipulated by brands and markting tactics. To conclude I think children would only benefit from the banning and their savety would be insured.
