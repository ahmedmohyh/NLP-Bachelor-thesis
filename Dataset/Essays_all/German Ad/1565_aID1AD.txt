I think it should be allowed, that children aged two to five watch advertising in TV. But there are reasons for both sides of this statement.
First it should be clear, that these children watch series for children. So the advertising in these programs is for children too.
Someone would say, if children watch advertising (for children) they get "stupid", because there are some methodes of them who are making advertising, which are not good for children. They only think about the best way for selling there products and sometimes it isn`t good for the children who want to watch their series only.
But on the other sides, what makes them "stupid" like many people say? I don`t see any reason for this.
I said, that children only want to watch their series. If they watch "Spongebob" e.g. and then there is for three or four minutes a break, they play with other things, because mostly they aren`t interested in advertising. And if there watch advertising, what happens for them? Maybe they want some of these products, which are shown to them. 
All in all there are some reasons for both sides, but if some parents are against advertising in TV channels for children, they doesn`t have to let watch their kids watching TV und buy DVD`s for example.
