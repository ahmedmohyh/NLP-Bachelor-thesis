Children seeing adverts for toy-tanks in the TV and want to have this. Many parents are shocked about this and the call to ban advertising for young children from the screen gets louder.
In our time media is an really important thing of the lifes of many children in the world.
So you have to think about how to bring media in a healthy way to them. 
And there the controverses begin. On the one hand there are the parents who see toys adverts in the TV and think this is horrible, on the other hand there is the industry which wants sell things.
There you can see this group of consuments is very important for the economy and yes it´s the future because when they are grown up they buy things and with the advertising you as a company can manage which products they will buy in their later life.
No one wants children to play with tanks and going to think war is a good, a normal thing. But there you can say there is much more other advertising on the sreen than for tanks, so why is this not good. The children get to know the latest toys outside there and can wish them from there parents for example for birthday. And the parents know what their cildren want and can buy the best, the latest toys.
But there ist a problem with this. Children can´t reflect and know the intention of the adverts. This is what´s dangerous. The child only sees this wonderful thing on the TV but does not know the industry wants to sell things. Children are manipulated and they are going to think it´s good what others tell and show you. This would have consequences for their later life. They do not reflect and can´t see the real intentions behind.
So looking on the different sites my point of view on this topic is real clear. Ithink advertsing for children, and not only for the youngest, should be banned from the screen. It´s not good for them.
