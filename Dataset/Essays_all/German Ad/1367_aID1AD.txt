Nowadays many young children watch alot Tv and many advertisings are directed toward children. In the following statement I give some explanations whether the advertisings toward children who are under the age two or five should be allowed or not.
First of all i have to say that childrens get information about new products. So they can talk about these at school or somewhere else. Furthermore the children are also intigrated in the economic market so the company's have a right to advertise their products, even if products are made for children. But beside these arguments there are many other facts why the advertisings should not be allowed. Adding to that is that many  children change their mind about money spending because they have no idea how hard it is to work for money, they just go to their parents when they are interested. Also the kids are not educated enough to understand the rhethoric methods from the companys. 
All in all advertisings to children should not be allowed and I can not agree with the statement.
