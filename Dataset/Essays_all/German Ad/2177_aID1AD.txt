Should it be allowed that television advertisings are exactly made for young children?
I think there are many facts for and against it. For example you could say that it should be permittet because the children are too young (two - five years old) to decide if the products in the advertisings are necessary for them or just nice but not important. They also don not know which of these products are good for them. If they like them, the kids want to have them and they do not care if they are maybe bad for their helph, like computer games which make the kids sit a long time in the front of their computer instead of going outside or like candies which make them eating too much sugar. The television advertisings also uses that little children can be exited about things very fast. So when they watch six advertisings every day, they will maybe like the half of them and want to have all those products. Adults sometimes think longer about what they could buy but children just want to have things when they like them, so I think they schould not watch advertisings which are directed toward kids.
But there are also arguments for these advertisings. I think children just should not watch TV so often, so they wont see so many advertisings. And the parents have still the right to permitt buying the products becauce they decide what they buy and what not.
