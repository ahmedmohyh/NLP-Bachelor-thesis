The statement is quite controversal. Many young children watch TV all day and their thoughts are pretty easy to influence. Because of that, the cool new toys or whatever they see in the commercial breaks, is all they want. This forces parents to likely unapproachable things, when their 5 year old son wants the newest Hoverboard for $400. On the other hand you could say that these children wont buy the articles anyway and it´s more for the parents who need to collect ideas what toys their kid wants for christmas. 
I think these commercials are quite important especially for the companies that sell toys, but how these commercials look is wrong. In my opinion they are brainwashing the children. You hear the name of the toy like three to five times with trippy music in the background and euphorical children who overact in their roles. But it needs to be said that these ads are also essential. In fact they cant influence the buyer of the product directly because the adults, who would buy the articles, do not watch kids TV normally. When you notice your kids being influenced by television too much you maybe just have to switch the device off and go play outside with your child. In order to make these commercials less controversial one should overthink exactly what they show there and not adress it directly to children this young. I do not think they should be forbidden completely, but their appearance and what they show there in which way definitely needs to be changed
