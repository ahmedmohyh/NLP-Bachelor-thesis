I agree with the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.

I think at the age of two to five no child has to watch any television. At this time there are so many other things to do. For example playing outside with friends or have walks with family in the woods. Learn something about nature and animals in real life is really worthful.
Some people have the opinion the children could learn things about life while watching television. Sure there are some informativ documentaries but what kind of child wants to watch this boring stuff?

Another argument against using a television at this age is the children who sit infront of computers or ipads or smartphones or televisions all day or can we say atleast too often get fat. They not get enough fresh air and they do not move. So they eat and lay in bed and thats really bad for their health.

The parents have to be very careful because there are so many possibilities to get in contact with some kind of media in times like today. I think parents have to protect their children

For parents it might be easier sometimes to "take" their children and set them in front of a television. They do not have to pay attention to them any longer. They do not have to prepare exiting trips or something. But it is so important to play with your children and to give them love and time.

Dear parents, please spent some time with your young "pieces of gold" as long as you are able to do and as long as they are not too old to want to play with you.
