The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five. There are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not. 
A good side of television advertisement is the fact that some products for children can be presented on TV and the children will talk to their parents about it. if the ads would only run on channels for adults, they probably would not listen or react to it as much as the young kids do. Many adults simply do not watch television advertisement. Having the children informed through television would be specifically great for selling the products as well as knowing all the products as a parent. 
There are more bad things about this topic though. The children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement. It would always interrupt their shows and they really just would not like it at all. In Germany there is a TV-channel called KIKA which does not show any ads. It makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement. In addition children would only see the product and what they are worth. They would be teached to think about prices and owning products more than thinking about feelings and ethics. They would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society in general because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get. 
All together i would agree with this statement. I would say that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children in general. It teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything. It is the parents' work and job to teach their growing youngs that things are just that much worth as you think they are and the advertisement shows a different idea just thinking about capitalism and making profit.
