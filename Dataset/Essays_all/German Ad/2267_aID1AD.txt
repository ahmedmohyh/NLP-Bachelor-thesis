I do not think that television advertising directed toward young people should not be allowed. The problem is not the advertising , the problem is that a lot of children are allowed to watch all programms on TV and to watch the whole day. Today in many familys it is normal that the TV is on in the background  everyday, so the children see it everyday and learn that this is normal. It is the parent´s duty to teach their children the right way to deal with all the advertising. The children need TV-rules, so they are just allowed to watch specific movies and programms. Because when advertising directed to children, aged two to five, is not allowed, there is advertising when they are older and it becomes more difficult to tell them they can not have all and buy all. Furthermore there is not just advertising on the TV, there is advertising everywhere, so the children would not be protected against it, when it is stopped on the TV. So the right way is not to stop the advertising, the way to solve the problem is education. So I do not agree with the statement.
