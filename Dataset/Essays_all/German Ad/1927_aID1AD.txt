You can't change the fact that young children grow up with advertisments. Advertisments are everywhere and you can't controll it. It doesn't matter if television advertising is allowed or not. Children don't only see these in television they also see advertisments on the street or in the newspaper. It is everywhere. You have to see the point that it is  negative in the way that young children don't only see the advertisment for games for their age it is also possible that they see an advertisment for daiting apps or something like this. This musn't be because they are too young for that but what can you do against this? Nothing because 50% of television is advertisment. It also influences the children negativly because they see the 'fantastic' things and they want to have it. However, they don't know that everything only seems to be perfect in an advertisment. It isn't the truth they are talking about in it. And that is a big problem. 
The television channels today are seperated into channels for children and channels for adults. And mostly there isn't much advertisment on the channels for the children but the danger is that children can always switch between the channels and they can also watch channels they are too young for. But it can't be a consequence to completly not allow television advertisments. 
It also depends on their parents how much they controll the channels their young children are watching. 
All in all I would say that you can't controll advertisments so it's okay if it is allowed. It is the task of the parents to controll the consum of television in their children's life. You can manage it on your own which and how much advertisment your child is watching.
