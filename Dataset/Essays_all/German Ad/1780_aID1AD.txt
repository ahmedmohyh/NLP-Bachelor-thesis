The topic is that children between two to five dont watch TV.
The first agument is that Children dont go outside and learn by doing. It is importat that children learn thing. For examble they need to hurt himself or build a snowman. If the watch TV is a way this thing by watching not doing. 
Then children learn bad things like bad words or violence, because in the TV are a lot things with violence or hate. Also children need to run and go outside to get stronger and it´s a training for them. Real social Friend are more importent then friend in TV, because friend are importet to have a happy life also as child. Then if your are lonely u get depressed and sad. A other agument is that children get problems with her eyes and need glasses.
On the other Hand they can lean things about politics or economics, if they watch TV,, they can use it for her future. Or the Parents can do things and dont need to play with the childrens. A other positiv agument is that childrens learn things by childshows. At last Tv can be good, if it is the right show and not bad content about useless things. Then they can learn writing or speaking with this shows.
In my opinion i think it should not be allowed, because TV is not good for children and the parents need time to play with his children, if they don´t have time they don´t need to make children.But if the parents had no time they should get his children into a babysitter or daymother.
