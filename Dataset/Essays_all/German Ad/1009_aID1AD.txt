Should advertising toward young children be allowed? In this essay I will show off the advantages and disadvantages of this topic and comment on it.

Of course it is interesting for a little girl to watch TV and see a doll in the advertising that wants to play with her. But what if the mother of the girl is so poor, she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money for that doll? The girls wants the doll so bad that the mother doesn't know how to react. The doll can even talk and dance, but that is why she is so expensive. Now imagine the girl never saw this advertising. She wouldn't talk about this doll and her mother wouldn't be in despair.  

In my opinion advertising toward young children shouln't be allowed. Children don't earn money and can't buy things on their own. Many children spend too much time on watching TV. People go working and people have families. Sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family. Exspecially if a mother thinks, that she can't make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw while watching television advertising.
