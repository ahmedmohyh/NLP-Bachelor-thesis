Today, there are many television programs which are directed to young children. But shouldn't we asked ourselves if these programs influence the life of the young children and shouldn't be allowed?
On the one handside, there are programs which can be good for young children because they wanted them to think and to learn about new things. For example, in my childhood I often watched a television program where other children made experiments and I learnd about new things which I told to my family and my friends. I think these programs are important for young children because they can also do these things at home and show it to their friends and families. And they are proud about theirselves when they also made these experiments.
But on the other handside, there are also television programs which aren't important for young children. The children can't learn from them and the programs only shows bullshit. And then the children also want to do these things because they think it is cool and they can be proud about theirselves when they can make these things too. But then the parents get angry and they have to tell their children that these things which they have watched in televison aren't good and that they aren't allowed to do them.
All in one, I think that television programs where the young children can learn from are very important because they have to think about new things. But the television programs which only shows stupid things shouldn't be allowed because the children want to do these things too because they think they are cool, and that's not good.
