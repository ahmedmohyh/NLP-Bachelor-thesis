"Should television adverstising directed toward young children be allowed?" This is a difficult qustions and a controversial topic.

On the one hand the direct adverstising is a possibility that children can decide on their own if they would like to have the advertised product or not, on the other hand the cildren aged 2 to 5 do not understand the function and the system of adverstising. Some people might say they learn it when they grew up with advertising directed toward them and can handle it better and earlier. But i think the young children would like to have every product they see on tv. This can causes big conflicts with their parents because they can not and often dont want to buy everything their child want to have, for example toys or sweets.
 
Of course there exist also a lot of "good" products for young cildren but they do not figure the right ones out.The parents of young children know what their kids really need. Thats why I agree with the statement that the advertising directed toward children aged two to five should not be allowed because it influences the kids too strong and they can not handle it because of their age.
