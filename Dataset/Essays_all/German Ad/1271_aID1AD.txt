Children, aged two to five, shouldn't watch TV so often, because they are in the most important Age of their life. At this age, they are learning to speak, to walk, maybe to read and so on. Television advertising could cancel these exercises. The television advertising could support the children to watch TV all day long and they want something from the Television advertising, toys or somthing else, like smartphones. But Television advertising is also helpful. The children can find some thimgs, which are useful for speaking, walking etc. If the parents are poor, it could also be, that the children can' get everything they wan't. This could be helpful for the education of the children, because they can concentrate more on things they have to learn. It is like in school, if children have things they like more, then studying or doing homework, they will do them mostly before homework, etc. In my opinion, children should be allowed to watch TV and see the Television advertising, but not so often. They should go outside and learn something from the nature and have fun. It doesn't need electronical devices every time, to be happy. But to be honest, the most children nowadays dont even now the Nature, because the're sitting all day long in their rooms and play video games.
