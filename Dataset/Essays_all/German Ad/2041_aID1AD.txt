Everybody knows the moment when they watch a movie or a serie on TV at home and every fifteen minutes there is some advertising. On older people these ads doesn't have a big impact but if young children, aged two to five, watch these ads, do the ads have an impact on them? In the following text I will analyse the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed". 
On one hand many ads concern things that a little child should not see, such as things with harm or sexual content. The children at this age are easy to influence and they are in a learning process all the time. So if they see something, they copy it because they think everything what they see is the right thing to do.
But on the other hand, most of the ads are harmless and about shampoo or travelling. Children aged two to five normally don't watch channels concerning advertising such as Pro7 or Sat1; so it would be not necessary to forbid advertising on these channels.
I think, Television advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because the Kids often only watch Kika, which doesn't concern advertising. In my oponion, parents have to decide by themselves if they let their kids whatch TV or Advertising or not. I think, children at this age would better play outside with other kids, than watching TV inside the house; but that's to decide by the parents.
