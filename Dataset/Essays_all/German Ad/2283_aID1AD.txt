We all wait what is happening next and... "Buy the new Playmobile sandcastle..." Advertising! 
My family and I watch the new Disney movie but now there is an advertising break. While the rest of the family is just annoyed by the advertising spot and does something else, my four years old sister keeps watching TV. Her eyes stick on TV and follow fascinated the new Playmobile advertising spot. 
But should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
Some people might say:" television advertising has no bad influence on the little children so why should there be no television advertising towards young children?" But I do not agree.
Young children are very easiely manipulated. In their young age they can not seperate between good our bad choices and what impact they may have. They think the adukts are always right and when they want to be like someone they just need the same things. The same toys. The same clothes. So when my little sister sees the happy pretty girl playing with the Playmobile sandcastle she wants the Playmobile sandcastle. Not because she likes sandcastles. My sister wants the Playmobile sandcastle to be like the girl in the advertising spot - pretty and happy. She gets a wrong idea of happyness and beauty and can not accept who she is because she feel incomplete.
So I think television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because young children are too easiely influenced. They get the wrong idea of happyness and beauty and can not accept themself.
