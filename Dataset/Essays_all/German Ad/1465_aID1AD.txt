I think television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed. In the following text I listet a few arguments that came to my mind while thinking about this issue.
Children of the ages two to five are way more influenced by prebuilt opinions than adults because most grown-ups can question different opinions and think about those critically, while children as young as the mentioned age are more likely to not be able to do that. Therefore advertisements have a huge influence on kids and can make it harder for the child to learn to reflect their surroundings if they develop the habit of adapting other's opinions.
Although getting premade opinions on such things as toys and food could help children to learn reflection from a very early age which may give them a more mature view on things in their youth so they are familiar with critical strategies if it gets to a more important decision than what to eat for dinner. Also parents can use advertisements to teach their children the concept of money and different values such as the right amount of consume but it depends on the parents if they want to educate their child on their own or rely on the scholar system. On the other hand children this young probably don't want to learn about the values of a decent human life on this planet. They only want to play with the toys from the ads.
To conclude I don't think ads aimed at children this young should be a thing because they are more influenced by the prebuilt opinions than adults and they would be more likely to adapt opinions even in their adult life if they aren't teached properly. Altough advertisements could be used by the parents to teach children proper values and concepts but let's be honest: ain't nobody got time for that.
