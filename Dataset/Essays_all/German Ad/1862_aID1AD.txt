I defenetly agree with the statement on top of the page. I think it is not right to direct advertising to young children, because they can not seperate, which part in the advertising is true and which one is not correct and the people of the industry only mentioned it, to make the product more interesting for the user.
I think, most of the advertising, which is directed to young children, belongs to toys or other things to play with. But these things costs money and the children don´t pay for them by themselfes, because they do not earn any money and in the age of two to five they don´t even got pocket money. The parents would pay the toy, so they have to agree with it.
Even if the kids are older than five and get pocket money of their parents, I think it´s not fair to manipulate them just because the toy industry wants to earn more money. 
Many toys are really expensive and sometimes they aren´t as good as the advertising promised. In that case the children could be sad and also they lost their money on a toy, which is not that, what they wanted.
The innovation of new products is really fast. There are coming more and more toys and kids can´t seperate between those, which are really good and will last you forever and the ones, which are not good. So they always want to have everything and because their parents wont buy it for them they will have an arguement. 
Because of my arguments I agree with the statement.
