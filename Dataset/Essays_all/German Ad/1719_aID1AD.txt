The following essay is about the question, if the television should or shouldn't advertise stuff directed to children between the age two and five. 

My opinion is that the statement shouldn't be allowed. The biggest problem with young children is that they completely miss their childhood while watching TV all day. With the power of the advertise they want to have whatever they see on the screen. Young children can't understand the neccessary and the needs of the (for example) games or toys. They won't stop wanting stuff they don't need, just because they see an advertise about other kids who love to play with the stuff. Children in this age can get really annoying and most of them won't stop crying until the get what they want.

That leads us to another problem. With the advertising, focused on young children, they'll stop apprecciate the presents and toys they already have or get. They'll start wanting more and more and this will damage their character and the raising.

Another reason against television advertising towards young children is watching TV at all. In the century of the technology most people or children are watching TV, playing computer games or chatting online the whole day. Especially the younger generations have problems with the consum and year by year more people join the hype. The damage for younger people is higher and stronger than for older people, that is another problem. They start to live in their own digital world and stop playing with friends outside, that'll damage their social life and their character. 

All in all, television is bad for everyone but younger people are more affected by the risks. So I think that it shouldn't be allowed to advertise directly towards young children and maybe it's for the best that they shouldn't watch TV at all. This'll raise their social life and improve the relationship between parents and children. And, of course, they'll raise up with an healthy handeling for the technology.
