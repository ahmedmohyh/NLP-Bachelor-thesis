The question if young children should not be allowed to watch TV is not that easy to answer, there are a lot of pros and cons.
At first young people are much more easy to influence than adults so they may think that everything told on TV is real. On the other hand children are often very interested in things they don´t know and they can also learn a lot while watching TV and that´s quite a good chance. 
But in this young age it´s not neccessary to watch TV there are so many things they can do to learn and know what´s going on in the world. But sometimes it´s just nice for the parentes to have a break and most of the childen like to watch TV and so the adults can do what they like and don´t alway have to do something with their children.
The last point is that there aren´t only nice and unscary movies on TV so childs can be scared or shocked by what they see.
At least i think it´s okay when children watch TV but the parentes have to check what and how long they watch. There should be a limit which every family can discuss on their own, so the children know that they aren´t able to sit in front of the TV the hole day. I think that it is important for the process of growing up and the individuality of everyone, to go out, meet people, make friends and so on and that´s not possible if you are just inside and never leave the house which is a risk when you have nothing to do and so just watch TV.
