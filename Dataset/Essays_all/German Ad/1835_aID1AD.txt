The advertising in television can be seen from everybodey who is watching the right program. Also childre4n between two and five years old are able to see this advertisment. Is that good for them?

Advertisments have an influence on everybody who is watching. The adult people are able to know how to work and live with these information. But young children maybe aren´t able to see the difference between the shown world in the advertisments and the realitiy. They can´t understand the task of advertisements and interpretate them in a wrong way. These wrong understandig can have a bad influense for there coming life. They maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy. The advertisement gives the children no chance to get informed about the negative aspects of the products. They only shows the good and happy world you might have using the product. But also that is a problem. The children thing that if you use the product everything would change like in the advertisment. But that ist wrong and the children aren´t able to understand that. 

But on the other hand is the television advertising a part of the life of a normal person and later of the children too. So why shouldn´t they learn so early as possible how to understand these advertisments? When it wouldn´t be allowed to show these advertisments to young children than there would be a point when the children were able to watch this advertisings and aren´t also in the higher age able to understand this in the right 
way. If they learn very early how to understand, they will later have nearly no problems.
