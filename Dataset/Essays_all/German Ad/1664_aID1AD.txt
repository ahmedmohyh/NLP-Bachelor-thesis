I agree with this statement. 
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of the danger such advertisment can do in relation to a young childrens` brain. 
When children watch television in a young age it will kill more brain cells than in an older age. Also the children want to watch more television. They are getting confronted with advertisments for kids, so they want to have them. Very annoying for parents when the child asks the whole time if he can have that toy maybe. So the parents buy the toy for the kid. Only to stop this annoying questioning. This is buisness. The firms are playinmg against the will of the people and because of that they are making more money. They are not interested in the health or the wishes of the people who can decide. Children can not decide. They see something they want to have and can not decide if it is good for them or not. The television is something everyone got today. It was getting important during the last years. Because of that, many firms are doing advertisments in the Telivision.Many children are watching Tv nowadays and so they exploit it. Only to make profit.
