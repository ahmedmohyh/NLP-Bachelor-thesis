Television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.
Therefore, firms use the most abstract way to potray their product publicly. 
Children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the product's appearance in the media.
The consumption should be determined by the quality of a product rather than the appearance.
Of course, firms like ToysRus have to adapt their advertising to the group they want to target to get the best possible outcome.
But considering that today society is dependent on media more than ever, the influence ads have on both children and adults is increasingly high.
Especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society. They cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality.
That will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances.
Why should a three-year-old girl want anything else than the new robot-barbie, that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements?
These advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: They're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.
In my opinion, parents should keep their children away from TV-advertisements as long as they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have.
Otherwise, advertising will overcome rational consumption.
