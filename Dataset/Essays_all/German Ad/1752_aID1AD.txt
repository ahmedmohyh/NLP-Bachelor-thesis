There are different arguments regarding the topic of advertising especially targeting children aged two to five. For example on the contrary side we have the simple fact that children in this age category are easily influenced and should therefore not be the direct target of adverts. Even if they are only spotting them when seeing their parents are watching TV. However the amount of influencial content shown to kids could be regulated by their parents simply by telling them to turn off the TV. There would also be controls on the content of the adverts themselve through organisations like the department of security for youth.  The stongest negative argument against these adverts however is the development of the children. In the ages of two to five many children start to develop their own individual interests and that should be state in which they are able to think for themselves instead of buying them of them to get the most profit out of it.  
I myself would agree strongly with given statement and think that children should be able to show interest in things without having to have seen the advertisement in the media for it. Sadly today certain patterns are allready seeable when noting that the varying trends today show a great deal of change from generation to generation depending on what is on the TV and other media and what is not.
