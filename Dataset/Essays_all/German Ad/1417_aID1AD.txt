It is questionable whether advertising directed towards young children should or should not be allowed. In my opinion it is not possible to ban this kind of advertisement, because it is up to them what kind of advertisement they make. But it is also up to the TV program what kind of advertisement they show and when they show it, although in the end they show the ads they get paid for the most. So it's not for the TV programs or the companies to choose but rather for the parents to choose what their children should watch and what they shouldn't. What should be banned is false advertisement which also happens in ads for children aged two to five. Suddenly the Barbie or the racing car is alive and able to speak and does fun things and the children in the ad are amazed and happy and the stuff seems like the most fun you could ever have, but in reality it's just a piece of plastic, and on top of that the most times overly expensive.
There should be a filter to what young children are able to watch and if it's not possible to directly ban ads from television the parents should think whether their child should watch this show or rather watch a different one where there is no advertisement.
Those ads are always for the newest toys or toys that appear in TV shows or movies so of course the children will want them but their ability of judgement has not yet developed to see that this is not about them having fun but for the companies to make money because of their lack of understanding and them getting tricked to want what is advertised. 
Young children should not watch advertisement because then they grow up thinking that everything presented to them in ads is as good as it seems. Companies should not make that much profit by taking advantage of them not knowing better.
