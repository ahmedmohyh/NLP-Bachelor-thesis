Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. 
With this statement the following text is occupied. I´m going to compare advantages and disadvantages. 

An arguement, why children should not be allowed to use Television with the age of two to five is, that they are to young to understand a lot of things, which are told there. Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future. For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football. Also they could draw some pictures or learn, how to spell theier names. If children with young age only watch TV, they will do this also with older age.
An advantage is, that a children with young age often has to be alone, because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something, where a little children is not usefull. Than they could watch TV, with the result that their fixed on the Television. Also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier, it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life. But it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information. 

A young children with the age of two to five has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals, for example. It is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch TV .Young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias.

As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages. I think there are a lot of more things, children with young age could do much better than watch Television. In my opinion, children, who look at pictures or learn the colours with young age have a lot of knwoledge more than children watching TV.
