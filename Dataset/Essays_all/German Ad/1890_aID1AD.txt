Television advertising always was a controversial theme. Even more so when directed at small children. Is it okay for companies to aim at children as young as  two to five with their advertisement?
The first point to be raised on the pro side is that it depends on the product advertised. Child-friendly toys such as puppets shouldn't be a problem. Also, it is probably safe to say that the advertisement is less directed to the child itself but more to the parents, since they are the ones to buy it. And a two years-old child probably won't even understand what they say in the advertisement.
To be said against that is that, while it sure depends on the product advertised, it also depends on the way the product is advertised. There surely are some child-unfriendly ways to show your product on television. Also the point about the advertisement more being directed at the parents isn't completely waterproof. A child that sees something it wants on television - and just visually seeing it is enough there - can to a large extend take an impact on it's parents when deciding wether or not to buy it. Also, just generally, children at such a young age just shouldn't already be confronted with potentially manipulating advertisement. But then again, one could argue that it is up to the parents to keep their children away from the TV if they want to prevent that.
To my own opinion, I'm generally against too much advertising on TV, which is why I stay away from it as much as I can. Therefore I say yes, advertising directed toward young children should be illegal. At least very manipulating advertisement. Or manipulating advertisement in general. I especially don't see the point that the parents should keep their children away from the TV. Why can there even be something that you have to protect your child from in television (before 10pm - or on supposedly child-friendly programs)? In my opinion that just doesn't fit into a modern society.
