Advertising toward young children?

I would agree the following statement, that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed, because a child at this age can be easy manipulated, by the advertising.

The manipulation of our society is a big problem and shouldn´t be supported by anyone. Also children decide about their own life, without beeing influenced by any organisation or an advertising in the television. 

The only positive point for this statement is, that the company, who does make the advertising towards the children can easily win new people, which will buy their products. So the company is the only one, who has a use for this advertising toward young children.

Young children are not in the position to buy products of a company, so they have to annoy their parents till they buy the products. The parents are the one which will try to make the manipulation undone, but it will end mostly like the parents will buy the product for the child , so it is quiet. It´s really unfair for the parents and they only prevent their children from the manipulation if they wouldn´t allow their children to watch television or the advertising towards young children shouldn´t be allowed.

So there are only positive aspects for the company about the advertising towards young children and only negative for all the other people, which means that this kind of advertising shouldn´t be allowed in my opinion.
