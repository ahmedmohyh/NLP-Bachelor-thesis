In the following text I am going to state my opinion on the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
On the one hand the advertising directed toward young children is not good because it somehow influences the kids and making them want to have some specific things for example toys. So they start to beg the parents if they could get it. It also changes the view the kids are having on, sticking to the example, toys. They start to compare the toys they are having to what they are seeing on television and questioning the parents why they don't have such things.
But on the other hand when parents are letting the kids watch television, they know what the consequences could be. Also a two year old will probably not notice that much from televison because it is too young. 
Personally I think that television advertising toward young children should be allowed because if parents think that it's good to let, for example, a two year old watch television then why would the advertisement a problem? I think that a two year old shouldn't be even watching television because it is too young. If parents don't see a problem by letting them watch television, which influences them just as the advertising, they shouldn't see a problem with the advertisement.
