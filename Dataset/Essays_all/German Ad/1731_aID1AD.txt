There are a lot of children in television advertisings although they can't really decide it for themselves. Their parents are responsible for them and probably also decide if they do it or not. Of course they probably ask the children but is a child able to make such a decision? I think everybody knows some decisions of their own childhood they would make differently nowadays. So maybe some people would even regret it later that they've done such an advertising in childhood. Most of the children also don't know or are not yet able to understand what it means to be shown in television. So of course there's the possibility that the parents decide right fo their child and also give them the money they get for the advertising but i think it shouldn't be allowed. Those young children can't already decide for themselves but television advertising isn't a thing parents can decide for them. Children of an age of two can't even speak so it's not their own will to make television advertising. And also children older than two probably just do it because their parents want it. I think those young children are just not able to make such a decision they even may regret later in their life because they aren't able to understand the meaning of being in the television. For me these are the main facts for my answer and i agree with the statement. 
I could understand if there were parents who'd need the money but even then it would be the child's decision it can't make because it's too young for it. There are often parents who decide for their children, want them to do things or want them to become famous and i am totally against it.
