Televison advertising is a very excited theme, espacially the one directing toward to very young children, in age of two to five.
That's the reason why I want to answer if televisison advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children?

In my view advertising is a way to manipulate somebody or to informate somebody about a product. And i think it's more a manipulation than an information. 
It isn't my opinion, but advertisings really could be dangerouse for the children and although it is a manipulation of a child's thinking there are more reasons for the television advertings.
I agree if somebody said, it should stay allowed because some of the factories producing toys have to do this beacause they should survive in the buisiness. And maybe it isn't nessasary to say it shouldn't be allowed because it isn't intresting for the children. The adversitings are more for their parents, their are more the adresse of this kind of advertising. 
Maybe the parents are going to have crying children they really wanted to have the toy, the child in the telivision have.
And if you want to answer the main question, you should have a look at the problemes of the publizity. And i think that's not a big problem, because it's the buisiness and all toy-factories have to have the chance to make television advertising like any other buisiness.

All in all i'll say that television advertising toward young children should stay allowed because i don't see any problemes for the children although they were manipulated by the advetising factory, but the main adresse of this are the parents and they really should know what is something good or what is something bad for their children.
