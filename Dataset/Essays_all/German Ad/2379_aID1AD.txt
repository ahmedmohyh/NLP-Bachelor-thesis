In the following I´m gone creat an "Essay" about the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed".

First of all it´s important to meantion that the television could be used in many different ways. You can use it to have some fun with your children and the children can learn many thinks from watching but you can spend to much time on it so it could be negative. Of couse there´re many thinks in the television a child haven´t to see but it´s emeasing how much a child could learn the language only by wathing television.

I would say that it´s right to allow children to use the television because of the learn effect but I´am not agree by let a child do what he/she want to, because just like I meantioned at the beginning in the television you´ve got so many options by switching form one channel to another that you can lose the feeling of the time and start to spend to much time by watching it.
My opinion is that it´s from familiy to familiy different because you can´t tell your children to stop whatching television if you spend the whole time by doing it and in this point it isn´t important how old these children are.I would meantion too, that the television is a medium which have a big might at which is able to form the way a human think and if a child start with young age whatching television it will be have more effect od the children
