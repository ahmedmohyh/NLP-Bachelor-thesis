Everybody gets influenced by advertises. Espacially in the television advertises can trick people to buy the product even if the don't really need it. So most of the young children gets affected and are influenced by these tricks.
 There are lots of arguments against the television advertising toward young children. Young children can' recognize tricks of the producers so all they want is to buy the product. Due to the fact that the children want to have these product the parents are affected too. 
The children want it and they don't know if the parents have the necessary money but there is a positive aspect too. There are some products which has to be bought by the parents for example the clothes. So the parents have to be informed about the latest products for their children. It means that the consumers have to knoe which products are for their children and where you can buy it. 
another negative aspect is that the children might think if they see the advertisments they don't have good parents who buy them just boring stuff. When they see the latest Playmobil modell the only thought they have is "I want it" but the next Playmobil modell will be released in 2 weeks and the they want this. So for the parents its don' even possible to buy all things for their children.
My opinion is that the television advertising should be in the evening or in the late afternoon, so the parents see this advertises and the children don't get influenced, so the children can get new products but they don't want the latest of everything.
