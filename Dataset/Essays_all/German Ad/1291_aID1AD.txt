Generally in the 21st century, in this technological century, is a lot of advertisement on TV or on PC (or other devices). The advertisement´s task is to motivate the consumer to buy the pruduct. 
But not only mid- aged people see these advertisements, everybody can see them and can react different to them.
So for example an older woman could be motivated to buy the product, so the advertisement reaches the goal of it´s task, or she could ignore it. But when an for axample a younger boy or girl watched the advertisements, they would´nt see these advertisements, they´d see something different because of their age, they would´nt understand the advertisements as we do. For us an advertisement is just sometimes an annoying message from a store to buy some products in there, but smaller kids just see humans or fruits ( or any different products). 
Smaller kids get "infected" with new behaviours they see on a screen. Kids in generally are´nt resistent against behaviour- changing trends or advertisements like social media, you can see that the younger peaople are more respectless than the younger people from the generation of 2000. So they reflect these new behaviours they learn on screen. So it´s not only advertisments´ fault that they´re like that, but advertisements have a small percentage of these 100%. Young people wont go out to play with friends like we´ve done, they sit inside and watch TV or You Tube ( or any other social media device). They get confronted with it very strong. 
I completely agree with the statement, the times have changed, new "trends" got injecteted in our community, maybe life changing ones. It´s not only the advertisements fault, but it takes part of it.
