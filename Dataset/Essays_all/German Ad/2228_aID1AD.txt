The statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is a difficult one. 
Big companys are saying that the young childs often have not their own money for free use, it is usally in the hands of the parents, so they can not buy anything showing in advertisment. But why big toy companys are producing advertisment for millions of dollars directed towards young childs , if there is not any benefit for them. Children, espcially younger children, often have their parents in their hands, they can whishing anything and they are getting it. So the young kids are not having the money and buying the products directly, but they often get this trough their parents. One can say that every other age class gets advertisment, why young children, aged two to five, should not getting advertisment. It is a simple answer: These young kids are in the middle of the development  of their own personality, favours and character, so it should not be allowed to manipulate them with the advertisment.
I am agreeing with the the statement mainly as a result of the last point, because it is not okay to interfere with the development of the young childs. They needing these development to become a teenager with no greater problems resulting of manipulation by the advertisment of the big toy companys.
