I would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation. But it is not that easy, you need to check many other factors which influents opinions. 
One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation. If they watching theese ads theyre just like "Oh mama i want this". They dont think about specific stategies which companys could use to make the people buy their products. Another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents. They decide it. But there may be parents do everything for their children. And really mean everything. But in my opinion thats part of our economic system. Everbody need comercial at least someone who has an company. Whitout advertation its very difficult to get new customers. But there is not just the company lead ads. There is oral propaganda too.
