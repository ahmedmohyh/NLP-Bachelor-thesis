In the following essay I have to answer the question, if television advertising shouldn't be allowed to young children. 
I agree to the statement, because young children are way to manipulative to get advertising directly towards them. In my opinion the advertising which are ment to be for the children are too aggressive towards them because they often say that they have to get that thing. Children don't have the control to say no when things around them like ads repeat they have to need that one thing now or they will be less cooler than others. 
A other reason why I think they shouldn't be allowed is that many children go to their parents and say that they need it until the parents get sick of them for only want this one thing. 
Mostly the advertisings are about games and dolls or things like this but often the things are useless and only for consuming. I also think that children are too poor to get robbed without knowing it by big companys who only want to make money also when their parents buy that things for them. I think that children shouldn't get advertising but more shows where they can learn something from without any ads between them because it has more perspectives for the young children. There are things on the market which are good for children and where they can learn from but mostly they don't get enough advertisings because of all the other hyped things which get more ads in the television.
