The topic of advertising in the tv to young children is difficult. Children shouldn´t watch tv often in that age, that´s clearly. For the concerns it´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it, they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it. But it´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit. Maybe it isn´t wrong to start in a young age with that things. So the children may know what will happend in an older age. Everyone is controlled by the media, at all in the digitalized (like tv or radio) and in the undigitalized way (like newspaper).
Finally I agree with the statement.
I think that shouldn´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem. They should not controle by the media so early.
