Kids in this age can´t buy everything what they see on the tv, but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it. 
Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isn´t everything real what they see on tv.
 But I think children are very easy to manipulate, so on some tv channels for children there isn´t television advertising. For example the german tv channel 'KIKA'. 
Also children don´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up. Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see. For example they see on the tv that you are cooler if you eat 'Fruchtzwerge', children want to have 'Fruchtzwerge'. 
In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.
So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.
But companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising, so it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children.
