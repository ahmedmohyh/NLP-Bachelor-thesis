In the following essay I'm going to discuss the statement that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising content to children below 5 years of age.
If you look at the statement, you can see that it only means "television advertising". The most advertises are related to the content that is sent between those advertises, so in a show for young children there won't be a car advertise for example. The people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content so they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things.
If you look at the financial part, the tv channels also have to make some money to run their business and the content shown. 
If I combine those facts and if the advertising content shown to the children is nothing harmful, my opinion of showing television ads to younger people is that they are okay in a way of financing the channel. But I also think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like, they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford. They shouldn't be teached to that much consuming like it's often shown on the television, but it's not that bad if they don't see too much tv and advertising at all. 
So if their parents are sitting right beside them and are also looking at the stuff their children watch, the tv can be switched off when an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising. But they should keep in mind that if they don't watch it between the ages of 2 and 5, they might watch it after that, and for sure parents can't keep an eye on everything their children see; the modern world is just too full of that, not even on tv but also at the streets, radio or newspapers.
