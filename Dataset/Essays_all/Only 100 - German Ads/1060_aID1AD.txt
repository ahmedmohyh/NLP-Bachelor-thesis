In the following essay we are going to discuss the statement, whether it should be allowed to show television advertisment, which are focused on children between two and five years old or not.

On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children. They usually don't read newspaper or magazines, so they can see things from the televeision.
But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them. The brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult. They believe almost everything. Children can also be influenced more easily by different things. If you tell a child that Santa Clause exists, it will believe. But an adult knows that it is not true. They also do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have.     

In my opinion it should be not allowed to show TV advertisments for children between two and five. They see something colourful, beautiful, etc. and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world. They will annoy their parents to buy this thing. TV ads are just made to manipulate a child's brain, because of the straightforward thinking. In todays' life it is very difficult to keep children away from electronic media. Because everyone has a TV or something similar in his home. So the advertisment companies use this as an advantage and manipulate a child's brain.
