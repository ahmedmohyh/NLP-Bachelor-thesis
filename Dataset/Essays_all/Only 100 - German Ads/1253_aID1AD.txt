If the children for example watch televsion for one hour a day they dont really get much information about that, but if they watch very often television they can do bad things with the wrong knowledge. Also it is important which series or canal they watch because every programm had other content to "get" the people to watch it. Would the programms show the children important stuff for the whole life like school knowledge then they would do very good work, but with series which only show stupid people who do some activitie like hiting a other person and then laugh about it or something like this, then can the children do this at home and dont know its wrong to do that. 
I dont really agree or disagree with this statement, because too many factors are to punish this statemant and to much situations which say its good or bad.
