Now i will discuss, if television adversiting directed toward young children should not be allowed. 
Today there is a television in each family and the parents and the adults in the family are watching tv. Children in the age between two and five spent almost all there time after the kindergarden with his mother or father. In the evening adults often watch tv and if the children are not going to bed so early, they are sometimes watching tv with their parents. 
In the programm for adults the tv often adverts direct to the audience, but today also the kids channel do that. The children maybe see a new toy and happy children says that it is so cool. Every child would want the toy. That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy. A nother probolem is that often the "Werbung" manipulates the audience. For example Playmobil: There is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act. It can spy fire or is flying in the clouds. In the reality that is not possible, but younger children would trust the television and think it is real. THen when they get the new playmobil dragon and want to the it spying fire, they are sad becaus they thought it works.

I agree with the statement because i think if young children are watching tv, the television should not adverts direct toward to the chidren.
