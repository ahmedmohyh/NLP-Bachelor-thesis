In our technical world the television in a big part of our life. Espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media. So is it a good idea to confront this young children already in this age with Television advertising?

As in verios studies proven young children get more influenced by any kind of adverting than young adults or older people. These young children are very naive and so it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the TV. Also would a children try to buy everything, which is showen in the TV, because they just want to have everything. And this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no. to. For example when the children wants to buy a knife.

But as alreday mentioned before we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising. Because it is such an important skill it is important that the next generation lears this skill very fast. And there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time. 

Of cause some content is just not right for children like zigarets, alkohol or other kinds of violent games. These advertisements should not be allowed to see in the Television befor eight at night. 

So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed. But advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the TV they would see it in the streets, radio and big city. So for me banning direct advertisement is not the right way.
