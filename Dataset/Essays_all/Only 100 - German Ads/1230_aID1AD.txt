Television advertisment is, as long as you have a TV a part of your life and almost evreywhere.
but should even young children be targeted by television already at the age of two to five?
well at first it must be said that the channel itself has the right to show anything they want as long as it's legal and so people who don't want their children to see advertisments can decide themselves whether they want to switch the channel.
furthermore it can help young childen develloping interest if they see things they like and they can start up their own opinion.
but there's also many reason's it shouldn't be legal.
children at a young age aren't independent and get influenced very fast, so they think about the things they will see in the advertisment but only want to have them.
after this the parents have to tell them that they can't have the things because they don't really need them, which the children won't understand, putting the parents under a big pressure.
to sum up I think that it shouldn't be allowed to direct ads to small children because they get influenced way too fast and then set their parents under pressure to buy them things they don't need.
