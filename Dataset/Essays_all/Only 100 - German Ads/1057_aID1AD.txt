For first it should be said, that a directive like this propably never will happen to the television, because would get´s more and more digital.
But thinking of the consequenses of some kind of Television this might be a good way to keep that kind of stuff away form this young children. For example Psychomovies ore Some Thrillers or Actionmovies. This basically has nothing to do with the normal programm young children watch today, but if they get used to watch TV every days since they are maybe 3 years old they might start watching this kind of movie ways earlier then they should. Another problem could be that this children might have some problems to make friends later bcause they are so used to watch TV all the day that they maybe keep doing this when
 the´re already in school. Even there school grades would be a problem if they are just watching TV all day on regular basis, and do not learn vokabularies or for some class test´s.
On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age. For exapmle there are several knowlegde shows for kids on TV they can watch to learn a bit more about the world and some other things that might be interesting for them. This is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing. 

In my opinion there is no way that the gouvernment ore anyone else then the parents can say how much and when there children are allowed to watch TV. I  do think that there are to many children watching allot to much TV nowerdays but as I said, the important thing is to show the maybe futural parents what could happen if they do not handle this problem. But according to the specific statement from the adversiting i say no it should be allowed, because if the parent regulate the TV usage of there children right it has allot of advantages for there further live.
