In the past few weeks many people especially parents care about one big problem. They criticize the use of television advertising directed toward young children. But does this topic really brings this much problems or is it not even bad?
On the one hand adverts towards young children is a great oppotunity for the concerns. The kids have a strong will and the parents want to do them a favor and buy the products. But on the other hand children can hardly understand what it means to buy something. They do not understand what money means. If the parents don´t have the money or even just do not want to spend it it comes to argues between the parents and their children.
Another argument for the use of advertising toward young children is that they can decide what they want and that they learn fast that there are many toys but they can not have all of them. They learn to understand what it means to get something they want to have. 
The concerns set themselves on an higher level than the parents. If a mother does not want their children to know this toy she has to forbid them to watch TV.
Furthermore the shops just use the kids. Surely they know all this points but they just ignore them because they want to sell as many things as possible.
To sum up this topic really is a problem. On the one hand you cand understand the shops that want to make money but on the other hand you have the parents that just want to protect their small children. And I can totally agree with the parents and the statement on the top. It can not be respected that the children can see anything even if their parents don´t want to.
