We live in the 21th century, the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important. The next generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing. But is this right? In the following text I will discuss the thesis, if television advertising directred toward young children should be or not be allowed.

If we'd go 50 years back in the past, we would see that kids and young adults had more complications to look up things. They had to go to a library to look up informations. Also for young aged children it could be helpful. in the past and also in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks. The coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid. Apps are a good example for that. There are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things, that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games.

But do we need that? Do a children in the age of 2-5 need media or apps to get something in his or her mind? Just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it, they played outside and had toys to understand some first easy things. Also social contacts are very important, VOR ALLEM when youre a young kid. The first steps are important to know how you deal with your social area (family,friends).

I agree with the statement, that television should not be allowed toward young children. Sure, the media brings new oppurtunities and easier ways to bring something in the mind of somebody with it, but I do not think that a e.g 2-years old children need media to understand the first things of life. It is more important that it can get the first social contacts, can go outside and play with other kids.
