In the following text, I will discuss the controverse theme if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
On one hand it´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five can´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it. I think children maybe don´t want advertising that is directed toward them. The children aged two to five are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being directed toward them.
On the other hand you could say that it´s good to direct the advertising toward young children even if they can´t say if they want to do that, because it´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children. It´s also important for the television advertising to do that.
All in all I think the statement is correct even though it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children.
