Concerning the question whether there should be television advertisement directed towards young children personally believe that they should not be made. This is due to the fact that young children are not yet able to tell apart between an advertisement and reality. This problem has already been adressed in the film and gaming industry for example by introducing age restrictions. While the problem in advertisement is not mature content it can still cause problems. This is due to the nature of advertisement especially that which is directed towards young children. Those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is while also giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have. While an adult knows that the things depicted in an ad are only big exaggerations of the truth a child might think of them as true. This is simply because of a childs nature of still having lots of fantasy which only adds onto the graphics shown in the ad. Companies of course know these things as well which is the reason for creation of such ads in the first place meaning they willingly exploit the childrens fantasy for personal profit. Lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves.

To sum up I would say that adds for young children should be prohibited from being played on TV as they exploit the missing characteristics in children to make them want to have things. The reason why this is especially important for TV adds is the fact that the medium of television allows creators to manipulate children into thinking a toy has way more abilities then it has in reality.
