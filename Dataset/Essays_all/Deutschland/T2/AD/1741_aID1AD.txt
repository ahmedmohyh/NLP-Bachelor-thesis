Before I take position in this particular case I want to emphasize my liberalism that is based to a certain degree on the theory of freem from John Stuart Mill who said that the only reason that one man or mankind is allowed to intervention in one man's or a group's doing is to protect itself.
Either side whether you agree or disagree do make very good points. By producing commercial for young children they get used to our theories of economy especially capitalism because children are the consumers of tomorrow, they learn that there are maybe some things they want to have but therefore the have to learn how to deal with labor and with money (those lessons are most times learned during their teenage phases). But many people will disagree and say that we should not show our children these highly accepted (role) models of our society, espicially leftist will hardly oppose of calling young children consumers (of tomorrow) because the leftifts might think children were naive. Those people do not want their children to see this role model for society because it is not quiet reality but when you think of the stories the generations before had been listening every eveing in the bed, those stories have not been quiet "realistic" and it might be good this way to give your children the immage of a better world a better future than we live in today and that is why those movies and TV shows for kids show us a different world that wants to encourage children to use their creativity and immagination but these movies have to be worth their production costs so that they have to show commercial.
By forbidding commercial that directs toward young children you enable these young human beings to develop their own position towards the advertised products and you enable these young human beings to speak for themselves. I personaly think many people are not aware of how reflected and strong these young human beings are.
