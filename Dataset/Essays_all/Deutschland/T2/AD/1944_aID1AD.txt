"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." 
That is the oppinionon of many worried parents desperatly trying to raise their child to the perfect young adult they always dreamt of it would be. But what are they really that afraid of? 

They proclaim that cruel comanies from all over the globe try to ivade the brains of their children and spark the firely desire to posess the advertised product. The TV spots are immature, unrealistic and of course harmful to the children's mentality. 
That or and many other similar points of view is probably what drives the most worried parents- But why?

From the economic point of view, for the TV station is is necessary to air advertisement to finance their shows and even the station itself. Also for teh companies producing products for children it is important for their success, not to ... the parents, but the children who eventually will actually use it. 

But let's be honest. None of the arguments above really matter. The problem it self doesn't matter. 
First of all it is the parents themself who allow their children to watch TV knowing well there is going to be TV spots trying to sell something to their kids. But thats only one part- A lot of times I see parents just letting theri kids sit in front of the television instead of actually spending time with them. 

I think it is kind of stupid accuse companies of airing inappropriate TV spots, when you can just turn of the TV or forbid the children to watch Tv. And there lies the problem. The problem is not thst there are TV spots for children, but that parents just let their children watch Tv.
