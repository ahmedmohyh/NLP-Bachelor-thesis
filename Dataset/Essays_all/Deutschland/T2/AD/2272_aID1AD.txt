If television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not allowed is a very controvers topic, which gained more and more meaning over the last years.

There are many things children of the age of two to five are not able to understand, yet. The most advertisments for children this young might be more for food and toys. With this comes a problem for all the parents. Kids, that see an advertisement do not look for the food itself, they will look for the sound and the colours of the advertisment, and the most advertisments are not about healthy food. 
Also advertisments for other shows on the channel might be not a good thing. It will happen that they want to watch one show after the other. If they see what cool looking show will come after the show they just watched they do not want to quit, and kis should defenetly not sitting in front of the TV the whole day.
For companies this might be a good marketing strategy, even if the children can not buy anything by themselv. Kids will see their food advertisments and if they like it, they will beg their mothers to buy it. And everybody knows how pickheaded a little child can be.
It might also cause an unrealistic way to think about money and its meaning.
For them kids are way more easier to influence than adults or teenagers. 

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children is not a good thing. 
I rather want my kids playing outside, where they will hurt themselve from time to time than getting this brainwashed. Many parents underestimate the influence a TV and advertising can have for a child. 
And as a parent I would not like to have always a fight with my children over what food they would like to eat. I would want them to grow up healthy and raised by someone who knew what he is talking about and not by what they have seen at the TV.
Sadly advertising directed toward young children is already a thing, which is not regonized by too many parents.
