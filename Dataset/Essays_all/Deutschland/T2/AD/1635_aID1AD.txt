Today nearly nobody can spend without watching television. Sadly, parents sit their young children in front a TV, that they can do other things and must not care for their children. But is this the wright way to deal with the short freetime, you have, if you are parents?

On the one hand it maybe solve the problem for the parents, that their children is not silent or is getting on their nervs, while they have to do the household or work.

But on the other hand it is not okay, to sit a young child in front of a televison channel for adults, this can build a trauma in the mind of the child.Some parents do not care about what is on the televion, tehy only want silence for a time.

Eventhough parents show their children channels for kids, it should be a solution for more than an hour. Although some series try to teach the children speaking, but you can not compare it with the social contact to the parents,other family members,...  

In the future these children lose the ability to deal with social conflicts and all in all to know new people, they are not so educated and have it harder to get a good education, because they had no good skills, you need for it.

In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because the rate for risk and danger is much higher than for the positive aspects. And I think, the government should make a law, which forbid it. These children will be the future for humanity and the whole planet.
