In our todays society many young children watch television and most of the parents did not see any problems or complications in the later life of the children, but is the television and in addition to that television advertising directed to young children good for their evolution and shoud it be allowed?
In my opinion the children in the age of two to five get very much influence and in particular advertising via the television they get as much influence as possible. Futhermore the light of a television is very bad for the eyes and the brain and there could be problems in the future life of the children when they for example watch tv the whole day. On the one hand the parents can put their childs infront of the television and they are happy because all of them are quiet.
But one the other hand is not it the job of parents to play with their kids and have fun with them. A child should be a big dream and not a thing to get some money from the state. You should love your child and you should love to take you time for just your child. When the children get influenced by the advertising, they always have a wish they want to play with and maybe when there is a very good markded toy the young people oftener want to play with bit instead of watching television. 
In my opinion it should not be allowed to stream advertising in television directed toward young children in the age of two to five, because so young people get influenced very fast without doing something. But it would be much easier to turn the television off, go outside and for example climb the trees, than to discuss wheather it should be allowed to direct advertising towards young people or not.
