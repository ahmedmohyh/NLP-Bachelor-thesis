Nowadays the world is full of modern techniques, smartphones or computers which make everything easier the people think. So it´s nothing special when you see a small boy playing on his smartphone the whole day anyway he´s not even in high school. I don´t think that this is something normal because it´s much to early for using smartphones in such a young age.
So in my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children shold not be allowed. 
Of course the young kids grow up with this modern communication, smartphones and televison like the generation before grew up with something else which was typical in their time. Another poinjt is that they will get used of all these computers and smartphones anyway only a few years later.  
Despite I think that the age of two to five is much too early to watch TV. It´s really bad for their concentration. This is something adult people realize twhen they use their smartphone for example. The time runs and you don´t really realize that while chatting or srcolling through facebook. The concentration suffers a lot with all the social media. 
Especially young children are still developing also in their head and watching several TV series with funny characters isnt´t really helpful in this time. 
Of course some stuff in TV they can learn something from won´t be that bad and maybe they understand it a little bit better because of pictures, noises or special characters. The problem is that children from two to five aren´t even able to read in this age so they start watching TV before they are able to read a book.
I think that children should be able to read before they start watching TV so that the television doesn´t even need to produce a programm for young children from two to five.
