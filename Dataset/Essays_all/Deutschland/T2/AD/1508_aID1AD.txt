We all know the doll, racer or horse advertisements on television. Now exactly these adverts to young children are controversely discussed in society.

One uncritisised fact is that parents get problems on their weekly shopping tours after their child has seen the new pink Barbie doll on television. What follows is crying in the supermarket... the conclusion: sad children and angry and helpless parents or a happy child and poorer and frustrated parents. A child of this age can not think about its wishes and their pros and cons. They want it all and they want it now - no matter what it costs. And this is the aim of it, isn´t it? Those firms could address the childrens parents instead, persuade them to buy these toys for their children. But they don´t. That would mean less profit in most cases.
But isn´t it the parents` own fault? If they did not let their children watch TV, these kids would not see any advertisement that raises their wishes of new toys and games. But let us be realistic; it is not possible to keep your children isolated from all TV influences until they go to school. It is not in their parents control what they do when they are with friends or in the kindergarden.

So to draw a conclusion I can say that the aim of TV advertisements directed toward young children is to make more profit by raising the childrens wishes and force their parents to buy the advertised toy or game. This is why I think that it should be forbidden. It is unfair trying to raise one´s profit by using the relationship between parent and child than just try to convince the parents with the product itself.
