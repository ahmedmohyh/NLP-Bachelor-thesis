It´s a comlplicated question. You have to look at the different shows, which are shown in the television. On the one hand they are shows, who are very bad for young childrens like ''Teletubbies'' or something like that. This interrepted the education for the young childrens. This shows have bad follows for the kids. That shouldn't be allowed for them. But on the other hand they are shows to learn about different languages or about different cultures in the world. When the parents show the kids something like that, the kids have a good start in the life for the school for example. When they are looking bzw. hearing music or playing games on the television, the concentration of the childrens could be better and so they are preperated for the future. 
So you can give a easy answer to the question, if television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed. When the parents show the kids learnvideos or music on the TV, there aren't any resaons to not allowed it. But when the parents take the TV for shows, who have bad follows for the kids, it should not be allowed. Or the other way have to cancel the TV programs, which make the bad shows.
