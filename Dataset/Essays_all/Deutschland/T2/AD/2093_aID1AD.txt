Television advertising directed to young children is a complicated theme. Some people say that the children are influenced in a wronge way and the advertising isn't good for them. Other Opinions are that the children don't watch television anyway because it make them stupid. Others say that isn't bad for them because they don't understand what they watch on the TV. So what is better for them ? I would say it isn't good that young children watch TV because they are in a age where you have to play with other kids or play in the nature. Added to that adults and older children also get influence by the television advertisment. But when a children watch TV the advertisment isn't the bad thing they get influence. So when you try to make the TV more helpful for the children you must change something by the series or film the watch. The series and films are most of the time some stupid stories without a moral or senes in it. You also have the advertisment everywhere in citys. So can't you go outside anymore because your children can maybe get influence?
I wouldn't say so. It is the job of the parents that the children see not the advertisment. They should see the important things. 
In the end I would say that television advertising isn't the best one for our children but you can't change something and you must help your children that they see the other things in the world.
