It is the time of media of all sorts and forms. Young children grow up with it and are influenced by it every day. There is specific advertising for products that is made for young children. A question is, if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
 
The first argument against this is, that is good for the companies selling these products. They have young people who grow up with this advertising for these producs and who really want to have it and play with it. When they grow up with it and make many memories with these toys they may buy it for their own children, when the are grown-ups. 
Another argument is that many parents cannot say no to their off-spring and often buy everything they want to have. A further plus for the companies. 
Young children are influenced nearly everywhere they go. Many toddlers do own smartphones or tablets and are confronted with advertising. So why should it be forbidden on television?
A third argument is that it is part of our society and capitalism to earn as much money as possible so it is ok to use everybody.

The first argument for this statement, that young children in the ages from two to five years should not be influenced already, is that tehy do not understand completely what they see and what they should do with this information. It is too much for their young brains. 
A seciond argument is that companies are using these children and their parents to make more money. Of course people are always used when it comes to advertising but this should not be done to young children because they do not have their own money and do not know how to use it in the few cases they alreay have money.
In this society it is important that you have money, because only then you have power so people start using the most naive and innocent part of the community and this is not ok.

To conclude, it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children.
