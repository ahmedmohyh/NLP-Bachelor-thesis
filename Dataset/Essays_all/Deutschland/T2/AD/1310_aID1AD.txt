I think there are other things in this age they are much more important for children. In todays society there are much problems with the speaking, learning and having frinds. I thing one reasons why in the society came up this problems is to much Television. Children have to play with other children. They have to play in the forrest, playground or somewhere else they find somothing to have fun. But I think the importenest is to play with frinds and have conversations, connections and contact with other persons. You suggest children what is important in life. If a big part is Television they add this meaning. But Television is something you do not need another persons. There is no conversation, no connection or contact. In the age of two to five it is important to learn from other, they add reactions, how to deal with others and how to live. Television do not show the right way. There are so much  uniteresting details. But I thing you can not change the problems when you say Television is not allowed. First think about an five years old children. On his sixt birthday, what would you think  is the first thing the children want to do? Yes, Television. Something which is not allowed are much more interesting than others. The following is that wanting the Television grow and grow whit every day the child are not allowed and others are allowed. Another big problem are older sisters or brothers. The conflicts between them will also grow up. I think you can not say without Television there will be less problems. You have to think about wich role television should play in your childrens life. Parents who do not care about this would find other things wich could make problems in the life of they childrens. It is a different question but I think it should be allowed but less than it is used now adays.
