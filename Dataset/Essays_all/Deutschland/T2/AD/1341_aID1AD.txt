The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." is a sentence, i would discouss in the following.
Firstly i want to say that i think television is okay, but not to much, not the whole day. The childrends have to play in the nature, whoever where exactly. The forrest, the street, the garden, its not important where exactly they play but they have to play outside. I hate it when childrend are only inside and look tv ore relax the whole day. kids have to play outside and didnt watch tv the whole day. When its evening and they watch the sandman then its okay but i think young childrends arent alloud to watch much tv. Its important to find social contacts and learn things, and you could only learn this when you are with friends. In the television you can find much stupid things and worse series. Childrend coulndt notice if the series tells really things ore only stupid and unreall things. its very important to protect childrend for that, if not, then they will think that the television only tells good and really things. so i can comprimise with the statement, because i think its important to show chioldrend in this age how to play outside and have fun without television. but I although think that childrend are allow to watch tv, but only a bit and only the series which are for kids.
