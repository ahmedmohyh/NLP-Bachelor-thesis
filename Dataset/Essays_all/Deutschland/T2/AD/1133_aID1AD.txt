Today children are already confronted with the permanet influence of social media and technology at a very young age which seems to be a chance for companies to sell their products by using advertising in a clever way. That's why I'm going to discuss the following statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."

On the one hand there are arguments against such a law. For exemple one can say that permanent advertising is a part of our time today so that children have to learn how to handle it. Also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen - for example last week I saw a new car in the TV but I wasn't able to buy it because of a lack of money.
Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.
But on the other hand there are also arguments for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed. A law against it could be understood as resistance against the money-ruled society we have got today. Critics say that children have to be protected from this "bad world" to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way. They will become an adult fastly enough. For example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now I'm already confonted with the force of earning money next year - after leaving school - to become independent and live the life I want.
In addition parents might be happy about TV programm without advertising directed toward young children because they wouldn't suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in TV and cries now the whole time because his parents won't buy the mentioned car.

Especially because of the two last arguments I'm agains television advertisement for children.
