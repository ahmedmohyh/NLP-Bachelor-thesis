Nowadays everyone watches TV. It became normal that even young children watch TV and grow up with it. But there appears the question what does the TV show. It is not just about showing movies and series. There is also lots of advertising and some ads are directed toward young children. Now we have to think about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or should not be allowed. 
Allowing television ads that are directed toward young children would mean allowing companies manipulating young children for making them buy their products. The companies show their products in a way that gets the attention of children and makes them want to have their product. So the companies put their product in the head of young children for making the young kids ask their parents to buy it causing another argument against advertising directed toward young children: The parents lose much money. By making young kids want to have something the parents are going to be asked to buy these certain things and often the children convince their parents to buy them the things they want and parents also want to make their kids happy. Another appearing problem is that if the kids have this product they often play for maybe a week with it and then see another ad and want another product which leads t
To put it in a nutshell in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it has a big impact to the children and also makes lots of people lose much money.
