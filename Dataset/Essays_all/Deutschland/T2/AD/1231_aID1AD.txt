Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed? 
This is a really discussable topic with many different opinions.

I think in generel advertisment is just a marketing strategy to influence or force people to buy something. You can influence young children very well and I think this is a problem. Children live, even if they are young,under extrem high society pressure and the advertisments often lie or show these young children things they can`t have. Besides the parents can`t afford the things their children would like to have and think they are bad parents.  
Moreover, advertisments can show the young children new things and in their following life they see advertisments everywhere and every time. 

All in all you can say that advertising toward young children can leed to society pressure, but you can`t hide the children from advertisments, because advertisment is a part of our material society.I would like to add that it is really difficult to say to what age advertisments should not be allowed.
