In these days more and more young kids spend their freetime in front of a computer or television. By doing this, they are often confronted with a lot of advertising for toys or other things for kinds in their ages. But is in needed to broadcast ads for young children?
On one hand there is the argument that product for children should be placed in actions where kids are in, for example television. Why shouldn't it be allowed to make ads for Kids when they are the customers? It ist very simple: children are easy to infuence because they can not decide if they need this product or if the promises the ads do are possible ore just empty promises. But by watching these advertisings children also learn how to deal with the given informations. They learn not to trust everything they hear. This is one step for growing up. Further they learn slowly how to deal with money. If there is a product, which they are totally in, they have to save their money for buying the product some day. But sometimes this can go wrong. kids who get too much money from their parents don't learn this quality. They waste their money by buying the most (unnecessary) toys or other product just because  in the  adsvertising it seemed to be very cool.
In my opinion it is very diffficult to decide whether advertising in television for kids shouldn't be allowed or not. On one  hand they learn in their early years how to deal with advertising promises and saving their money for things that are more needed. On the other they are in a critical age where they easily get influenced by things in television and waste their money, because they can not handle the given information and promises. So if I  had to decide, I wouldn't allowe ads for kids.
