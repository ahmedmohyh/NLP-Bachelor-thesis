The topic of television advertising toward young children is a much discussed topic. In the following I will discuss this statement.


To begin with, TV advertisement should likely be allowed but also be supervisioned by the parents. If parents allow their little kids to watch TV, they can also watch the commercials. Nevertheless, parents should always control the amount of time their kids spend watching TV and set rules with them. Advertising toward children should not be forbidden but it is in the parents´hands to keep and eye on their kids.

Furthermore, allowing television advertising for little kids will lead to them growing up with a lot of media use. It is a lot more improtant though that they grow up with friends and play games and not only sit on the couch all day. Kids should rather participate in activities such as sports or clubs or even play with others. 

On the one hand, if television advertisement is allowed, children will probably not only sit in front of the TV a lot but will also get in touch with other media soon. This may help them to learn how to use those with early age. Since the use of media has taken a lot of influence on our society, this might help them a little to understand the function of it.

On the other hand, it is way too early to start watching TV and the TV advertisement already at the age of two. Such little childern should first start to speak and even start writing before watching TV and use other media. It will not be helpful for their developement and will probably lead them to become addicted from TV very early in life and this should be prevented by not allowing television advertising. 

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed toward young children aged two to five because it has negative influence on their developement and it is much more important for them to learn speaking, writing and even reading skills before watching TV advertisements.
