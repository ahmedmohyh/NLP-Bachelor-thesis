In the following essay i´m going to discuss if televiosion advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Against this statement is the fact that televison advertisment could influence the children on from a very young age. It would be more difficult for the partens to control the developemnet of their own children. It could interrupt or cause problems in the education of children because they start to want things that are advertised but which maybe don´t fulfill the wishes of the parents. 
In favour of this statement is the fact that it isn´t proofed that the influence is strong enough to effect the childrens development so the parents just have to be careful enough that their children dind´t go crazy in their "later life". 
Furthermore, the economic effections on stopping televison advertising toward young children could be drastic. It would interrupt the whole freedom of advertising products and with this the marketing companies would lost an oppurtunity to promote their products which can led to lower sellingnumbers. 
All in all, television advertising directed toward young children will stay a controversial topic because there a many reasons for and against. In my opinion it should be allowed because it´s a theme every single parent has to deal with on their own and decide what is best for the development of their child. The reason which led me to this opinion is mostly effected by the argument of the companies who sell products and whom would have taken away an opportunity to promote their products.
