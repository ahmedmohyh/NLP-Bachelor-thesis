The following essay refers to the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.". TV advertisement directed to young children is a very controversial topic.

I agree to the statement because exspecially young children are easy to impress. For example an andvertisement for a new toy could have a very big impact on the kids. It could be possible that they really want to have the toy advertised in the TV, because it impressed them and if they don´t get it they are very sad. Also it is possible that the cildren are going to be even more addicted to the TV because they like to see all the new things they could own. The third argument against TV advertising directed to young children would be the pressure for the parents. It means that the children are going to ask their parents to buy the things they saw in the advertisement. Now the parents are under a lot of pressure because they have to decide if they are going to buy the stuff of the advertisement or if they aren´t going to buy it. 

Summarizing I can say that TV advertising directed toward young children is a very controversial topic and it´s not easy to decide to allow or to not allow. But I definitely thing it would be better for young children and also for their parents if it would be forbidden.
