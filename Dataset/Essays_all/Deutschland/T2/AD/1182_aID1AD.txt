I would say the answer for this is very difficult.
First off all it seems to manipulate the young children, because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young children.This works because they don´t even think about the price and if they really need these things.
Nevertheless, these children aren´t allowed / can´t even buy these things by themselfe.
So in the end the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this. But when they don´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid. So in the end both, children and parents, are mad.
On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.
That is the normal reason to produce advertisings. It is the same aspect when you see some advertisings for adults, like an advertising for some good beer or a new video game. Also trailers of movies works like this - they have to make people interested in the topic of the movie.
Nevertheless, chilrden are much more open minded for advertisings, so it works much better with them instead of adults.
