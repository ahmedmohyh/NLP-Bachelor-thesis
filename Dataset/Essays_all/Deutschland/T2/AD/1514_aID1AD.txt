In the following text I analyse the state arguments for and against the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" and after that my own opinion.

Many people are convinced, that advertising might have a negative influence towards children. 
If it refers to children's advertising, the only harm which will follow, is that the parents might get annoyed by their children's wishes to get new things to play with. Moreover, earlier or later children are confronted with the consume of advertising in our society. Its necessary to remember: Children's advertising only shows some playthings, and that, very short. Maybe children are influnced to want to have what is shown in TV. But especially at this age they should learn that they could not get everything they want. If the parents want to prevent the contact between children and advertising, children cannot even leave the house, because we are surrounded by it. 

In general I think advertising for cildren is not very harmful. Firstly, its their parents challange to prepare them for becoming an adult. And as long as advertising is a part of our daily life, childrens should be teached to get along with it. In spite of preventing the contact between them and the advertising, I think it is better to teach them why it is shown in TV and that they cannot get everything they want. So I do not agree with the statement.
