Television is a very discused topic becsause it is important for all ages in the sosiety. In the past it was an importaned way on which the citizens could get information  about what happend in the world.
 But is it important that children use this media? In the age from two to five years children learned the basics about how they can interact in the sosiety in ower countrie. Children in this age could get manipulated very easely and the parents can not control what they are watching in the Television. 
 Also in Television there are so much topics disscoused which are not good for the growing of this age like newes or crime series. If the children learn how they can switch to another chanel they could watch news or horor movies an that is not very good for theyr growing. But there is also the other side because if they watch seires which they can learn somthing from it is a good thig.
 My opinion is more like the first arguments becuase i think it is better when the play outside or with theyr parents in the hopuse or arpartmened. I think they should go outside in the nature and learn it with own hands and boddy. Also if they are with the familie outside they lesrn how to interact with other children on a playground as example.
