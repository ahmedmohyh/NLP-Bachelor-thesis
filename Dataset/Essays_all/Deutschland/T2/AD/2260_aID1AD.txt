Should Television advertisments for young children be allowed?

When you are watching TV with your little five year old children, silbling or cousin you probebly might have heart them say:"Can I have that?". That is a common question in for children in this age because the advertisments on a TV channel made for children are perfectly desinged to make them want the advertised product. Based on the fact that it is way easier to make an advertisement for childern because they are not that experienced many adults want those to be banned.

One reason for that is that the Children could get persuaded by those advertisements and by things they usually did not need or even want just because they looked so cool in the television. When that happens they are kind of forced to buy something from their own money and do not even get happier from it.

But the advertisement industry also has a good argument, which is that the parents just should watch their children better so that they are not allowed to just simply buy everything they want but have to ask their parents first. That would solve thee problem that Children are not expierenced enough to know what they really want or what the advertisement tells them they want.

Another good reason to let them be allowed is that Children only learn to handle advertisements when they get confronted with them. This means that banning them for up to five year olds would make over five year old children be eán easier target.

To sum it up I would say that it is not usefull to bann those kind of advertisements because with the help of the parents they could teach a children how to handle advertisement for the rest of their lives.
