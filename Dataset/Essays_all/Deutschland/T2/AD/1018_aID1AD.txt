Chlidren form the age of two to five have not been able to develop their own charcter jet, that makes them an easy target for advertisement, because they are easy to influence. The Question now is, should advertisement directed to children, of the named age, not be allowed ? 


Children of the age from two to five are the future of the human society, which means that they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought, in the future, and the standards that will define our future society. Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.
The promblem with advertisement, which is directet to children, is that it does not aim for a better futer. The people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children. By trying to sell their products, they can set unrealistic standars of beauty or material things that children may want to own one day. The consequences of this can be depression, because nobody is happy with their body or with the stuff they own and they will simply be unhappy.
Children should have the chance to develop their own character as isolatet from advertisement as possible, so that they can find out for themselves, what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines.

Bacause of these given arguments I come to the conclusion, that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter.
