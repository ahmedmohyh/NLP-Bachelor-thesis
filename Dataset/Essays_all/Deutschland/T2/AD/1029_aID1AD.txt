Concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children, people have differnt opinions. Some are convinced they should not be allowed while others don't mind them. In the following, the statement will be evaluated.

On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television. Ads that are directed toward people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only. To keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects, it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch.
On the other hand, chidren aged two to five should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly. If parents are responsible with their childrens' time management, there is no need for TV companies to show ads directed toward them.
It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them. Having seen an interesting ad about a toy for example can have them begging for it. 
But actually, those children are not customers yet. They don't have a say in what their parents buy them. Therefore, advertising about toys and other childrens' products should also be directed toward parents, since they are potential customers - not the children themselves.

In conclusion, even though children are an important part of today's economy, they should not be confronted with advertsing directed toward them in public media.
