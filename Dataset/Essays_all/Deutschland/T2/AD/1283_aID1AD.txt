Our society uses television a lot. You rarely find a household where there isnt a tv. And we are also surrounded by advertising daily. One way to bring people things near is to place the product in breaks of tv shows. Almost every show is seperated in different parts and you can have 10 minutes of advertising till you can carry on watching. Some of these advertising may not be for children. They could not deal with some of the pictuers of the advertisement. But we have different channels for different ages. We have disneychannel for kids or some channels where you can only watch crimes, thrillers or documentaries. I think we have to keep an eye on what kind of advertisement is shown on which cannels. But my opinion is that we cant keep television advertising away from young children completly. If its no bad content it wont be bad for the children. My view is that all the television advertising for young children are also for the parents to get them to buy the products for their children. The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."  is a little over the top. Children get to see advertisements for their age anyway because there are more mediums than tv. They could also see that in magazines, on posters in front of the shoppingcentre or on the phone of their parents. So its useless to forbit television advertising for kids but we chould check their content and design.
