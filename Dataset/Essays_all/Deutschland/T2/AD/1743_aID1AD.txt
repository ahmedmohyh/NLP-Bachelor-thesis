In many families young children in the age of two to five are watching TV. The majority of them are watching advertisment during the movie break. 
But are advertisments a quite good influence of these young children?
First of all lot´s of people support the idea that children have to have as much influences as possible. So children learn  much things and can decide very early about many questions because of their knowledge. 
In this case parents have to explain the general using of advertisement to their kids. 
But it´s quite clear that children in the age of two to five can´t understand the using of advertisement. 
Furthermore young children connect the presented dream world in the advertising with their real life. On the one hand they aren´t confronted with the really hard real world and so they have the opportunity to live and think about the new created dream world.
On the other hand children can´t decide between the dream and the real world and sometimes their life is damaged.
Thge last point I´d like to mention is that young children wants to have all presented products in the advertisment. The famalies are confronted with a crying child who really wants to these products. Companies can easily influence children in this age because of their small knowledge. In this case companies sell more and more products.
