Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. 

There are many arguments that agree and disagree with  this statement. 

The advantages of  that are that the Television could show wrong information sometimes. The children maybe never wont get the right information  because no one is telling them right and the small children believe  in that. Another point is that the children will be  sitting in the house and watch Television all day long if they are allowed to it. Many children don´t go outside and play there if they can watch television. They learn that it is a nice action for their freetime. This wont be good for their future. Many children would watching television in their future and wont go outside and do  sports. This fact concerns that watching television all day long wouldnt be good for their healthyness. This is a reason why some children are getting fat which is quite unhealthy.
Also the contact to other people especially children could get lost if they are watching TV and  don´t go and play outside. These arguments are all because children wouldn´t find an end of watching TV if they are allowed to it.

On the other hand the children could learn something when they are watching television. There are many series also for young  children where they can  learn things like colors or the alphabet. 
In the modern society it is also important that the people can handle new and modern technologies. Especially for their future it is important that can handle it because it get more and more important in many  jobs. So it could also be a advantage if they grow up with it. 

In my opinion children should beallowed to watch television but they should new their borders. It´s important that they have the skills to handle  modern technologies but thex should go outside
