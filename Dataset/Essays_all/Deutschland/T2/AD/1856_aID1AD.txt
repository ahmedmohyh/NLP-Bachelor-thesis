Nowadays watching Tv is normal.Every child, also at an young age, is watching Tv.When they watching series or film which ar made for kids the topic of the media is made for kids and there are no points why theire shouldnt be allowed to watch them. Between series or Movieparts there normaly are breakes for advertising.In the afternoon and in the evening there are adds for every type of products. At some "Sender" there are no breaks for advertising. An example for that is "KiKa". Threre are no breakes,not even for something like puppy and so on. I think this is because Kids could be influenced easily by the clever marketing of the comanies. For Kids it is very importent to have an "peaceful" Childhood which is not influenced by adds.When young Kids see a lot of advertisments maybe they want to have all these "cool things from the TV" and then they are never happy with what they own. "TV-Sender" like Kika choose the right why for making TV for Kids but the mayority of the "TV-Sender" is presentinng advertisments all the time and for these its important to ssend adds so it must be allowed. The responsebility is by the parents for looking after their children and what they do or watch.
