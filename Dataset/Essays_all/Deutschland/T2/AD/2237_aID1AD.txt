The discussion whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not became more and more important within the years. One could say that it is nearly impossible to avoid advertising in the television and the only thing one could do is to quit watching TV. But is it really necessary? Young people get easier influenced for the reason that they are in their learning-phase which means that soak everything up that is told to them and reproduce it. Now if they watch too much TV it could have bad effects even on their later life. Some ads in the TV want their viewer so hard to buy their product that it sounds for a young child nearly as he or she has to do so. This leads to the fact that they get influenced so strong that they want to consume a lot even for example as a three year-old boy. This experience in ones childhood can make a child easy influenceable by advertising in their later life and make them spend a lot of their money to things they do not even need.
So in my opinion television advertising or advertising in general should nt be allowed towards young children because it has only bad effects on them.
