The topic whether telivsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed can be considered as very contreverse.
In our society is capitalism the leading cause to advertisment in television, newspaper or elsewhere. The big companies do not look at the negative effects they cause especially on young children. As a young child it is very easy to manipulate you because you do not own the ability to reflect yet. This leads for example to problems in later childhood and also teenage-time. Girls are shown perfect dolls with a unrealistic bodyproportion. Maybe they get trouble with their body in a higher age because of that. 
Also the advertisments show that dolls are for girls and for example cars are for boys. This causes misunderstanding later in the years. Our progressed society has no gender rols, so advertisment for children ought to stop teaching gender rols or stop showing at all.
Another problem is that the children learn in the youngest age of their life that consumption is important, because that is what advertisment shows. And if this person thinks its whole life that consumption is needed to be happy, this person will never have a fullfilled life.
Otherwise the parents can decide wheter their child is allowed to watch television or not. So they can regulate the impact advertisment does. In our society it is pretty normal to use media as a child, but there exsist so many options to watch movies and series on the television without be forced to watch advertisment, for example the payed movieplatform Netflix.
