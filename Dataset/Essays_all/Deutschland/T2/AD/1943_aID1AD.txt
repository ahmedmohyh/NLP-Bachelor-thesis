Everybody sees advertising. on the busstation, in the train or in the TV. advertising is the most boring part in the whole TV. But advertising toward young children is the worst advertising. Small kids who see this advertising  want this product advertised in the advertising. In the very first years of a child the kids learn from seeing what is in there world aroud. So they see the advertising and this product stays in their head. Advertising in television is a very bad instrument to get costumers, but the shows and the producers have to do this because their money comes from the advertising. just so they can stay on scene with teir shows. New ideas could just be made in reality because of advertising. Advertising is a bad thing. For all of the people they see this advertising.
But when I see this question I must ask myself "What is wrong with parents who let watch their children television. For me it is not clear why someone should do this. Children in this age should go outside with their parents and whatch the nature or go to the zoo. When you watch television you can not learn anything in this age. Also the advertising to this group of age is very agressiv. Children in this age have to speak with their parents or with others around. They should not wach television. And of cause not advertising.
To come to a conclusion, advertising towards small children should be abolished. But also it have to be forbidden that parents let their children watch television on a age of two to five.
