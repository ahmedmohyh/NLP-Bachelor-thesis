The advertising in the television is often directed to young children,because they are manipulatable. but many people think that especially for young children this should not be allowed. For the companies it is a big advantage to make advertising toward young people, because they often watch television and they want to have everything they see in the television. Although the children have not much money, the parents of them would do everything for their children to make them happy, so that means that they would buy it. The children could also remember the things from the television, when they are in a supermarket or something like this and then they want their parents to buy it too. However this could be callad manipulating. The companies use the behaviour of young people to sell more of their products. Another point is that children of that age, are not really able to think of what they see. THey do not know anything about it and older people would say that they do not need, but young children are manipulatable and can not re think their decisions. With that method the companies also make advertising for people, which leads to that other people buy something and spend their money, just because of the manipulating advertising toward other people. 
To put it into a nutshell, I think that this kind of advertising should not be allowed, because young children do not know what is good for them and you can easy manipulate them.
