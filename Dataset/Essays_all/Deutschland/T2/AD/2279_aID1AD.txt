In the following I am going to analyse whether televison advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. 
In this time televison advertising plays a big role in our community.In young ages children were confrontated with televison advertising, although they often understand nothing.A big disadvantage is that children were often manipulated with televison advertising. When they see a product in the televison they often wanted to have these products for christmas or as a birthday present. As a result they often get angry when they do not get these products. Furthermore the parents have to pay a lot of money for some of these products because they wanted to make their own children happy and not sad.
On the other hand televison advertising could be an inspiration for the children. Maybe the parents have not enouhgh money for these products but the children and the parents find together a solution to get an other product. Instead of buying a playhouse you could biuld one yourself or you can buy a fottbal with no brand instead of a football of Adidas.
In my opinion Televison advertising should not be allowed for young children. Children need to form their own creativity and should not be able to buy some expensive things. Young children should not be able to watch to TV that long.Furthermore they should only watch children TV channels where advertising plays not a big role. In my youth I was confrontated with television advertising and also wanted to have the cryziest things which often were very expensive. Today I am glad that my parents did not buy me everything.
