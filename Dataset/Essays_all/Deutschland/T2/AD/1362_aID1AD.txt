Nowadays we live in a society in which the most of us have a TV. When you watch a film, TV show ect. every single break between it you can see advertising about erverything. On childrens programms as well. 

Televisoin advertising on children programms show most of the time new play stuff like toy cars, games or Barbies. When I was younger I always want to have new things because the companys, that sell these things show, do these advertising on purpose: They want to get higher sold rates. With good ideas they influence the children during they watch their favorite series. They used special effects, specific colors or characters to get more attention. They set their products in a perfect "light". 
Young children are more influenced by it than older children because older kids have the knowlegde that they can´t get everything and accept it easiler than younger ones. They always want to have new play stuff and with advertising their consume will increase more than before.
Some people want that those advertising should not be allowed. But then want do you want to show childrens? TV programms earn money from companys for showing their advertising. And you don´t want to have advertising of new soap  or not for their age (alcohol etc.).

I doesn´t agree with this statment because I think you should look for younger children when they watch TV. The point is you have to switch the programm or talk to them during those periods when you don´t want that your child is influenced by it. Another reason is that TV programms don´t cut advertising out that easy. They were paid for it. And it doesn´t disturb me at all because when I was younger I learned that I can not get everything on TV and after time I got bored of advertising until now.
