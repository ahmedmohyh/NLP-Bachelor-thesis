I think to say if it should be allowed or not depends on the commercial. For example some commercialspots are really creative and should be allowed on the other hand some spots are to influencing towards the children should not.
For example if the commercial make it seem that you have to have the subjekt and can not life without it. This is dangerous especially for young children because they believe things like that alot easyer than adults which is obvious. But i think you can not disallow them because tv is for everyone. 

To come back to my first point, pointing out the creative tv spots and with that i mean for example something usefull or real fun for the children. I remember for example the spots for a summercap which in my oppininon is still cool. Of course maybe they also use some unreal facts to make the camp seem cooler but that is ok in my oppininon.
Another example are the LEGO commercials because in their spots no one tells you that you need their products to have fun and they do not show anything wrong about their products to make them seem cooler.

So in my oppininon you can not really disallow television advertising for young children because it is a bussines for me the parents have to decide if their child should watch commercials and if so, they are the ones who should explain their child how advertising works.
