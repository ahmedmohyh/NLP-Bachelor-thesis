In the following text I will bring arguments for and against television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five years). At the end i will say my own opinion on this theme. 

The first thing I can say is, that it's important to know what advertisments are meant.  Some ads for cereals or ads for toys (as example). If its the right ad, maybe the kid will have more fun because it didnt even know that something like that existed and than the parents can buy it and get the child a better life. 

The Problem here is that,  when the child see something that it want and theen thee parents dont buy it, it will be unhappy, also if friends have the thing fromt the ad but the parents are not rich enough to buy it and they kid cant have it.

Another points against ads for young children is, that they cant see whats realistic and good and whats bad. Its very easyto cahnge the opinion or the view of a kid that is so young and companys or partys could use this to change the view of the kid in there use.

A goood point for the ads is that childrencan learn that u cant trust everything you see and need to be critical. Parents could  teach the kids that not every ad say the truth. 

With ads for young children children could be maipulated very easy and thats not good in my opinion. But thats not a question of allowed or not allowed, the companys wanna make profit and thats not there fault. THe capitalisim force them to try to make profit. In my opinion its the foul of the parents to let there childen watch tv. Without it would be no problem or question of allowed opr not allowed, because the children wouldnt even watch them. But many parents didnt know what to do with there children and just let them watch tv and get dumb because its easier for them letting the children watch tv instead of doing something together with the children.
