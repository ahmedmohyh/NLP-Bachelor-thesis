The amount of TV-advertising increased throughout the last years and still increases. Even channels for children are full of advertisement for toys and other products for toddlers. 
Should these advertisements directed toward very young children be prohibited?
Due to the digital age and modern family structures, young children tend to spend a lot of time watching television. When I was young, for instance, I was usually allowed to watch television at the weekend only, whereas nowadays my younger brother can watch his favourite TV-show every day. This negative trend should not be encouraged by advertisements for childrten aged two to five. Furthermore, young toddlers are too easy to manipulate and take the advertisement-promises for granted, as they are not yet able to question the credibility of advertisements. 
On the other hand, there are many companies selling only products for young children, like "Playmobile". They must be allowed to advertise for their products, otherwise they would have a great disadvantage compared to other companies. 
Moreover, advertisinng agencies should be able to decide on the target group of their advertisment. It is simply not acceptable to deprive them of their freedom of choice.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children must not be forbidden, because every company has to sell their products, thus it is indeed appropriate to advertise for products on TV-channels, which are popular among children.
