While you look Televison, you often see advertising between your program. The advertising is about differint things und should influencesequences of that? First of all in my opinion a young children who is only two years old, should not watch TV that often and they  the people to buy the products and to convince them of their new product. 
But is it okay, if an advertising is directed toward young children who are between two and five? And what could be the problems and coneven shouldn`t watch programs with advertisments, because there are even programs for children which are without any advertising. But after that children are much more easier to influnce than older people who should know what is real or who should know which advertisment they can trust. Young people always want the products or the toys they see in Televison and they believe in everything they see in TV because they can´t know that the people who designed this advertisment only want to sell their products as good as they can. This methode is only good for the people who desined it or for the people who get their money with this advertising because they maybe get more money because the parents buy the stuff for their children because they don´t want that their children are sad. 
To conclude I would say that children should not watch TV that often and because of this they don´t see the advertising, but in my opinion it isn´t a good solution if you don´t allow this advertising because many people get their money with this job and in the end it is always the decision of the parents if they buy the things to their children. Everybody can decide on their own because everybody has his own opinon which shuld be accepted.
