It would be hard to classify the advetisement. Is it for children aged two to five or for older kids? The companys sponsering the ads could just claim that they´re not aiming for the younger children. But it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate.
For companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge disadvantage if they can´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them. 
On the other side are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys, sweets, etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents. Using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad.
I think it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children because they are innocent. They cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it. This effect can be used to advert something with a lot of coulor and shining. But the two to five year olds dont know that the ad just wants them to buy things. Advertisement for adult people is oaky, they know the sence of an ad.
