I think it should not be banned from the television. It should be more controlled not banned. For example they could make a maximum of minutes advertisements for children can be showen on a channel per day. Or you could set a time when it can be showen. A channel manager can that think if it is really worth it.
It is right that this is manipulation and that this kind of adversisements are not good and really unmoral. A child could fall easier for an adversisement than an adult but it is the wrong way to ban it. It would destroy a hole work sequment and many ppl would lose their jobs. It is also the mission of the parents to prove what her child is watching on the television. If they do not want her child to watch this they could turn off the TV and do another things with the child. Or they could teach the child how to avoid getting caught by this type of manipulation. Advertisements for children are also anywhere else. Banning just from TV would be really inefficiente. U also have to ban it from every other medium that includes such advertisements like the adbanner on roads. For example McDonalds advertisements are placed a few meters in each direktion before and after a restaurante from McDonalds to make the children interested and give them enought time to say it to their parentes. That is in my opinion a harder and more unmoral kind of maipulation because that can´t just be turned off.
