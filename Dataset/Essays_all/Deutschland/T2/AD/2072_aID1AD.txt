In the following text I will discuss the question, if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. This is a topic many people disuss and it is not easy to say if it should be allowed or not. There are many points that have to be discussed, to make a decision about it.
One argument to allow the television advertising directed towards young children is that these children feel part of the society, otherwise it could be that children do not feel involved. On the other side it could be kind of manipulation to direct television advertising towards children. There are too young to deside on their own if an advertising or the product in it, is good or not. That could be also an argument for television advertising directed towards children. Maybe they could learn to deside on their own with this advertising. For sure it would be better when parents could help their children in another way to learn how to make decisions. 
Another argument for showing advertising directly to kids is that it could be boring for children when they see advertising for adults only. 
There are more arguments to show advertising to children directly, but the only real good argument is that it could be to boring for children to only watch advertisments for adults. But anyway I will agree to this statement, because I´m sure there are way more better activities for children from two to five than to watch television and the advertisments.
