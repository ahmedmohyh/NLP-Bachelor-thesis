Should televison advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should really be permitted? 

There are pearents who don't want their children not to watch television. They say that there are also programnms on televison which are teaching their children something new. Furthermore watching televion is a good opportunity for children to learn a new language whos family have migrantal background and therefore don't speak the language at home their children have to speak in kindergarten or in elemantary school. 

But there are more arguments for a permittion. Beside the fact that watching television is bad for the children's health because of radioactivity and also for their eyes, children who watch to much televisio per day will get isolated of society one day because they learn to just be alone watching televison and not talking to anyone except Dora. They will get less and less communicative which will be bad for their future since we all have to communicate with each other to be successfull in life. Like once a famous poet said : '' No man is an island of his own''.
Moreover there are much more effective, healthy and communnicative ways for children to learn a new language and imrpove their speaking skills than watching television. Meeting with other children for example who are native is the most easiest way for a child to learn a new language. Not only they would learn the vocabulary which is necessary for their daily life but they also would learn to interagate with others and become part of society. 

So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since all the arguments which say that it should not be permmitted can be easily
