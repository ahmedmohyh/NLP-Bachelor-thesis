The number of persons watching TV have raised in the last few years. Also children love it to watch television in the evening or in the afternoon after the school ends. But besides the televison programme, there are many advertisings, especially for young children. This leads me to the statement, I read in an article, that television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed.

I agree with these statement, because advertisement has a huge impact on people, but especially on young children.
They see a spot in the television and want for example the newest Nintendo DS, because it has a game you can only play on this version of Nintendo. Or for younger kids are things like little figures they can collect an share with their firends, more important, but also dangerous. They can brathe these little figures in and it can get stuck. Also are these figures full of chemicals who are not healthy for children neither then for parents.
Another point is that children could try to replay what they saw in the advertisement. The new spiderman costume is in sale and in the ad the children wearing it can fly like spiderman and after the children get these costume it would try to do it like in the advertisemnt.
There is also advertisemnt which is violent or have a positive point of view about violence and this is a message, the children learn and keep in their minds.

But not only advertising for children until five years, also all advertising should be controlled more or be forbidden. Young Teens are very impactable in all kind of advertising or propaganda.
All in all is watching television for children, but also teenanger, not a perfect freetime acitvity. They should go outside an play games with thier friends before they must go to upper school and have no longer time for playing games or freetime itself.
