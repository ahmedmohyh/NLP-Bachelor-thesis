The topic that television adversiting directed toward young children between two and five should be allowed is a is hard to discuss. On the on hand its not necessary for them to entertain and they could do lots of other things. Another point is that there is no informatic point of television they can use because of their age. On the other hand there arent any reasons why they should watch television at their age. But the reason that anybody or in their position their parents should decide if they are allowed or not because there are some series that even a little child would like and learn from it even if its not as helpful to learn as other thing their parents could teach them. The next argument is that that many young parents do both work in the morning or even in the afternoon so they arent able to take care of their child the hole day. There they coukd use a babysitter but if they dont earn enough money to pay such a babysitter its way easier to keep the child happy.
In my opinion it should be allowed just because of the earlier named reasons.
