Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial topic. Some people think it is okay at the age of two to five, other people think it should not be allowed. In the following text I will give reasons for and against it and tell you my opinion about this.
One reason for that advertising could be that children get in contact with the medium at a young age. Like in today's world they grow up with such "influence". A reason against it, which is mentioned often, is that children, especially young children, will become numb because of the huge influence that the TV and, not only but surely, advertising have. Another reason against it is that the parents of the child should have the control over what they buy for it. Of course they should look at the wishes of their child. On the other hand there are things being advertised which are not suitable for a child and these wishes should not be accepted. A reason for the early advertising could be that the children can specialise themselves on what they like and what they do not like.
All in all I think there should be this form of advertising. It does not harm the children. In addition the parents need to have the control over what their children are watching. Not when they are older but at this young age.
