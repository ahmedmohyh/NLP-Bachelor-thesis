Television advertising plays a big role in our life. Every day we see these. 
Children in young ages often watch these television advertisings because there parents don't want to spend time with their kids. For them the television is a cheap babysitter.
I think these television advertisings shouldn't be allowed to young children aged two to five becauase they see them every day and know them better than some other and more important things. My cousin for example often watch television because his parents work at home all day and he stress them and they can't do their work. He's able to sing more television advertisments than songs for children. His favorite advertisment is >>Washmachines lives longer with Calgon<< or >>Carglass fixs, Carglass changes<<. I think it's not that good for their childhood when they're know these slogans and are able to sing them. Children shouldn't watch television all day, they should be outside and get dirty. This is a reason why more children gets allergic to some things. Because they didn't had any contacts with it in their childhood. In my opinion parents shouldn't be allowed to get kids, when they don't have any time for them.
But I think it's not a realistic thing to not allow television advertisings because you can't control if there is a child or an adult watching television. The only thing you could change is the television advertising at the children canals like KIKA or Super RTL. I also know some kids who just watch televisin advertisings. They don't like television shows.
