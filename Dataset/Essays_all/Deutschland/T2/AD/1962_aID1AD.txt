The statement if advertising for young children should be not allowed in television is a very controversely discussed topic. 
At first it is important to know, what adcvertisements does with children. Of course they suggest them to buy special food or toys. Although this could be mentioned as a part of the economic engine of esociety, it could cause problems. Kids can't critizise the habit of wanting something that was well advertised, but is not very practical or good at all. They would believe without questioning what this advertisement says about this special thing. And of course they would need the advertised toy and a few parents would buy it to make their kids happy and quiet again. Maybe there are people saying that the influential part of advertising is not very important. Kids get used to it very fast and the special channels for children would earn enough money to survive. But does this kind of ignoring the problem solve the problem?

Not in any way. Short: It should not be allowed to show advertisements in channels only for children. Although these channels need money to work too, it should not be earned with advertisements, because the children could not think critically enough about it. 
The kids can't understand whats the secret of advertising, they can't see the lies in the fog of blinking and shining colours. Their brain is simply not developed enough to question what they are seeing and that is indeed a rather big problem.
