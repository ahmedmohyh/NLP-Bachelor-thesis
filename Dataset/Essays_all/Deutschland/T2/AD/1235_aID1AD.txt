Televison advertising is a often discussed topic. Especially young children become influenced by the advertising, which can become a problem, when they get older. But is that an argument to forbit advertising directed toward children on television?

First of all it has to be mention, that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic. Because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things, which aren`t right.
But in case of this it must be said, that it isn`t important, which advertising the children see in television. They get influenced by each one. Even if they watch TV and see advertising which is for adults. In most cases this is more bad for them, than see things, which are especially made for them.
An importatant argument for advertising to children is, that the partents have to control the consum of their kids in the end. They have to pay attention to the programm, watched by their kids and forbit it, if it is not godd for them in their opinion.

In my opinion all these arguments are, why it would make no sense to not allow Television advertising directed toward young children. It`s in the hand of the parents, which programm their children watch and also they have to take controll of how much their kids consum and get influenced of advertising because of this.
