My question is Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
You can discuss how good is advertising. But today we only discuss is it good for kids in the age from two to five. You can see it from two different sites on the one site are the companies on the other the parents and kids saver. But I start with the companies. The thing is that kids in this age think everything is true they can't deside is it true or false. So when they say we have the best product ever and shows some sweet figures they love this product. A big example is ferrero with the "Kinderschokolade", "Überraschungsei" or "Kinderschokobons". They annimate the chocolate and shows the kids how good it is. And the speaking egg says to the kids that they buy seven "eggs". So they influence the thoughts of the kids. And they do this to have thees custromers later. So they make much money with the ads.
On the other hand you have the parents. They don't want that their child are a zombie of any advertising companies. They want that the kids knew that choclate is not good that there is many sugar in. They want that they eat vegetables and that they do sports. Anyway kids who can't see the ads make their own thoughts. And kids don't watch TV the hole day. They go out and play with their friends.

I think that you as parents must have the choice. If you don't want that your child see ads they watch only the public channels for example KiKa, or ARD in the morning. But when the parents say it doesn't matter if my child see ads or not then it can watch the private channels too, e.g. SuperRTL or DiseyChannel.
