Television advertisement is something completely normal for us. However, should it be directed to young children or not?
It can influenz the children and change their personality so that they only look at their own needs and don`t take other people into consideration. They develope a need for everything they see and get self-centered. Children shouldn`t even watch TV long enough to see these advertisements. Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them. 
But some TV programms can be useful, if they educate the children and increase their kreativity. Nonetheless there are advertisements on these channels, which might be good for them and the companies who placed these advertisements but it doesn`t help the children learn to share and play with other children.
In my opinion there shouldn`t be television advertising directed to young children, because it only benefits the companies who make money with it. These advertisements are only aimed at the money of the parents of the children. Furthermore, the children get the feeling they can have everything they want and don`t learn to value money.
