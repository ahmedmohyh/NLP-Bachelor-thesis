Now I have to discuss abot the statement if television advertisnment directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
First of all young children, especially children aged two to five, get easily fooled by advertisement in television. They see something what have been shown there and want their parents to buy it for them. But on the over side if there was no advertisement for children everybody would be upset about that too so you can´t make it right for everybody. And to be clear I also think many children at the age of two wouldn´t really understand advertisement in television because they are just too young. And also not all children want to play with the same type of toys so that would be a big problem too that has to be solved. 
In the end I can say I have no pronblem with television advertising for young children because I don´t really care. Not offensively but I mean I don´t have to watch it so why should I care ?
