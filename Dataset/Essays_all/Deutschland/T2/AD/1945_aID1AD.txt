The discussion about advertising towards young children is a pretty controverse one. Some people say it should be prohibited to stop the influence on children. Others say that the companies selling toys for kids should have the opportunity to advertise their products as well.

And so do I. I think that in general these kind of advertises should be allowed. 

Of course critics could think that these advertises would influence children in a bad way and I totally agree. Children could get a wrong view on things like morality if they see advertisings of gun toys e.g.. But especially in cases like this parents have the obligation to protect and educate their children so their children wont be influenced this much. And I think that most parents are reliable by communicating the morality basics to their children.

Additional the parents still decides what the child gets. So parents can still control what their child get despite the child watching these advertises. And because of this the children learn that they wont get anything they see in TV and the presents they get get more special.

On the other hand children could get angry if they do not get what they want but in this case the education relies on the parents and the major parts of the parents know that. And we can not prohibit advertising because of a small group of parents who do not know how to raise their children.

The good thing about children not getting what they want is the increasing of creativity. Children who want something really bad but who do not get what they want will build it by theirselfs or just imagines having it. This will increase the creativity of the children.

To conclude I dont think that this kind of advertising does really hurt anyone. If the children are raised in a right way, they wont be influenced in a bad way too much by these advertises. But here we have to rely on the parents doing their job.
