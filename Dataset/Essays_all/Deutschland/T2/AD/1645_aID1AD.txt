Nowerdays often the question if young people should watch TV comes up to our minds.Today many young children watch TV because their parents have no time to play with their children.
In my opinion it is not good for so young people to watch TV the hole day. Children in this age should play outside with other children in their ages. It is important for them to have social contact to know how to act infront other people. Young children learn the most with other peolpe in the same age.
When they watch TV it is also possible to learn new things, so you have to know the difference between some channels. Some channels are very helpful to learn the language or the numbers but other channels do not have a learneffect. They are only there for entertainement what is not the best for little children.
Young children should play with friends in the same age or with there parents and other familymembers. At a special age it is okay to watch TV but not the hole day. I think a two years old child do not have to watch TV to be entertaint it should play to have fun. I think with five years it were okay when the child watch half an hour the day TV. 
So in my opinion you have to know the differnence between the age of a child and the TV channel it is also important to look at the time, how long a child watch TV. So in the end every parent have a other opinion to this theme and have to know it for himself.
