In the following text I will argue on the thesis that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Advertisements are basically everywhere to be seen in our daily life. Since younger people also use mobile devices or use the internet to watch for instance Youtube, where ads are played,too, I would in addition television advertising say that online adnvertising shouldn't be allowed, too. 
Advertising in general is used to manipulate and influence the thoughts of the audience and bend it to the company's will. And when watching the add over and over again the effects on the audience are unforeseenable. But after all, adults are already able to defend themselfs against strong advertisements, most grown-ups know what they need can properly decide what is good or bad for them. 
But we are talking about young children from the age 2 to 5. Their brains are not as developed as the brains of adults. During the age of 2 to 5 the human being is still learning everything he aquires through his senses. They are most of the time leaded by emotional and not rational thinking. Advertisement is easily accepted by the young children, they would be overwhelmed by the manipulative pictures and slogans. An example: On the "Disney Channel" is the ad of a "Lego" game shown. The young children see these colorful images and are easily convinced that they want to this game. The parents relentlessly give them what they want and "Lego" profits from the advertisement instantly.
 Children at that age cannot decide what they want or don't want. 
In conclusion I can certainly say that television and internet advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
