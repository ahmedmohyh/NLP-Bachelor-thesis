Television advertising directed towards children aged two to five? Can there really be any success for the companies? I will have a closer look at the arguments and then come to a final statement. 
First there is the question to be asked whether children of the age of two are really watching TV. And if they do, can they realize that they are the target-group of the company? At least their parents watch it too, they could buy their kids the things they see on TV. But then you could also direct the advertisement towards adults. If it would be allowed, what will happen with our society? Three year old kids hanging around in front of the TV to see whether there is a new product they would like to have.
If it would not be allowed to send such advcertising(anyway, where would it be for?)maybe there would be a chance to prevent the following generations from being couch potatoes. In any case, the parents are the ones who buy the things, so they should be adressed directly to get their attention. 
On the other hand, such advertising would be better for the children to watch than the one for alcohol or cigaretts. But when should it be sent? Naturally not in the evening fot then the elder generation is watching TV. That leaves the morning were they are probably attending the kindergarten or the afternoon where they should rather play with friends or go outside. In general, I see no real possibility in reaching the children through this kind of advertisement. It bears huge problems as to when to send it and if they are old enough to understand what they see. In my opinion, televion advertisement for kids of this age should not be allowed. They will get in touch with the whole TV and marketing business soon enough, and then they can decide on their own where to spend their money.
