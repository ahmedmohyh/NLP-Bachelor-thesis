"Television advertising directed toward young children (age two to five) should not be allowed." is an often discussed statement in this time, bacause the media with television, computer and smartphones is more present then ever.

At first it is to say, that the TV Programm nowadays isn´t really made for children in that age. The Programm for that age is the same as for older children. And in most families they just watch Tv with there Parents and they don´t like to watch childreens programm. In this case they see things they aren´t supposed to see. 
An other point is that if they start to watch a lot TV in this age they always want to watch TV an don´t go outside or go play with friend. LAter they just communicate over the computer and smartphone. They don´t learn the thinks they should. 
Also a really important fact is that there health system is´t going to work well, because they just sit inside at the coach or the bed to watch some kind of stuppid program. 

In my oppinion the Television adversising directed toward young children schould not be allowed. They don´t have a childhood with the TV. They don´t learn to play. They get stupid, because they just know the world in the TV and not the real one on the outside. They don´t learn to live.
