The question, whether TV-advertisments, which are directed toward children, aged between two to five, should be allowed or not, has caused a huge discussion lately. 
First of all, advertisments are often designed to be really manipulating for both, adults and children. However, children are much easier to impress, since they don't have much knowledge and are usually naive. To take advantage of this naive mind by advertising a product, which they should buy, is certainly morally questionable. Furthermore, the company knows exactly that children between the age two to five are not able to buy something on their own yet. The parents have to buy the often expensive toys for their children, because the children are annoying them as long as they don't have what they wanted.
However, on the other side, it's questionable if a child between two to five even understands the advertisments and that the products in it are real things. They could probably think it is part of a show as well and do not even know that the thing they see is available for them to purchase.  
Moreover, you could say that it's the fault of the parents. It is up to them to set rules and to make it clear to the child, that they cannot buy everything, they want. Or they could simply set "TV-times", to make sure their child is not watching too much shows and advertisments. Or they could watch TV together which their child and decide on their own, which toys to buy. In the end, it is all a matter of parental education, if the child is more manipulated by advertisments than by their own parents. 
In my opinion, TV-advertisments for young children should still be allowed.Besides that i don't know, whether a child even understands what they see in the TV,i think, it's up to the parents to educate their child in a way, that they know they cannot get everything. And maybe they can even teach their child to be satisfied with what they have.
