A young child is used to watch TV almost around the clock. So they are confrontated with a lot of advertisment.
Now the statement was made that showing these advertisments to young children shouldn't be allowed. 
A child that is aged two to five is naive and believes almost everything. For example a child thinks that Santa does really exist, etc. 
When these childs are watching an advertisment in the TV it can have an effect on that child. These ads we are talking about are shown on channels for kids. 
So these ads are dealing with childfriendly topics. These could be about toy, horses and mostly playing with "Barbie". 
These childs who are watching these ads are willing to buy those things, except their parnets have to buy it.
I think that it's good to avoid showing these kids advertisement in young age, because they have to grow up with no nonparental influence. These children are innocent and they should have the chance to grow up like that.
