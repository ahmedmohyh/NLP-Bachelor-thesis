in the following statement about " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" i want to present my personal opinion about that.

If young children watch tv they were always influeced by the advertising at every channel. Some advertising are directed for adults and some are directetd toward young children. The ones that are just for kids can be manupulated so that the kids make a wish about the things they have seen. Especially when its time for christmas the advertising are full of presents for children. So when they watch this they usually want to have these things. But they cant get everything they want. so when they are not getting the things they want they can feel a bit uncomfortabel and be sad. Otherwise they have to learn, that they cant get everything in life you want have and you have to work hard for things to get them.
often the advertising show things parents do not want to that their kids see this. But when they have such a big problem with that, they have to forbit the children to watch tv because advertisning is at every channel und you have to accept this when you want to watch television.
To put it in a nutshell i would say, that its not possible to forbit advertising directed toward young children. Advertising take a big place in our social life and we are always influenced by it. When you want to watch tv you get advertising und you could not do anythings against that.
if you as parents do not want that your child watch advertising you have to  buy them blue-rays, because that is the only possibility to get a distance between the kids and advertising.
