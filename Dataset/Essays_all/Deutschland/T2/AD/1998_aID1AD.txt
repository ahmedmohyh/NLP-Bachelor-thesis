The statement that television advertising should not be allowed for young children is not right i think. 
On the one hand it is right that children have to play in the garden or in their rooms or anywhere else but on the other hand it is sometimes okay when they are watching TV.
 You can use Television advertising for new languages for example. From aged two to five the children learn very fast. It is easier to learn something in this age. Exspecially languages. So the children in germany could watch english films.Our community is very national today, so it is very important that people speak languages, exspecially english. For jobs, for traveling and many other things. 
 Further more television advertising shows many situations and there are many special canals for children so it is easier to understand. Watching TV is not only watching TV it is a way of learning. The children see pictures and maybe someone explain it so it is the first part of learning in a easy way. 
 Nevertheless in my opinion the children are watching to much TV. Many parents sit their children in front of it so they have free time and this is so wrong.It is so important that children are going outside and that they are meeting friends and play games and that they have fantasy because this is the best part of our life to be a child. 
Children have to espect the reality and not the fake world in the TV. They have to experience their life and they have to live the real life of a child. Another point is that their are many situations in TV which are not really good for children. They show horrible things and the children get fear.
In my opion Television advertising should be aloud but the parents have to watch out which canals the child is watching. So it is no problem and is more a help for children, exspecially when they watch TV in a other language.
