Should televison advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not? 
The question is clear. Of cause, the first impression is that it is manipulating these kids. Also the parents will be involved, because their child wants to get what ever is in the show. On the other hand adults surly can be influenced too. So we have to ask ourself, not if it should be allowed to direct it toward kids, instead we should ask, if generally it is a good thing. 
Furthermore these people, who produce these things need it. It should be a right to show their products to potential buyers. That is how it works, without advertising, how people could know about it.
For kids in age two to five it isn't a good or bad thing, so why not? In their live there will be always a way to influence them, if not on tv than in the kindergarten or at friedns house.
The next argument is that the kids need to cope with things they can't have. They need to learn not to get everything someone wants to sell them. Later on in life it will be there day in and day out. Thus they need to learn it early. 
Also if parents doesn't want their kids to be influended, they shouldn't let them watch tv at all. 
Even more imortant is it to ask, should children watch tv without their parents during that age? 
Furthermore, what is the fifference between five and six and how could they possibly manage it. If the kids see something for older ones, they still want it. Also some kids are further an other ones. Or they want things, which are normally for younger ones. 
For the conclusion, it souldn't be forbidden. Television advertising is influencing young and old ones, there is no line that we can say, these ones yes and the other ones no. Parents should be capable to leed them into the right direction.
