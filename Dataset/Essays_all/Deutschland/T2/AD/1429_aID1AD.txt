I agree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. At this age children are easy to influence. They don´t have the ability to decide wether something is right or wrong.
By influencing the children, the parents get influenced as well, because the children talk their parents into buying things. By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion. They have an opinion on whats right or wrong and what´s good to buy planted in their minds.

For economy of course it´s usefull to direct television advertisement toward young children because they win a new generation of customers. A child will keep a brand or a product name, which it´s seen an advertisement for, stuck in it´s head for a long time and might even remember it when it´s an adult.
They are programmed to buy more things because they know from a young age, that buying things is a good things.
The system trains them from a young age that they have to buy stuff and that money is the most important value in this world. And so, by buying stuff they just support the system and they don´t even understand why.
