I agree that some advertisement at the television can be dangerous for young children. Children in this age can easily be manipulated and are open for any influences. In addition to that the children of the current generations are spending more and more time watching television, so the danger will increase in the future. Children at this age can´t really see wether it´s a true statement in the advertisment or if it´s a lie. Even in some advertisements where their parents would clearly understand that it´s not true. The consequences of this bad influence could be that young children increasingly think that they need to buy things to be accepted and to be popular, pretty or even intelligent. On the other hand the children will be sooner or later confronted by advertisements, even if they didn´t watched television advertisements when they were 3 or five. So it would not change much to not allow it when they are so young.
Another argument against the statement is that advertisements with bad influece aren´t only at the television. Young children can be manipulated and influenced by advertisments everywhere, wether it´s a mall or a supermarket. So it would not help to keep the children away from the advertisements at the television. I think only the parents should be responsible aobut their childrens well being. They should make sure that the children know that they dont need things to be a better person and that the advertisements (not only at the telvision) aren´t always real. If the parents are aware of the possible danger of the advertisments. I don´t think it´s necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children.
