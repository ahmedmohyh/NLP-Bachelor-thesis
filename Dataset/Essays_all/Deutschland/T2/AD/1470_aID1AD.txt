It might seem, that advertisements for children might prove usefull, as children can choose for themselves, what interests them, when they are offered not only their parents point of view. However, there are many contradicting arguments. 
For starters, a child is too young to deprict what's good for itself, and therefore cannot judge the value of a product, especially as advertisements are never neutral. In addition, children are easy to be influenced by the television, and should be educated by their parents. Also, children of that age are not yet capable of handling money, and most probably are dependant on their parents nevertheless. Of course, children can always tell their parents what they want, but its still up to them what they actually buy. 
Most importantly, children watching television are missing elemental time else spent with framily and friends, which normally provides much of future knowledge, such as the known words and moral values, social capacities and other skills. But advertisements often use wrong grammar in the use of puns, taking not only time for the child to learn, but teach them wrong instead. 
I therefore think advertisements are not to be allowed for children at such a young age.
