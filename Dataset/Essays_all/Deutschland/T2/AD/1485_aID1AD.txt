The following text will handle the topic whether advertisment directed to children aged between two to five years should be forbidden. There are pro and contra arguments which will be laid out. 
On the one hand the idea seems a bit unnecessary and like a typical burocratic decision. People might think that the advertisors should be free to make advertisments directed to everyone but there are more pro agruments, which support the stat
First, children are easy to influence. In consequence, they can be manipulated by advertisments, also in a bad way,  because they do not understand the strategy of advertisments to make people buy the goods. So they are not in the position to judge about the advertisment because they do not have the ability to decide what is good for them. This could be bad for the children to be influenced in that way because they first need to learn how to handle advertisments and the advertisments should not be directed to them.
In addition the children are not the ones who would buy the goods, which are presented in the advertisments. Instead they need to convince their parents and this could cause problems in the family because children can be very stubborn if they want something. For the parents it might be hard to explain that the goods, which are normally  presented in the advertisments in nice ways to make the people buy it, can also be bad for the children. In consequence the role of the parents is more hard nowadays if the children are influenced in many ways and do not trust the judgment of their parents anymore. This should not be supported so it is not good to direct the advertisment to young children. Instead it could be directed to the parents, who are more able to handle the strategies of advertisors and who are also the ones to decide whether to buy it or not.
