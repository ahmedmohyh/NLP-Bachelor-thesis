The voting system with ballots is said to be inefficient and it is said that humans of course do mistakes which both are very true, if all the miscounts of every little community in the U.S. would be shown then the numbers will be high but it is a sacrifice to take because if machines make mistakes actually caused by humans the severity will be much larger and on small community voting where the actual human miscounts would not really alter the outcome of the voting, while a mechanical failure could screw up the whole thing.
Changing the system to a mechanical system does not at all decrease if ever eliminate the risk of a mistake, it rather creates a bigger fear of a hidden mistake in the machine that unknowingly alters the outcome of a voting.
