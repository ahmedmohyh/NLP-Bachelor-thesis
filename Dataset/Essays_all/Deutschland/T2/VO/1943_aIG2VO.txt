Voting is a big thing in a democratic countrry like the USA. So it is important that the voting is accurat. Here some Critics say that it can efford problems when the voter votes on a ballot. The voting would be more accurat when the voter votes by a computer. The number of the vote can be not so accurat when the ballots are counted by hand. The computer can easily count the votes by an algorithm so you have a winner for the election very fast. But others say that there might be people, who can not use a computer good enough to vote with one. Also there is the problem, that when the algorithm in the computer is wrong and the computer counts wrong, you have no ballots you can count extra.
There Critics would say that humans make mistakes often and the ballots they count could also be wrong. But a algorithm is also a product made by humans.
Also a vote is one time in four years so you can count them. This is not such a big problem that you have to discuss a brandnew votingsystem.
