The text is about the problems of the current voting system. Instead of the traditionalwise, critics think, that new computerised versions are better and easier to use. At the current voting, people, who can´t see that good could easily mark the wrong candidate or party at an election. Also the counting would be easier, becouse the mashines doesn´t make human error possible.  At the old system humans were counting every single vote, so it was possible, that they don´t count right. 
But there are also some problems about the new voting in the listening mentioned. Just because the voting is not counted by humans it doesn´t mean, that human error is impossible. The new mashines are programmed by humans. Because of that it is possible, that they are wrong programmed and that would be even worse. Many people know how a computer works, but for those who don´t know it could become really difficult to understand the programm. The fear of the technologie could be a cause for them for not going to vote.
The text mentioned the positive parts of the new votingtype and the listening showed, that there are also negative aspects, you have to consider.
