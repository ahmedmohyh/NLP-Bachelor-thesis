The woman talking in the presentation critizised the computer voting system, that was iplemented in the text. She says, that people, who aren`t used to computers may have problems voting or could even be feared to attend the voting. In the text it is written, that it would be easier for people with sight problems to vote. The woman also states, computers are programmed by humans and make human mistakes, because of that. At this point the text assures, that computers wouldn`t make counting mistake like humans would do. The womans last point is, that voting systems aren`t developed enough and that other computer systems took decades to work perfectly. The text gives that as a reason, why the computer voting system would definitely work.

































I`m sorry but I have to write this:

That woman annoys me really hard, wake up Trump follower rednecks it`s 2017 and computers are as vital as water to us. And how stupid one has to be to click the wrong thing on a computer screen. I`m getting angry at this. unlucky
