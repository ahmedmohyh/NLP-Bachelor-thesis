It's told that computerized voting can have a lot of problems too because some people aren't used to computers. So they probably vote accidently for the wrong candidate or they don't even come to vote. But in the text people criticise the current large sheet with the candidates on it because the names are written too small. Consequently people with poor eyesight can't read those names well and maybe put their mark to the wrong name. 
Another point is the counting of the votes. Critics of the computerized voting don't think that the human error is removed by computers. Computers are programmed by humans so they also can have errors. And those errors would influence all the votings and make more trouble than one mistake by humans counting votes. Added to that with a computer it's impossible to recount the votes.
That's a big difference to the text because it says that mistakes by humans counting the votes could be removed by computer programmes. And it's also much quicker than counting every vote by people.
