Voting is a very important thing in nearly every country. But it is discussed if the voting systems which is mostly based on human actions is that trustworthy and efficient or if computerized votings are better. In the audio it says that computerized systems may seem good for people who are used to computers, but for others it is difficult. They may have fear of technology and so do not vote at all. In the text it says that the computerized voting machines have "an easy-to-use touch screen technology", so it is easy to use for everyone.
Furthermore, in the audio it says that computers can make mistakes too. Their systems are made by humans, so it is just normal that there may be any errors. And an error in a computer system is worse because it can influence the whole voting. In contrast in the text, the author says that the systems remove the possibilty of human error and it is automatically and quicker.
Moreover, in the text it says that governments and other people trust the computer technology everyday and it works perfectly. In contrast, in the audio is declared that computers used for example in banks were improved over years and now work nearly perfectly, but voting is only once in two years. So it is difficult to improve the systems and to develop the confidence of the people with these programms.
