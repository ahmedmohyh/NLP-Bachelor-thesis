Instead of the author of the text, the speaker in the record doubts that voting machines would be any better than the common ballot system. Instead, she fears, they would be even more dangerous.First of all computers are, acording to the record, expensive and many people don't know how to use one. Some of the citizens are also frightened by technology. This would cause in a greater number of wrong or ungiven votes, compared to the old system. The author of the text instead predicts an improvement due to the people who mark the wrong name because their poor eyesight. This will not, according to the text, happen with an easy to use computer.
The record refers to the text since it approves: Humans make mistakes. The text sees the solution in a computerized system since no human would count the votes and could therefor not make any mistake, whereas the record speaks about a far greater threat. If a computerized system would be established, humans would have to write a programm and if they would make a mistake thousands of votes could be lost or misscounted. The humans counting the ballots would therefor be the smaller risk.
Finally,according to the text, computers are trusted in for example the banking or communication system. But the record reminds these system have developed over decades and are used daily, while a voting system would only be used ever 2 years. Therefor it couldn't improve as fast as the other systems and the efforts wouldn't be worth it.
