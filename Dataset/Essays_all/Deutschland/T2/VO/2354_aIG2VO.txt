The audition was about the problems with ,,computerized voting'', which critics want to be the new kind ov voting in the USA, because the current voting system leads to the miscounting  of votes, which could be damaging for elections ,which are closely contested. The were some main arguments against this kind of voting. For example the woman which spoke said that the people, which aren't good in handle computers will have a big trouble with this kind of voting. In the text it said in contrast that the computer system will be easy to handle. The voters would just have to touch the name of the candidat they want to vote for. Another argument the woman mentioned against computerized voting was that human error could result in errors in the computer programm. The text said that systems make no errors, but humans do.In the audiotion the woman said that we don't know that. The mistakes that human do are that they count a few votes wrong or that they put a few votes on the wrong candidat. In contrast the woman said a computer programm could just put thousands of votes to the wrong candidat or could just cancel them. The last argument in the text was that we have to give computerized voting a chance to see, whether we could trust this complex computer technology, because we trust it in banks and communication also. So if it wouldn't work we probably would see that there also  have to be mistakes in the computer systems of banks and in communication systems. The woman said against this argument that we actually can not trust this computer systems and that the ,,old'' system, in which the ballots are counted by humans vote for vote, worked out well in the past and is also used since a long time.
