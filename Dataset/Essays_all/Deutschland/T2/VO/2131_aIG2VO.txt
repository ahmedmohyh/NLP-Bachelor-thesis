The problem talked about in the text and audio comment is the voting system. Some people say votings have to happen at a computer because it isn't likely to do so many mistakes by counting the votes as a human being does. Others say the modern computers might scare older and poor people of from going to vote. Both sides do have good arguements. So the pro computer ones say that a vote with technolegy would be much easier for everyone because the candidats names would be easier to find since people could just search for the name on the computer and not go through the whole paper, mistakely marking the wrong one. But for many people today it is still not commen to use a computer and with not having one many people do not know how to handle one. Accoring to the audio the computers also can't be fully trusted because they are also human made and human are known for making mistakes from time to time. So a computer could happen to remove a vote from the record and getting it into place again is more complicated than counting by hand twice.
