The computerized voting system offers a lot of opportunities but also has a few major problems to deal with. The presentation mentioned the fact that people, who don´t use computers on a regular basis might be affeared of technology and won´t be able to vote using a computer. The text on the other hand says that voting on a computer is much easier because you can zoom in and epecially people with poor eyesight won´t make their mark on the wrong candidate. Another problem is the fact that computers are programmed by humans and humans make -as mentioned in the text above- mistakes. But if someone makes a mistake while counting the votes you can easily recount the physically available sheets. If the computer counts the votes wrong there isn´t such an opportunity and errors often lead to big failures and differences to the real number of votes. The text above simply says that the computerized systems remove the possibility of human errors. The last argument mentioned in the presentation is the unregular use of the systems because in the United States you vote once in two years and a computerized system has to be used heavily to detect errors and to improve the reliability of the software.
