A problem of computer voting is that not everyone has a computer or knows how to use it. Furthermore a computer is not cheap. Another argument against this new voting system is that computers are programmed by humans. So the voting can be manipulated just like the traditional system. In the text it says that computers can be trust better than these ballots and that this new system makes voting easier because it is faster and needs less action. I would add another important argument to this discussion which is that through this new system there is no paper used. This is the argument which I think is the most important. But I would prefer any system which does not make Trump president.
