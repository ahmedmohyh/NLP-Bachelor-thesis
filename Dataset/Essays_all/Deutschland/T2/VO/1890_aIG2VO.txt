According to the heard comment, a computerized voting system isn't as clearly a good idea as the text above makes it out to be. It makes the point that, while it may be true that voting on a computer screen is easier accessable for many modern people, there are also a lot of people who still aren't as familiar with modern technology, may it be for any reason whatsoever. These people may even be caused not to vote by switching out the traditional system.
The text also makes the point of human error because the ballots are counted one-for-one by people. Regarding that the audio comment states that computers are also programmed by humans and may therefore be flawed. And if an error occurs in a digital voting programm it would be much harder to correct. The comparison to a daily used banking programm doesn't factor in the fact that these are used and tested daily and therefore had plenty of time to be fully developed, which is not the case with a voting proramm which would see field testing only every few years.
