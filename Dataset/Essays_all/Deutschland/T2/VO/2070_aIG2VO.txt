the speech was about the modern way of voting and the risks of them. Many people have the possibility to damage the modern system , because of good knowledge in mediathings. With error in the system many votes are miscounted. So there is a different point in the text and in the speech. In the text it says, that a computerized system remove the human error. Its right, that votes automatically by the computers are counting more quickly, but the chance to have a big error is higher. With a paper vote it is much easier and you cant destroy a whole system.If one vote is wrong, only and not everything is miscounted.
