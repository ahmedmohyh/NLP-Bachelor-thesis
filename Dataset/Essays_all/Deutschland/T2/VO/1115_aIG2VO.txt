The text about the voting system in the United States shows that miscounts aren't very unusual. They could damage a whole election. Also is there a problem with people who have a poor eyesight because there's a big chance that they vote the wrong candidate. There are also mistakes at the recording vote. If thousands of votes have to be count by people one by one it often happens that they - like every human - make mistakes and it's really hard work. Should the voting with technology be implemented nationwide?
But computers could make mistakes, too. It's important to say that computer rised votings are only a good option for people who are informed about technology and know how to work with computers, mobile phones etc. As already said, computers aren't without failure either. If a voting is counted out by humans there is a chance of counting mistakes. But when it comes to the point where  computers are the basis of an election it would be very complicated if there would be an error. Technology is made by humans so it's a fact that there aren't without failure. 
Even if critics have the opinion that it's too risky to implement the voting technology system, today, the system is used heavily and daily because govermnments and individuals put enough trust in the complex computer technology.
