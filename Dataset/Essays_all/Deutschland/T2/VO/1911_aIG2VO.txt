The text is about voting (in this case counting and election) personally or with technoligy. The probleme with the old voting system is that it is ineffecient and inaccurate. This means it leads to mistakes which are not being made by computers. For example computer can count the voter much better then a human ever can. Therefore person with poor eyes could make wrong ticks behind the candidates. As an Opposite Computer are programmed by human and humans are making mistakes. Our trust in technoligy is to high as we can not rely on it. Furthermore its indeed confortable to work with computers. They make our lives definitly easier. But as she said our heavly and daily work with computers make us to trustfull for them. We can not even see if any mistakes could be done. I bims 1 Kotnascher. Anotherwise she said it exist the fear of technoligy which is unfortinate as well. Do not using any kind of technoligy leads also to missunderstanding of it. This is not recommended as well. All in all i can say relying on technoligy can be positv but to much trust might be bad. We need some kind of balance between them. Maybe some workshops for older people to teach them how to use computers might be helpfull.
