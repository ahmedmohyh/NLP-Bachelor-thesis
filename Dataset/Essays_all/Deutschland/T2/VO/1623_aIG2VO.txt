Voting is a difficult theme and there are a lot of different opinions.
The main point, about which was talk in the presentation was if computer voting is better than traditional voting. And just look at the arguments the woman has told, computer voting is better than traditional voting.
On the one hand there could be troubles for people which doesn't work with computers that often, but on the other hand the computers will do a better job und the programmes which are going to do the voting, are programmed by human. And if you use the new voting art, a lot of the people which where needed by doing a voting right now, weren't needed anymore, because you just got all the results on computers and there are doing good work.
This arguments aren't the same like the arguments were written in the text.
In the text the traditional voting is much better called than the easy-to-use touch-screen technology.
Two of the main points were that the new technology is to risky and the traditional way is much easier, because you just have make a small mark next to the name and than the voting is completed.
