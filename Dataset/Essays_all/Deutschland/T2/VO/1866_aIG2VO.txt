The text and the lecture about the voting system of the United States of America are comparing the old voting system to a new computerlized voting system. In fact the old system is criticized heavily, but the new system isn't as perfect either.
The comparison starts with the facts that the old voting system is filled with flaws becaus of people wrongfully, or accidentally vote for the wrong candidate so the votings are lead to inaccurate counting of the ballots. The problem of the need to rely on people to vote the ballots is also accused to be inefficient and not trustworthy. On the other hand the computerized voting had many good thing about it. Because of the easy-to-use touchscreen with a magnifying feature people with bad eyesight could also vote correctly. But as said in the lecture many people don't use computers that often so they get discouraged from voting. There are also the problems of errors in the programm or even hackers who can fake the whole voting. 
In the end some people say it is far too risky to implement the voting system nationwide.
