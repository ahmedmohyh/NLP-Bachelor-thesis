In the following text, I explain you the voting system and the problems from the voting system. At traditional voting system people read the votes. This is very expensive and it´s very long. At the new sysem a computer read the votes,this isn´t so expensive and also it´s very fast. But a computer is a programm. Whem the programm have a error, many votes aren´t corectly read and so is the complete vote wrong. By a people is a misstake not insane, but the mistakes are not so much, hwo by the computer error. But a computer without errors, don´t think and so the computer  Finaly is the new system much more better, than the old one, bacause it´s faster and not so expensive. Also without an error the computers are 100 procent save.
