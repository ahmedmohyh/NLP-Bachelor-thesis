Some people haven´t the experience to work with computer technologies, so they don´t know how to use the computer for do a voting or counting the votes. Because of that they like to use the traditional voting system. But the problem in this kind of voting is that the people who are zuständig to count the votes could make mistakes, for example they count wrong. Counting votes with comnputer technologies is a big advantage (Vorteil?) because a computer doesn´t make mistakes in comparison with the human.
