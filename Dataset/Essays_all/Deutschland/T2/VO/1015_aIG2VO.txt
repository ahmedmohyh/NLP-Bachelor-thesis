In the following I am going to summarize the arguments from both sources I got, the text and the audio from a lecture.

Both sources are about the voting system in the US. The question is: Is the current voting system efficient and is it giving us the exact right result? Critics say that especially miscounts are often happening when the votes are counted by hand. At this point the result basically relies on the people who count the votes. But who knows if they are impartial and trustworthy enough to do this job?

Specialist think that a computerized voting system might be a better way to vote in the US. It is way more efficient and easier, since you would just have to log in the computer and take one click until you are done voting.
But there are also issues about having a different voting system with computers. As always technology has to improve during the years. Since the voting only happens twice a year, the programm would not be used on a daily basis which means that it cannot be improved during the years. There is also always a trouble with technology, who can tell that one will not have any problems with the computers and that they won´t make any mistakes. It is being said that humans make mistakes during the counting of votes, but computers are basically programmed by humans as well. It might seem easier to have a system like this on the computer, but what about the people that cannot afford or just do not have a computer? Everyone should totally get the same chance to vote.

To sum up the arguments one can say that there is a huge questionmark about wether people in the US should trust the vote counting by hands or if they can develop a programm for computers which everyone has the chance to use.
