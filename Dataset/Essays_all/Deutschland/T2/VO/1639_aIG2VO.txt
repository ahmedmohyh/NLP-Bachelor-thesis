Nowadays coumpters become more efficient. Some people no think it is a good idea to use them in voting systems.
Critics say that is doubtable that coumputerized voting systems are more efficient than traditional voting systems.
Computerized systems should solve the problems tradiotal systems have. For example people with bad eyes can not really make the cross on the right place if there is a long list. Also do humans have to count all votes, which leads to mistakes. On the other hand people say that there are also huge issues in computerized systems. Some people can not even afford an computer. Others have trouble and now idea how to use them .Some also fear technology and do not want to use them. This points could lead to an lower voting participation. Also the argument that computers are more efficient is declined by critcs. There are efficient computer systems in economy for example bank systems. But they are used and improved every day but voting systems would only be used a few times a year. What is also striking is that computers can have failures to. Critics say since computers are made by humans their can also be errors. And probably more immense than failure in traditional voting systems. Failures in computer systems can lead to an completely wrong result of the vote.  Thousand of votes could be deleted which would be an huge issue.
