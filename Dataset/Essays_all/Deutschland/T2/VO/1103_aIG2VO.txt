When it comes to the current voting system, for example in the U.S or in the Uk,there is a conflict between those who would appreciate a system based on modern technology and those who want to remain with the current system or at least don't think computers be the right way to improve the voting system. Critics of the current system say that computers could easily count all the votes without making the mistakes humans often make and they are easy to handle. They are convinced that mistakes that are caused by accidentally voting the wrong person on a ballot or miscounts when counting the votes, could be abolished with the help of computers.Meanwhile the other side claims that computers are just as likely to make faults as humans are,especially when regarding the fact that the computer systems are programmed by humans and won't be used as often often as multiple other modern computer programms people are relying on every day.Another problem with the computerized voting would be the technology fear of some people or the disability  of using a computer correctly. This could have the effect that a lower number of citizens than before is voting at all.
