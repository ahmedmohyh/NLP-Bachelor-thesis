Voting is a very controversial topic. Some say that a computerized voting is better than the voting right now with humans counting and maybe making mistakes. But is computerized voting better?

It might seem better than it actually is. With people making mistakes while counting the votes, if a computer makes a mistake, it will definitely be a lot worse. Computer programs are written by humans, so if they make a mistake, it can lead to lose thousands of votes or that some votes just won't be counted. Also, nobody could verify because all you can rely on is the data of the computer meaning that the computer would be "hiding" the mistake and you couldn't find anything out.
As well, people that aren't used to modern technology might not be able to vote anymore because they don't know how things work. In the worst case, they just wouldn't go voting anymore because they are afraid of not being able to use the devices.
At the end, it is being said that voting doesn't happen a lot, at most twice a year so it isn't that big of a deal if these two times, there are people counting the votes and not computers.

To conclude, you can say that voting stays a controversial topic, especially with the discussion about the computerized voting.
