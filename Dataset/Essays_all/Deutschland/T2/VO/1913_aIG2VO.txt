The lecture was about the problems of computerized voting in the United States. For example there might be the problem that some voters are not familiar with computers because they can not afford one on their own. This could lead to people not voting because of their fear of technology. The text argues against the traditional voting and for computerized voting because voters with a bad eyesight could magnify the names to make it easier to read them. 
Also the text says that in the traditional counting there is a risk of human error. However in the lecture it was said that computers are programmed by humans so that there could be even greater mistakes. Thousands of votes could be counted false, while people who count the votes could only miss a few ballots.
