Voting-Computers

In the article the computer is only showed in a good way. In the text the author mentioned the ineffeciant sythem which is problematic by very close votes. Also the fact, that people have to count every vote by and hand, which leads automaticly to errors caused by human. The woman in the presintation saw it the other way around. For her a couputer is still a human made product which was programmed by a human. In her opinion an error there would cost thousend of votes, which would be gone because there a no peaces of paper anymore. An other problem for her is, that these coumputer programmes needes a lot of time to work perfectly like our bank sythem today and elections are just every two years. 
The text pointed out, that it would be easier to find your canidats name on a coputer screen and is is easier to read. But in fact the woman pointed out that for example old people or poor people, who an not afford a computer would be confused by this new technologie. SO for her the vote with a computer is more a danger than with people.
