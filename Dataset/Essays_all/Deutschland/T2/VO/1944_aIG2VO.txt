Regarding the issue of problems and errors occuring during votes, focusing on the US, there are two pretty contraverse opionions towards this topic. Ones are saying that the practice of voting and electing should remain as it is and has been for past votes- Other proclaim that through the change to a technologized voting system, many errors would be wiped out. But what arguments do both sides bring to the table?

The ones bellieving in a transformation of the voting system state that one of the main factors of the inaccuracy of elections is the fact, that it is people that are responsible for counting the votes. It is thought of as inevitable, that while counting hundrets or even thousands of votes, erroers and miscalculations will occure. Also they say that is common that people accidentaly tick the wrong box and vote for the wrong Person. The solution would be to trust and technolopgy as we do in daily life and to digitalize the voting system.

Contrary to that the others state, not every one knows how to correctly use a computer, meaning those would have major problems or disadvantages voting. Speaking of errors that could occur counting the ballots it is just as likely that errors occur during the process of programming the "voting programm". Minor mistakes during the writing and codiing of that programm would cause even bigger problems than just a few mistakenly counted votes.
