In general the woman says that the current voting system in the United States shouldn't be replaced by an online system where you vote on a computer. It says that it isn't that bad as said in the text to rely on people to count the votes because if there was an error at a computerized voting system there would be much bigger problems than at a counting by humans because thousands of votings could get lost forever. When people make a mistake it is only about a few votes and it can be fixed very soon. Furthermore computers are created by humans and that is why they can make mistakes aswell.
Another point is that not every voter is used to using a computer which may lead to trouble. Espacially older people could get problems with the system and vote for another person than they wanted. At the same time the text says that it would become much easier for older people to vote because a computer program is more sorted and structured than a sheet with many names and little boxes to pick the person you want to vote for.
