Until now you would vote on ballots by making mark next to the person you vote for, but at the moment people discuss about changing it into a computerized voting system.

The people that are for changing to computers say, that the current system is inefficient, because there can be easily voted for a wrong person by marking the wrong name. With the computer-based system you would just have to click on the name and can even zoom in to check if it is the right name. Meanwhile critics of the idea of the new system explain, taht it will not become any easier. Especially for people who do not use computers in their everyday life. They might touch the wrong name or be even scared to go vote.
Another problem that some people see in the old system, is that the votes have to be counted by people, who will probably make mistakes. If computers were used for that job it would be much faster, but here again the critics claim that the computer is programmed by humans who can make mistakes too. If there will be an error the votes could be miscounted or not counted at all too and you would not even be able to check that, because the computer will not let you see that.
Another point that the critics of the computerized system make, is that computers can not really be trusted because of the argument before, while the other people say that we already trust computers every day.
