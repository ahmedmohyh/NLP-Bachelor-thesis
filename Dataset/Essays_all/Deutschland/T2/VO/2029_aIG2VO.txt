The lecture tackles the topic of online computerbased voting opposed to traditional voting systems. Unlike the given text it is against the idea of using computerprograms to count votes. One argument is, that it might be easy to use for younger generations but hard for older people who aren´t used to technologie. Therefore it wouold not be able to prevent accidental wrong votes like it is written in the text.
The main argument from the lecture is that big programs are much more likely to fail than many officials counting the votes. They might make small mistakes which is a problem, but given the program has an error thousands of votes might counted wrongly or even left out totally. This is a problem which isn´t mentioned in the text. 
Another argument from the text is that people won´t trust technologie in terms of voting, but use it everyday for banking transactions. The lecture doesn´t go along with that point. Instead it points out that banking programs had to be developed over a long time and didn´t work perfectly from the start either. With long voting periods like we have, it would take very long to develope the perfect program and many fatal errors could be made by the program.
