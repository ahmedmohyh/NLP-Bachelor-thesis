The topic of the text and the speech is voting and the way of voting. It's the traditional way of voting and a computerized way. The text supports the idea of a new way of voting and the speaker supports the traditional way. Both give arguments for their idea. But the speaker especially tries to show that the arguments of the text are wrong. In the text it says that some people who vote could accidently vote for the wrong person because the list of names is very long and the letters are very small. It also says failure during the counting is minimized by computers. All in all the message of the text is that computerized voting would minimze mistakes made by humans. In the speech it says that computerized voting would not minimze mistakes but could strenghten it. Computers are programmed by humans and if the program of the computer has a mistake it could have more influence on the vote than one or two mistakes from a human while counting the votes. Moreover could people who don't use computers very often could have big problems while voting and the possibility for them to accidently vote for the wrong person is quite high. 
All in all it can be said that the text underlines that computerized voting could minimize mistakes during election and the speech says the opposite that computerized voting is more likely to have mistakes than the traditional way of voting.
