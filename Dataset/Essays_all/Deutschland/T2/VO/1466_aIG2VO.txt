The text and the audience are bowth abaot tradtional voting and a computersystems to vote. But they  are too realy opiside vieus about this topic. 

The text is pro the computer voting, because of problems that happens at the vot and after the vote. Computers, so the text, say are better for old people, because of ther bad old eyes they have cut vote in thar large list of names the wrong name by a traditional way of voting. by a computer they have the chance to lat the names grow up. Tehy would ever vot what they want to vote.
 The audience say that techik is not usefull for old person because they never use computer in ther daylife. They are not at the situation to deal with this technik. so that they vot the wrong thing ore aren`t go to vot because they know, that it be to complicated. 

The Text is althou kritikly whith the counting. ther are a lot of mistakes the text say and it tooks too long time. The audience can`t say that it is wrong that peopel make misstakes and that is is a long counting, but it says olthau, that you have to think about, that computers are made from peopel. and people make misstakes! So computer wioll make the misstakes that the people sett in ther systems. and than are ther votings that are go strong away from ther realy resulut. or if the technik get out without a update, the vote have to do a second time. The positive thong of the traditional voting, the audience,is, that the ballots are still ther. you can count it a second time. the computer can`t count the voting twice; he will ever get the same resolut.
