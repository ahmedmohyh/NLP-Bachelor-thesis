The first argument you could hear in the presentation was the fact that the traditional (latest) voting system got some problems, but votes on the computer would'nt decrease these mistakes. Just new mistakes would effect damage on fair votings. The damage, which is caused by the computer controlled voting, would do a greater damage to the whole election. It also has been said that there are people, who can't afford the system and are affraid of technology. It's too hard to trust the computer system, because there are not many votes in the year where it can be proven as save. In comparison to the text the arguments of the presentation does'nt fit very well, because according to critics the voting system is just inefficient and it has to be edited. People with weak eyesight could tick the wrong mark and that leads to an inaccurate count of votes. This is damaging the election especially if it goes to close contested votings. Beside the critics there are also people, which say that it's too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide.
