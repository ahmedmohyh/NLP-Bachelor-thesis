Nowadays people in the United States discuss whether it´s better to on the current voting systems or to vote on a computerized voting. 
In the following part I will present arguments for and against a computerized and traditional voting system.
First of all lot´s of people don´t use computers in their daily life. Especially old people don´t know how to use a computer.So they will have troubles when they have to vote on the new system. 
Furthermore it´s not clear that computer don´t make mistakes. 
All computer are programmed by human and sometimes all human make mistakes. So it´s possible that the votes of thousand people are wrong. 
It´s a big problem because in this case are more mistakes than in the traditional votin g system. 
On the other hand the text mentioned a quite big problem of voters who have a poor eyesight. These people often mark the wrong name on the large sheet of paper. In the computerized voting system  this mistakes can´t happen because the voter only needs to touch the candidate´s name on the screen. 
An human error in the computerized system is not possible, since all the votes are counted automatically by the computers.
