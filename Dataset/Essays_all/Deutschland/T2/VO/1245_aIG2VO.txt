In the latest time there was a debate if the voting systems used in the United States have to replaced with more efficient voting systems.
There a two points of view. Critics say that the USA have to use computerized voting systems. It is much more easier because the voters can touch the person they choose on the screen and it is easier to find the person. As well there is a problem if humans count the votes. It can happen that they count wrongfully and this has a huge impact of the voting results. Accordingly computerized voting systems were made for perople using the computer and people who aren't use the computer can't deal with them.
The other position about this debate is, that voting systems were created by humans. There could be some errors in the programs that the result of the voting is wrong.
