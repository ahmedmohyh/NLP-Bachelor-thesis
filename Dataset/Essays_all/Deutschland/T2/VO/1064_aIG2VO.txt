The topic of both textes is if traditional or commputer voting is better. The written text is pro cumputer voting and the spoken one is pro traditional voting.
Both say that humans make mistakes, that is natural. But the first says that computer voting would make the system better, because a human can make mistakes by counting the votes. The computer counts by itself and nobody have to count every vote three times to find the winner out. At this point the secound text disagree. They say a computer does mistakes as well, because they are made by humans and humans make mistakes. They used the example "online banking".At the beginning of this system their were many problems and it lasted a long time to correct the system. The thing is online banking is used every day but online voting would be used just evry secound year, so the risk of system mistakes is to high.
Another point in the written text is that if your eyeslight is not good you maybe make the cross on the wrong name. The text say that with computer voting there would not be this problem. But like it´s the secound text sayed, there would be another problem. Computer voting is good for people who already have a computer, but what about the ones who have no computer or don´t realy know how to use it.
