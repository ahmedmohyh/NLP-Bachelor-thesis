In the text it is said, that traditional voting systems has to be replaced with new and modern computer systems. But in the presentation of this problem it is said that computer systems are only good for people who has got good knowledge. when people don`t know things about computers they can make mistakes and vote wrong. 
The fact, that it is very difficult to count each vote as a human, which is metion in the text is right, but it is said in the "speech", that computers make mistakes too. The systems are made by humans and when they make one little mistake in the productiuon, there can be thousands of mistakes in the counting of the votes in the end.
Also the text says that banks are using computer systems every day, to make their work easier.
But the problem of this is, that the banks use this programms daily. Voting is only for one time! That means that banks can improve every day many things on their programms to make them mistakeless, but for voting you haven`t got so much time to improve, so there would be many mistakes.
To put it in a nutshell it can be said, that the text says all would be better if we had modern computer systems for votings and in the presentation of this topic it is said that computers make as much mistakes as humans and would make all more complicated.
