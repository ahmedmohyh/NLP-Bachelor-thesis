In the discussion about developing a new voting system which does not contain human couting errors like the current system, one of the ideas was to create a new computerized voting system. The new system should be easier to use with the new touch-screen-technology for example, as many people who have difficulties with seeing have problems to mark the right person as the ballot paper is very large. But there are also many people in america who are not used to computers. They either can not efford one or do not need them in their daily life or job. Besides that the new system could contain errors aswell, as it is a product of human kind. Those errors can have an even worse impact on the elections, as the consequences could be even worse, for example more than 1000 votes could be deleted or mislead in case of a system error. Nowerdays many people are used to the modern technology because nearly erverything is controlled by computers and we use them in nearly every situation you can think of. The whole banking brange or comunication brange is based on the modern technology aswell. But those systems had to be improved aswell. They had many errors in their system in the beginning, but as they are used every day it was not to hard to find out where the problem was. As a consequnce of that it is very hard for many people to trust the upcoming modern system.
