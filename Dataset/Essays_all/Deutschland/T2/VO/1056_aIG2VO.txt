Voiting systems- humans or computers? 

 Nowadays, the votings were made by computers. They were easy to handle, they count the votes fast and correct. The computers were used daily and a checked every day. 
The old voting systeme is that the votes were count by humands. That was really hard work. Everybody could do this because every human knows what to do. 
First the problems with the modern voting: Computers were made by humans and humans make mistakes so there can be problems too. Furthermore, if the syteme get cancelled, every vote is away and that is horrible. Also not everyone knows how to handle a computer. So we must trust what the computer "tells" us.
Secondly, the problem by the old voting systeme called "traditional systeme" is that humans can count wrong and it needs a lot of time. 
Indeed, the text informed us about that the systeme with the computer is inefficient and thats totally a contrast to the fakt that tey really help us. Also a contrast to the text I herad to this text is that, trusting a computer is harder than to trust a human. I do not know if this is really an important argument. 
A really big problem by the voting without the computer is the sheet and the small places to tack the one you will. People with bad eyes can pick the wrong and bad one thats a really big problem, I think and it is not named in the audio. And in the audio they say that not everybody can handle a computer but in this voting systeme you only pick the name on the screen you want that could every human do also these with bad eyelight. 
But anything that is written and say by both is that counting by hands is really hard. 
Now, we need computers for the comfort and they help but they must be checked very often that there are no incorrect things on them.
