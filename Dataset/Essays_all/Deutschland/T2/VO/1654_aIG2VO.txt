The text and the listening comprehension is about the advantages and disadvantages of computerized votes. One major point is that the current voting systems which the governments use are inefficient and miscounts can have a massive scale about the election, so it can cause a huge damage if there is a closely contested. The people who critizes this behavior of the government, wants to replace modern more efficient and thruthworthy computerized voting system. Furhermore in the traditional way they have to search for the name of the person, make a short note behind his name and have to hand him/ her the ballot in. They have to count thousands of ballots and it is human to make mistkes, but these mistakes can cause a lot of damage. Because a election is not everyday only all four years, so it has a massive scale. A problem could be the older gernation who are not able to use a computer or only don't want to use one, so there has to be a conclusion to fix this problem. But another aspect is that the computerized voting system has to deal with is, that this program is written by a human and it is in our nature to make mistakes, so this programm can also make mistakes and a further point is that the computer is not able to recount the votes, but the traditional vote is able to do it, but it is very expensive. Furthermore they talk about that this voting system has to be proofed and this takes time, but everyday computer are used for complex banking transactions or in the communication of highly sensitive information.
