In the first text is said, that the traditional votingsystem should be changed because its very inefficient. The votes get counted by humen, wich can make mistakes. Because of that the critics thay that a computerized votingsystem would be way more efficient. The computerized votingsystem gets rid of human errors and is easily to handle. The votes can be given per touchscreen and get counted automatically. The opposite site says, that a computerized votingsystem would be a problem. One of theyr arguments is that the older people that do not even have a computer may not be able to vote because they don`t understand it. Another point is that the system gets programmed by humen, so mistakes can happen still. This mistakes will be much badder than in the traditional votingsystem, because in the traditional system, human can make one or two counting mistakes. But in the computerized votingsystem, one mistake can miss thousands of votes. They also mentioned that the whole  technology that we are using everyday got improved over the last years, our computers and mobile phones had technical issues too. So if the Technology that we are using everyday had problems, why should this votingsystem not have some too? You have to ad that the electins in the USA are every two years, so if this system does have problems it should be tested and improved before using it for the election.
