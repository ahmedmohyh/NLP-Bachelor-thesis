In the heard speech the disadvantages of an computer based voting system are explained and references to the benefits of such a systhem, given in the text are made. 
As a first point the positive affect of an computer based voting system is doubted. The speaker points out, that voters, who aren`t used to working with computers, probably because they´re too old or too poor to afford one, may have more problems using the technology. This could lead to more voting mistakes or a discourage for these people to go voting at all. The speaker refers to the first passage of the text, where the benefits of an computer system are explained and the conclusion drawn, such a system would improve the voting act for all voters, especially old ones with a bad eyesight. 
In the second part the disadvantages of an computer based voting systhem concerning mistakes while counting the votes are discussed. While the text assumes an improvement of this counting act, caused by the ellimination of the human error, the speaker explains, that the computer´s programms are human-made and could contain an error as well. In this case the damage would be far more serious, not only because of the more difficult recount but because of possible missing votes and the general absence of physical data as well.
In the last part the speaker points out, that the everyday used computer based actions, given as examples of the good function of computer systems by the text, didn´t work flawless at the beginning and took many years and daily use to be improved. Due to the rare occasions of use, such an improvement wouldn`t be possible for a computer system with the purpose of carrying out a vote.
