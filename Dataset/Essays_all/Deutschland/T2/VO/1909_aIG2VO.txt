First of all, it is said that some people, who are not used to technology and computers, might be afraid of using technology, thus will not go voting if there is only "easy-to-use touch-screen technology". In the text, it is only said that it is easy to use and that one can enlarge the candidates' names.
Furthermore people have to count the votes so human errors are possible. The text is for computerized counting systems so that there are not as many mistakes but in the presentation it says the complete opposite: Although we rely on computer programs on a daily basis mistakes in the programs are possible and if there are any errors in the system itself, there might be huge problems, much larger than just a few miscounts. Earlier mentioned programs which are used on a daily basis are used daily so there are not as many mistakes. In the beginning of every program there were indeed problems and mistakes in a voting system, which is used very rarely, would have a large impact.
