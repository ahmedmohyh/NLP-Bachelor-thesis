The first argument in the lecture was that people who are not used to computers will have problems working with them. With this statement the lecture refers to the argument in the text that it will be much easier to work with computers. They say it would be espacially better for older people who have problems with reading because with a computer you could just make the words bigger. But maybe the older people would just not be able to work with it in the right way.
The next argument was that it is not sure whether computers won't make mistakes in counting the votes together. This refers to the argument in the text that in the traditional way people will make mistakes in counting the votes and computers simply don't make them. But the argument in the lecture is that when people make a mistake it would just manipulate a really tiny part of the whole election. But when there is a problem in the system of the computer it would have way worse consequences.
Against the statement in the text that people use computers every day for example for money exchange the text in the lecture argues that those machines are used every day and they had mistakes in the beginning and were just improved by the experiences that people made with them every day.
Computers used for elections would only be used a few times in a year so there is no experience with them and no knowledge whether there are errors in the system. So maybe they are not more trustworthy than people used in the traditional way of an election.
