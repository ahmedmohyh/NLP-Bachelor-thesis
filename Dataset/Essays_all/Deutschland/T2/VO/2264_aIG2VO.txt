In the discussion about a new voting system is the idea of using computertechnologie instad of the traditional one very controverse seen.
On the one hand criticer of the old system say that it is ineffective and often wrong, because on the long list of canidats or if someone has bad eyes it is very easy to elect for the wrong canidat.Using computers could awoid that through an easy touch-technology and the magify of the names. Also the computers could avoid human failure, which often happens because the counting people have two work with thousends of votes so that there are always some mistakes. Also it is very expensive to recount all of the votes if such a mistake is noticed. At last computers are used in so many other and also massivly importened processes like banking or data-transfer without doing many mistakes while nobody questions that and takes it just as a normal part of live in our developed society.
The people who defend the old system instead see a problem for all of the voters who are not familiar with a computer so that they also could easily make mistakes there. And so they say, a computer can not iliminate human failure because it is programed by a human.In connection to this it is much more damaging if such a failure happens, in the old system a miscound just influences one counted voice while a computer mistake can cost the miscount of thousends without any recording of them, so no recount is possible. Also the other computersystems used to do importened jobs, like banking and also evers other technology in our lifes, so they say, is used daily so that it is developed very far and mistakes are fixed and noticed in short time.This is the reason that they work that well but such a system specificlly for ellection would just be used all one or two jears, so taht it could never work that acurat.
