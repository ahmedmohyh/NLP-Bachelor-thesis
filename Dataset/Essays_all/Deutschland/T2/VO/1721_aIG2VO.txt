The arguments of the speach are diffrent than those of the text. Many people think voting should be part of the internet. you shuld vote online and a computer should count the votes. Because of this they think, there would be less mistakes. But in the speach it is shown, that this isn´t true. Computers don´t do everything better then human.
Computers are programed by human, so there can be as many mistakes as when people count the votes. Also, when there is an error in the systeme, many wrong counts are there. If people make mistakes becaus they count the votes one by one, there are only a few mistakes, because if they make a mistake only one vote is wrong. If there is an error, every vote is wrong.
Also there are many people who can´t use the internet and computers very good. They could do vote for someone else than they want or are afraid to go to elections.
In the text it says, that people trust the computers everyday for banking ore something else, so why don´t trust by elections. But in the speach it is shown, that these programs are used everyday and get improved very often. The vopting program would be used only once in two years, so it wouldn´t be as perfect, as the banking systems.
