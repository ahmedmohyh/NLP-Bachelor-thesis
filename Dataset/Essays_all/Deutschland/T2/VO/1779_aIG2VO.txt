The very first argument of the woman was, that there may be people who are just too old to use a computer properly, or are too poor to afford one. These people might lack the "skills" it needs to tap on a name on the screen with their finger. Also, the lack of confidence in modern technology could demotivate people from voting at all, because of fear of technology. 
Secondly, she is admitting that humans can have errors while counting the votes, but says that these errors could be found in the programms that count the votes as well, because these programms were written by humans. She says that our everyday used technology is only as reliable as it is, because it is used on a daily basis and improved reguarly to fit into the system. That concept does not work on a programm that is only used twice a year, at max. 
Also, she says that if one of these errors occur in a computer system, all votes and records would be lost so the damage of a programm failing would be way bigger, than under the occasion that a human fails while counting the votes.
