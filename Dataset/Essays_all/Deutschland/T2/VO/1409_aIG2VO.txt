The voting system in the United States is always critisized by many people. 
Some of them critisize the opportunity to improve the system by using computerized voting machines. Others are definitely for the use of these machines.

In the following text I am going to explain the oppinions of these critics.

To begin with those, who see the system nowadays as an inefficient and inaccurate one. By still voting by marking the name of their candidate on a large list, which is called "the ballot", one is damaging the election and there can always be mistakes be made by people with poor eyesight because they cant exactly find the name of their candidate on the list. To avoid accidentally wrong votes, critics are in favor of  computerized voting machines which can be used easily, compared to the tarditional system. 

The critics who aren´t in favor with that project, are saying that people who aren´t used to work with computers often fear technology and would maybe even skip the election to avoid using the computerized voting machines. Moreover it is said that these machines are making as many mistakes as a normal human who vots. As a matter of fact, that these computers are programmed by humans, they may make errors and misscount or even delete votes.

On the other side by using these computers it would be easier to count all the votes. As nowadays we need many people to count them, a computer could to it a lot quicker and witout being paid.

In contrast to that, critics say that these computers don´t always work fluently, and especially have to be improved to suceed the best.
