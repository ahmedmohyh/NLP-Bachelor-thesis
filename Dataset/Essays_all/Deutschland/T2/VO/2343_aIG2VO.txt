The text is about voting by the computers.
The problem is, that humans make mistakes by counting the votes so it is inefficient. The idea is to make it automatically by computers to have no human error, because it works perfectly by baking transactios or communication of highly sensitive information. It will be counted by a programm and you will vote on an touchscreen. It is easy for normal "computerusers", but older people or people without computerknowledge can fear this voting methode and wont go to the voting. Also the programm is written by humans so there could be the human error too. At least this programm will only work once every second year so it isnt that much in an workingprogress like the baking systems, because they are used every day and they didnt work at the beginning so it needs time to make a programm perfect.
