There are many different opinions on the topic of computerized voting. Critics say that the usage of computers in election is simply too risky since computers are not trustworthy. For instance if a mistake or "human error" is made in the counting of votes there are only a few ballots missed resulting in an expensive recounting, if theres a mistake in the programm of an election system however thousands of votes might be lost with no possible way of recounting them at all. Another argument also says that there is no reason not to trust computers since they are already used every day for banking processes. But critics claim that the systems used today had to be improved over the time they were used, where as voting systems wouldn't be used regularly, making it difficult to find  the faults made. Another claim made by people against the new voting system is that it might scare people off who aren't used to technology as they may be scared to vote for the wrong candidate. On the other hand using computers would make the process of voting much easier because instead of a long and small written sheet you get an easy  to handle touchscreen which can even magnify, closing in on problems for people with poor eyesight too.
