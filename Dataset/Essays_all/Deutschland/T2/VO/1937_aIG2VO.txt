Because of the failures und mistakes, that humans make in the voting process in the USA, some say that computers would do a better job, because they are obviously computers and don`t make mistakes when it comes to counting. However critics argue that some people are not used to computers and would be frightend, if they have to vote on and with them. Furthermore computers are programmed and developed by humans. And if the programmers make a mistake, it would be far more devestatinng, than when humans do a mistake in counting the votes.  Such a recount would be just expensive, but when the system has a mistake a recount would be impossible. The critics also mention that such systems need time and practise to be improved, that was realized when systems for banks were programmed. But that would be quite hard, because voting isn`t so often.
