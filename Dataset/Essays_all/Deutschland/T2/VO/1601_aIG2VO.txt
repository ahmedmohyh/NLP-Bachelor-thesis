The topic of both sources, the text and the audio, is the voting system. In the text, they describe how they would rather like to replace the traditional voting system by a computerized voting system. They say that the tradtional voting system often leads to the inaccurate counting of votes and older people or people who have a poor eyesight even vote the wrong person by accident. The computerized voting system should remove the possibility of humanerror. In contradiction to that the woman in the audio, says that the computerized voting systems are doubtful too due to the possibilty that the computers might not work flawlessly and can mistakes too. The computers have improved a lot but it is not reasonable to say that they can not make mistakes too. As another argument, she states that people, especially older people, who are not familiar with computers, could be scared of the technology and vote for the wrong person because they do not know how to work with computers. Nevertheless there is no doubt, that the computerized voting system would be easy to be used by people who are familiar with technology. Still she adds that the elections are only once every two years in the U.S. and therfore can not understand why the traditional voting system should be changed into a computerized one where recounts are not even possible to manage. 
So the one side says that humanerrors could be erased but the other side answers with the argument that computers can make mistakes too. Same goes with the argument of computers being easier to use and less irritating - the people with no or rare knowledge of technolgy would be disadvantaged.
