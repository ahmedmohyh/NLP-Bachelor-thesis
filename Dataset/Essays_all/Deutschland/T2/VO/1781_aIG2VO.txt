The lecture tries to give arguments against computerized voting. It says, that computers are also made by humans, so human errors can also appear in computerized voting. And furthermore the mistakes which a computer can make can be much worse than accidentily voting for the wrong candidate. All votes could be mixed together or just disappear. So voting with a computer doesn't provide all mistakes and also can create new ones. Another argument was that only people who use technology in daily life find the voting with a computer easy, but old people wouldn't be able to use the technogoly properly at first. You would have to show them how the technology is used first before implementing such a system in an area that affects almost all agegroups and people of all social and educational levels.
