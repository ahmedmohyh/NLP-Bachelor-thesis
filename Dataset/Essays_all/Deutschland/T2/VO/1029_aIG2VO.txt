The two given sources oppose heavily concerning computerized voting systems.
While the first source states that computerized voting systems would make it easier for those with poor eyesight to vote, the second source informs about the problems those who don't use computers often might have. The new system might even discourage them to vote at all. 
Furthermore, computers might make errors too during the process of counting the votes. The consequences would be even worse in thst case than when humans make a small mistake counting the ballots. 
Regarding the fact that some are convinced that the risks of computerized voting systems are nothing to worry about since we trust technology every day in banking transactions and communication, the second source opposes that those are used daily. Over the past years, humans have improved those systems so we can now trust them. But votes only take place once every few years. It would take decades to improve the system well enough for it to be trustworthy.
