The presentation was about computerised votings. Their opinion is that the old voting system isn't as good as it was years ago. In our time we have more and better possibilities to make the voting easier. Computerised votings have negative and positive aspects. First you can say that the technical voting is much easier but only if you know how to deal correctly with computers. If you haven't that much contact in your life with laptops it will be difficult to know how to use the technical things right and as a consequence can be wrong votings. The text also talks about the old voting system and that it isn't modern anymore. The aspect with the worng voting is also given here but in an other way. They say that the old voting system is difficult because there are so many names that it is possible to vote for the wrong candidate. However this can also happen at computerised systems. A big advantage is that technical systems can count the number of votes easier so there isn't a high possibility of miscounts. All in all you can say that both, the text and the presentation, think that a computerised voting system makes much more sense than the old voting systems. They are easier and the chance of a miscount is very low. In general you can say that both are talking about the critics at the old voting system.
