There have been lots of rumors regarding the election processes in the U.S. in terms of its voting system, because many experts say that the election system in the U.S. is booth untrustworthy and inefficient. To replace this highly criticized system those experts point at the possibility to use computers instead of ballots of papers and private persons to count the votes because in their eyes it is way more easy to make your mark on a modern touch screen rather than on a barely readable and unhandly peace of paper and the computer system would make much less mistakes than private persons who count the votes. However some other experts doubt these arguments because there are some aspects that critizes this theory. For example: What about people who are not used to deal every day with computer systems? Those critics of the computer system say that the new technology might confuse the older people and because of that can lead to a fear of technology for the older men and women. On the other side (means counting the votes) computers are more reliable than humans but you can not recount the votes in this case because the votes are not physically existent and there is a high risk of an programming mistake or the computer voting system even get hacked. To counter this argument those men and women who are for replacing the traditional system with a new computer system say that we rely daily on computer transactions in terms of the world wide economy including transaction worth billions of dollars. The last argument of the people who oppuse this new technology is that they say they would not have have enough possibilitis to develop a reliable system. This theory however can be encountered by pointing out to the election system in estonia which is very modern and relies on computer systems.
