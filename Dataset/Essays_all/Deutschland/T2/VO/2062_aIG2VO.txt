Their are some different ways to measure an election. Every posibillity has pros and cons. They way the count everything by the computer can becomer a problem for those who arent familier with computers, those who cant affor one. They cant use it safely so the chance that they make mistakes is very high. Also computers are prdouced by humans. So if anybody said that computers are not making mistakes taht maybe could be correct but humans do and computers are the work of humans. So an election by copmuter isn't hundret percent safe. Looking at the veolution of computers it took years the modernise systemsn an stuff like that. Thats the same with programs for a big election. But the problem ist that elections are not that often so the program is not used very often and it would take more years to modernise election systems. 
The opinion of the text in the task is the otherway around. They think that with the help of computers they would get a better outcome. People with bad eyes could see better on a computer screen because ist could be bigger than on an piece of paper. So bad eyes can be a problem of an election by paper because the cance that a wrong person is ticked is very high. Also the counting would be better with an computer because if people have to count every ballot more mistakes would happen an the outcome isn't correct. 
So the text and the presentation have two completly different meanings of how an election should take place and with of the methods is better and safer. For every argument of the one side theres an argument against it from the other side. So thier isn't the perfect answer. Every method has pros and cons so the best has to be right in the middle of both.
