Of course the traditional voting system has some problems but the computers have some, too. The computerized voting machines are easy to use for the people who are used to computers but not for those who never use a computer. In the text is written that it's an 'easy-to-use touch-screen'. But computers have problems, too. It surely won't work flawless in the first time and that'S the problem. The computer could have an error and thousands of votings aren't counted or could be counted wrong. The text is more against the traditional voting system. Also are votings not that often, so the computer won't learn new things. Other technologies needed much time to work properly.
The traditional voting system is inefficient and not trustworthy. A big problem is the counting. Humans will count the votes and it's normal that they make mistakes but this could follow to a recount. A computer makes everything easier. The computer will count the votes very quickly.
In the end you can say that the text thinks that the computers are better and the audio says that the traditional system ist better.
