Regarding efficiency, computers may posess more of it. But The damage done to the political process by automation is far more concearning than a few inccurate votes towards the end of the election. 
Just think of the possibilities of corruption of these computers, fraud would be inevitable. 
The usage of computers to prevent people from ticking the wrong box is also riddiculous as it would only bring new difficulties to senior voters.
Furthermore, trusting machines which are a bigger subject to manipulation is madness.
It would be hardly noticeable if a few votes are beeing ´´switched´´ from candidate to candidate. 

I only signed up for this to gain some independence from the classes so
