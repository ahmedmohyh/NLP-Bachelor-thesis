According to the speech a computerized voting system will make even more trouble than the traditional voting system because of three major points. A main disadvantage is that people who aren't used to computers will have big problems with understing hoe the voting system works. This could lead to wrong votes because people could accidently vote for the wrong person. On the other hand the text says that the computerized system is really easy to use and no mistakes will happen. Another point the text adds why computerized voting is better is because the counting of the votes is way faster and it is far more unlikely that a computer will make mistakes than a human. The speech disagrees to that because the computer sytsem of course would be programmed by humans and as the text is pointing out correctly: Humans make mistakes. But a system error could be way worse than an error while counting the votes by hand because with the traditional voting system you can always just count the votes again if you make a mistake but a systems error could lead to 1000s of votes not being not counted. Also a computerized voting system can't be compared to computer systems like online banking which we use on daily basis. Voting only happens every four years and no system is perfect at the beginning so risk of an error is very high.
