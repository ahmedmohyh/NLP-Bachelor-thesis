The following essay summeraizes the statements of the text and the presentation to the current voting system in the USA and if it should be replaced. First of all the text is about the positive sides the computerized voting would offer and the presentation deals with the negative points.
While the text says that it´s difficult for people to vote for the right canditate because the calssical voting papers are very small written and very difficult to overview, the presentator says that the computerized voting would only work for people who actually know how to use a computer. For everybody else it wouold make the voting more difficult and could even lead to a lose of people who vote.
Another point the text mentions is that a computerized system would make less mistakes than the people who countg the votes but the presentator answers that human may miss a few votes but the computers could also make mistakes and that would mean that the whole system needs to be reworked and the voteing has to be done again.
Last but not least the text mentions that there are a lot of computerized systems are used on everyday base and the presentator snwers that thos systems are already very long uzsed and because of that they are perfectioned. A computerized voting system would be very flawfull when it is first introduced and  that can be dangerous for the whole voting process in the US.
