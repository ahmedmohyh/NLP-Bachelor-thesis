Some say that in the election of the United States of America human errors can manipulate the election.
They want to use cumputers for the election.
The other side say, that human errors can be also in programm of the computer. Computer are made from poeple and are not without mistakes. 
So the two sides can´t agree with eachother. Sorry but no sorry.
