Both parts are  dealing with the topic "voting system  in the USA". The written part and the presentation presented two diffrent opinions about that topic. In the text it is said that the voting system has to be modificated into an computerized voting system because the traditional voting inclueds the votion with "paper and pencil". For some people with poor eyesight could mark the wrong name and that paper has to be counted sheet by sheet. This takes a long time. With computersystems all these problems maybe are eliminated. 
The presentation shows the oner side. When the system is computerizied the mayority of the people who dont have to deal with computers every day could also do mistakes by the voting process.When the voting is running with an computer there are no results which could be seen in "real-life". That means that in case that the system of the voting has an mistake its realy hard to correct it when there is no paper where clearly is seen what the person wanted to vote for.
