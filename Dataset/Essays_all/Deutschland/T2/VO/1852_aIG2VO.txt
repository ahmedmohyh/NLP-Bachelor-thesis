The audio and the text have the same topic if the traditional voting system in the United States should be removed with a computerized voting systems because there are often inaccurate votes. The statement of the audio was mainly against the modern system. It was critized if you can trust the computer or the programm for voting. Because one error could delete lots of votes which can not get back. The text was positive about changing to a modern voting system because it will be much faster to count the votes. Although no searching for the name on a big list is needed. Another positive arguement is to make the text bigger for people with ey problems. But on the other side people who do not use a computer often could have problems to handle it. The programm must be easy for everyone. But one question of the text was if a computerized election is safe against something or someone like hacker?
