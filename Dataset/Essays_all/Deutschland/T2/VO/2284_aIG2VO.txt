The lady in the lecture is against a computerized votingsystem. In comparison to the text, which is for computerized voting machine. She said, that humans make mistakes, so they missocunt some votes. But a computer is a programm, created by humans. So they may put mistakes in their programms and so into the whole voting system. In comparison to the text, where it means that humans makes mistakes my voting and accidentally give their votes to the wrong candidate and it's very important that this isn't the term in closely contested elections. The lady in the presentation also thinks, that people with a bad experience with computers, especially older people don't know how to use a computer and so don't know how to vote. The text doesn't even think about this argument. The lady in the presentation calls the current voting systems more trustworthy, than the computerized voting systems. In comparison to the text, which thinks that the computerized votingsystems are more trustworthy than the current voting systems. She thinks that computerized voting systems have to be improved first, before they are getting used for a voting system. The text doesn't even list up the point, that the computerized voting sysmtems could make faults aswell, but if they do, so the text, they'll do much less.
