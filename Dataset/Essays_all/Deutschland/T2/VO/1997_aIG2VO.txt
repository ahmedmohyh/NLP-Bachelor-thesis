The traditional voting system is critized by some people and they say that a computer sytem might be easier to use. The problem is, that not everybody knows how to use a computer and therefore mistakes can be made easily or they just won't vote anymore, which would be unfair as they just don't vote because they do not know how to. Further more the people who would prefer a computer voting system think, that the countings can be wrong as poeple do it by hand and have to go through every ballot. Though a computer system would be made by humans as well and if they would make a mistake it would count not just one or two wrong but lots. So one mistake in a computer sytem has a bigger effect on the countings than a missed ballot from a human. Further more computer systems are still improving because of some little errors, so a computer voting system would also take many years to improve and we should not use it until it is perfect and save to use.
