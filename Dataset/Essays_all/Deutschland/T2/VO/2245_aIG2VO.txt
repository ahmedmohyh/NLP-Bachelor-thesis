In the following is discussed wether a computerized voting system or the old voting system is better and which is more effective. For this case I want now to sum up a text and a speech to that.

The text first of all points out that the old voting system is inefficient and also inaccurate when it comes to the counting of votes. In addition to that the text says that computerized voting is much better because the people cant vote  the wrong person. This is the case because with the old voting system the people often votet a person they do not wanted to vote in fact of that the voting cheets are so long. Furthermore the states that the counting of the votes is very hard for the people who are counting and lso a lot of mistakes can happen. In contrast to taht the speech about the voting systems says that computerized voting is only easy for people who are used to computers. For especially older people ist is hard to work with computers and in fact of that also mistakes coeld happen. Another point that the text points out is that computers can also not make a better job than a person because it also programmed by a person. In addition to that there is no physical record of the the votes so if a mistake or a system shot down happens all votes are away and it must give a new voting. Also the text says that the system has to be improved before it can be used for the voting. Therefore the speaker states the example of compputerized banking system which at the first site also had a lot of problems. 

So all in all one can say that the two textes shwow a very different aspekt and meaning to the different voting systems.
