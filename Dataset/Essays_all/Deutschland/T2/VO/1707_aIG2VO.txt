The text is against the old and traditional voting system, in the text is said, that the current voting system in the USA is the better one. 
In the traditional voting system the people often vote for the wrong candidade, because they can not see very well. This would not happen by the computerized voting machines. Another point is, that the humans have to count the votes one by one and humans make mistakes, so that there will miss a few votes or count false. 
The next reason that is given in the text is, that we use computer technology ever day in a lot of situations, so that the voting technology is very good and every people can trust them.
In the presentation about the voting systems is mention, that the traditional voting system is the better one. 
Some people may can't use the computerized voting machines because they don't use computers very often, so they have difficulties with the voting. 
Another major problem of computerized voting is that the computer machines must have a perfect technology and this can't have any mistakes. But humans program the computers and human make mistakes, so that there will be some errors in the technology. If there is a error this would have badly consequences because there can be thousend of votes be delated if the votes are count by people they will only miss a few.
It is right that we use computers and the technology every day but not the technology for voting machines, these will only used once in two years or something like this.
The text and the presentation listed the arguments for both sides. The author from the text is for the computerized voting and the speaker  from the presentation is against it and for the traditional way of voting.
