The speech and the text are about the way to elect politics. It could chance from the sheet of paper where you have to find the name you want to vote on a large sheet of paper to an easy-to-use touch-screen computer.
In the speech the woman says that it could be easy for people who are used to computers. But for the older gerneration it is a new thing, they are not used to. They fear the use of the technologie.
The speecher points out an other aspect. The computer system got programmed by human. normally the computer is the controll for the counted papers by human. Without the sheed of paper there will not be any controll. Also an error is possible. If 1000 votes got missvoted the electon is wrong and everything has to be done for a second time. It would be a scandal for the state.
In the text they only critise the technologie that not everybody can follow easy. But in the speech the speecher talks about the things that may happen because of the election system. And about the speecher meantions the antihuminiations.
