The text and the debate have opposing opinions about voting systems in the United States. While the text is for computerized voting, the debate is against. Here are their arguments telling their opinions.
You can read in the text that some voters, who for example have bad eyesight, can easily mark the wrong name and therefore vote for the wrong person. Though on computers, you only have to touch the candidate's name on the screen and a part of the screen can be magnified in order for near- or far-sighted people to read better. But in the debate it is said that some people have difficulties using computers, for example people which are not used to using computers because they simply can't afford one.
Humans can also make mistakes at counting the votes. And if an error is dedected the votes have to be recounted. However, computers can also make errors and while it's just a little difference if a human makes an error, computers can change a number in hundreds or thousands. Also with a computerized voting system you cannot recount the votes. Errors are permanently, unless you make the people vote again.
But finally you can read in the text that while some people say it's too risky to be implemented, more and more people trust computer technology in for example banking transactions.
Though the voting system took many years to improve itself to the point as it is right now. If a computerized voting system would be implemented, that time  would be needed again in order to improve it. But still, it's unsure whether it can be improved.
