In the text they say that the current voting system is inefficient and leads to inaccurate counting of votes. That is why they want to change the systewm to a trustworthy computerized voting system.

They think that it is easier for eveyone to vote on a computer with touch-screen because the sheets are too large and contain many names so that it is hard to find the right candidat. 
Computers should hepl to solve this problem. Also they are of the opinion that it is faster to have the votes counted by a computer.
The listening exercise is of another opinion. It is said that they doubt a computer to be the solution because not everyone is able to use a computer. For example older generations have never used a computer before that is why they probably would be disabled to vote if they do not have friends or family to help them. Also not everyone can afford a computer and you can easily vote for the wrong candidat by clicking by accident. 
Computers had to be improved several times, so why should every thing turn out fine while voting for the election? The elections take place every two years and nobody can be sure that everything is going to be alright in the end.  
Of course, as it is said in the text, humans make mistakes by counting the votes but computers are also constructed by humans who make mistakes.
