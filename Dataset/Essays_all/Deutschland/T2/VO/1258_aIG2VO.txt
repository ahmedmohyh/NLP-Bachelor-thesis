In the following text I will give some reasons from to different sources why or why not the current voting systems should get updated. 
The one source said that it would be better to update the voting system because they are inefficient and leads to miscounts which have the damaging effect that the country have to vote all again. A negative aspect for the old voting sytem is also that people have to count the votes one by one so they don't make any mistakes but it also happend that they have to recount the votes. A other reason was that people accidentally vote for the wrong person because the ballot have many names on it and the voters have to search it. Older people have also the problem that they have a poor eyesight and can't read the small names so they do a wrong mark on the ballot. A pro aspect was that the computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use-touch-screen which allows the voter to vote only by touching the name of the candidate and allows older people to zoom in to vote. At one point it says that somputerized systems take the possibility of making human erros because everthing is done automatically. 

The other source was striclty against computerized technology for the voting system because it is easy to manipulate  or could have an error in it which is maybe handmade by a human to manipulate the votings. It also said that maybe young people will like it because they were grown up with technologies like this but for older people it will be more difficult than being with poor eyesight because they have problems with the control over it or maybe with the touchsystem. Also there could be a mistake in the counting programm which also leads to a mistake. They said that even when many bankers are working with computers they make mistakes which have enormous follows for the banking system. 

So in many ways the second text is more against it like the first one.
