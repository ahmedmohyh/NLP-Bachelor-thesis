Is the american voting system outdated?

Many people say that the american voting system is outdated and should be replaced by a system working with computers. But those people usually are abled to use a PC properly anyways and they forget about them woh do not. for those people it would be as easy to make the wrong tick on a PC as it is on a ballot today.

But thats not the only problem. When a PC has an error during the work with those votes thousands of them could get lost, which is much more than a human missing a few ballots.

And in the end a computer system which is trustfull has to be developed thru many years and during the every day work which is not given for a voting system because there are too few votes in a year.

the information given from the text and listening part make it clear that the voting system has to be developed but that the perfect way to do this is not found yet.
