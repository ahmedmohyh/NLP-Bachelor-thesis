In the given presentation one of the main argument is that there are people who could have problems with voting machines since there are people who have never used a computer before because there a afraid of technology or can't afford one. In the text it is mentioned that a computerized voting system could be easier to use for people with poor eyesight since they could use the computer magnify. 

Another argument given in the presentation is that the programm that counts the votes are programmed by humans, so there is also a chance of human errors and they could be even more damaging. The text mentions that in traditional voting systems the votes are counted one by one by humans, that is a lot of work and it is inpossible to not make a mistake. 

The last argument of the text is that we use technolgy everday for example in banking transactions and that these systems are trusted, in the presentation it was said that these programms had problems at the beginning as well but they now work fine bacause they are used everyday, a voting sytems therefor would not be used that much so there is no proof that it would work flawless.
