The presentation shows that there are many problems with computerized voting systems. Not everyone, especially old people, are not used to computers. They do not use them daily and some do not even have a computer. Because they cannot afford them, do not know how to use them or are feared of them. That could be a problem, when old people decide to not vote because of the system. They develope a "fear of technology". 
Humans make faults. When they count the votes, they make faults, but they can also make faults when they are programming a computer. When a programm is wrong, maybe many votes cannot be count. The computerized voting is not as improved as other computerized systems like money transfer or other things. It would not be used daily and might not be reliable. Money transfer is improved and used heavily by many people. The people do not have confidence and maybe do not trust the system, because they would use it just once a year. 
In the text it says, that the old people could see better what they are doing, because they could make the letters bigger on a computer. The computerized voting is also easier than the traditional system. It also takes a long time to count the votes by humans and they are making mistakes. The people trust other technical devises so why shouldn't they trust computerized voting systems?
