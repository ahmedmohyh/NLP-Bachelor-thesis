The speech I have just listened to describes the opinion that the current voting system may be inefficient, but still, modern voting sytems with computers would not be the better choice. The speech says that there would still be many problems and doubts such as people who can't afford computers or are not used to the technology. As a cosequence, wrong votes could be casted or peolpe wooldn't even vote because of the fear of the technology. Another argument was, that, although humains make mistakes, computers do too. They are programmed by humains and therefore not without any mistakes. Also, a recount would be impossible with modern voting systems if votes had been misscounted. To sum it up, the speech's message is that the modern voting system with computers can not be wholly trusted.
On the other side, the text I have read earlier contains the opinion that the cutrrent voting system would be inefficient and inaccurate. It should be replaced by computers because not only humains make misstakes and computers won't and are trustworthy and more efficient, but they are also other reasons: People could accidentally vote wrong or the ballot could not be understood. Furthermore, the people who count the votes make mistakes too. The text ends with a critic of the modern voting system with computers: It would be risky to implement complicated voting technology natonwide.
