Traditional voting systems or new technological voting systems?

Small question, but different opinions. 
People who support the computer voiting system have the opinion that with the traditional system happens to many human faults during a voiting. This will change the voiting and will lead to wrong results. Another aspect is that with handwriting voitings people with for example poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. With the easy-to-use touch-screen technology of a computer this mistakes will not happen. 
The other side critices the new voiting system, because a computer program can also have an error and the results of that will be as big as a mistake of a person. Another argument of them is that maybe older people who don´t use a computer every day have problems with the new system. They aren´t able to vote, because they don´t know how it works or maybe they are afraid of making a mistake. This would be bad, because they don´t go to a voiting and that would lead to less voters and maybe to another result. 
So there are many discussions about this topic, but nobody is able to say what´s really the right solution.
