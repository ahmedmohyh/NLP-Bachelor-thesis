The woman says in general that the current voting system in the US is better than a computerized voting system. Therefore she refers to arguments of a pro computerized text which title I do not get to know by an author I do not know either. So towards the argument that people with low eyesight cannot clearly see where they make their cross, the woman says that more people do not know how to use a computer so there will be more mistakes in this system. Furthermore she mentions that a computer error can lead to a massive miscount so they have to count it again which means that they are not faster at all.
