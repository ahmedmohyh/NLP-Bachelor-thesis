The woman in the audio talked about the voting in the US, and that people are thinking about getting another system, that is leaded by computers. 

She taught, that its right, that people make mistakes, and that this might be bad, but she reminds also of how computers are programmed: by human persons. It is bad, if human make mistakes while counting votes and sorting persons, but it`s worse to have a computer, while whose programming was made a mistake, because then, 1000 votes could be deleted, of a state could be forgotten.

The text was about humman mistakes, miscounts and trusting computers, and the woman agrees them, but in terms of the computers, made by human, the trust in a human should be higher, than in this coumputer. Normally it´s like computer are used every day or at least every week. But in this case, the computer aren`t used that often, but only once a year. The humans doesn`t know their faults and all the mistakes they made while programming it. 

So all in all you could say, that the text and the audio agree in the fact, that humans make mistakes, and that that ist not good in elections, and there are people who can handle computers, and there are some that don`t.
They disagree in the fact, that the audio reminds of where the programmes of the computers come from, and the text doesn`t. It only says, that you trust computers, or you don`t - there`s like nothing in between.
