Some critics are saying that current voting systems used in the USA are inaccurate and inefficient. 
A good compromise to avoid that problems is to use computers for votes.
Computers are made by humans and are way more accurate than other voting methodes. There is just one little problem. If somebody wants to vote and never used a computer, like an old person which never had the chance to get experience with computers, would have big problems to use the computer correct.
An other problem of traditional voting is that people with poor eyesight could mark the wrong name on the voting paper which makes wrong results.
On a computer you can use a zoom function, which is a good compromise for people with poor eyesight.
At least there are ever some oppotunities which can false the votingresults but I think that the voting on computers has more good aspects than bad and it can be trusted.
