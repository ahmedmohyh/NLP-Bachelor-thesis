Computer are easy to use for people who are often using them for other it is rather difficult to use them correctly but it reduceses the misstakes made by counting the ellection sheets because hume can make failors then they are counting but computer can have programm misstakes and they have to get improved other the time. If the ellection software have a programming misstake the votes are lost because they there not on physical sheets of paper which could get recounted. This is different to the text above. In the text is written that the traditional votingsystem is inefficient because people can vote the wrong person because of the names on the sheet of paper they get. Computer remove the human mistakes for example the countings are correct and the work directly after the programming fail free. The last points are rather different from the speech. It got clear that the text is supporting the computerized voting system and the audio is supporting the traditional voting system with sheets of paper.
