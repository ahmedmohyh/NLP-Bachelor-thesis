The voting system in the United States is very inefficient and risky.
The text says, that people might vote for their wrong cadidate by marking the wrong name. A computer system won´t make it easier though, because people with a bad eyesight often are old people, who don´t know how to handle a computer and so they won´t have a problem with their eyesight anymore, but they will have a problem with working with a computer. The text says, that often the people counting the votes make mistakes and so they have to count them all over again. It says, a computer programm would not have such problems because it would just remove the errors that occur. But one has to know that computer programms are created by humans as well, so they will have human errors included. And if a computer system has an error in it, there´s an even bigger trouble, because that means the error occurs in thousands of votes.
The text also says, that people rely on compputer systems everyday, such as in a bank or supermarket. But these programms are used everyday and they´ve been improved for many years. A voting system will not be used everyday, because there are voting every two years, and and so it can´t be improved all the time.
