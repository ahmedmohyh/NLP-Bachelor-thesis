While the written text clearly supports a pro computer votings position, the text we heard was against it. 
It said, that computers also make misktakes because after all they are only programmed be humans, and a mistake made ny a computer can be way more fatal than a human mistake.
Also not everybody is used to work with computers so a computerized voting system would not be easier for everyone.
I don't know what else I'm supposed to write I tired and hungry.
