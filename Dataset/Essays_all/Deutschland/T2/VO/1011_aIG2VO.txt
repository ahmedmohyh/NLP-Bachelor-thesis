Is a modern way of voting really better than the old traditional one? 

Not everybody is used to work with a computer and not everybody can afford one. This might lead to the problem that some people will have troubles to use a modern voting system. Another argument against the modern system is that even computers are made by humans. There is a chance that an error in the system can make mistakes aswell. Third it is another problem if a computer makes a mistake, because the mistake made by a computer can be much bigger than the one resulting from a human. Finally we trust complex computer technology every day but the point is that elections take place only ever two years. The time to develop a good system which will work is not long enough. 

Against all these arguments we know that the old system does not work perfectly. Many mistakes are made by humans but the difference is that if a mistake was found it needs much more time to recount all the ballots. Second thing is that it might be hard for peolpe with poor eyesight to mark the right name between the the other names on the list. This can lead to inaccurate votes. And finally we trust other computer technology in banking transactions and highly sensitive information aswell so why not in our voting system?
