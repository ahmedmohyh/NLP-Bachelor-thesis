The given text as well as the one delivered in the audio, deal with the issue of the efficiency and usage of voting systems used in the United States.
The text criticizes the human errors and thus inaccuracy of traditional voting systems. Especially the long ballot-lists which are therefore in particulary small writing pose a severe problem. Voters with bad eyesight can thus accidentally tick the wrong candidate and vote for someone they didn't mean to. Human errors also occur in the counting of the votes, which is still done by hand. Votes may be counted incorrectly and an error would cause a new counting to be issued. All the named issues can be solved by switching to computerized voting instead: human errors are avoided, counting would be faster and the machines would eliminate the ballot-list issue. However, the speech in the audio argues against this that this heavy use of technology would scare voters unexperienced with technology away. Human errors, it argues, may still occur in the programming of the machines and thus be more severe. Additionally, as voting only takes place only about once a year, there is no time for it to be perfected like banking systems, and thus can't be as easily trusted as those.
