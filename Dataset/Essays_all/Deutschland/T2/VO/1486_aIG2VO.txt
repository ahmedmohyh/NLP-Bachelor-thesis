Many people in the US want the traditional voting systemy, where you have to place a cross on a large peace of paper, being replaced by a computerised voting system, where you have to clic on the candidate on a computer, as explained in the text.
Many people would have trubble seing their candidate on the sheet and thatfore would be helped by unsing a computer, where they could zoom in on the names. But as the audio explained, many people, espessially older people, would have difficulties using a computer and even not show up at the voting station, because of the fear of doing something wrong on the computer.
In addition to that a computerised voting system would be efficient, because it would count the votes without mistake as written in the text. But, as mentionned in the audio, computers are only machines developed by mistake making humans and if the system of the computers would fail, there woul not only one or two votes missing, there would be a total failure and all the data of the votes would be gone. And technology still can't be fully trusted, that is why humans are more efficiant in total.
To finish it is fair to say, that elections happen approximately once a year and that it is not nessesary to use an computerised system for that, as summed up in the audio.
