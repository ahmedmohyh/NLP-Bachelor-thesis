The text and the oral presentation which i analysed were abot the voting system and about the possible technological influence on it.There are as many problems in the tradional system as in the new technological because both of them can show errors.But the advantage of the technological system is that its easier for the voters to find the canditade they want to vote for because they dont have to look on a sheet of paper with many names.If there are people with poor eyeslight it can be a problem.But in the technology it also can be difficult for some people who cant work with computers and it could lead to an misstake in their vote so they probably doesnt vote for the candidate they want.Also the counting system can lead to misstakes because the systems are also made by humans so we cant be 100 percent sure if there are not some errors in the final results of the elections.The next point is the risk the goverment goes in. The risk ist that all these system which could be used for the election have first to be improve and its not easy because we only vote once for a few years and not like in the other computerized systems for example used in banks or some companies which will be daily improved.Summarized all both ways of election can be problematic so it needs a new idea to make the election process better .
