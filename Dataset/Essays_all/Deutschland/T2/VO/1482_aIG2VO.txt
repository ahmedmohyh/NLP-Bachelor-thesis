First it was said, that humans can make mistakes, which agrees with the text, but it isn't sure that computers make it even better, which is the opposite of the opinion of the text writer. It was said that people that doesn't use computers regularly and doesn't have knowledge about those technologies maybe do mistakes with them and so vote for wrong people, which disagree with the text saying computers make things easier for people. Another argument was that computers are programmed by humans and if there is made any mistake it can cost thousands of votes being miscounted while humans only miscount a few votes. In the text, this problem wasn't named. As a resolution it was said that humans can do some mistakes at counting votes but in closely contested votes the votes can be counted again while computers can make big mistakes that aren't solvable so the traditional voting system should be used furthermore.
