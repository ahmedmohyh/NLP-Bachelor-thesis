The lecture says that there are also people who trust the traditional voting system, because some people might not be used to computers and therefore vote for the wrong candidate or be discouraged from voting altogether. It is also said that computers are programmed by people so they have their faults too and can make far more serious mistakes if they count the votes of the people. Furthermore, a recount would be impossible, because the data would be lost.
The computers we use for banking transactions are used daily and there had to be many updates made to make them work. However, the voting systems wouldn`t be used that often and therefore not be as accurat as the systems used for banking transactions. These theses don`t agree with the text.
