Provididing mistakes in voting symstems.
Every two years a new election of people in goverment is done in the US. But some critics mean that the voting system today might be inefficient. But is it that much badlyer as a new voting system by computers?
They acutal voting system might have any problems with mistakes. Critics say humans make mistakes, that is natural. so they can be mistakes by counting votings. Also they say old people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. It's easilyer if you can zoom on a screen to see the name better and to only to touch it as marking. 
They voting system have to trust in the people who count, or they have to count it 2 or 3 times to eleminate any counting mistake. Critics say it's faster and easilyer to use computers. They say it's safe, like money transaction. 
But what is ith people, that might be have no experience of any computers? They are unable to vote because they got a big disadvantage by useing computer. But the biggest thing is that the computer programms are made by humans and humas make mistakes, that is natural. so which case might be heavilyer? Loose 1.000 voting by a mistake in counting by humans or loose 100.000 voting by a mistake in a programm? Critics can not say it is safe like money transactions because they are done everyday and mistakes can be corrected in one day. A voting would be every 2 years 1 day so to find a mistake they and fix it and wait next 2 years is not comparable with the transactions system.
