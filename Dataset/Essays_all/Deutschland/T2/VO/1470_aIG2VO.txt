In the lecture, it is doubted wether computers would improve the Voting process in the United States. They are said to be easy to use, however, people who have no personal experience are easy to fail to vote right. In the text, computers are said to prevent the chance to tick the wrong candidate, but as said in the Lecture, computers bring even more problems, and the fear of modern technologie might even scare potential voters away. 
It is the said, that humans can make mistake while programming, resulting in fatal errors, resulting in wrong count or even lost votes, which would not, as said in the text, preclude the occurence of wrong elections. Also, as the votes are not physically present, they cannot be recounted should the loss of information occur.
Finally, the text claims, that computers are used in banking and handle of sensitive information and therefore can be used in elections, but the Lecture states, that the election only takes places every few years, and therefore the programs have hardly any practical testing, and have immediate negative impact should there be errors in the program, where banking and other similar programs are used almost continuesly, giving them an easy time to improve and perfect in the beginning, so they can be used without doubt.
