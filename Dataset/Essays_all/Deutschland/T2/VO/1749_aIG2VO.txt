The main problem of the old voting system of the USA is that the chance of voting for the wrong candidate or party is high because of for example people who have problems with their eyes and set their cross on the wrong place, so it got more and more popular in the last years that voting should be more and more computerized in the near future. 
Some people say that those computerized voting systems make voting easier for the citizens, but critics say it is possible that even computers make mistakes, so it could be that the solution of votings could be wrong and that candidates who did not get that much votes could win an election just because of the mistake of the computers. 
There is also the problem with people who do not use computers and who have to vote analogically.If someone does not can handle the using with computers it might could get heavy to vote, what counts especially for the older generations.
In solution there is to critizise the safety of computerized voting also at the look on the chance of interfluence of votings in the last years.
