There is no doubt that voting is a very serious and important topic for the entire world. As a result, the voting systems need to work out well, so there will be as few errors and mistakes as possible.
The current voting systems in the United States are still traditional, the voting sheets are filled out by hand and counted by real people. There are many arguments on why it should stay that way.
Computers should not replace the traditional voting system because not everyone is used to technology. Consequently, many people would not even try voting anymore because they fear using technology. Or even worse, unexperienced technology users would accidentally vote for the wrong person. 
Some may argue that people who count the traditional votes tend to miscount the votes as a result of already having counted thousands of sheets before. That makes sense because it is usual for elections to not be quite on point with their results.However, computers could also have included errors that are caused from human programming. And these errors could possibly get thousands of votes wrong, which would be a catastrophe for elections.
Furthermore, computers and technology as in banking systems had to be improved for years and that would not be possible for elections because they do not happen as often.
All in all the computer voting system might appear very handy and easy, but it is obvious that it could very easily cause more damage instead of improving the system. People who do not understand the voting sheet, should inform theirselves about it since voting is a very serious topic. Others with e.g. bad eyesight should try to get ready for voting, as in getting or borrowing glasses. The problems with traditional voting can easily be solved.
