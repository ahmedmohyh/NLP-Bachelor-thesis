In the text and in the presentation you get informed about the problems with voting systems. The main question is are computer good for a voting or not?

There are two voting systems: by humans or with a computer. Many people are against the computer and agree with the traditional way of voting. The computer could make the voting easier because they ars quick and haven't got mostly misscountings. A missing vote could damaning a whole election. But the critics are against computers. They oppinion is that computer are easy for the younger generation but for the older people it could be a problem by using the computers. Not only this could be a problem, the people, who agree with this voting system, critizise the traditional way of voting because the humans make more mistakes than an computer. The argument from the other side is that the computers are made form humans so the cause of an error could be possible too and this could be an bigger problem than a missing vote.
