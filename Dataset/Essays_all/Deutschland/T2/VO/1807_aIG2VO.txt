In the following text I will summerize the arguments in the oral presentation and then I will show how they speak against the arguments in the text.

In the oral presentationj they said that it is correct, that some people maybe have a problem with the voting system how it is now, but the also said that a computerized voting system would not work better. 

People who do not use computers in their daily life can have massive problems with a computerized voting system. 
And also humen errors during the programmation of the computers can probably destroy an complete election. 

But in the text is demostrated another opinion. The text says, that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. 

If the old voting system gets replaced by a new computerized system it would be more efficient and trustworthy.
The problem with the old system is that some people can easily mark the wrong candidate becuase on the sheets it is written very small. 
With computers there would be the opertunity to zoom with an easy touch-screen system.
Also the count of the votes would be much easier because know we have to count every single vote, but with a computerzized voting system it is possible that the computer is counting the votes.
