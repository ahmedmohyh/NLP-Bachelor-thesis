The just heard lecture about the US voting system question both the traditional and also the digitalized method.

The lecturer explained that the traditional, currently employed, voting system was inefficient, yet also how the current alternative, the computerized way, is not any better.
She explains that there could be a lot of counting errors as well, because on the one hand people who aren't used to computer technology would have trouble voting for their candidate, as they might make the mistake of still picking another one on accident or being completely scared of by the modernt technology and not voting at all.
The lecturer opposes the view stated in the text as she neglects the positive effect of the method to help cease accidental voting mistakes.
She also states that miscounts would still be a thing to worry about, as the program code is still written by humans, who also make mistakes. To think that the computer would be able to flawlessly count the votes, as stated in the text, would be wrong. Additionaly, the mistakes would have another dimension as there could be thousands of votes being miscounted.
Furthermore she disagrees with the text in the aspect, that the computer systems used by banks or other important instances weren't flawless at the start either: The software was used constantly and everyday so that errors and bugs would have been fixed over time to the point when it became flawless. The voting process would only take place, at maximum, every half a month making bugs stay for a long time.
