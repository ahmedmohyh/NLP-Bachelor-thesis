The woman from the audio was clearly against newly invented voting systems that are based on computers. First she mentioned people who probably will have trouble with votings on the computer because they are not used to it. For people who work daily with a computer there would be no problem. The text choose another way to concern for example older people. It is said that people with for example a poor eyesight can easilier work on computers.
The woman also mentioned that after all computers are human inventions. So it is not a perfectly working system because humans make mistakes and so the computer do. This point is also given in the text with the difference that people should vote on the computer because humans tend to make more mistakes while counting. Of course the counting people make little mistakes when they deal with thousands of ballots. But those mistakes are not much heavily because it is just one or two votes more or less. A by human designed programm makes also mistakes- but those are much bigger. One misfit in the system could lead to a totally remove from the survey or voting. 
The woman also said that national votings are barely more than twice a year. Scientists do not really have the chance to improve their voting systems and counters are not overwhelmed with counting many ballots once a year. It is their job or their volounteer work so they can do this small afford to serve their country.
Concluding, the audio and the texts are in contrast with each other. The audio rather supports the traditional way of voting and criticizes the computer systems. The text rather criticizes the traditional way of voting and wants to support the use of newly invented computer voting systems.
