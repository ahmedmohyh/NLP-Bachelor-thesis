The heard comment disagrees with the text on many bases, first of all it generally sais, that computerized voting wont make the voting easier , because it will exclued other minoritys from voting , for example people who can`t afford computers or are not used to handle a computer. It also disagrees on the counting aspect, it sais that for sure accidents can happen when someone misses a ballot, so it may cause more, but minor mistakes. If a computer has a mistake programmed , the effect will be way bigger than the mistake of a human. In the programming of a computer a human failure can shout down and could produce more and growing mistakes. The last referation to the text, is the aspect of the banking and the risk.It sais, that programms like banking happen on daily bases and get approved every time a mistake happens, but voting systems mistakes can only get noticed every two years.
In my opinion a combination of the two aspects , the traditional and computerized voting creates the solution , it is no problem , that votes first get counted by a human and then get recounted by a computer , to avoid and equal the disadvantages of both ways. You can also include all minoritys if you offer both ways of voting , the computerised and the tradiotional voting , so you as a voter can choose where you want to give your vote. In Conclusion traditional and computerized voting have their advantages and disadvantages , but the combination of both is possible.
