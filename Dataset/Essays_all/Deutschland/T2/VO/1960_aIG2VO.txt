In the speech it was said that a new voting system based on computers could be to difficult for people who aren`t used to computers. They could even be to afraid to do something wrong that they don`t go voting. The text says that computers would help people with poor eyesight which would stop marking wrong names by accident. 
It is also said that humans count the votes and every human makes mistakes. Because of this, the voting system is inaccurate and a computer should count the votes. But on the other hand, if a computer counts the votes you have to rely on a program by a human. If there is a mistake in this program the miscounts would be way higher. 
Although we also trust computers for example in banking transactions as in the text mentioned we use them every day and it took much time to take the mistakes of this systems away. Because voting is only every two years it would take way longer to correct all the mistakes of the computer.
