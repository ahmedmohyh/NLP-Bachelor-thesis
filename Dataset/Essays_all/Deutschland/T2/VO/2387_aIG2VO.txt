The two texts are about the voting systems in the USA. On one hand the traditional voting systems lead to miscountings, because mayors count them personally. Because of this fact, the final votes can be wrong and in the worst case, will lead to a wrong election. One the other hand computer-counted voting systems can lead to a total crash, if the systems have an error. In this case the whole voting has to be held again, because it totally depends on the computer system. Even banking transactions were'nt as perfectly acurated as they are now. Years of new intallations have passed in which the systems were renewed. If the elections will be done with computers then an error is predictable, which can cause fatal consecuences. The first text says the computerized voting can help people with bad eye-sight. But people who rarely use computers or can't even affort one, may have big problems with the use of computerized voting systems. In conclusion the first text may seem trustworthy at first but the second text gives more explanations why computerized voting systems are not as effective as they seem.
