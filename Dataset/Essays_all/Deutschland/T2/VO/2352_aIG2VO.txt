Computerized voting takes lots of problems with it.
Many people say that it's easier to fill in the right name on the ballot. But for peolpe who don't know anything about computers it's probably hard to learn it in a short time. Maybe the people are even feared to be confontrated to a computerized voting system. It's possible that they don't go to the votes anymore. 
The second big problem we are confronted with is that we can not be sure computers do a better job than humans. They  are designed by people and like it said in the text, people make mistakes. When a human count the ballots there's maybe one little mistake, but think of a computer. When there's one mistake in the program the whole count goes permanently wrong.
And the last thing is that computer programs are too risky. It's true to say that we use lots of computerized things in our daily life, for example our banking system. But this are things we use every day, permanently. The voting is normaly two times a year. So if there's a mistake, it needs too much time to solve it, maybe just to find it. And then it needs to be proved, this is impossible. You can't vote every day to develop a program.
All in all there are lots of problems with computerized voting systems we're faced with.
