The text shows the positive aspects of computerized voting while the presentation focuses on the negative aspects. 

It is stated that it may seem esay at first to use computers for voting, but that there are some problems most people don't think about like the fact that some people aren't used to computers. As a consequence everything will be far more complicated than before and we will have the same problems: some could make mistakes and accidentally vote the wrong candidate. Besides, computers can make mistakes too, because they are programmed by humans and if they do, one will have a far greater problem. After all, the votes won't be physically there. Last, we don't vote often enough to develope a computerized voting system, so it wouldn't be worth it.

To sum up, the presentation completly disagrees with the article. They want to make sure that everyone knows that the problems we have now with voting won't go away when we use computers. Instead it will be more or less the same but they will have a far greater impact.
