In the presentation I have just heard the point of view of the narrator is against the computerized voting sytems. The narrator prefers the traditional votings through humans. As arguments they list the following ones. The computerized votings may be easy for people who use and deal with computers daily but for people without any computer knowledge or experience it would be hard.
Another argument is that an error or mistake in the computerized votings is worse than one in the traditional votings because computers are full of programms and if there is even one very small mistake in the programm it will probably lead to imense problems and mistakes. The narrator sais that compared to this, mistakes like miscounts in the traditional votings aren't as worse because they can be fixed much easier. 
And finally they refer to the point that the creators of this programms and sytems humans are, so the narrator sais that the traditional votings are more realiable and trustworthy than the computerized votings.
