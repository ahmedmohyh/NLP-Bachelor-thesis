In the United States, voting could now be developed and digitalized by using computers.
The exerpt of the text is favorising digital voting whereas in the presentation, problems with this method are mentioned.
In the exerpt, many disadvantages of tradional voting are mentioned, like the inaccuracy or the reliabilty on people counting the ballots. The computerized method is seen revolutionary because it would be quicker and there would be less counting mistakes, since it would be the computer doing the work and human errors would be excluded.
The presentator, though, is not persuaded by the efficency, nor the accuracy. In fact, computerizing the votes could have a huge negative impact on the turnout. Since there are many people who are not used to computers, especially older eligible voters would not cast their vote. But there is still the fact that computers are programmed by humans, so if there is an error in the programm it would be way more serious, since it could miscount all the casted votes.
The two informations, the exerpt and the presentation, are contradicting themselves because they both mention their different and subjective views on computerized voting and the advantages or disadvantages that come along with it.
