The lecture and the talk are stating theire opinion on the discussion on a new voting system in the U.S.A.
While the letcure states the opnion that the tradiotional voting system is to old and should be replaced by modern thechnology, Computers, the talk states that computers are not a better option.

In the lecture it says, that there are a lot of misvotes. That is caused by people exediently voting for the wrong person, because of ticking the wrong name on the long list on the ballot or can not read the names because of poor eyesight. With computers you could touch the candiates name and magnify the name for easier viewing. Also you relay on people to count your vote right, without making a mistake, what is nearly impossible. Ist takes a longer amount of time, then when computers would count it autmatically. The goverment trusts the computers with highly senstive information, so the people who vote should trust them to.

But the talk said, that we can not trust in computers. It may be true that there where problems with the tradional system beacuse of counting out the wrong amount of votes ore people voting wrong, but not everyone is in the position to use a computer. Some people might not vote anymore because they have no confidence and trust in modern technology and themselves, to not vote wrong. Also computers are made my human, so the chance of having a failure in the program is not to underastimate. And while traditional votes can be recounted, that is not possible with the new  system.
