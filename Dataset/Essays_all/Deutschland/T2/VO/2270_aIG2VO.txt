The persons from both text has different opinions about the voting system.

The woman thinks voting with computers causes the same issues as regular voting. So while voting on paper for some people is a problem, the same mistakes could appear by voting on screens. This is because many people are not really confident with new computer technology. Also the fact that computer programs are writen by humans could lead to same mistakes as in regular voting. So while you can recount the votes with the regular systems easily due to physically paper, electronic votes could not be recount because the raw votes could not be reconstructed. Also the reliability of common computer systems depend on using it a lot to elimate errors. Because elections are not very often it would be very difficult to find these errors and get rid of them. 

All in all electronic vote systems are not tested enough and because of this the are not fully trustwothy. So according to the woman it is better to use the old inefficient and inaccurate system instead of relieng on new sytstems.
