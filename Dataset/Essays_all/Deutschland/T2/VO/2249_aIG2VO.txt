The audio extract is about the computerised voting and the voting when the votes get counted by humans. A computerised voting would be easy for people, who often use their computers, but people without any knowledge would have problems to vote or they do not want to vote anymore because they fear the technology. Also the computers get programmed by humans and it is sure what humans make things wrong. When it comes to the point of the counting, humans can miss a few votes, but if a computer has an error everithing is wrong and you need specialists to fix it.
Futhermore the text says that the problem could be the humans who are voting: the large sheet with many names could be to little and they could make a wrong little mark or when it comes to the computerised voting at a touch screen, the people can klick the wrong person and so the wrong candidate is voted. The extract from the CD is more about the problems by the counting of the votes.
Both extracts are about the inefficient voting system in the United States and they are the opinion that there are a lot of miscounts, but a really good way to fix the problem is not found.
