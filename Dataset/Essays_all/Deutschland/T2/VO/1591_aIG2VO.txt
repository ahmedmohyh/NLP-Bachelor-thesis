The lecture, as well as the text, both handle the same topic: Voting systems in the USA. But while the text lists all the bad things about the old system of voting, the lecture prises the old system and lists more of the bad things of the new system.
 New system? Old system? Whats that?
Well the old vote coutning system is the ballot system. People mark the wanted person on a ballot and other people count the votes. But in the text given it says that often people count votes wrong and a miscounting follows, which is espacially bad,in times of a close election. The text given says that the new version of voting is much better. The new voting system means, vote counting by the computer. The text says that with the compuiter counting the votes, not that many mistakes are made.
The lecture says not so. In the lecture the speaker says that with the new system a lot of problems accure. Many people have no computers, becuase they simply can't afford them. Also many people are not used to use computers and have big problems with dealing with them. Also it is much worse if a comnputer counts votes wrong, because if the computer has an aerrroe, far more votes are damagded. 
So in general the text is in favor of the new system and the lecture is in favor of the old system.
