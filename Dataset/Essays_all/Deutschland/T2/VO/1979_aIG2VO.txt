Critics of computer votings say that many people aren't used to using computers because they for example can't afford one or they just don't like to use them. That's why there could be made mistakes when voting online. On the other hand the text says that there could also be mistakes made when reading the ballots because there are so many small names on it so the voters could easily mark the wrong name and the voting would be inaccurate. Also nearly every person uses computers in their daily life and so it would be easier for everyone.
Additionally the critics say that it is much worse if a computer has an error in his program than if a few votings are counted wrong. On the other side it is very expensive and takes a long time to recount a whole voting if a mistake is detected. Computer systems are trustworthy and usually more efficient than counting votes by hand.
