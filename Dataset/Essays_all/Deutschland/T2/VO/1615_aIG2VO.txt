In the presentation the speaker opposes what the text says about the positive aspects of computerized voting systems. She starts by stating that, although the traditional system does have its problems, so does a computerized system. Many people are not able to afford a computer or do not know how to really use one. They could not vote or also make a mistake like they could with the traditional system on the ballot. The speaker also talks about the fact that computers are prone to errors aswell, just like humans are. Whether it be a programming error beforehand or an error during or after the vote has been given. These errors are also far more serious than a few miscounted ballots in the traditional system. Thousands of votes could be lost or miscounted and once the data is gone or corrupted a recount is not just difficult, it is impossible. The last point is that the computer systems we use daily in for example banks have taken years of work and many mistakes to become the reliant systems they are today. A voting system would barely be used and would take much, much longer to become trustworthy.
