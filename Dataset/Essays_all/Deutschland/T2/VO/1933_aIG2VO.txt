The speech says that is doubtful that computers can´t make mistakes. People maybe can´t afford a computer or are just not familiar with using them. This could cause them being reluctant to vote and thus not showing the true opinion of the people. It was also claimed that we can´t be sure if computers actually are better. How can we know that the computer doesn´t make a mistake? It was also mentioned that computers are designed by programmers who are humans. So the argument that we can avoid human error is invalid as we still need humans to count the votes. And the programmers making a mistake could cause a much bigger problem than a few people making the wrong cross as there would be thousands of votes wrong. Furthermore, voting is not something people do every day as it is only once every few years and thus the necessity to rely on computers is not so big.
On the contrary however, the current system could be inefficient as we don´t know if people who count the votes are really that reliable. They could make much more errors than expected. There is also the possibilty that older people can´t read the names properly and may need assistance by magnifying the names of the candidates. Without magnifying the names people could accidentally vote the wrong person resulting into the wrong candidate being voted. The idea of not trusting computers also could be invalid due to the fact that we already trust computers in our everyday life  by trusting them with accurate bank transactions and personal information.
