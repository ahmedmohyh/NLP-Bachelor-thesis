The text i read and the listening part is about voting and the progres of it. 
The text is for the technical vote and the audio was against it.

The author of the text says that the technological vote is better for people who can not see so good, because on the 
easy-to-use touch-screen you just have to click on the name and on the paper you have to mark a little box behind the name. So the easy-to-use touch-screen is better for old people, so it can't come so easily to a wrong vote.

The person from the audio think that the technological vote is not so good, because they can get wrong in the counting. It says that the humans who would count it also could make mistakes, but computer could make it too and the computer were made by humans and so get also wrong or the computer could get haked.
There is also a little fear of technologie, because it gets often wrong. And like old people cant get what they have to do. 

The mashine for voting where not using often, just like once in two years. So it is not so safe as mashines where you get your money, because they get use everyday.
He said that there is no fully trust in the computer.
