In the USA there have always been problems with the voting system. Critics mention how unpractical the old voting system is, they would rather replace it with computerized voting systems. Their biggest critics are that some people, who maybe cannot see very well often vote for the wrong person.But there are many points against computerized voting. Firstly the voting on computers is easier for peopl, who usually use technology every day, but people who are not used to it may have big problems with the new system or might not go voting, because they fear the technics. Further it is not sure if the computers do less mistakes than humans, and if they do a mistake it would be much worse and influences the target more than a person forgetting around 10 ballots. even though we trust the tecnics from today, it was a long and heavy way to this security and safety within the modern tecnology. But different to tecnical voting systems, the tecnologys for banking for example are used every day an with this they are tested every day, while voting systems are less improved and tested and with this at the moment they are definetly less secure than the old voting system with counting by humans and with the opportunity of recounting, which is often not possible by uning computerized voting systems.
