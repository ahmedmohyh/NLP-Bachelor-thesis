The text is about the voting systems, which have a lot of problems. For example, people with bad eyesights could mark the wrong candidate. Also people could easily make mistakes, while counting this much cheats of paper, where the marks are on. 

The more trustworthy systems are the one´s with  a computer. But it´s also a problem, because there are a lot of persons, who don´t want to use them, because they are afraid of using technology. So because of that they are not included in voting for their candidate. An other porblem is, that computer are also made by humans so even in this programms could be a lot of mistakes. Computer systems are used daily so they have to be improved after using them a lot. The votings in the United States only take place every second or fourth year so maybe the computer systems are getting old with the time. Maybe because of this problem, the computer could make mistakes like miscoutings. But it´s actually better than counting the votes by people, because the computer system is able to do this automatically.
 
But because of the high technology today, people are able to improve them and make them more trustworthy. So in the future it´s more confortable to use computer voting sytems, because peolpe don´t have to count the marks and also bad eyeseeing people could give their vote more easily. Actually we need do find a compromise for the peope, who don´t want to use a computer.
