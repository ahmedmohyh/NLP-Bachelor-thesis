There are many people who want the current voting system in the US to be replaced with a new one. But of course there are also critics who think that this could make things even worse.
These people don't think that the idea to replace the paper ballots with computers to count the votes is very good, since there are many people in the US who aren't used to this technology, for example because they could never afford a computer. These people could be discouraged from voting at all. Also these critics say that using computers doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be any more mistakes with the counting of the votes. In their opinion, technology can make mistakes much worse than humans, since when officials miscount, it usually doesn't make such a big difference in the end (only a few votes) as when computers make a very big mistake and the votes can't be simply recounted again - after all, computers are just programmed by humans who also have flaws. Also the critics think that technology-voting systems aren't used frequently enough (usually every few years only) to provide a flawless work. Other systems like banking transaction are being trusted much more because they are used every day, so a possible mistake is discovered way sooner and can be repaired very fast. When this happens with the voting system, it can take quite long to find the mistake at all which could lead to a great damage in the results of the election.
