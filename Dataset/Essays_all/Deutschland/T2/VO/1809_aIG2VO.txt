te text is about voting systems in the united states.

the first argument is that critics say that current voting systems are inefficient. even they lead to inaccurate counting votes. so this system have to replaces with a technology way witch is on computers and mor efficient.

the big problem is that people vote for the wrong candidate. so their is a list with a lot of names and you have to mark the person you would like to vote. people with bad eyes easily can vote the wrong person because they mark a person under but thing they mark the right person. computers are better so you cansearch the name easier.

Another reason for the bad old system is the rely heavily way to count the votes.


so in the audio version the person who speaks says that the old system is better.

for banking etc it is good because the technology system is every day but the voting most only one or two times. so there can be many mistakes in the programm.


so all in all the text would like a computerized way, but the audio the old voting system.
