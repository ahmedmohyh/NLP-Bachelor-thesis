The voting system in the USA is full of mistakes and errors. Made by humans. The system is inefficient, mistakes happen at marking the names at vote because people can not see right and counting  more than thousand votes by hand leads automatically to mistakes. Computers could solve the problem. It would be quickly to count the votes, marking the names would be easy. But what is with these people who are not good with technology? It is easy for those who always use computers. What is with the others?
Moreover the programs counting the votes are made by humans. Mistakes in the program would not be surprising, but here the errors could be more fatal. Thousands of votes could get missing.
Besides the system in banks is improved because of the every day using. Voting is just two times a year.
