the text and the presentation were about the voting system in the usa. in the text it says that the current system is not the best and it should be changed because of many mistakes humans make while counting the ballots. the second reason why they want another system is that many people with poor eyesight might mark the wrong name. the fields where you can mark are so little that you could easily take a wrong one. so it is their wish to change the whole voting sytem into a technological computer voting. it might be easier for people to wote this way because it is modern and the problem of making miskakes while voting or counting is not as high as before.

in the presentation they had another opinion. they were against the technological way because not everybody has a computer or is able to use one. it is not fair to say the voting only take place on the computer and some people do not have one because they are too poor to buy one. it could also be that some people just stop voting because of their fear of technology. why should they buy a computer only for votings every second year. it is not necessery for them so they just stop voting. they should leave the system the way it is but they could bring computers to the place where the people come to vote so they do not have to buy one and there would also be someone to help them if thzey do not knoiw how to go on. or they could let the people decide how they want to vote and give them both methodes.
