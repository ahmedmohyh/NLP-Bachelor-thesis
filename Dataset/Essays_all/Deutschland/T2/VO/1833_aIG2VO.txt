The text and the audio are both criticising the traditional voting, by mentioning the problem of mistakes made by humans. They are also about the computerized voting system.
The audio is against the computerized voting because of the humans who were against technology or just have not used any computers yet. Another mentioned problem in the audio are the mistakes made by the persons which programm the copmuters. They are also humans who can make mistakes, but if a PC loses all votes they are lost for ever.

The good things about the computerized votig system are mentioned in the text. For example the banking system, it is about our money and we trust the computers. Why should not we trust the coputers by voting.
Computerized voting is also much easier, you just tap on a touchscreen and thats it. The PC also counts the votes directly whitout any counting mistakes. Another good thing of computerized voting, which is mentioned in the text is the automatically of computers. You need no count made by humans, no recount made by humans, no cotroll while voting made by humans... nothing exept electricity.
