Both sides have different oppinions on this topic. The woman in the speech is against the idea of useing a computersystem fot countig votes. She says that this systems are easier to use but that there are many problems with it. There are many people with no accses to computers in the country. These people would have big problems to cast a vote useing this system. Also older people who aren`t used to work with a computer would have problems to use this system. She says that it is normal that people make mistakes but these mistakes are much smaler than the ones a computersystem makes when it breaks down. In this case thousands of votes are useless. This would cause bigger problems than people can do. The opposite side has a completely other oppinion. The text says that the traditional voting system is inefficient and it leads to inaccurate counting of votes. That`s because many people could vote for the wrong candidate. they have to pick their candidate from a long list of people. that can cause a vote for the wrong candidate. Useing a computersystem is much better because it is easier to use and human errors aren´t possible, because the votes must not be counted by people. that means there can´t be any failures in counting the votes for the candidates.
