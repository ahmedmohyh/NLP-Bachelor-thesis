How to vote in the United States is a big point to discuss. Somebody have the opinion that the counting from the ballots should be done from computers and not from humans. Some others said that it should be count from humans because computers can not make it the way humans can. Maybe some people who do not use the computer so often have problems to use it when they should vote. Also they vote not so often in the United States that the people can learn it especially for voting. As cosequent they vote the wrong candidate then they want to vote and that is a bad mistake and can have bad consequences. Also it is not so bad when the humans who count the vote misses to count some but when the computer has an error maybe the votes are lost and can not be back. Also the computers are programmed by humans so they can have also mistakes and so it is the same if the people count the votes or the computers do. But someothers things that computers can remove the possibility of human errors and the major sources that some people vote the wrong candidate is not the problem any more. Also it is a big work to count all the votes by humans because they have to count every vote by themselves. Also it is easier to find the name they want to vote in a computer programm than on a large sheet of paper. Also the humans use the computers to do other really important things for example a banking transaction.
