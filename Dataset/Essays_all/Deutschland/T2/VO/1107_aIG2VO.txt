The speech and the text are about the using of modern technologies in votings instead of the traditional voting systems and their risks. On the one hand, computerized voting is easy for people that are using technologies in their daily life, but on the other hand, people who are not used with modern technologies, for example older people or even people who can not effort a computer, are not really able to work with modern voting systems. Another problem that is mentioned in the text is that the people who are counting votes in the traditional way of voting -mostly one by one- can always make mistakes and it can be really stressful to recount all the votes. But up to that, the modern voting systems are also designed and programmed by humans. This is why this programmes can also have faults and it can also happen that the votes have to be recounted; and in copmputer systems it´s nearly impossible to do that. 
Another point of the text that is different to the speech is that of course in our daily life technology is always there; In banking transitions or other systems that inhabit sensitive information we use technologies like they are used in the voting system. But like the author of the speech said, votings are not that often and the systems can not be improved that much like in banking systems eg.
