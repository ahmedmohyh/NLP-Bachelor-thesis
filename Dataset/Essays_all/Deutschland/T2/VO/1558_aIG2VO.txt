Traditonal voting systems were used other hundrets of years, but now we have a new area and the question is today: Are computerized votings more efficent than the traditional ones? 

Firstly computerized votings are better and easier for people with computer experience, but for them, which have not got these experience may have some problems with it. The next point is that the programm can failed and remove thousends of voting, if it have an error. Moreother computerized votings can remove human errors, because the programm count every voting and did not forget one vote. 
Computers improve every day for example in banks for banking transactions, but it needs a longe time to be as efficent as it is today. The elections are one time in two years, so these computer programms did not have the time to envolve and be so efficent.
