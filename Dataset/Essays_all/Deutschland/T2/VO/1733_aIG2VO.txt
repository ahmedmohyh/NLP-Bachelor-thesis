The text firstly implements that the traditional voting in the US is inefficient and so does the lecture too. They both explain that the votes are counted wrong often because humans tend to make mistakes in a long period of concentrating on counting the votes. Furthermore the text says that a great source of errors is the voting ballot itself: There are long lists given with the names of the candidates very small on it. Due to that the chance of ticking the wrong candidate by accident is quite high. Moreover people who can't see properly aren't able to read the lists in detail and the small mark they have to set is often set for the wrong candidate. Therefor it should be established voting with computerized systems because they are more reliable than humans. According to the text it's easier to vote because you just have to touch the candidate's name and computer systems also are really accurate in the banking branche so it would be easy to use it for voting too. In contrast to that stands the lecture. It says that computers are a easier compromise instead of voting traditionally but they also make mistakes. An error in a computer system causes a huge error in the votings which is worse than counting some ballots wrong. Due to the period of votings (only every 2 or 3 years) the systems aren't improved enough to stop such big errors and because of that the systems can't be fully trusted.
