Both text discuss the pro and cons of computerized voting. While the first text says that computer voting is more ifficent, due to the fact that miscounts and the false marking of the voting sheet can't happend anymore, the audio staits, that the computer voting system may only seem easier. 
The audio points out, that there are people who don't have a computer or can't afford it and people who are even affraid of using modern technology. These people wouldn't have the opportunity to vote, leading to a higher number of false votes or even no votes.
The fact, that a maschine, like a computer, does far less errors than a human, negotioats the audio. Instead it says, that computers are still manmade maschines, programmed by humans, and for that they can have errors too. These errors would be way more damaging than the ones caused by humans. In the case of an error from a human, in comparison to the computer,only a small amount of votes would be lost but in the case of an error caused by a computer, the results would be catastrophically, because thousand of votes could be lost or even be erased permanent.
At last the text says that people are already trusting computer, for example in banking transactions and the communication of highly sensitive information. The audio points out, that computer are used every day and that they are always exchange or improved, but voting happens only once or a few times in a year and it's harder to improve a system which is not used as frequently as a computer.
