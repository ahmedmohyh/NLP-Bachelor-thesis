In the following the American voting system is to be discussed, as there are several critics saying it was inaccurate and inefficient.
The main issue is the counting of the votes done by human beings. They make mistakes which lead to expensive recounts and sometimes even lead to a wrong result. A solution for this problem could be a computerized system, where the counting would be made by computers in order to be more efficient. But as said in the other text, computers aren't free from failure, especially when they are not used daily, like banking machines or in everyone's daily life. In addition to that, a mistake made by a computer would be even worse, as a recount would be impossible to make.
On the one hand, a computerized system would be easier to handle than the large piece of paper on which you can't easily find one candidate's name. On the other hand there are people that are not used to computers and would not be comfortable with a computerized voting system.
to conclude one can say that there are indeed some major problems in the traditional US-american voting system, but it is not confirmed, that a change of the system in a digital way would be working any better.
