In America is now the question,if computer are more efficient at voting counting, then humans. In this question there are two different views on the computer system. People say, that the computer system is inefficient and make mistakes too. At the votieng the humans must count thousands of votes, so there can make some mistakes. But a computer system was programmed by humans , so at the system can be mitakes too. A big Problem is, when a computer system has an error while counting the votes, in this caise America can lost a lot of votes, which are important. An other aspect is, that the voters can`t see on the paper, for who they vote. On the computer the voters can touched on the candidates to magnifi them, for a easier viewing.
