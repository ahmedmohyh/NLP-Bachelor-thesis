The voting system in the US is a traditional one. Many people claim it should be replaced by a modern system which relies on computers. 
Not everyone agrees with that though. People who usually don't work with computers and don't know how to use them might make mistakes and accedently vote for the wrong candidate. In addition they might be too embarrassed by their leaking knowledge about computers which could lead to them not attending public votings anymore.  
Another argument against modern voting systems is that the only mistakes people can make are missing a few ballots whilst a computer error might remove thousands of votes forever. To completly trust a computerized system it would take a long time because there aren't enough votings, e.g. in a year, to get fully comfortable with them and improve them as best as possible.
One thing seems obvious, a modern voting system doesn't necesserally improve votings and won't remove all the mistakes humans can possibly make. It isn't more efficient nor is it more trustworthy.
