The voting systems in the United States are inefficient. Computerized and the traditional way of voting have their pros and cons.
Voting on the ballot can be counted inacurrate, votes can get lost. Computerized voting is easier on counting. A programm counts the votes exactly and no mistakes are made.
Different to the counting error, people can make mistakes by voting accidentally for the wrong person. They have a bad eye-sight, read a similar name to their favourite candidate and pick the wrong politician. This can happen too by computerized voting, but these computers have an easy-to-touch-screen. The voters just touch the name to mark their candidate. There, its easier to read the names because of the zoom.
After the voting, the human error han take place in counting the votes. They have to count every sheet of paper one by one. A ballot can be missed or counted wrong. But even the computers can make mistakes. Errors arent safely excluded by the voting process. When the system stops working, the votes are lost. You cant get the votes back and count them one by one. Computerized voting is not a hundred percent safe, but fully trustful.
Mistakes can be very dramatic if an election is close between two candidates.
Nationwide computerized voting is too risky say some people, the computers work well by banking but not by voting.
