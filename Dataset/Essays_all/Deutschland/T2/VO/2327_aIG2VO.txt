The speech is about voting systems. It deals with the problems of traditional and new voting systems.
The text above says that the old and traditional voting system is inefficient, since the voting papers are very long with very much nmaes on it. So the names are very small and for some voters not easy to read. As a solution for the problem the text announced the using of electrical voting. 
The speech is against this solution, because it is not safe and for some people mot so easy to for with it like for other. First we have it is to say that not every person, espexialli the old one, work with computers or use computers in their daily work. In the case of a election there could be some probölems with the using of the election computers. Also the computers are not safe. Some votes can be missed or the votes of some voters are failed. The argument that we trust computer systems every day is a good one. But the opposition of this programm say that we use the election programm inly every four years. And the programs in the industry are not verxy good at the beginning. Day for day they become better and better. With the election  progrmam it is an other point. They been using not every day and so it is a very long time, that they get perfect.
