The recording of the woman is about the diffrent ways of votes for new gouverments or soemthing like this. The older way to vote is the traditional way with a long sheet of paper with a many names of the canditates, wich was presented in the text. The voters have to make a cross on the right name. Now the speaking woman says that in this case many mistakes can happen and problems come out. To solve this problems today there is a new way for votings, the computerized way. In this voting way the voters have to give theire vote on the computer. Now the speaker says that it is good for people but not easy for people, who dont can use a computer on there own, like old people ore people, who dont have enough money to buy a computer and then to learn how to use it. 
On the other side it is a good solution for the misscounts, that were shown in the text. This misscounts are easy to make, because thousands of voting papers have to get count of humans and it is normal, that the counters make mistakes if they count thousands of papers. In the new voting system the woman sees problems too. The programms of voting and the counting of the votes are programmed by humans too, so they can be mistakes too. In the text this points against the coputerized voting are not shown. Also the speaker says that computer programms are used daily so that there becomes a routine, wich can get problematic when everyone things that it is not so important to check the programms. This point is also just in the recording presented.
