The presentation about the voting system in the USA explained some problems which come with that voting system. Since there have been a lot of mistakes in voting, some people have asked to introduce a computerized system which should be used to count the votes, because a problem that often comes with the "old" voting system is that the reliabtility on officials who have to count the votes is too high and they can, in many cases, not be trusted, or that people with a bad sight might vote for the wrong cadidate. Although a lot of people like the idea of voting on a computer, this idea has also been critisized by another group of the us-american popultaion. They think it is too risky to trust technology and that the voting being computerized won't make it better than the current situation. Also, there are obviously some, especially elderly ,peoplewho are not used to using the computer on a daily basis and they might be afraid of technology, since they're old and, as mentioned earlier, just not used to it. It might be too expensive to buy a computer just for voting as well for some people. And if there is a "human error" or a human mistake, there is a great chance of the votes being misscounted. Another argument against the use of computerized voting systems is that the old voting system still works fine for most people and it is not necessary to introduce a new voting system, if the one being used right now is only being used once or twice a year anyway.
