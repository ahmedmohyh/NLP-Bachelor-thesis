The voting system in the united states is often discussed. There are groups, which support the old voting system and others, who expect the country to work on new voting systems. A lot of good points are made on the side of the "pro-new-voting" but also on the other side. 
Critics of the old system say,that the voting can be inefficient and that there is a lot of inaccurate counting. There are different ways a voting can be wrong. One way could be that the people accidentally vote for someone else. The sheet of paper is full of names and cadidates and its hard for people with poor eyesight to find the right name on the paper and so it often leads to people voting for the wrong candidate. An other way could be that the counters make a mistake. Officials must count up the vates one by one and if there is an error there has to be a long and very expensive recount. And this is where the new vating system could help. Computerized systems wouold help to remove the possibility of human errors. 
But there is also a group against the new votig system. Eventhough if a computer is correctly installed a computerized system could remove the possibility of human errors but on the other hand, the computers are installed by humans. They also say that if a human makes a counting mistake he misses a few counts, but if a computer makes a mistake there could be thousands of wrong names in the system and it would be nearly impossible to recount. Another point they made is that of course a coputerized system is easy to use for people who are used to work with electronic devises, but for people who dont know how to work with them its pretty hard and they could easily press the wrong vote. 
However on the one hand there are a lot of good point for the new computerized voting system but on the other hand there are also a lot of good points for the old voting system.
