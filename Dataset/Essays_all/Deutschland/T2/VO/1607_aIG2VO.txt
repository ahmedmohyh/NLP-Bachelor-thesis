This essay is about the discussion about the current voting system in the USA and if it's worth thinking about replacing it with a computerized voting. 

Some people from the audio which just played say it's doubtful to use computers because someone who isn't used to computers wouldn't get along with it and maybe cross the wrong vote. This argument is also used in the text which is the opposite position to the audio. An argument in the text is that people with wrong eyesight can easily make a wrong mark behind a candidate and that's why the voting should be computerized because it's touch controlled and therefore easier to use.
The audio brings the point that there could be a human error in the programm and that mistake could follow thousands of votes. Also they can't be recount if the mistake is in the programm. But the text states that there also mistakes made by humans now because they have to count many votes one by one.
Another point said in the audio is that the election don't happen regularly. They only happen every two years nationwide. Therefore it' difficult to correct mistakes.
The text says that it's more trustworthy to use computerized voting.
