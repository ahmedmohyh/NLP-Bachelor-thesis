The topic of the lecture was the idea of a digitalised voting system. The woman who was talking had some arguments that I want to sum up.
 
First of all she said that computers are not so easy to handle and some people will have struggle to deal with them. This could be a large issue because some people could be afraid to go voting and others could accidentally vote for the wrong person. The same argument is written in the text but there they say, that there are difficulties with the large sheet of paper and people have to find the name of the right candidate. In addition there are people with poor eyesight that can't find the right name. Another argument in the lecture is the question if computers are really better than human counting. The woman said, that computers were also made by humans. They could also make a mistake with the program on the computer and this would be much worse than some little mistakes which are made by human counting. Her answer to the argument, that there is other complex technology in our daily life is, that this technology had to be improved over a long time. The voting technology could just be improved very slow, because there aren't so many votings. Mistakes would be dramatic because thousands of votes could be wrong.
