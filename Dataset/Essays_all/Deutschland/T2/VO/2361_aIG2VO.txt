The Audio we heared was about tradiotional voting compeared to voting with an computer system, but it mainly focused on the negativ site of voting with computers and wheather it is really better than the traditional way of voting. The computer may be faster by counting the votes, but it has many flows. Flaws like how used voters are to computers. An older person mide not be as comfortable with it a young ones, who used tecnollogie almost daily. That could make it easier for older generations to vote for the right candidate or make them stop vote at all. Another aspect mentshend  in the audio was that computers are made from humans, who can make mistakes and an error in the maschien could be way worse that a forgotten count or another small human mistake by counting the votes. A totally differnt site of this showed the text, it says for example that human mistakes accur way more often than a computer error and need more time to be fixed. It also says differenty than the audio, that a computer would make it more easy to find the candidate you wannt to vote for and that humans trust computers with ather importand and personal information, so they could also learn to have faith in computers when it comes to voting.
