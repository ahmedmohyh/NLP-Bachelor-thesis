That the voting system in the United States is inefficient is clear up to this point, but what about a technological solution just like computerized voting. 
An argument against the normal process is, that there are too many names written down on the election sheet which is hard for some people to get used to. On the computer the people can magnifie the names so that even persons with poor eyesight can vote correctly. In the text it is said that another point that speeks for the computerized voting is that human errors like wrong counting are now distinguished because the voting is faster and done automatically. But there is one problem about it: artificial intelligence is made by humans and computers are programmed by them. So when a human makes a mistake during the programming process the computer has this error threw the whole election process. Another problem is that computers sometimes do not work like they should do, this can even happen during the elction process. And because the whole process is automatically done the counting data can possibly be lost after an error.
