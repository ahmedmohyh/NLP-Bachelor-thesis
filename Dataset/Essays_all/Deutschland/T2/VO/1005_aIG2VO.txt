The spoken lecture stated, that one should stick to the traditional voting system, since computerized voting machines can bring many problems with them.
First of all, it is admitted, that human errors can indeed happen, while counting the votes. However, errors can occur in the programm of a computer as well, which can lead to far more devastating consequences, like completely removing thousands of votes from the record. 
It is also stated, that computers aren't as "easy-to-use" as the written text mentioned it, since there are more than enough people, who don't use this sort of technology on a regular basis, thus one does not know how to properly use it, which might even lead to the fear of voting as a whole. 
It is also said that while people use technology for banking and communication on a daily basis, votings happen rather rarely, twice a year at most in terms of local votings. Because of this, one does not have the ability to improve the programms sufficiently, which makes errors in the system more likely. 
However, it is not denied, that humans counting the votes will make a few miscounts inevitable, but at least a physical record of the ballots are available to recount the votes, whereas an error in the programm could be very hard to spot.
So one could say, that the message the lecture provided, is that humans do make mistakes, but saying a computer doesn't is rather foolish, since it's a human who built it, after all.
