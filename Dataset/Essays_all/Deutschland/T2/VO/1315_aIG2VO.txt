The texts were about the voting system of the USA. The voting system their is very old and many people say that they need to improver or update it. People wizh eye problems cant really see ever candidate on the ballot so its really possible that they mark the "wrong" person. So the critics want computers to be used to vote. So their the voters can see every candidate orderd and people with poor eyesight can look closly. Also the ballots get counted by hand and with thousands and thousands ballots per human you must expect counting errors. The text now said that computer will solve this problems bcause they can count many ballots in a really short time without any errors.The audio outherwise said that human errors could also be in programs of the computer and this errors will be much heavier than some small counting errors made by hand. Laso the critics said that we trust computers in pretty much every other live situation why shouldnt we trust them in the election? The audio refused this argument caused these programs also had their problems at the beginning and they are udes daily and heavily so they can get improved every day and because the election is just every 4 years it will take much longer to improve this system. Also theier is another problem with a computer voting system, not everybody is used to a computer especially older people. so they cam make mistakes. Laso not everybody can afford a computer so this people cant vote.
So the opinions are very splitted, because some people think the system is to old it neeeds to get improved and others say its to much of a risk and errors will be really much of a problem.
