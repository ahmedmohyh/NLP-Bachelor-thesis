The question is if the votiong system of the United States should be replaced with a computerized voting system.
One point is that the traditional voting system often leads to counting mistakes. The computerized system would count all the votes trustworthy and a lot faster. A problem is that a lot of people are not used to use the computer. This "fear of technologie" could lead to wrong votes because the people do not know how the deal with the new system. But it is the same thing with ne traditional system. It is quite difficult for the voters to find the name of their candidate on the ballot. In both systems is a risk to make mistakes. An error leads to an expensive recount but when the computer makes a mistake what can also easily happen because is is made by human thousants of votes could be counted wrong. Of couse the bank system is a computerizes system, which works well but it is used every day and not just about two times a year. As we can see there are cons and pros and it is difficult to decide which one would be the best decision.
