The recorded presentation shows the critical point of view regarding the use of computerized voting systems which is the opposite of the opinion the given text explains. In the presentation, it is mentioned that it's doubtful that computerized voting systems would be better than traditional ones, while the text points out that there are many problems which can be caused by the traditional voting system. First of all, it's said in the presentation that there can be a huge difference between people who often use computers and people who have no experience  with computer technology, which can lead to mistakes because there might be people who are scared of the technology they have to use. In contrast to that, the text says that computerized voting systems could make voting easier because especially people with poor eyesight are able to make the names of the candidates bigger, which causes less mistakes. Another point of the recorded presentation is that humans programme such systems and humans also can make mistakes, which means that one single mistake in a system can have fatal causes regarding the couting of votes. This fact can be seen as the opposite of the argument mentioned in the text that the traditional counting of votes one by one has a high possibility of being incorrect. 
Finally, the argument that there's almost no risk because we use complicated computer systems every day in many domains which is explained in the text is also a contrast to the recording, in which it's mentioned that the typical often-used computerizes banking systems etc. are already improved because of their heavy use; on the other hand, voting happens less often which means that there isn't a possibility to develope and improve such computerized voting systems and makes mistakes less obvious and also more risky.
