The speaker mensioned that a computerized voting system would solve the problem of inefficiency of the todays voting system. People without computer-knowledge aren't used to computers so for those the voting would me more complicated than before. In the text they said that a computer voting system solve the problem of inefficiecy because it's much easier to click a candidate's name than to search for the name and to fill in a sheet. 
Another major problem that was mensioned by the speaker is a error in the program: often it is said that computer systems alwyas do right things but if a mistake happens in the computerprogram itself (which was written by human) the following miscount would be very high. The text said that computerprograms in generell are always faster in countering things. Added to that mistakes like miscounting often happed by human.
To conclude both (text/speaker) clarified aspects which stand for or against a computer voting systems. But in the future everybody must be able to use a computer.
