Voting is always an interesting topic but during the last years some new points about it came up. 
Especially in the United States the common way of voting is criticied by experts. Many people think that it would be a better way to vote with computers. Some persons are making mistakes while voting because they don´t understand it. Giving votes with a touch screen an counting these votes with another computer would be easier, faster and better because people can´t count these votes without making mistakes. 
But on the others side like it was told there are people who can´t get along with technology so well and through that there still will be mistakes. Another point is that computers can do mistakes too because they were made by human. 
To sum it up there are different opinions but you have to mind that the technology improved alot during the last years and there are many parts of our daily life which are just working through it.
