The US-american voting systems are today heavily critisized because of an inaccurate counting of vote. Therefore digitalized voting systems are discussed to be introduced. Nonetheless people have their doubts on whether a computer voting system can actually improve the current problems of wrong voting because of sight problems and faults in counting. Possibly, people who are not used to computers might have problems to handle the new system, if they do not stay at home due to their technophobia. A modernized system could exclude potential voters, whereas they can also make voting easier to people suffering from sight problems by magnifying the font. Still computers aren't perfect and absolutely reliable as they were programmed by human. The impact a single vote counter could cause by missing some ballots is marginal compared to a problem of the voting program. Maybe a recount will be impossible just as data are lighter than a paper ballot. A bit of more accuracy would have a risky price. Sure, computers are also being used for "communication of highly sensitive information" and among the financial world, but these systems have been introduced over long term with continuous development. Digital voting systems have not yet been developed or tested and therefore cannot guarantee security for such sensitive data, the US-american votes.
