The adio document was about the idea of using computerized voting instead of traditional voting. The lecturer is an opponent of that strategie. First of all, she believes that some people that are not used to the usage of computers might be discouraged to vote because of their fear of technology. They could even cast a wrong vote because of their lack of experience with computers. Also, the programms for computerized voting are made by humans and humans make mistakes. It would be fatal to have errors in a computerized voting process because of an error in the voting programm. A recount would be nearly impossible. Some people in favor of computerized voting say, that the people also trust and rely on banking softwares, so why should they not trust the computerized voting software? The lecturers response to this is that the banking system is used on a daily basis and has been improved over a long period of time to now be reliable. The people simply do not vote often enough to achieve this reliability for computerized voting systems.
Compared to the adio docuemnt, the author of the text is a supporter of computerized voting. He believes that the ballots that are traditionally used for voting are too complicated and therefore the people would accideltly vote the wrong candidate. Also, the traditional system relies on people counting the votes. These people could make a mistake in counting which the computer systems according to the author would not make. Compared to the lecturer of the audio, he believes that the computerized voting systems are equally reliable as the online banking systems that so many people trust and use on a daily basis.
