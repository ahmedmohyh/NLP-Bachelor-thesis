In the heard lecture were arguments confronting the text which will now be summarised. The first argument was that some people could have no experience with computers of even fear the technology and thus could also vote for the wrong candidate. The latter problem also is written in the text but there they say that it occures by accidently making the mark on the wrong candidate because there are so many names on the sheet and they are so small written. Another argument is that computers can also have errors like people that miscount the votes. Furthermore the problems computers can have may have a much bigger impact on the voting. It is also said that computer programms that are designed for banking transaction are used daily and get updated frequently so they get much more reliable but the programms used vor voting are only used every two years and thus dont get updated that often.
