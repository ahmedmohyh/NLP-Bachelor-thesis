People that are not used to work with computers, more often the elders, might cast a wrong vote or they dont even want to vote anymore because they just dont trust computers. Computers are made by men. If there is an error with it, it has a weigh larger effect on the counting of votes then it might have if a human countsw them and makes one or two little mistakes. Furthermore these systems have to be created, tested and improved, such as those we usse daily.

At the beginning the text givs the point that mistakes might have a more heavy issue if the contest is very close.
But if a computer does a `little` mistake, that can make a contest that is not that close, way closer, it would just have a way bigger effect on the final facts.
Next the text gives us the problem with people with poor eyesight. On the one hand, they could get glasses because they know they are going to vote and it is important to be able to read. On the other hand, the use of computers may have a lowing effect on the amount of voters because not everyone is familiar with a computer. Some might even be scared of the Idea that machines count their vote for such important things, that there is an election.
Then the text is about the counting of the votes and probable mistakes made by men. Computers are programmed by men and if there is a `little` mistake, it has a way heavier effect. And there cant be a recount of the votes because they dont physically exist.
In the end the texxt gives us examples of thechs, we use daily. Those have been working on 24/7 for improvemnt because they are used 24/7. The more these systems are used, the more mistakes are found fast and can be corrected in an efficient way. To be able to trust a system we have to be able to use it. But if we cant trust it because we didnt used it before it may never become used because we could trust it if we tried it.

The positive thing about computers is, they do what you tell them. The negative is, they do, what you tell them.
