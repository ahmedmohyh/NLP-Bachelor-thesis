The woman´s speech disagrees with the arguments of the text, in which it is recommanded to use technical devices for votes, instead of the traditional papers, that are still counted one by one by officials. 
The text´s first point of the papers being hard to read for people with poor eyesight because of the huge number of different names that are on it, leads to their conclusion, that touch- screen technology could solve the problem by being way easier to use. The lady does not agree with this point in her speech. She critizises,that technical devices can only make the voting easier, if the voter himself is already used to technical devices. Therefore, old people would often have it harder than younger voters.
The text praises technology to eliminate human errors, which are "almost inevitable" if officials have to count the votes one by one. A computer system would also be able to work quickly and automatically.
The lady disagrees again by requestioning computer systems. If humans themselves created these systems, how can they surely be free of human errors then? She adds another doubt, as she declines human errors as harmless compared to the consequences of technical mistakes. If an official doesn´t count one vote it is actually just that one vote that is missing in the statistics. If a computer is not working the right way, the consequences could be huge and hundrets of votes could be affected.
