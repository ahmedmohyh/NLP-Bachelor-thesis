Firstly the woman told us about the bad sides of computerized voting this is the oposide of the text we just read.Here we have a two faced topic on the one hand th current voting system or the traditional voting with a pen and a sheet of paper and on the other hand a new idea called computerized voting, with programms and a touch screen.
In traditional voting voters usually have to find the small written name of theire candidate,which could be very difficult for people with poor eyesight. In the opposite in computerized voting this could be more easy, becaus voters can use a touch screen to touch the candidates name they want to choose. To add the shocking fact, we coumpletly trust a machine, which is not very clever by itself, human error can be shown in not funktion programs. Therefore every machine we use today, didn't funktion very well, when it was introduced. On the one hand every computer technology is improved since the first day of introduction, on the other hand a good programm can spped the vote up and human error or personal human preferences are a big deal toady. For example in Nordreinwestfahlen some people did not count the votes for ''afD''. 
To come to a conclusion computerized systems cannot remove the possibillity of human error, becaus a computer programm always have errors and has to be improved.
