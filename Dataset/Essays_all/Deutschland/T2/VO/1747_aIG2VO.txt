The first point from critics is that many voters dont use computers and can get in trouble when they have to vote on  a computer. SO it can easy happen that they vote for the wrong person because they dont know how to deal with the computer system. This point is a argument against the first point of the text, that more people make the right vote. 

Also nobody can be sure if computers dont miss thousends of votes or get them wrong. Humans may miss a few or get them wrong but also they are physical counted. Nobody can check if  the computer has counted the vote right. The text says that humans make mistakes but the computer programs are developed by humans, so they can also have mistakes which can have a huge impact on a vote. 

The last argument is that banking transactions use computer systems that are used every day and long improved but a vote computer systerm would be only used every two years, so it cant be improved that fast and would have a great impact if something go wrong.
