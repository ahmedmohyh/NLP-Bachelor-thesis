Is the traditional voting or the computerized modern voting better for a state to vote for his government or his president etc.? 

The traditional voting is a voting with paper and pen so the voting is indíviduel and the errors of human can be imagen and is easier to know how to solve. But it is difficult to solve the errors, because the recount is expencive and they need many people to count the votes again. The people can easier use the wrong name
The computerized voting is a voting on a computer with touch-screen. A computer makes less mistakes then a human and it is quickly without needing so much people. The governments and individuals are using this technologies for also important and complex things. 
Using the computers is difficult for people don´t have the experience with such technologies. The mistakes are easier to solve, but it is difficult to kno how to solve the error.

So the both voting systems have their good and bad sides and to use one of them is the choice of the government
