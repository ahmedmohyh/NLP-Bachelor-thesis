Elections are a difficult action. Nowadaays it is an analoge action. People come to their alection point, get an paper and mark their favorite canidate. After alle have done it, some persons count one by one the votes. The test says that it is very risky thing, because humans make mistakes amd then they have to try it again, which costs a lot of time. Also humans make mistakes when they mark their canidate. It is really little and difficult to see, so it is possible that they vote for the false person. The text say that it would be a nice options to let computers make all the work. People vote on computer an they count the votes.  But people who have problems with reading litte letters, ot is poissible that they have also problems with working on computers. This is one point the listening version consider. The other point is that computer programms also made by humans. They could make mistakes or people could hack the programm. In addition to that thousand of votes get lost, when their is an error during count the votes. 
All in all you can see that there isn´t one really save way for an election process. Probably it would be the best when they make both ways, but then it is too much work for them. On top of that you don´t know what is right when there are different results, because first there could happen mistake and second you can´t be sure that all humans mark the same canidate in both processes.
