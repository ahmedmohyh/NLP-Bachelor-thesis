The text deals with the problem of traditional voting in the United States. It often happens that people vote for the wrong candidate because of the small voting papers. If the names are written too small and some people have poor eyesight it often accures that they mess up voting for the right candidate. To solve this problem the US wants to imploment a technology called "easy-to-use-touch-screen technology". Of course some people say it is too risky to imploment this technology and it could lead to trouble for people who don´t use computers.
Computerised voting could be a problem because they have to be programmed by normal people and it may happen that these computers doesn´t work properly. But the people don´t have to worry about that because the technology gets better every day. So it could be good or bad-but only the people have to choose.
