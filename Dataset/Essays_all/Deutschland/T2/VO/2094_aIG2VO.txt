In the text are a few arguments that can be filled together with the the presentation. In former times everybody in the USA voted on paper sheeds and even today it's the same but more and more people want a votingsystem on the computer. But can you trust a program made by human? Aren't there any problems or mistakes? Everybody makes mistakes that's no problem but in such a big Voting or Decision they can't have a mistake because if something was worng with any computer the hole voting can't be used. of course it's much easier to count the decisions of the people and even if you do it on a paper you can make mistakes but with a good structur in it you can manage it very nice. And you have thoose papers to count a second or third time if you thhink you made a mistake. But when you do it with a computer you have no other opinion than trust the result. Maybe it's easy to use but if there are people who can't work with a computer somebody has to help and then there are even people who have to sit there between the voting period so maybe the working time is the same than having papers. And you don't have any opportunity to not trust the system when they decided to work with computers during the next votings. They don't have so much vontigs that they don't have other oppinions than buying computers because it's much faster.
