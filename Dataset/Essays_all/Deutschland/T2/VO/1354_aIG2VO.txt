The given lecture comments on the topic of computerized votings in the USA.

First of all, the speaker is doubtful, if a computer election is better and more efficient than a traditional voting. While it may be true, that the younger generations will take advantage of it, the speaker questions, whether people, who are not used to computers, would go to the election at all. Furthermore, she argues that it is very likely that these people vote for the wrong party,because they do not know how to use the computer and misclick, contradicting the point in the given text, that computers will prevent wrong votes. Moreover, the speaker proves that the theory, that computers are free from any human error, is wrong. She claims that computer programs have errors, because they were made by humans, who do make errors. Thus, computers are full of human errors as well. She says that votes can be lost, the computer doesn't take the vote or even deletes a huge amount of votes.

To sum it all up, the speaker has a complete different opinion, than the author of the text. In her point of view, a computerized voting system would cause even more erros, than the traditional voting system does nowadays.
