My essay is about the problems of the voting systems in the United States. There the traditional voting system with human counters and the sheet of paper, where yiu can cross the name or the easy-to-touch-screen technology with the computer. They've both pro and contra sides. The first good thing about the computer voting is, that the people with the poor eyesight or old people cant mark the wrong name. Thats nearly impossible. The name is easier to choose in the computer-version. But the problem is, that a lot of people still cant use a computer and are not able to vote then. The problem with human-voting system is, that human are doing a lot of mistakes. Thats normal but this miscounts can be a really big problem if the election is closely contested. But the computer are not better. They're programed by humans, and its a bigger problem, if a computer miscounts 10000 votes, then a human, who just miscount 3-6. But the good side on the computer-voting is, that you dont need to count the votes one by one. This needs a lot of time. The computer is doing this a lot faster.
