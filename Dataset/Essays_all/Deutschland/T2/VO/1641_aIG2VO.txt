The text says that critics want the tarditional voting systme back because it is more efficient and better that the new one. In comparison to the lecture where it is said that both systems have problems and do not work flawless. It is  common that people who do not use the computer that often will get problems in using it. They do not know how to work with it or just how to vote for a candidate. The text and the lecture say that it is normal that people make mistakes in ballots. In the text it is said that it is much easier to use the computerized voting systems but in the talk it is said that the new systems lead to mistakes because humans develop this systems. That means that every human is able to make mistakes because it is really normal. The text says that old voting systems are heavily to count but it was said in the lecture that in computerized votings are not no records of votings either. In the internet or just on the computer can be things which get lost and suddenly are away and noone is able to find them. It is said in the lecture that computerized systems have to be improved beacuse they are made by humans while the text says that it is a perfect technology for sensitive information. 
To sum it up you can see that the computerized voting system and the traditional voting system are not as good as many people think. Both systems are not flawless and need to be improved.
