The voting systems in the United States are inefficient, because they want to use computer of course it is better for people who had a computer but what are doing the people they haven't a computer. The system with the computer is good because they do a better job  and to count the votes is better too and faster. But the computer can do many mistakes and this is not good for the votings system. You can vote everyone and the voting is once a years.
The text means that many people vote for the wrong person because it is really difficult to see who they vote on the old voting systeme. Even so it is fifficulter to count the votes in the old voting systeme. The compouter systeme is easy and quickly but of course it is risky to do mistakes in the programm. But poor people who haven't a computer they must do the old voting systeme, but on a computer they can see the name easier. 
It is better to use the old one because everyone can do this and it isn't so difficult the write the name clean. The computer systeme is a good idea but this cant use everyone and to make the both options it is really complicated for the people.
