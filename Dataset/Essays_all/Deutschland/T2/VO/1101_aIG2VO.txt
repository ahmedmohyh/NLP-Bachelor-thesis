In a society like ours, people seem to question almost everything and everyone has a different opinion. The best example might be the voting systems. Two crosses on a sheet of paper, can make a huge difference. Probably the most important decision you have to make in your whole life. But are those sheets of paper really efficient enough to make the next president? It can easily happen, that you make the wrong cross. People with bad eye conditions could accidently vote for a person just because they are not able to see who they are voting for. That should definetly not happen. That is why people are considering computerized voting systems, which might be a great solution for some issues that show up with the traditional voting systems. They are easy to use and you can magnify the the names for an easier viewing. Another good point is that in contrast to the traditional voting systems, the computer can count the votes, so you know how many people have voted.
