In the lecture on criticisms of electronic voting systems in the USA, it is asserted that, since computers have only been around during a relatively recent era, they do not yet function flawlessly; instead, they are subject to human-imposed mistakes, which cannot be erased because they are often due to flawed programming, such as the accidental removal of candidates/votes, wrong votes etc. However, the text, which gives an overall view on the topic as well as some advantages of these new systems, it is explained that these mistakes are happening with the current paper ballot voting system, too, because the lists with the candidates are very confusing and require a lot of focus when trying to vote for a candidate.
Computers being a very recent invention can also lead you to the conclusion that not all people are used to working with these systems, which can cause the discouragement of these presumably older individuals from voting at all or mistakes due to misuse of the computer system. Contrarily, the text states that paper ballots are not as easy-to-handle as the computer program that is planned to be introduced because the latter is much more reliable and can be adapted to the eyesight of the voter.
