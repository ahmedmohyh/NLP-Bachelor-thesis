Twice a year, in the USA take place national elections. Year after year the countings of the american votes are always critizised. The main argument is the fact of human errors which can easily influence the result of the voting. Furthermore it´s a fact that traditional voting systems are much more work than the modern ones.
In times of developing technology it´s a question of time that these traditional voting systems will be replaced by new computerized voting systems.The presentation we listend to had much more doubts against these technical devices. So the first important argument against the modern systems is, that maybe the computers are not that well developed as most of the people think. If there are mistakes of these computer systems the influence to the voting results is much more bigger than less human errors. Another aspect is the missing education of people with this kind of technology, so the danger of human errors is also given here. In some states of the USA the traditional voting sheets are already replaced by tablets. The hope is to have a clearer result of each voter.
To find a conclusion you can see  that the replacement at national votings are highly controversal and the modern devices are still full of doubts.
