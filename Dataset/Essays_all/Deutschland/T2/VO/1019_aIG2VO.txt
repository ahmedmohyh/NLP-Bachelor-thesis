In the following text i am going to summarise the arguments form the audio and explain how they stand in contrast to the arguments from the text. I will give an argument and explain it, after that i am going to put in contrast to the text.

The first argument from the audio is that old people or people that can not afford such technologie will have troubles voting because they are not used to computers. They might vote the wrong person or do not vote at all because they do not understand it or even fear technology. But in the text the author brings up the argument that old people or people with a bad eye sight vote the wrong person in the old system as the names on the big ballot are too small for them to read and that computer can zoom into the ballot so that even people with an poor eye sight can read the names.
The second argument in the audio is that human error can be in the programm as well and that these errors can be more serious than the human errors in the current voting system. As in the current system they might count one vote for two but the computers could delete several thousand vote with a back up that would be fatal. The text just brings up the miscounting by the people.
The last argument from the audio is that the banking system is used daily and had it's problems the beginng and a new voting system would only be used every few years and will have mistakes at the beginning as well. The text argues that everyone realtes on computers in their daily life and tha the argument that the new voting system would not be safe enought does not count because of that.

To summarise the audio takes the arguments from the text and gives reasons why the arguments from the text are not thougt through enough yet. So the author of the text thinks that a new voting system based on computers would be better and the person from the audio thinks that the current system is good enought.
