The following text is an essy about voting on an example of america.

The voting system in america is very inefficient. It was count form men one by one. But when humans count the votes mistakes can happen. So a computer is a better option. But when you use a computer you have many big problems. The old society is one of it. Because many old people didn't know how a computer works so, if america want to use computer every older person must go to a computer workshop. The second big problem is the programming. Humans make mistakes and humans programm the computers. So if a person programm something wrong the whole elcetion can't use. And the hardware can broken, so the whole computer is out of order. Furthermore, computer can be hacked so the votes are not "save". So the inefficent way is the safest why.
But if you use computers you can help your envoiroment, because you don't need to cut down any trees for the voting-sheets. Another problem is when you use touch display computers is when it rains and many people touch on the computer with wet fingers the computer don't know which candiate you want.

So computers are good but not safe enought.
