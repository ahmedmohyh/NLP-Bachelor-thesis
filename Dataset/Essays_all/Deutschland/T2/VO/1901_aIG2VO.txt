The text is about voting in the United States and the problems which are when you vote with or without the computer.
The first argument from the lissining part is that many people have problems or can easily make mistake because not everyone can be good at the computer.
At the other side it is easier to vote with the computer because you can better see what you want to mark. But the lissining part and the text also says that computers has mistakes too because the computerprograms are made by humans and humans makes mistakes. All in all is the text and the lissining part at the same direction because both methods are not perfect.
