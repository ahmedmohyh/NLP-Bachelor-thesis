The woman giving the presentation agrees that people do mistakes and that they miscount. But she thinks that computerized voting machines would not do any better because the programms the machines work with are made by humans and we as humans could programm this mistakes into the machines. This could lead to a even bigger risk of miscounting without even knowing or recognizing it. So she disagrees  with the text in the aspect that computerized machines would not do any mistakes. 
Furthermore she says that these voting machines would exclude the part of the citizens of the United States who are not used to computers or even fear technology. They could not vote because they just would not understand the technology. Other than the text which says that these computers could make it easier for people with poor eyesight than the ballots she thinks they would make it harder for them.
In the end she critizises that every new methode has to be improved after the first few practically uses. But the national voting only takes place every two years. So there would not be enough time and enough tries to improve the machines seriously. She does not even want to give it a try like the text does.
