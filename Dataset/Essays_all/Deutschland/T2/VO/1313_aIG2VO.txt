In the Text and also in the speech is said, taht the voting system in the United States have two major broblems.

The first problem is the voting by an easy - to - use touch - screen. It´s produced for older people to make it easyer for them to go voting, because they can´t find the fields whrere they should fill in their votes for example. But it isn´t easyer for them to vote on a computer because many of the older people doesn´t know how to use a computer and maybe cast a wrong candidate.
The other major problem is, that the voutes gets couted by a computersystem. The Problem is, that these systems are made from humans and humans make mistakes. That´s why computers could have a programm problam infakt many votes get lost. Forthermore the votes can onely get counted one time, to garanty the anonymity of the votes, but if a computer gets votes missed, it´s unpossible to recount the votes. Misscounting can also happen, bacaus older computers. Tehy are counting the votes one by one, so it´s nearly inevitable, that out of milloions of votings not even one vote gets lost. 
Finally the Problems are to difficult technics at the one hand, and on the other the misscounting an wrong casts by the voters.
