In only one day in two years the people vote at the moment it's the question that they vote on easy-to-use touch screen technology or vote on the paper?


The vote on the computer make the whole thing easier because the most people use the computer every day and they did'nt need help with´, but at the other side the old people who hasn't an computer they don't know what to do so they have trouble. The most people are scared about it to trust the computer but it's safer than the papers, the most people do online banking too and they trust it too. The officals did'nt go every ballot they have a programm that do anything for them.With old computer programs they will do often mistakes and that's not good for the vote, because they have thousands of ballots and thats clear that make mistakes. The officals must often count up the votes . It's also one day in two years thats not so bad when a vote is not so good.
