But many people are afraid of the technology and also computer can make mistakes becaus they are programmed humans. A problem in the computersystem would make a lot more problems becaus nobody would prove it. The system had also to be proved every day and elections are just every two years. This facts are in contrast to the authers arguments beause he sais that the voting on a large sheet of paper is ineffiziend becaus they have to find thhe name of  their candidate on a long sheet of paper and also people with poor eyesiht can easily make a mistake. Computters are easy to use. So we should give this technology a chance because we use it every day for example for important banking  transactions or for highly sensitive informations.
