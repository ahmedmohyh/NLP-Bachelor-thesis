The presentation about the current voting system in the United States and the text are generally opposite.

The speaker said that not everyone can afford or use a computer. And primarily older people could have fear of technology, what makes the old system better than a computerized voting system. On the other side the text says that just picking a candidate from the list can cause mistakes when there are people with bad eyesight or something compareable. It is hard to implement the system in the whole country though.
Furthermore the female presenter argumented that counting progressed by computers can lead to big mistakes when there is a problem with the programme or any other technical issues. The text gives the point that counting by people is way more annoying and can lead to smaller mistakes. It also takes a lot of time. Against these arguments the lady speaks about voting only being one time in a few years, so counting the choices is not that big of a deal.
 
While the text states his position that a new, computerized voting sytem would be better and easier, the presentation is on the opponent side that the old system is better. A good mix between both ideas would be to make up a possibility of voting by computer but also letting the old system there if people want to vote due it.
