In the lecture a women talked about the negative points of having a reformed voting system in the United States.
The idea was to eliminate the inaccurate counting of votes, but there are some points that speak against the replacing of the traditional system. For example is a major source of inaccuracy that the old counting system relies heavily on people that count the votes. The women brings up the idea that computers together with their programms are also only based on humans who wrote these specific programms and could also have some errors or technical difficulties from mistakes that a human made inside their code. When some votes are missing cause of mistakes officials made it is a smaller change to the actual outcome than an accuring error happening inside the code of a computerized counting system, which could delete all the votes out of a whole city or so. So she says that these systems need to be improved that they are correct 100% of the time and that people who aren't used to working with computers can use them easily and quick.

The text arguments fully against the women from the lecture. It says that the computerized system is much more trustworthy and efficent than the traditional, old system. It helps people who have to suffer with poor eyesight by having an easier viewing. Also the main problem of miscounts by officials doesn't matter for this new reformed way of voting. The counting is better and faster and you have the complete outcome with a much higher correctness. 

So both opinions have good arguments and it will take a long time if the programms are improved enough to use them.
