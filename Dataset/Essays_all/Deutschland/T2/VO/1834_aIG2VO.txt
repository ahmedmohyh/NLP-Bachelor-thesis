Is the the old voting on paper or the new on the computer the better one?
This is a struggle topic.
The text says, that computer votes could be damaged, so the vote isn't fair. 
It says that peolple vote the wrong person, because of the small marks on the sheed of paper next to the person they want to vote if they have bad eyesight. So finally the computers are in this case more better, because there it is easer to make these larger.

Another problem is, that people who deal with the resulate of the voting they make mistakes after a lot of them. 
In this case the audio says that the computer is made by humans too so they could do mistakes too.
IOn addition one one hand the text ist correct to trust in the technology like other concerns. But on the other hand is it not possible to develope these systems if votings arne only two years like in the USA.
Althogh the woman in the audio thinks people who are not able to deal with technology otr computers make mistakes forthat the voting is even unfair.

So it  is great problem to decide if it is better to choose the old voting system or the new with computers.
