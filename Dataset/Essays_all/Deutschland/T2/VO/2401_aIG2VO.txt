The text I just read lists arguments against traditional voting systems while in the speech there are listed arguments against computerized voting. In the following text I'm going to compare those point of views and explain them. 
One argument in the text is that  people with bad eyssight are likely to vote for a wrong person, because of the big list with loads of names written on it in a small size. That leads to the point where they don't put the mark where they want it to be.
Also those votes are being counted one by one which also leads to mistakes. That's why they are coming to the conclusion that computerized voting is more efficient and trustworthy.
But in the speech there are reasons given to overthink that again. First, not everybody has access to a computer or the internet. Many people can't afford it or have a fear of technology. 
Also it's not clear if the computerized voting is trustworthy. Errors might appear and cause a bigger loss of information.
