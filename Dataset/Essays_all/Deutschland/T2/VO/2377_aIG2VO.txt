<The audio explains the doubt some people have with replacing the old system of voting in the United States with a new modern system based on using computers. 

People do mistakes, it's normal, the referant says. Counting the votes physically of course can cause mistakes because they have to count many of the bullets. But in that case they may forgot just one vote. By using computer programms which are invented by humans can cause a bigger error. If the programm doesn't functionate many votes will be deleted. This cause a situation that costs thousands or millions of dollars.
An other argument is that older people often can not afford to the modern system like computers are. They are probably confused and that may lead to mistakes by voting the right candidate. Also they may have an fear using such systems. There are advantages in using computers of course like zooming for people with a poor eyesight but the referant criticises that because of the many disadvantages. 
Also you have to know, that elections aren't every year and it's like a tradition for some people and so you are going to destroy this kind of culture.

In the end she asks if it's useful to replace the old system if we aren't quite sure about the errors that the new modern system could cause. Also she criticise the fact if it's truly necessary.
