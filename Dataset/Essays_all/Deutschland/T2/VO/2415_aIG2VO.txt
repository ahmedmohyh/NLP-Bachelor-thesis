Computerized voting can solve old problems. With this new system some people with poor eyesight are not able to click the wrong name of a candidate because on the old voting sheets the mark next to the names were really small so they had problems. Some people do not like to go for the vote and with this system they can easily do it and can even stay at home.
But of course there are some problems which makes this system untrusty. It is possible that there is an error so thousands of votings will gets lost and even if its not an error it is still possible that people can hack it, so those people get what they want and they can do what they want. Besides that some people do not have a computer so they cannot vote or they have to do both; the computer system and the classic vote system.
But some of these problems can easily be solved. For example the people with poor eyesight can get some help of people who work there. 
Those people who don´t have a computer can get a basic computer from the state and they are not really expensive and so on.
