One the one hand, citics of the US voting system have problems with the errors that could occur during the counting of the ballots and the problems thatcould arise for the voters themselves. Especially old peolple have problenms with reading the ballot sheets and might not vote for their preferred candidate because of that. During the counting of thousands of votes there is a high possibility that threre will be errors. 
The cirtics want to replace the traditionbal system with a computerized system beacues of these reasons. A computerized sytsem would have the possibility to magnify the names on the screen and the counting of the votes would be much faster and more reliable. A computer is prograammed to count the votes and it would not do any errors because of fatigue or any other reason. Many people are afraid of such a system but it is used in the banking sector already and people trust that system since it is working. So why should it be any different for voting?
One the other hand, many people say that the computer system has flaws just like the traditionaal system since it is programmed by humans. The difference is that an error in the computer system would have a much bigger effect that just a few miscounted votes. There would be no way to recount sice there is no paper record. There is also the problem of understanding this new technology. It is no problem for young people but old people who are nor familiar with computers might have a problem during the voting process or might not even go voting at all. The banking system was prefected over time since it is used daily unlike the voting system
