The speaker heavily criticizes a possible implement of a complex voting computer system. It is said to be doubtful if the majority of voters can rely on or are encouraged by a computerized voting because there are still many people who don't regulary make use of computers and have not learned how to use them correctly. This may cause inaccuracies while voting as well as hinder people from voting due to their fear of technology. They add that, while a manual voting system can lead to mistakes due to human error, computers are programmed by humans, which does not ensure for no mistakes to happen and will cause fatal mistakes if it is not programmed correctly, possibly damaging the whole election in comparison to minor faults in the counting of votes within the traditional system. These points were all made to oppose the text's claim that a computerized voting system would surely lead to less miscounts and a more accurate election. In order to prove the text's last argument wrong, the speaker pointed out that the computer systems used for banking transactions and communication have been used for a longer period of time and while now they have improved massively and have very little mistakes, they didn't work that well when people just started using them. Years and years of progress in technology had to be made for them to function like they do now and looking at how few times there are elections in the U.S, it would make no sense to begin using a computerized voting system as it would not hold accountable for fewer mistakes than the manual one, at least the first years of it's use.
