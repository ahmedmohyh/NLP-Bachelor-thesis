Voting is a high discussed topic - espacially in the US. There are many ways to vote for somebody but also many problems which could make bigger problems. The text says that the voting systems are inefficient and the fact that the votes are counted by people could easily lead to misscounts. For too older people the large sheet with much information could be to difficult to read. An alternative that is given is to vote at computers. A computer would count the votes quickly and would not make mistakes like people do when counting votes. But thats the point where the presentation says something different. America should stay to the voting system which is used now. Also computers could be too difficult for older people because they often do not know the technology. Therefore, they could easily vote for the wrong person and somebody like Donald Trump would be the president. The computer could be very dangerous because it can also make worse mistakes than the people because it could delete all the votes or hackers could get into the systems and could easily manipulate the votes. The amount of mistakes of the computer could be higher than those of the people because the people would only forget a few votes - the computer would probably forget all of the votes. So the presentation contradicts to the text and would rather stay by a method which is used and experienced than trying a new method which is unexperienced and could maybe delete the votes.
