The speaker strongly opposes to the concept of computerized voting systems. First, he argues that the computerized method would be inaccurate too, because some people are not accustomed to computers, thus might be discouraged to vote or vote for the wrong candidate accidentally. Some people considered technology a threat, which would lead to a lower turnout of the poll. Then the speaker claims that computer systems are not anywhere near flawless, since they are also made by humans. According to the speaker, computer errors are even far more severe than a human mistake when counting the ballots, because an error in the computer programm would affect every vote. Moreover, as opposed to the traditional counting system, a recount in the computerized system is impossible.
The author argues that other computer technology had to be improved often, and is chiefly used on a daily basis.
The voting system wouldn't be used regularly, so errors are very likely to occur.
Unlike the author of the text, the speaker prefers the traditional voting system, which is reliable even though it might not by completely flawless.
