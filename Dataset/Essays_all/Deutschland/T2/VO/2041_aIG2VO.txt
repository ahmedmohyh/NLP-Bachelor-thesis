In the speech, the speaker is against a new voting system concerning computers. She says, voting on the computer is only for ones often using computer easier. But if a person not work with PCs, it doesn't differ to the traditional voting. In contrast to the speech it's said in  the text that voting on the computer is much easier to work with and easier to handle, especially for people with poor eyesight. The voting machine have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology and are easy to understand. 
The speaker points out that technology also makes mistakes and that the efficiency of computers and technology in the working area got better and better with the time. In the beginning, there were many mistakes and problems with the technology but as the time came, the technology improved. So if the vote would be done digital, there would be many problems and mistakes in the programm and the votes wouldn't work. 
In the text there isn't said something about mistakes of thechnology; there are only human mistakes. Humans can forget a ballot or put it back to the others but computer can't. If a human makes a mistakes, there has to be a big recount of the votes. In contrast, the speaker says that if there is a problem with the system of the computer, it isn't possible to recount the votes. Everything would be deleted and there would have to be a new vote.
The biggest difference from the text to the speech is, that the speech is against a new voting system and the text is for a new one.
