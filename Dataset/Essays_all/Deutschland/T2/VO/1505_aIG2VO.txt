The audio warns the listeners about raplacing traditional voting systems withdigital systems in the USA. 
It is said that that thee computer technology would have many flaws due nto the fact that they are developed by humans. It is very natural that humans make mistakes which will cause even bigger mistakes in counting the votes by the computerized system. Another point is that these flaws would not be detected soon since elections are made in the USA quite sparingly.
Furthermore it is said that many citizens would avoid to vote because they are afraid of using technologies that they are not used to. Mistakes would even be made by citizens that do not use modern tchnologies like computers on a regular basis like their daily life that would result in an inefficient and inaccurate voting systems 


However, in contrast to this it is said in the text that digital voting systems have a lot advantages over traditional systems: Computerized voting systems would reduce or even eliminate mistakes done by counting the votes on the ballot. In addition citizens would be supported with information of the election and the candidates by the computers so that everybody votes his "correct" candidate.

Thus nobody would be discriminated against as long as every has the opportunity vote for their elceted candidate.
