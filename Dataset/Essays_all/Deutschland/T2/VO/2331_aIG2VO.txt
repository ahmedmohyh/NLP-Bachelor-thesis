The voting in the United States has some problems. Now the Government has to decide how to go on with voting and which system is to use. 
On the one hand there are some critics say that traditionalvoting is leading to a wrong count of the votes or more worse the voters just voted for the wrong canditate, because the voting sheet isn't optimized for e.g. people with handicaps. Those cititcs also say that a computerized system avoid mistakes like the wrong count of a voting or something else. 
On the other hand there is the opposition. These people think that a computer is programmed by a human and so it's has its problems. Maybe the computer missed a voting or just made a mistake that leads to a wrong count of a vote. They think that it would be easier for peolpe with handicaps to vote is not true. There are also people who cannot handle a computer and don't have the knowledge that other ones might have. These computers are used that much but not for voting. 
So it's hard to say which one is the better way of voting progress, because both of them have their problems and causing mistakes that leads to inaccurate counting of a vote. 
One thing is clear, though, a computerized system can be manipulated or hacked.
