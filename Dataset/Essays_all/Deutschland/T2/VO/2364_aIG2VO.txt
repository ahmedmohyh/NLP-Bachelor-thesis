One way is to use a computerized voting system: No more difficulties trying to find a on a long sheet of paper. Voters with bad eyesight can find names easily on a touchscreen and the officials don't have to count every single ballot, avoiding mistakes, that can cause errors costing recount progresses.
On the one hand it is a big deal for senior citizens. They are the ones who are going to have the most problims with the computerizing. It is possible that a whole few would avoid ging to vote just so they don't have to deal with the voting machines. This is one of the essues. The bigger issue is that nationalwide programmed voting machines are indeed programmed by humans and the same problem apears: human error. this can lead major pronlem as hackers trying to manipulate the election.
On the other hand there are more and more generations that are used to technology. Technology is everywhere: In banking transactions for example. The new generations are dealing with technology every day.
For them it seams easy. 
At some point it will be realistic to have computerized voting systems in thze USA.
