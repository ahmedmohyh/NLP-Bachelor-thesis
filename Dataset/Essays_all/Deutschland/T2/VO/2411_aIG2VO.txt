The presentation I've just heard there were several arguments against the use of computer technology in voting systems. 
Computerized voting is maybe easy for the ones who work daily with computers. They use them with confidence. But elders or other people who just don't have one or who are afraid of them cannot use computers to cast their votes. 
Of course, on a normal sheet of paper it is also possible to cast the wrong vote, but this makes a tie between computerized voting and traditional voting.
Furthermore, human error while counting the votes is said to be still possible, since the computer programmes that count the votes are made by humans. In traditional voting, human error is of course also possible. But in the text above computer programmes are considerd to be perfectly working, which is not the truth. In fact, nearly every computer programm has some mistakes in it. 
Banking systems or other technological helps are used on a daily basis so that they improved over the times. Voting systems must work flawless on their first attempt. You also cannot correct the couting if you find a mistake in it when you rely on computer sytstems. So the argument given in the  text above that says that one should trust computers because other systems work too is not a well- thought argument.
