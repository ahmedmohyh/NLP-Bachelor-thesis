The things the women said in her speech are arguments against the text above. In the speech the women are totally against computerising the elcetions in the United States. She said that voting on a computer would be easier but only for those who know how to work with it. For older peaople it could be harder to vote with a computer. The text says that it will be easier for everyone. People with poor eyesight can´t figure out wich canditate is the one for who they will vote. This old voting could lead to inaccurate counting and damaged elections. Even the counting lead to mistakes. It is really hard to count all the votes. It is easy to make mistakes. To solve this problem they want computerized votings. But in the speech she said that a technical error could lead to bigger misscounting than by humans. If the system have a problem it is hard to figure out and than the problem have to be solved. In the end they have to make the election again. Of course the most people know how to work with computer programs but only after it was improved again and again. The voting system have to be improved also, but it is not that easy because elections are not so often that the system could be developed very well.
