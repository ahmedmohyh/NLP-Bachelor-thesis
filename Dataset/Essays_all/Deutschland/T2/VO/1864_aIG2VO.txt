The record was about the computerized voting system who should be better than the normal voting system with humans.
But the computer could be a problem for those who haven´t a computer or those who don´t often work with one. 
As well it istn´t sure that computers don´t make mistakes. So it it better that a human make a mistake because then one vote is wrong but when the computer make a mistake the problem is a lot worse because the whole programm is broken and could destroy thousands of votes. And human errors could happen too because the computer programm is made from humans. The last aspect is that computer programms need improvment. So the computerized voting system as well but votings aren´t so often so it´s difficult to improve it. 
The writer of the text has another opinion. The computerized voting sytem is the solution because there aren´t human errors anymore and on the computer you can´t vote for the wrong person because you don´t see it right like on the paper. The text writer hasn´t look after any disadvantages and the record only critisize the computerized voting system.
