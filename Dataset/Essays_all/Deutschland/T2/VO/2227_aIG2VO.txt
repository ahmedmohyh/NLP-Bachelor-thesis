While some critics of the old election system want to replace the human made work with computerized voting machines, the speaker wants to warn that computerized voting systems might not work better.
Firstly she said that computerized votings could be convenient, if somebody is used to computers, but a  part in our society is  not. She mentioned the examples of not being able to afford a computer, having eye problems or untrusting technology in general.
In the text it is mentioned, that their can be some troubles if a person makes mistakes in couting(comp.l.8-12). That can change the result of a whole election if it was "closely contested" (l.2). In opposition the speaker remembers us that a program is made up by humans and humans make mistakes. So if there is maybe a defected program this could have a major effect, much worse than some miscounted numbers if one relies on people counting the votes.
Lastly the text told us that everyone believes in computerprograms daily when it comes  to banking transactionsfor instance. In contrast in the audio file, it was explained that these other programs are used daily and they had to be improved for years. Since an US eceltion is only every two years, there exists no chance to improve the system right away, so it could end terribly.
