The first argument the lecturer made was saying, that the people who aren't used to wirking with computers are more likely to have trouble with the system of the computer than with the system of the traditional vote. They may even have a fear of technoligy or are simply not able to get along with the system. This argument is opposing the one from the text, which says, that people also have trouble reading the names from the paper, which causes them to vote for the wrong person.
The next argument from the speech was a rethorical question to the audience, if they really think computers make less mistakes than humans. If an error on a computer happens, it may even come to the point where many votes are counted wrong or possibly even lost and that's a far more serious problem than the problems that will occure, if somebody counted the vote from a paper wrong, because the actual vote is not lost somewhere in the program but still on the vote sheet, which makes it easy to re-count it. This argument opposes the argument from the text, that humans tend to make more mistakes.
After that, the lecturer brought up the fact that the system for voting is maybe not yet ready to be used. This is because you only get to vote once or twice a year and the system hadn't really had time to develope yet. Many errors or problems in the system could come up, which could lead to major problems. This is put against the argument from the text, which says, that the people trust technical devices everyday with secret and important information.
