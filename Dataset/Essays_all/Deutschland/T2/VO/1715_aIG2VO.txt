The presantation was about the votingsystem and how computerized voting systems would make elections worse not better. It sais people may can`t effort computers and wouldn`t now how to use it so they could pic the wrong candidate or have fear of technologie and wouldn`t vote at all. Also if a program doesn`t run right it could cause very big trouble a humand wouldn`t cause that much trouble and there could be a recount witch isn`t possible with computers the data would be lost and it could destroi thousands of votes. It was said that most of the problems could be solved but that would take time because big elections happens only every two years in the US and you can solve problems only when you noticed them. The presantation disagreed with the opinion of the text. Unlike the Text it is against election with computers because of the problems it could cause but it doesn`t gave another solution. Also the text sais other coplex computer technology is used otherwide and the presantation said it is because the problems with this systems are solved now and that took some time.
