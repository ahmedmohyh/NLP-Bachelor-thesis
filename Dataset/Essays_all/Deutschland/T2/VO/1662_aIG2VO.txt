The question is, are elections leaded by computerized voting systems more efficient than elections leaded by human ability?
In the past there were problems with human mistakes while counting the votes or injustice because of unfair acting of the people who count the votes. Besides a computerized voting system could help people who can not see well.
But computerized voting systems are may not better.
People who are afriad of technology or can not use it how it has to be will maybe make mistakes while voting. 
Furthermore computer systems are created by human and there can be mistakes in the system. This would be much more problematic than one mistake by one person because the whole election could be wrong.
