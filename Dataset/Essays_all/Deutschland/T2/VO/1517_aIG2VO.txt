Critics say that the current voting systems in the United states are inefficient and that they lead to inaccurate counting of votes. So there is the question whether they should get rid of traditional voting or computerized voting. 
On the one hand, the traditional voting on a sheet of paper is easy to handle, because you only have to read and set a mark behind the name that you are voting for. But there is also a high risk given of accidentally marking the wrong name, because they write down all of the candidates. On the other hand, computerized voting is really easy to handle for the people that are used to work with computers. If people that can not afford computers or older people that did not grow up with social and the current media have to vote on a computer, that is probably one of the biggest problems. They would not be able to know how to use the computer to vote. And if you vote on the computer, you only have to find the name that you are voting for and then you just click on it. So there is also a high risk given of voting for the wrong person. People installed the computers, so they are probably never fully trusted. If you have to count the traditional votes, you need to collect all the sheets and count it by hand and if you have the computerized votes the computer counts the votes for you. 
I would keep both of the voting systems in the United States, because there will always be people that can not handle computers and get used to them and that prefer to have a sheet of paper for voting. And the young people probably prefer to use the computer, because they are so used to have a phone around and work with media.
