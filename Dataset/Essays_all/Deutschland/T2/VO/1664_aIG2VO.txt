The computerized voting machines with the easy-to-use touch-screen technology solve the problems of wrong countings and not reading the name of the candidate. Also it would be less time to count all those votes. But would the computer counting programs really help with the votes ? 
No they would not. And they can not. They are computer programms which have been tested a thousand of times before they can start doing such important things. And also then it is not quite clear if there are no errors in this counting programm. When there would be an error in the programm then the error should be found and solved. But after that the programm should count every single vote again. And this all together would take more time than coulting every sheet of ballot again. And what is about the people who can not effort a laptop or do not know how to handle it? They have problems to vote. Of course it would be good for the people who know how to handle it. In other point the computer can not replace the people which got more knowledge than every computer. Not a computer can take away the work of a human without first getting teached and then work with a risk not to work properly.
