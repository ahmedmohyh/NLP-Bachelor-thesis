Some people mention, that the voting system in the United States is inefficient especially in elections. These people prefere to use the traditional system with a paper and a pen, with whom you do an small mark on the voting paper.

The computerizing voting do not allow human mistakes in case of counting and the people with poor eyesight could not mark the wrong name, because the computer can use the touch-screen technology and magnify the names.

On the other hand people critizes the computer voting. They think of people, who can not use computers or have fear of technology. Those people have no chance to support the democracy in the United States.

In addition computers are programmed of humans aswell, so they can fake the countings with the computer system. it is especially much harder, to find the person, who is guilty for the miscountings as with the traditional voting.

Another point, which was mentioned is, that all new technology systems have to have a long testing time to perfection it. And elections are only used one time in two years for region elections. So it is not teseted very well, there could be much mistakes in it.

All in all there is no clear opinion, which system is better. Always can happen mistakes, but nobodys perfects, a computer aswell.
