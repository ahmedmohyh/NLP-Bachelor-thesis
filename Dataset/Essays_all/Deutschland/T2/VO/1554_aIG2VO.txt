The presentation and the text is about a discussion of a change in the voting system of the US.
First of all the text said, that this system is easy-to-use rather than the hard traditional one, wherein people could accidentlly vote for the wrong candidate but for people who, don't have any experiences with high-technology, it is pretty hard to use. Also people who are afraid of the new technologies couldn't use this type of a voting system.
The second advantage by using a computerized voting system is that high-technology machines like computers won't count the votes wrong than human but it can do it too, because the computer voting script is written by humans. In there it could be that some problems were made in.
The last advantage the text is writing about is when a human is counting votes some errors could happen which cause a long and expensive recount. Coumpters wouldn't have these problems but counting votes quickly and without any problems.
In the presentation it says, that computers do some errors, while counting, too, because, as i said, the script is made from humans. Errors which were done by computers could damaging the elction outcome heavily, because some votes could be misscounted or removed.
