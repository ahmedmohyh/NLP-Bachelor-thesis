In the lecture it is mentioned, that computers are programmed by humans, and the traditional voting systems are also led by humans. When the computer has a problem or is programmed wrong, it can miscount or delete thousands of votes, while a human can only miscount a handful of votes. People, who have fear of electronic media, can maybe vote the wrong person, because they don't know how to vote on the touchscreen, while on a ballot they only have to mark the person they want to vote. Another criticised point in the computer technology is, that we don't know if we can trust the computers. Hacker can easily influence the votes.
While the text prefers a modernisation of the voting, the lecture prefers the traditional way of voting, so they have different meanings.
