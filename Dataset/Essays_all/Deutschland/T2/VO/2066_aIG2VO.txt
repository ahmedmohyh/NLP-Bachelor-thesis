The topic in the essay is the current voting system in the USA. In the essay the opinion is clearly against the current voting system because it´s inefficient and there are mistakes occuring. 

First of all the text comes with the argument that there can happen easily mistakes, because people with weak eyelight aren´t able to read the names right.Then there is the argument that people, who are counting mistakes could make some mistakes so that the election is wrong. The people who say a computer vote is too risky, they have to think about the fact, that f.e. governments are dealing with complex computer systems so why can´t we use it in the election?

The audio comment has a contra opinion on the first essay and is clearly for the current election system.

It is said that people who can´t use computer technology could make faster mistakes than peolpe who can´t read tzhe names because of their eye light. Than we have to think about the fact that computer are also programmed by humans so there can occur mistakes. The difference between a programm mistake and an individual election mistake is that a programm mistake will cause many more than one individual mistake. Then you can´t compare computer systems used by governments every day and an election programm which is used once every four years.
