The problem with the system of elections in the US are that it is possible that some mistakes happen because of the counting by hand and marking on the large voting sheets. To avoid this problem critics would like to replace the traditional voting system with a more efficent system; the computerized voting system. The computerized voting system should make it possible that people can't accidentally mark the wrong candidate on the large voting sheets because of the poor eyesight. But is the computerized way the better one? The people who are used to the computer system could easily vote in that way but the older generation isn't good with the computers and the technology just like the younger generation is. Therefore it is just an advantage for those younger people who are used to the computer system. The computer system should also remove a problem of the voting system; the mistakes of counting the votes. Because of the counting by hand and recording every vote there could be mistakes in the end. The computerized system should replace the counting by hand with the technologic sytem but isn't it possible that the computers could fail in the middle of counting and afterwards remove all of the votes. This way of replacement could be more expensive and would take much longer than correcting a mistake which is done by hand. Also it is normal that human beings do some mistakes and computers aren't yet safe enough to let them do all the work eventough it would be easier for the people to not count every vote by hand and record them and easier for the voters because of a better way of sight. This whole system is used just every two years and therefore it shouldn't be that bad to continue this system of voting because people are just human and could make mistakes just like computers do.
