In the text they say that the computerraised voting is easier for the people but in contrast to the hear lesson it is not easily for all people, because some people should have problems while they are not work with a computer before.Sure is that the old voting systems are very hard and sometimes full of mistakes by human beeings like the counting of the votes. But a computer cannot do it better, while it is programmed by ,human beeings and they also programmed some mistakes which are shown as errors later. Futhermore the most computersystems are used daily and also proved a lot of times but the systems for the voting are use less time like one ore two times in the year. so it could be also that they are proved less times too and it could come to mistakes in the counting of votes. Futhermore  in the part of the poem, maybe from Shakespeare, they say that it is time to think and also to talk about new things '' Time is come [...] to talk of many things [...]'' and that they have to change some things like to change the old systems with new systems and going straigthly into the future and do things which are unbelievable and a lot of poeple think that it cannot be like the '' pigs with wings''.
