In the text above is writen, that traditionel voting is inefficent, because they are inaccurate. A large sheet of paper contains many names, where some people can't find the right name. Also there are often minor mistakes by counting these votes. That can influence the election. Computer can do a better job.
Programs can't be manipulated and count accurate. A example for that are the computer programs used in a bank.

The Audio represents an other opinion. The speaker agrees to to the mistakes in the tradional counting and that computer voting seem easy. But also computer voting isn't that easy like it seems. Computer make mistakes as well. A program must be tested enough and used regulary to improve it. If the developer makes a major mistake in the code, the miscounting can influence is whole election. Bank programs are used daily, so there get improved daily as well. Further old people, who doesn't use a computer daily may have problems, because they don't know how to use it. But every person have used a paper in its life before.

To come to a conclusion, the writer of the text has the opinion, that the computer voting system will deliver much more accurate countings, than a human. The speaker of the Audio says, that the program will be used only in a 2 years gap, so it is impossible to improve it to a perfect level. But both, the writer and the speaker, see a problem in the traditional way of voting, because making mistakes are human like.
