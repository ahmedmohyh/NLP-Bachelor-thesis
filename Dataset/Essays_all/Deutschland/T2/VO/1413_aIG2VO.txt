In the texts we can see the two contrary opoinons about the voting system in the United States. The text we just listend to explained why the old and classic voting system is much better than the new electronic version. Basicly it said that computers shouldnt be trusted and voting by using a ballot is a lot safer than by relying on machines. Computers which are doing our transactions to other bank accounts or taking care of our stock today had to be improved over many years. In the very beginning they didn´t work perfectly eiter but over the years and a lot progress in the technology we can mostly rely on them now. A new programm which has to be created by humans who can make mistakes easily like the other text said could earase the complete results of the election or doesn´t even work at all. Moreover voting via the computer is a huge problem for older people who are not used to the technology or others who simlpy can´t afford to have a computer and because of that don´t have any clue how to use them. That could lead to the possibilty that the people vote eiter wrongly or stop voting at all.
So obviously we have to contrary opinions here. Both texts said that people could vote wrongly either because of their poor eyesight which makes it difficult to read the candidates names on the ballot or because they don´t know how to use a computer properly. In both cases there will be problems: Either humans mess up the programm which supervises the election or the people who have to count all the ballots make a mistake.
