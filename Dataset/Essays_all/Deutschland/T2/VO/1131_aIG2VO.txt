Our traditionel election methods include some problems, like it was said in the audio. It would be much more easier if people begin using computers for voting and for counting those votes later. But there are some problems with this new technique: people who are used to work with computers won't have any problems with it. But on the other side old people, or in general, people who can't work with computers, will have trouble handling those machines. The problems include also the technique, which isn't as perfect as we may think. Computers may have problems too, they are made by people and those who made them can damage and manipulate them. And because those elections don't happen that often, we can't really test computers as a new method, people won't get used to them very quickly and we don't get to know problems we may have with this technique.
The text didn't really mentioned all the troubles we may have with the new method. It also focused on the problems our current elections have, like people who are bad at reading, who can make mistakes while the process. When people count the votes, their methods can fail also, because there's so much to count, they may have problems while focusing. They named the new method, by voting with computers too and saw this as a good alternative.
