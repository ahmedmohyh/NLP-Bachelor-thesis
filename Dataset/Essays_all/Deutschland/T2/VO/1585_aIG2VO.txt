In the following, I will explain the meanings of different types of voting.
There are different meanings of the different types of voting systems. Nowadays, the technology is wide-spread in the most countries, so people say, votings should be counted by computers. The current systems were inefficient because of miscounts, which are easily done. People could also vote for the wrong person by accident - maybe because their eyes get worse or because they read a wrong name. So the critics of the current system say that computerized votings are more reliable and easier to understand. Apart from that, the counting does not take too much time, in the current system they have to be counted one by one, so it provokes miscounting. 
Another important point is the money which has to be invested in recounts, it costs a lot. But computerized systems could remove human mistakes; it counts the votes quickly.
Other people say computerized systems are a way too risky. They seem easy, but some people cannot even afford them, so they have troubles in voting. There was also the fear of technology that will hold back many people from voting. 
The critics of the computerized system would also like to know if computers build by humans are were able to do better jobs than humans themselves. 
Computerized systems would not only count two or three votes wrong, but maybe thousands of votes. This could have big disadvantages in national votings and even in "little" votings.
