The audio file tolf about the voting system in the United States of America (USA). The system, that the people are voting on a paper is too old in this time. Computer systems would make the voting better and easier. 
But there are a few problems with that too: Some people don't know how they use a computer. They are scared of the new technology and maybe they wouldn't use the computer correctly. 
Another problem is that computers are programmed by humans - an error could makes a lot of trouble and a recount in cause of an error - that would be impossible! 
The authors opinion of the text "Voting" is much different. He underlines how old and bad the "normal" system is, that some people who haven't got good eyes can mark the wrong candidate and that humans must count thousands of votes, so they can make big mistakes.
On the other side, both texts say that pc systems are used daily. Today and for the future they are necessary for many people.
