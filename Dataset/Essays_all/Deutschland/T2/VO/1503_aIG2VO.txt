Voting is a very important topic all over the world. But there are many problems.
For example critics say that the current voting system which is used in the United States are inefficient and inaccurate with counting of votes. Miscount can also damaging. The idea of the critics is that the traditional voting system will replaced with a computerized voting system. Reasons for that are that some people who vote traditional maybe mark the wrong name on the sheet which named 'the ballot' because of their poor eyesight. The computers are easier to use because of an touch-screen technology.
An other problem is the counting with the old voting system because the officiala need to count the sheets one by one so the chance that they make a mistake is very high. In contrast computers do not make this mistakes and it is also quicklier and automatically. On the other side some people said that it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide. But an individual alike trust this complex computer technology every day.
So in case you can say that the computer voting system is much easier and better to use as the tradiotinal voting system because of many reasons which are against the tradiotinal system and the benefits which come with a computerized voting system.
