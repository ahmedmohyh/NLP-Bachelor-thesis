Some people would like to change the manual voting to a computerized and more effective voting. 

In the text it says that it would be easier to find and click the right name on the virtuel ballot that marking it on the real one. Another argument is that there can't happen any mistakes with the counting of the votes, because a machine counts them and not a real person with maybe bad eyesight. 

What if people like to vote without using computers on a daily base like older people? With this fear of technology it would not be as easy as exspected. Critics say that computers are also programmed by humans and that mistakes are normal, because nothing and nobody is flawless. One can't garuantee that there won't be any miscounts or removed votes. 

People in America can only vote once in two years. That is why the voting system should be fully trustworthy.
