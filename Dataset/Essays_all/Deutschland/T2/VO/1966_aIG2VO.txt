In the presentation the it is said that a computerized voting system would not be a better alternative to the traditional system. At first not everyone can afford a computer and not every citizen is used to the digital system, especially older people would have problems with it. In contrast to this argument the text points out that there a some problems with the traditional system, which cause wrong results of the election. For example the list of the different parties and presidential candidates is not clearly structured and people who have poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. But the computerized system would offer a touchscreen, which can be easily used by the voters.

The second point in the presentation is that an error in the programmed software would be much worse, but with the traditional way the officals can correct their counting mistakes instantly. Here the text says that the traditional voting system needs way to much time. Because the officals have to count every vote one by one. Therebye they are recorded and to correct a counting mistake needs a long time.
Another disadvantage with computerized voting systems is that there are just a few elections in a year, so the software can't be tested often enough.
