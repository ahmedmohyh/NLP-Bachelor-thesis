The given text deals with the flaws and problems that can be caused by traditional the voting system. The US election is used as an example.
According to this text the traditional system that relys on the use of papers and pens and humans counting the votes it's inefficient, inaccurate and can lead to major mistakes caused by a human individual such as miscounts since every vote has to be counted one by one. It also suggests that people with poor eyesight have a disadvantage because they may have trouble finding the right name on their voting sheet. However the text suggests that computerized voting systems may do a better job at reducing the possible mistakes to a minimum.

A presentation given by a female expert on this topic however suggests that computerized voting might not do that great a job. On the contrary, she states that computers may cause even more problems.
She supports her position by saying that people who don't use computers as frequently, such as old people, could have a disadvantage since they're not used to working with computers. This could just as well lead to unintentionally casting a wrong vote. This fear of technology might even discourage people to cast their vote at all.
Opposing the argument that computers make less mistakes than humans do she points out that computers are programmed by humans thus making technical errors possible and also much more devastating since a system error might cause thousands of votes to be lost forever. According to her recounts are impossible.
Regarding the reliability of banking systems she states that it did take some time for them to become as reliable as they are today. They haven't always been as safe as they are today and the only reason for that is the everyday usage.
Voting however only takes place twice a year thereby not providing enough time to come up with a reliable voting system.
