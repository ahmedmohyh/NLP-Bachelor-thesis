The very first argument from the audio states, that many people simply aren't used to computers yet, and therefor will be scared of voting, instead of having more trust into the "easy-to-use touch-screen technology". It is also said, that misvotes might be possible due to lacking experience with the computers, while the text says the same thing about votes on the ballot, where the names of the candidates are often too small to be read, especially for people with poor eyesight.

While the text states, that miscounts are less likely to happen on computers, because you eliminate the human factor out of the equation, the speech says otherwise. This way, one human error made by the programmer can be much more fatal than one miscounted ballot, as it can result in the loss of data, which is a real problem, since there is no physical backup of those votes.

For the fact claim that it may be too risky to overhaul the voting technology, the text said that similar computer technology is used for banking and the handling of "highly sensitive information" every day, and therefor trusted by people all over the world. As an argument against that, the speech claimed, that those applications are being used and improved on a daily basis, and were far from perfect when they first came out. Voting on the other hand only takes place a few times a year, and therefor flaws won't be fixed or even detected that fast.
