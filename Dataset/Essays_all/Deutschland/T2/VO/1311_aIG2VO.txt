Some people have the opinion that traditonal voting systems have some problems and that they could be solved with new technologies. The new idea are computerized systems but it doesn't work without problems too. 
The main aspect is that this method is too risky. Maybe it's easier to only touch at a touch-screen than collect all the large sheets of paper, but an error in a computer system is very hard to remove and maybe some votings can get lost.
An other aspect is that not all people can work with computers like old ones. 
On the one hand some peole say that coputer technologies are used ervery day in a lot jobs. 
On the other hand you have to think of that these computer systems are used every day and can be improved daily. Votings only take place every two years so how can somebody know if the system works perfectly?
