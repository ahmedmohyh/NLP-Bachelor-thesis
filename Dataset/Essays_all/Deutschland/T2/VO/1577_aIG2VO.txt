In the presentation the speaker talks about voting systems. She talks about the opposides of the current voting system, counting the ballots by hand, and the voting system many people want, a computerized voting system. 

The lady in the presentation says, that nobody knows, if a computerized voting system would be better, she says, that it might be easy for people, who deal with computers on a daily basis, but the people, who can not afford one, can not vote properly. In the text it says something different. There the author writes, that it is hard for older people, who can not see properly, to make a cross for the right candidate on the big ballot, but a computer would solve this problem. 
Annother argument she mentiones is, that computers are programmed by humans and if just a little part of the computer programm is wrong, the computerized voting system could miscount thousands of votes, while a human just counts a few wrong. The author of the text says something different. He writes, that the officials have to count the votes one by one and that it is easy to make a mistake doing that, which would lead to n expensive recount. 
The computers might not even count the votes better and it would be hard to test the programm nationwide, because there is just a vote every four years, so that the voting system could not be improved on which the text says, that the computer programms in banking transactions work very well. 

In the end you can say, that the text and the presentation display complete opposide oppinions.
