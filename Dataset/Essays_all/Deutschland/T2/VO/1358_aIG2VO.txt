In the following I will discuss the idea to use computers in voting systems. There are many advantages and disadvantages that I will explain in this short text.

Nowadays computers are used by many people. Using computers in a voting seems first to be a good idea. I mean computers remove the possibility of human error. It also count the votes must faster, because normally it relys heavily on people. They need hours/days for counting those words and a computer do it much faster and more efficient. Yes, computers are maybe a bit too expensive, but you have to recognize that some people get money for voting too. For disabled people it is also a better way, because they can pick their politicans which they want to vote for in a much better way that on a piece of paper. 
On the other hand especdially old people don´t really know how to use a computer. That´s why they are confrontated with some problems and need help. In this case the process propably does take more time that most people don´t think about. We´re also not sure whether computers are trustworthy, because people are able to programm them in a way that the result is probably not right. A vote for a new president for example is also in most of the countrys every 4 years, so the voting systems are not in the same way improveded as in bank systems for example. That´s why we can not be sure whether they work in the perfect way.

To come to an conclusion I have to say that there are many advantages and disadvantages by using computer in votin systems. Because of that there will be a big discussion in the future about this idea.
