The presentation was about voting systems in the US and puts a spot on the benefits of 'the old' voting system. Critics say that the old voting system causes mistakes wheather by the people who are voting nor the system by which the votings are counted. 
Letting the voters make their desissiouns on a computer instead of letting them make a cross on a pice of paper isn't always easier. It is just easier for the people who know how to get along with a computer, who are used to it. Not everyone is used to work with computers and knows how to handle it, so for many people it would be more difficult to vote by a computer. 
Another negative point about 'new voting systems' is the aspect of counting them. Critics of the 'old system' say that computers should cound out the votings because human can easely make mistakes by counting every vote one by one. The women who gave the presentation says that computerts are only as good as the human who made it so when human can make mistakes by counting computers can make mistakes too. Even more, computers can have program mistakes which would effect tousends of votings. When a human makes a mistake it would just affect a few votings which might be counted wrong.
The women also says that a voting every second year isn't enough to intigrate a whole new system. It will be less trustfull because the people wouldn't get used to it. Agains that critics say that people nowaday already trust other computers. Why shouldn't they trust them when it comes to votings? 
The women has the opinion that the 'new voting system' doesnt't have to be better then the 'old one' because it can also make mistakes and would cause a lot of changings which would be difficult to handle and get used to.
