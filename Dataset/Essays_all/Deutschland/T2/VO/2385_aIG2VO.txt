The presentation about comuterized voting systems said, that it is only much easier to vote on a computer for people who daily use technic like a smartphone or a laptop. The problem is in the opposide of the first argument, what about old people oder just people, who do not often use a computer? They had problems to vote the right one or maybe they completly unaccept the new system. Also there is a danger in makeing the programms for the computerized voting. If only one person makes an error, thousands or all of the votes won´t be countable. 

The text said, that traditional voting sytems are inefficient and lots of people make mistakes by crossing the right candidate. Also there are many mistakes by counting the votes.

The difference is that the text is for a computerized voting system and the presantation is against the modern voting. Both are giving examples for their position. The text said their will be more mistakes in a traditional voting, because people have to surch for the right name, the pesantation said they could be mistakes in the programm, so that all votes are uncountable and that will be the bigger problem.
