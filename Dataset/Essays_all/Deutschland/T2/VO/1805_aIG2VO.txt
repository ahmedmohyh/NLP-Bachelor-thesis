Tis text will deal with the advantages and disadvantages of computerized voting.
In their argumentation for cumputerized voting, critics mention the problems of the large list of candidates- what leads to wrong votes- and the problems with the inaccuracy during votes -what makes recounting necessary. They suggest "computerized voting systems" which one could easily deak with and which wopuld be unable to make mistakes during voting. They use the example of electronic communication and banking to show how safety and unncomplicate electronic programmes are.
In her presentation the professor explains the problems of electronic voting she sees: People which are not confirmed to computers would have problems and would not rely on the technology, human errors would not be eliminated, they would only be brought to a place where you cannot correct them easily: the process of programming. She fears that an error of a machine would not be seen and a recounting could not be done because the error in the programme would still exist. She negotiates that the example would show anything: Used technologies have only become so wellby endless improvements, but elections would be only in two years periods, so in the meantime, nobody could prove, whether the electronic voting programme does everything correctly. Because of this, she has big doubts about the sense of computerized voting systems.
