The voting system of the United States is criticized and there is a discusion about the use of computerized voting machines.

The text say that people with a poor eyesight often mark the wrong name because they aren´t able to see the name exactly. Computerized machines could easiely zoom in the words. Also wouldn´t there the problem with mistakes by counting the voting papers from humans. The machine would count much better the votes and there will be no human error.
The person in the audio mentioned the problem that peoson who don´t use computers in evrey-day-live had big problems to deal with a computerized voting machine. Also are computers programmed by humans and so there could happen mistakes too. Also there is no physical record of the votes and every datas could easiely can get lost. The computerized systems used in banking transactions are used every day for many years and there were always new updates to improve the system. But a voting machine would be only used every four years and there would be many chances to improve.
