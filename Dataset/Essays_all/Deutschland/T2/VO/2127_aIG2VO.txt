The audio was about voting systems and their possible mistakes. In their opinion computerized systems would be worse than traditional voting systems. 
In contrast to this the author of the text declares that computer voting systems are more trusting and with less mistakes than the tradtional voting systems.
In regard to this the audio mentioned many reasons why computer systems aren´t more reliable: They would be first of all a problem for people who aren´t used to computers because they could easily cast the wrong vote. Further more it´s said that those human mistakes you have in traditional voting systems would be even in a larger amount in those computerized voting systems, because the programms are designed from humans too, who could easily make mistakes in the programms so that thousand of votes could be wrong, which would be much worse than a few wrong votes in the tradtional votinmg systems.
All in all in the opinion of the audio those computerized voting systems aren´t reliable. They explained that those programms need time to improve so that they can be as trusting as the computerized banking system, but they question if we really have this time, because votes are to important to have accidently thousand of wrong casted votes.
The text has, like before mentioned, the opposite opinion. The author explained that computerized voting systems "remove the possibility of human error" and that you just have to give those programms a try and some time to improve, because than they would be so much better than traditional voting systems.
