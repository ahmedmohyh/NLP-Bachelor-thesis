I heard a little presentation about the traditional voting systems. Now I´m going to repeat the arguments and compare it with the text i read before. 
The woman in the presentation said that the computer rise symstems are good enogh for only one or two votings in a year. In her mind you can trust it and it is more seriously. The computer can count the votes better and misscounting are impossible.People can also make a lot misstakes. In the year before round about 1000 votes that are wrong. The votes with computer systems will compare at the same time.

The writer of the text i read before has got an other opinion. In his/her mind the computer systems are too complicated and too risky for an important event. The traditional systems are good and also good enogh for the next years, he/she says. With a computer the people can also easily mark the wrong button. A pen and some sheets are the better method and better for the eyes from all of the people who vote.And if an error is detected, a long and expensive recoun The text has completly an other opinion.
