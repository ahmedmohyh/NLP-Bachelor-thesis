Both informativ media are about voting systems.
There is a discusion wether in future we get of computers to help us voting or if we stay at the traditional way per paper.
Siminular was to find a solution to get away the problems of the traditional voting system. The text says it is too difficult to find the right name of the cadidate on the large sheet of paper. But the audio message says there will be problems with the computer voting systemk to. For example the fear of using a computer or to get along with the touch screen. Furtheremore are there some human mistakes at the traditional way maybe at the counting or at the vote itself. But the computers are programmed by human and even this humans could make mistakes...
What if there will be a computer error? And all votes get lost?
Both media say that we have to have trust in computer technologies if this should be with succes.
