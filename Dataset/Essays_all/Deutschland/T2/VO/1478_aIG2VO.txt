Traditional voting vs. computerized voting

The written text sais, that the traditional voting in the US is kind of inefficient and inaccurate because of the possibilty to make faults while looking for the name to choose on the paper. 
It is said, that many people vote rather accidentally for the name they have chosen, because they had problems to read through all the names. A proposal is to use computerized voting systems, to prevent the election from human error. 
The spoken text questions this proposal. It involves old people and people who cannot effort money for a computer at home in the question whether computerized voting were a solution for human error.
The woman in the speech thinks, that espicially those people who have no experience with computers would cause false votes. Another argument against the use of electronic voting is that(human) errors cannot be prevented by computer voting, because also these computers are programmed by humans, who may did faults in this programmation too.
She said, that we can trust our computers which we use daily, because theseones were improved over and over again. Nevertheless, we cannot trust computerized voting, because these computers were not improved, like the computers we use every day. 
All in all the speech questions the opinion of the written text, which is because of human errors against traditional voting. It is said, that human errors cause also computer errors and that theseones may be even more serious than one human error in the traditional voting.
