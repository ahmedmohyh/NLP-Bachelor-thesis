The voting systems in the USA have problmes the humans count the votes but they alwys do little mistakes, comnputer programms can do mistakes too but then there is a very big damage that have to be payed for but it do not happens that oftent. So the text i heared sayed that people who are good with computers can easily vote adn have no problems.The people who do not use the computer usally have problems and are maybe not able to vote like they wanted to vote for. Also humans who counts the votes just make a few mistakes but that is usall they always do any mistakes. On the other side if a computer has an error or other problems and can not count the vote exactly thousand of votes were lost and that is much more worse than a few votes that were count wrong by the humans. The text says that the computers taht are used do actually never have problems and had an example for it, that every day there are bank transicions wich are perfectly accurate like the voting programm would be and that it is usally not happening that an error happens. Also the counting by humans take much more time than the counting of a computer. People who have eye problems can see the name they want to vote for better becaue the screen they look at is much bigger then the paper they get.
