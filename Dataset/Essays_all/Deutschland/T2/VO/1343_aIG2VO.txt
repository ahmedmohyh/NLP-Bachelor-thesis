There are many people who say traditional voting systems in the United States are not very good in these times and copmuterized voting systems is better, but in the presetation I heard they had an another opinion.

Many people are not used to computers or just can't afford them, because they have not enough money for it. But other pople say the current system are inefficient. Some people don't know about the technology and mabye don't understand what they have to do. The critics say traditional voting systems could have a lot of mistakes because they arer counted by humans, but computers are made by humans and could also have a mistakes because not all systems ever work out right. The other side said that these "human errors" could be replaced by machines and the voters would have it easy because they have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology.

It is true that for example banking transactions work perfectly most of the time, but it took years to accomplish that and Voting is only tow years nationally and the cumputers can't be fully trusted. the criticers say we trust them with our money , so we could also trust them with our votes.
