The question whether the current voting system is inefficent and to hard to use is debated hard. While some say that the old fashioned way of voting is not apropriate anymore, others warn of the errors of computerized systems.
 
There is a teacher who is elaborating the problems of computerized systems. Her most critizised point is that an error of such computer systems would have fatal consequences. The text given states out that there are computerized systems that we use every day, so why not trust them? 

You can say that, even though a teenager does not see that as it really is, there are many people who do not trust computers and don´t know how to use them, the teacher even said they could be afraid. As the population of indrustial nations is very old in comparison with others that may be a point. 

One the other hand you can say that touchscreen voting computers would be easy to use as the desktop is not very hard to understand. You don´t have to understand how a computer works to press a button. And there would be a wider spectrum of possibilities. 

The teachers answer to the problem is to let humans count the vote. Humans are not free of fault but they wrote the programm for any kind of machine, so when the fail the whole system fails. In the bank system and all the other systems that we use daily where have been detected errors earlier and if a programm would go down thousands of votes would be uncountable. That is a huge threat. But if a vote assistent would fail and it does not come out, the consequences could be just as hard. In the US you sometimes have the possibility to vote once a year. Why not improve the system by using both at the time and leran to deal with it?
