The problem seems to be that a lot of things become technological as well as voting systmes and their are still people without acces to computers, without knowlege about technic or people who cant afford one. The alternative, the casual paper vote seems to be a complicated version too also counting the fact that the ellection is counted by humans and they do make mistake, but its not clear that progrmas, also installed by humans, are not making some either. Anyway their are poeple supporting a computerized voting systems (l.2) because of the believe the risk of human mistakes would decrease (l.8), in contrast to the fact ,namend in the speech before,that its also just a creation of humans.
