A lot of people are looking critical against the old voting systems, because of the mistakes, that can happen, when you are mistakly voting for the wrong candidate, brcause of your bad eyes or the counters are counting the votes wrong. They also say, that these problems acn be solved by computer voting, because these computer programms are also used in banking transactions and the people trust these computers.

But even if people with bad eyes could vote mistakly for the wrong candidate there is also the fact, that a lot of people dont know how to deal with computers and technology, so its also easy for them to set the wrong mark at the wrong name. There are also a lot of people who fear technology and it could be that these people will not come to the votes, because they are afraid to do something wrong.
Furthermore the computer is programmed and built by humans, so there is also the fact, that the computer can do a big mistake by counting the votes. A human could do one tiny mistake and count five votes wrong, a computer error could count million of votes wrong. This would be a porblem for the whole election. A lot opf people trust the technical vote system and they also use it everyday, but these complex systems are used by humans everyday, for example at the office or in banking transactions. If they are used everyday, you can see mistakes made by the technical programme, easier ajnd solve them as soon as possible. When they are used everyday there will also be features and updates to make the system easier and better to use, but the elections are only every two years, so the system can do mistakes easier and it is more difficult to check the system about technical mistakes and the trust cant be as bis as the trust to the technical sytsem used everyday.
