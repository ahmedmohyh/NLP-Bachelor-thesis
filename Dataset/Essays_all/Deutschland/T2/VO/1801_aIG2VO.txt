In the following text I am going to summarize the listended preasentation and text.
The presentation gave a lot of information about traditional and computerized voting. First of all the risks of the tradititional voting are that the ballots are counted by hand from the people because of that there could be a lot of miscounts that could damage the election! The computerized voting would be done very quickly and the live in a digilatized world so it would be easy for the most of us. But what is with the people who do not know how to deal with computers? They could easliy mark the wrong name. People make mistakes in the traiditional voting system but what is with the computer programm because this is also made by human. But at least computers are used daily. When it was new to make a process with the computer there were mistakes in it but nowadays it is normal to work with a computer. The text says like the presentation that traditional voting is not so efficient and very typical for mistakes. The computer programm would very easy beacause of the easy-to-use-touch-screen technology.
To sum up both methods have good and bad sides but all in all the computerizde voting would be a lot more easier.
