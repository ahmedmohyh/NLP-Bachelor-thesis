In the following I will summarize the heard audio and explain how it is relevant to the given text.

First the woman states that poor people or a person that simply does not deal with technology would be scared or more importantly unable to use the computerized system. The text does not say anything about someone not being able to use it but belives that one could even magnify the screen to see even better since the worry of the text is that due to poor eyesight voters accidently make their cross for the wrong candidate. 

Later she agrees that a human error in the old system would mean some lost votes, which is also mentioned in the text, but explains that computerized systems are made by humans as well which could still lead to a human error just with much bigger consequenses. This does the text not take into account, there an error by the system itself seems impossible.

The author of the text writes that we trust computerized systems with our money every day and asks indirectly why we should not trust one with our vote. The woman offers an explaination. She thinks that our bank systems are used everyday and therefor often improved and further developed. There have been mistakes in the past proving her point that human error is also being seen in computerized systems. Since the coumputers are only used once every four years a steady improvement can not be guaranteed - in her opinion.

Meaning that the text unlike the audio does not mention a possible failing of the system, a incapability of the voters or the fact that in the audios opinion the aimed voting system can not be compared to a daily used system  like the bank system since it is supposedly  not possible to develope it as far as needed due to the fact that it is rarely used.
