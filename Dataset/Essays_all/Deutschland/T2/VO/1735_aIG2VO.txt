The text and the recording both deal with the problems of several voting systems. The text at the beginning says that especially voting systems where people still use a piece of paper and a pencil to vote for their candidate are full of problems. At first it is really hard to get an overview of the candidats because the person who has to vote gets a paper with many names of different candidates. Especially old people or people in general who have a poor eyesight have problems to read all the small written names on the paper. So maybe people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. They think computeriting voting would be a lot easier because they only need to tag one candidate on big touch screen.
The people of the nrecording have got a different opinion. They think that voting at the computer is also really complicated because not everybody is able to use a computer right like the youth nowadays. Especially old people don´t have a lot experience with the modern technique so that also with this kind of voting system a lot of mistakes ore maybe even bigger mistakes could happen. 
Another problem the text mentions is that the people who count the votes at the end are going to make mistakes always. They have to count every voting paper one by one an when they make a mistake because of missing concentration they´ve got a big problem. The text says that the peobple should try to use the computer voting.
The recording mentions that computer systems are also made by human so that there could be a human error too. Besides cpumpter systems like that should be improved before they get used in politics or other important topics. The problem in the case of voting is that it doesn´t take place often just a few times in year so that it´s really hard
