When it comes to new technology in terms of voting there are two major oponents. On the one hand critics say the traditional way of voting by paper is inaccurate because it is ineffiecient and by accidental false voting or false count could leave a damage if the vote is closely contested. They suggest a computerized voting as it is inevitable to make mistakes with paper voting. On the other hand there are people who also realise that traditional voting may lead to mistakes, but say that computers, designed and programmed by humans, can make mistakes as well, which then would leave a bigger problem because of an error leading to missvotings of thousands of votes. Both use the example of the computerized banking and display that everyone trusts in them. But critics do not know why they would not trust in computerized votings then too. People are of the opinion that there actually were problems with the system at first, so these could also appear when the traditional paper-vote would be replaced by computerized votings.
