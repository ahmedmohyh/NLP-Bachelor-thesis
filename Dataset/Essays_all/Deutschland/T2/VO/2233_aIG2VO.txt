In the presentation would prefered to the computer voting systems, because the old traditionellen systems makes a lot of problems. So the people out of the presentation are for the computers with the reason that people didnt touch ausversehen the wrong filed or candidate. And in the traditionelle system people do it,because they didnt see enough do find the difference or something else. Furthermore the lady in the presentation means that they not have work from the computer system because the computer count on his self how many have vote and who they have vote. The text against it means that computer can do a lot of mistakes and they can verfälsche the Ergebnisse. But the lady will promise that the computers do it better, as people do it on themselves,so they musst come and touch on a computer a filed and so they ready with voting. But she widerspricht sich , than she also said that computer are programiert and erifndet by the people ,but it is normal that human make mistakes. So they can get by the traditionelle system,too. Than in the traditionelle system people didnt can make so many mistakes which the computer can do. Cleary it is more work, when you have the old system but it is truthly.The system of Computer is more expensive than the other one.And it makes the people error said the text. So the text and the presentation have complety other Ansichten which one is better, whether the old system or the new computer system. Both of them have/can make/do a lot of mistakes. Also it is not important which one would choose,both of them are not the perfect solution.
