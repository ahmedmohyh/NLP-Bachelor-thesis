It is said that humans make mistakes and this can be very damaging to a closely contested election. Because of that, computers should take over that role. Though, the problem here is that computers are made by humans which can cause the computers having errors as well. Mostly, the errors of a computer have a larger effect than a human one which can lead to the loss of many votings or a huge amount of miscounts. 

Furthermore, another big problem is the rare use of these computers since they are only used once in every two years. Followed by trust and improving issues.
A computer cannot be improved very quickly when it is barely used. And things that have not been improved cannot be 100% trustable in making errors.
