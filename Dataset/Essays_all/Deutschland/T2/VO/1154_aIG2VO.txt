The text and the presentation talk about problems with current and computerisized voting systems. Many people wish voting on computers instead of the currently used technique. But both ways of voting have their own advantages and disadvantages.
At first many people are not used to deal with computers so they can easily make mistakes during their voting. The text said that people with poor eyesight might have problems to cross the right name on the ballot. Also many people are feared by the use of technology.
Another point says that making mistakes is human. There might be mistakes by counting out the ballots, but there might also be mistakes directly in the computer programms because they are designed by humans. But when the  ballots are counted wrong a recount is possible even there would be high costs for it. When the computer programm makes a mistake with counting the votes it is not possible to count again. And because there are not many votes during a year a whole computer system would be really difficult to design without mistakes. 
All in all the text says that computerisized voting would be better because there are less mistakes while the woman from the presentation has the opinion that computers are not easier and their mistakes would be heavier.
