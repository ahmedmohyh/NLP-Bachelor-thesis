In this text where they are talking about the voting systems in the USA they are talking about the deficients of this systems and summarice them with the old system.
One argument is that the old system is inefficient and inaccurate in couting votes, because people have to count all the ballot on their own and every person makes mistaks , so it is really easy to have at the end a wrong voting(ergebniss). 
They don´t really like the old voting system and are now proud to have the chance doing it all faster and easier with computers.For examlple there is a person who can´t read the name on the paper to vote and can easily mark the wrong name. On the computer it is much easier, because you have the function to zoom it so everyone can read it and mark the right name. The goverment trust the computer systems as well as in bankes and in case of security and so they can trust the computer too in aspect of voting.
The computer can count the votes wrong too, but with the technology now a days it isn´t so(wahrscheinlich).
All in all they said that elections takes places every two years, so it might be possible to make it with computer programms to take the old problems with the old voting system away.
