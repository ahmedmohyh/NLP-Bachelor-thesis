The second text was about arguments against the idea to use a computerized voting machine in the future. The first argument of the first text was that the computerized systems are easier and that people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name.The woman in the second text said to this argument that computer may seem easier to use, but in reality they aren´t. Especially for non-users, it can be difficult and frightening to use them. This fear of computer could lead to stop many older people from voting. In addition to that computer aren´t cheap and not anyone can afford to buy one. The next argument of the second text was against the point of the other text that traditional voting systems are inefficient and often lead to inaccurate counting of votes. The woman in the second text said that we aren´t sure if a computerized system would make it better. Only one error could make thousands of votes wrong and a recount would be impossible. Against the argument of the first text that computerized system are already successfully used in banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensitive information, the woman said that it´s true, but it´s a result of using them on a daily basis for a long time and that they surely didn´t work flawlessly in the beginning. Which would be a major problem at the voting, because we are only voting twice a year.
