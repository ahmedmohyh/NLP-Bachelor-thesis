Many people are thinking that the voting system in the United States aren't efficent and they lead to inaccurate counting of votes. These people want to replace the traditional system and use computer. With an easy-to-use touch-screen technology they can quickly count the votes.
 An argument of the promoters are that they can possibly remove human error. But on the other hand computers are programmed by humans. The programm can have mistakes. It can discount or the votes can disappear in the system.
 Every day humans make banking transactions and use complex computer technologies in the communication of highly sensitive information but that can be improve everyday. The voting day is only every two years so on the first time it can crush so they need to do an expensive recount. 
 Also some people don't use computer and have a big fear of technology. They can't trust it.
