In the treatment was explained where the problems are with a computerized voting. A computerized voting system would be better for people who are used to computers but for people who don´t use computers at all it would be very difficult. Many of them maybe wouldn´t go to the votings anymore. Another problem is that they could easily vote for the wrong person. with a computerized voting system there wouln´t be any errors in the counting of the votes but the errors could be even bigger. If the people programming the voting system make only a little mistake thousands of votes could be lost forever. When they are fully erated nobody can recount them as they did by the old system. The government has to do a full new voting. It would need a long time to improve this new system but there is only one election every 4 years in the United States of America. So in the first elections there would be many problems with the system nobody kmows how to solve.

This is the total opposite of the text above. The text tells about the porblems with the old voting system and the mstakes the people can make. For example by the counting of the ballots. While the treatment tells about the problems there are with the new computerized voting system.
