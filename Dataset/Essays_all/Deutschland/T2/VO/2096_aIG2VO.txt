Today there was a presentation about the voting systems like in the United States of America and there it was said, that the traditional systems are bad because the votings are counted by a computer system and there could have many miscounts because they developed by humans so they are not everytime true and if there is a problem with the computer because of the technology there could be more than 1000 miscounts. Another reason against the computerized voting system manchained was that people who can not get along with computers could vote for the wrong perosn because they do not know how to deal right with the computers so it is only an option for people who work with computers very often. But there is also an article about the negative aspects of the traditional voting system and there it is written that also people with poor eyesight could mark the wrong person and on a computer you can zoom the names to see it better. Furthermore the people have to count the candidates one by one and this takes much time and also many people who count the votes it is nearly impossible to do not make mistakes.
