The two sources are about the voting system in the U.S and support two diffrent opinions. The general question is wther the old voting system should be replaced by a computerized voting system. 
The first source, the text, explanied how the old system led to mistakes by people accidently voting for the wrong person because of the confusion by the amount of names on the sheet. Computers on the other hand have a function with what you can easily search for the name. Especially by counting the votes there happen a lot of mistakes. When counting thousands of votes by hand you can easily lose track of the numbers and if you notice you would have to recount everything again. The compiterized systems on the other hand are supposed to be very accurate and be programmed to not make mistakes. 
The other source was a lecture about the same topic. The woman said that while the people who are used to working with computers can handle that voting system easily, the ones that are not used to that kind of modern technology or can not even afford it would have a lot of problems. They might make mistakes and be scared of the news system and the amount of votes would even become smaller. Mistakes by counting are also possible by using computers. She claimed that as computers are programmed by humans they are not perfect as well and the consequences of those mistakes might be even worse than just counting a few votes to mich or too little. Another point the mentoned was that this highly sensitoive informtaion might be in more danger when on computer programs that can be manipulated or even permanently removed.
