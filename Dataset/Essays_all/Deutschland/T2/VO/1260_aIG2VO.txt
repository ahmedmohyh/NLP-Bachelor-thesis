Now in the US they use a new voting system, because in the old traditional voting system often lead to mistakes. They have to deal with thousands oft ballots, so they always will do mistakes. Recounts are very expensive and it takes much time The person who counted the votes makes mistakes and also the people who vote make mistakes. They don´t find the name of that candidate they want to vote for and people with poor eyesight can easily mark wrong names. For this causes much people think the new voting system, which is computerized is better. It has an easy o use touchsreen and you get a better view of all candidates to mark the right candidate. But the computerized voting system also earns critic. People said it might be easy to use for people who daily work on a computer, but for this person who nerver or only sometimes used computer and touchscreen can get problems with the technic. For them it is easier to mark it on a paper. A big advantage from the computerized system is that people don´t have to count the votes. The computer does all this automaticly and the computer remove the possibility of countingmistakes of the human. But the computerized systems aren´t so improved. The computers are much faster than the human and dont take the time of the working people. Maybe it can happend that the programm is defect and thousands of votes can be miscounted. Today lot of do their banking with computerized systems, but this systems are improved, because they are used daily and the voting system is only used once in two years.
