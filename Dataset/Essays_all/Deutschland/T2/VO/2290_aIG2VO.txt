The text that I was supposed to rerad was about alternative technological systems concerning elections in the United States of America. 
Some people in America say that the current voting system is inefficient and unjust. Miscounts would happen quite often and could have an effect on a closely contested election. These people think, that the counting techniques should be automated, because computers, unlike humans, would make no mistakes. On the other side, the woman holding the lecture thinks that there is no guarantee, that computers wouldnßt make these mistakes. She says, that computers are programmed by humans and therefore, could easily make mistakes too. And in this case, they might even be heavier than in the traditional counting system. She explains, that humans might miss a ballot or two, but if computers   aren´t programmed perfectly, the problem would effect the whole election. 

Another argument for automised technologies is, that some older persons might have bad eyes, and therefore could vote for the wrong candidate. On a computer screen, the name would be more visible.
 The argument of the professor/teacher against that is, that this group of older people is often not really used to PC´s and could get the voting wrong, or even stay at home, and not go voting because they have a fear of this kind of new technology.
Also, both government and the people wouldn´t be able to develop confidence in these new technologies, if elections are only held every 4 years.
So all in all you can say that the teacher does not agree with the text vand could be classified as one of the "critics", as they are called in the text.
