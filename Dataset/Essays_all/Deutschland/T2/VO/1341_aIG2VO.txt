The comuputer voting is a new idea for the voting in the united states of america. but it give some positives and negative points, so in the following i will show you some points for each side/view. the system of computervoting could be very inefficient. thats because not every person c an handle a computer. its not important how often you communicate with friends on the computer. the communication and online banking for emample are ussally things, the daily life. but voting on a computer is once in two years, in the united states. So the system can be good for computer experts but not for every person who would vote. The computer is not really to trust. If a person, who cant really handle a computer, must vote with it, it could be give problems and a wrong voting. But on the other side it is easier to collect all the votes with a software/programm at the computer than collected the votes with your hand and look which vote are on the paper. It would be faster but only when every person can handle an computer. I think voting on a paper is better than the computer voting, bec ause not every person can handle a computer and i think it woulndt be faster than the voting with paper. I think it would  give lesser mistakes witrh computers than with "voting paper"
