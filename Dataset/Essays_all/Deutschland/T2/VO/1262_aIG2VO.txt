The two textes are about the problems with the voting. On the one hand the old traditional way which is without any tecnology or computers  is a good solution.You set your marks with a pencil next to the name you want to vote for and also people count all the votes to get the results of the voting. But more and more people want that also the voting systems are new and modern like the rest of our society. This system to vote on a computer could be good for the people who are good in the using of computers and modern tecnology or people who have a poor eyesight, but what if you don´t have any idea of the using of computers because you don´t needed it before in your life? This people then have a problem, because they could set the wrong mark or don´t know how to do it. This methode can also be a problem while you count the votes after the day because computer are made by human and could have errors or something like that what could bring some very wrong results and thousna dof votes could be missvoted. If the countig is made by human themself there also could happen some mistakes but the mistakes aren´t not that big as if there is an error because the people can correct themself and there only happen a few mistakes.
