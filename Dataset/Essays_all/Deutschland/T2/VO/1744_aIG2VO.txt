In the text i have listened to it is said that computerized voting is that safe or good like many people think. That people that like the idea of a computer system in which u can vote are often people, who have experience using a computer. But there are many people who are feared of technology or can not even affort an computer. There is also the problem, that a Program for voting would be designed by humans. One of the programmers could easily make an error and that would cause an error in the softwqre. Thousend of votes could be lost and because you have no physical copy of the ballot you could not say from which person. It is also said that a program like these could not be tested enought. The comparison to such a program would be the software for the market. It is a software that is used every day, so that error could be found easily. But a program like the voting program would be not that often used, what makes founding errors harder.
In the writen text is said that the current voting system is inaccurate and in efficient. A computer system would be more trustworthy. It says that many voters have bad eyes. On a big sheet of paper with all the names it is hard to find the right candidate and if you find it you could easily mark the person next to him. It is also hard for the people who have to count the votes. There could happen an error too. For that reason it would be better if the current traditional voting system is replaced with a computerized systeme.
