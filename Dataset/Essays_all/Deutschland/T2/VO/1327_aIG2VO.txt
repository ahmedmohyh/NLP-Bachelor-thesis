There lecture about voting systerms argued against a computerized sytem of voting. Some people never used a computer and for them it will be difficult to handle a voting that is different from what their are used to have. There are also people who are anxious about technology. For them it will be hard to overcome their fear. 
Additionaly the voting system which is programmed could have also an error in it, as it was programmed by humans. If there is an error, it would be a huge one. 
Even the programms that we use all day in contact with banks or communication have failed a lot of times in the begining, but as their are used every day, they got more effeciety. The program for voting is not used very day. So it would be possible that it does not work as needed. 
At the other hand it is inaccurate if you count by hand. And the coputerized systems are faster and saver. Also it it cheaper because all the recounting costs a lot of time, effort and money. Furtermore the vote by computer would be people with a seeing disorder, as they just have to touch on the screen or can hear the names being readed out by the computer.
