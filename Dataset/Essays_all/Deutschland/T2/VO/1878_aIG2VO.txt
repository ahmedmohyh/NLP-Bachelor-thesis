The arguments of the presentation are that computerized voting is complicate for voters, who does not use technology at all or at a low level. It gives the question if computer will do a better job on counting, because they also can make mistakes epsecially because computers are made by human hands. They could have errors, which for example could delete thousands of votes. Using computers becomes daily for other things like shopping, banking and wrtiting, but the trust for computerized voting needs to envelope. This arguments are more negative than the arguments given in the text. The text is for computerized voting and gives some disadvantages of the current voting systems. It says for example that the current system is inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. They need to be replaced with more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems. So the text says that computerized voting is trustworthy. Why they are trustworthy is because they can not miscount. In the presentation they said the argument in contra to this like writed on the top. The text gives the problems of the current system like for example you can mark the wrong name because of poor eyesight or something else or because of mistakes from the counting people, who need to count thousands of marks. But the presentation says better one mistake than thousands because of an error. The text says that is could be too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide but it is worth to given a thoght because we trust other complex computer technologies everyday as well, for example the banking, that is also meant in the presentation.
