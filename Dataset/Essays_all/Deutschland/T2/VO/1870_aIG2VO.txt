In the listening version, they say that computer votings are not always easier than the traditional ones. The figure out the problem that persons who don`t use computers very often could have difficulties and vote wrong. Also, they may not trust the technology. They asked the question if computer are really better tahn humans, because of the fact that they are programmed by humans too. In the past, computers haven`t worked every time, and why shouldn`t this happen again? In case that the human counters miss  votes, they can count again. But the computers are programmed to count only once, so votings can be deleted or something else. And if the computer has an error, that could cause thousands of wrong counted votings. 
Compared to the listening, the text only sees the advantages of computers. They think their current sytem is bad and inefficient, so they want to change it. The biggest fault of the actual system is, that the voting papers are too large and people who haven`t a good sight can easily tick the wrong name.
In conclusion, both sides have good arguments, but traditionalists want that everything stays the same while the other ones are open-minded for new ideas.
