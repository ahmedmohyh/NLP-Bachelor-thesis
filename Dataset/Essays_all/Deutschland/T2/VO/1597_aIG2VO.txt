IN the USA many people doesnt like the courent voting sistem and want to have anothewr one bThe woman in the lecture has pointedd out, that  some people may have problems using the computor, which would be used to count the votes given by the people. If they are inexperienced how to use a computor, because they don not own one, they could easily choose the wrong candidat. The writen text instead tells us, that this would be much more easier than a regular vote because you just have to click on the name at the touch-screen and you can also maximize the name if you need to. Another point the text tells us is, that it wont take that much time to count the votes and there would not be as many mistakes as if the people had to count them by themselve. The woman insteat says that computors are programmed by humans and that they are not perfect either.If an error should accure there could be more than a thousand votes given to the wrong candidat or they could be deletet.But at last the text tells us that we use smartphones etc. for sharing very sensitive information and for banking transactions for examle.
