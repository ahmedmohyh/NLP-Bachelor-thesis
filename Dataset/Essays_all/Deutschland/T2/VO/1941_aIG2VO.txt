The voting systeme in the United States is really questionable. Some critics say that the old-fashioned systeme is a way too inefficient and too inaccurate at counting the votes for the elections. They say that the old voting systeme should be replaced by a newer one which is based on computers with an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology. For people who can´t see that good it would be easier to vote because on the old ballot they had to tick one name out of many other names and they can easily tick the wrong name because they can´t read it that well. If they have the new computer technology they just have to touch the name and they can zoom in the names as well. 
On the other hand are some people who think the new technology wouldn´t be better than the old systeme with the ballot. The whole society trust computers in so many ways, for example in the financial way with the onlinebanking or in the communication of highly sensitive informations, so why shouldn´t we trust in computers about the elections too? Because the election only happens once in two years while the computer systemes of the banks are usen more often, nearly every day. It was a long progress to get them work like they do now. So it will be easier to keep the old systeme, also for the people who are not used in computers and their behavior. For this people it bwill be really hard to vote. So just keep the old systeme and everything will be fine.
