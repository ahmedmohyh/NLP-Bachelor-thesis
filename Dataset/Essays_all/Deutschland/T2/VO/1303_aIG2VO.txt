It´s a very complicated decision wether the United States of America should make new their voting systems. It seems very easy to give a computerized voting. But not everyone can work with a computer. Not everyone has the talent to handle with the system of computers. A lot of people can work with them but the other half don´t want to work with them or they don´t have the knowledge about the computers. 
The text says that a lot of people vote the wrong person when they have a large sheet of paper in front of them. It´s often a mistake and there wouldn´t be any mistakes when the people vote with the internet. 
The humans could also count wrong and it the election resolve would be wrong. But when the United States would use the efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems, there wouldn´t be any counting mistakes. But the systems can also count wrong or there could be an error and a thousands of votes have to count again or maybe. So the trust in computers is very dangerous. Moreover the counting by human ist very slowly and it´s a lot of work. The computer systems would make it very fast and it doesn´t need someone who control the system. 
All in all it´s a very risky to introduce these new technologies and delete the humans work.
