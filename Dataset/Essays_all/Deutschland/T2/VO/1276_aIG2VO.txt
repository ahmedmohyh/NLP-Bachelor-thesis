The audio is about votings in the US and how the traditional voting is or if it's better to vote on a computer with a special programm.
The first point is that not everybody can use the technology, maybe like older people because it's too diificult. Although it was said in the audio that the programm, who is made by people, can have faults in their system and you can't realize that.
 But although it was said, that computers normally used everyday so maybe it's easier to vote with this than to vote on paper.

But the traditional voting has a lot of faults too. For expamle you can mark the wrong name or the people, who counts the votes in the end, can count wrong and maybe then it's a wrong elected person maybe.

But both voting things have the same faults. In both you can count the marks wrong because the computer system is failed or the person has count wrong and in both you can vote for the wrong candidate because it's too small or you cant't handle with a computer.
