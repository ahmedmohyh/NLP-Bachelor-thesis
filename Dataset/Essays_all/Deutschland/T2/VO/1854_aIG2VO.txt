The theme is about if the vote should be make by computer or if it should be make by human people. There are some people who say it would be doubtful to make it by a computer because it is really complicated for people who never work on a computer and don´t know how to handle it, to learn. But there is an other opinion which say that to vote on a computter would be better for all peole who have poor eyeside because it is taller.
An other question to discuss is if computer really make the better job. The one side say that it would be better to make it by a computer because of human mistakes by counting the votes, the other side say that the computer programms are made by human and if there is a mistake in it, its really harder to correct this.So there are many arguments for and against it and it would be good if every country decided it by himself but also it would be good to give a try in it.
