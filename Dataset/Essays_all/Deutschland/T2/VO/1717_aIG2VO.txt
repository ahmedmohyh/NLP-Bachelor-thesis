The text I just heard discusses arguments for and against a technical voting system that could replace the current voting system in the United States of America, concentrating on the disadvantages. It is said that technical voting would be difficult for people who do not use computers on a daily basis, it is possible that they would not understand how to do it and therefore fear to even go. Another argument against technical voting consists in the fact that computers also can make mistakes counting the votes just like human beings since the programs are made by humans. Also, a recount of the votes would not be possible. And finally, a technical voting system is not something used very often, it can not be improved like bank or communication system we use every day. On the opposite to these arguments, the written text deals with the disadvantages of the current voting system, like the fact that they are too many names on a sheet to always make the right make mark, to see that even. Apart from that it would be far more efficient to count the votes by computers and not by humans, they would not be human errors. The technical computer voting system can be trusted like other bank and communication systems.
