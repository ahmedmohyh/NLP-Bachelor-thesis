In the presentation about election in the US is said that the traditionally election shouldn´t be removed, because the election with computers could make a lot of problems. Not everybody has a good knowledge about computers so they don`t know who to use them. Another point is that computers could be hacked and this could make big problems. And you have allways keep in mind that computers are never working flawless like the human so there is no differnt if a computer counts the votes or humans do it. 
On the other hand like i said humans make problems too and its a really hard job to count every billot and so there could be mistakes. If humans count the votes there are more people how are controlling that they do no mistakes and at the computer you have to trust the computer that he does everything right, because you can´t recount the votes and if a human does a mistakes you are able to recount but its expensiv and very long work. 
All in all there is no really big different betwen counting with computers or humans. The biggest differents are that counting with computers is faster but way more dangerous.
