The arguments which are used tells the cons of computer voting. Often it is said that computer for voting are better and easier for everyone. But when there are people who cannot work with computers because they dont know how, they get trouble. Another point is that people often make mistakes by counting the votes by hand. But there is the question if computer will be so much better because they were invented and programmed by people so they will maybe make the same or harder mistakes than people by counting by hand. A big point against computer is that an error can destroy everything and have bad consequenzes like an wrong result. Bank systems are used every day but counting systems only once a year. So is it possible to build up an system which everyone can work with and where are no fails?

These arguments shows only the bad points of the computer voting. The arguments from the text shows only the good points of the computer voting. In the text is said that computer voting is always good and a good responsibility to vote for everyone. The woman who tells us also about the computer voting tells us the bad points like an error or ask the question if the computer is so much better than the perso.

All in all I think that the computer vote is a good way to vote for everyone but is has to be more tested and more worked out so there cant be so much fails or errors. There has to be a way to vote easily for everyone. Even when you have a poor eyesight or to old to know how a computer works.
