The listening part and the text show two different strategies for a voting system in the United States. The first is the traditional voting system, which is used today. Therefore many people have to count all the votes. And, of course, there are mistakes going on, because we´re only human. Another point is, that there is a very long list of canditats, so the critics say, that people with poor eyesight could easily make mistakes.  
To handle this problems there is another voting option, which could be an alternative,especially in our digital era. The technology voting. The voting with complex computer technology could be an alternative and would replace the humans. But also the programms in a computer are made by humans. There could happen much more bigger mistakes, for example missvotings of thousands of people. They don´t remove the possibility of human error.
