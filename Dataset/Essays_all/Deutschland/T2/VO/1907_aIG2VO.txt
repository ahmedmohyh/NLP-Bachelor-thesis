The topic of the texts is the voting system in the USA. First of all the text we have heard explains the problems of the voting system. The "old" system with the large paper and the "one by one - counting" has the problem with miscounts. Also they asked the question if computers do a better job or not. The people who not use computers in their daily life maybe have problems with the "new" voting system.
The written text shows also the problems of the "old" voting system but in the text the computer is the solution for this problem because of the "easy-to-use touch-screen technology" and the easier viewing for the voter´s. So the voter needs only to touch the candidate´s name on the screen and then the computer counts the votes.
The text we have heard criticised the sytem with the computer but also the "old" one.
To sum up both textes criticise the voting sytem in the USA but the right solution is not found.
