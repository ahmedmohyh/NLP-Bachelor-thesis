One argument of the lecture was that people that aren't used to modern day technology will have a hard time voting for their candidate because they don't know how to use computers properly. This argument is in contrast to the text which is saying that it's easier for people with bad eyesight to vote because usually the older generation has worse eyesight and the fear of technology. But with a computer voting you could zoomn in the text and make it easier to read. Also you can make a very simplistic user interface so that everyone can understand it. Another argument was that computer programs are written by humans so errors can occur aswell. And if an error occurs it can be even more harmful to the counting because every vote can get deleted. But in the text it says that the computers wont make a mistake and that the people that dont't trust computers to count the votes use them every day in banking transactions and then its perfectly fine for them.
