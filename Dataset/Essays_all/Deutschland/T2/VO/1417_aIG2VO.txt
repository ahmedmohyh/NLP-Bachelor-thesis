The question is whether the voting system in the United States should be computerized or not. The traditional voting system has been known to cause errors, either by people who accidentally marked tho wrong name or by people who made a mistake counting the ballots. The supporters of the computerized voting say that the possibility of human errors would be eliminated because the screen allows zooming in and by that making it easier to read and the automatical counting does not allow mistakes. The supporters of the traditional voting on the other hand think that computerized voting could discourage people to go voting because they don't know how to operate a computer and would not be able to use it properly. And while the counting is done by the computers, the programs that do the counting were programed by people who could have made mistakes that could lead to far more serious problems than just simply miscounting some votes, for example could some votes just be accidentally deleted.
The online banking had to be severely improved and is used on a daily basis, while the computerized voting would only  be used every two years and improving it until it works perfectly would take too long and would be too much effort for it to be justified.
