In the lecture there were several arguments mentioned against the use of computer technology during votes. 
The first argument was that the use of computers may seem easy to those who use them on a daily basis. But what about those people who don't use them because they can't afford one, because they never needed one. It could easily happen that they will not be able to vote because they don't have the experience and no possibilities, because they have a fear of technology.
Others might say that traditional voting isn't good because the results are counted by people and people can make mistakes. What they don't think about is that computerprogramms are also written by humans, so there could easily be mistakes in the programm that could cause a much bigger damage than a human miscount. 
The last argument against technical voting is that every computerprogramm is used on a daily basis, they were improved and improved over years. But voting only takes place once or twive every year, so it would be very hard to build up a proper confidence if you can't use the programm often.

The text now is argumenting on the complet opposite. It is saying that traditional voting isn't that good for example for those with poor eyesite. They have to search for their candidat on a very large paper and then make a very small cross, so it would be easy to accidentily vote for the wrong candidat.
Also the ballots are counted by men who could make a mistake and a recount would take very much time. A computer hopefully wouldn't make that mistake and the counting would be much quicker.
Some people don't trust the idea of technical voting but they don't think about the fact that they use computerprogramms every day without even thinking about it because it has become so natural.

So as you can see there are good arguments for both sides. The arguments for both sides are so good that it is impossible to chose a side. Good luck with that.
