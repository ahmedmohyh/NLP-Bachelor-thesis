While the text had a positive view towards a computerised voting system the speaker told the negative side of a computerised voting system. It was told that the computerised voting system is only easy to use for people, who are used to computers and can lead to problems, when people, who are not used to computers, try to vote with this new system. While the text said a computerised voting system will lead to fewer errors, while counting the votes, the speaker told that there could be problems, when the computers don´t work in the right way and that thousands of votes could be easily removed without any opportunity to control the system. The speaker told that there is no way to control the computer system and that there could be errors inside the system, because the sytem is programmed by humans and that these errors in the computer system could lead to bigger problems than the problems in the traditional voting system. Altough it seems like an easier way than the traditional voting system th computerised voting sytem has a few negative points, who stand against it.
