Some citics want a new voting system. They don't want the traditional one, where you mark your candidate on a sheet of paper. They want it more technically. They want the old system to be replaced with a computerized voting. Critics say that this system is more trustworthy than the one you do by hand. Some people are not best a viewing so they can mark the wrong candidate. And with the help of the computers it should be easier for them to find the candidate they really want to vote for. They say that there can be an error by couting the votes and the people who count can make mistakes.
But the system has also negative sites, as I just heard in the audio. 
For some people it would be easier to vote with a computer because they are used to a computer. But some people never had a computer in their own hands. For them it would be very harder to vote because they don't know how to.
Another negative thing they said in the audio is, if there is an error in the computer hundreds of votes could be gone and can never be brought back.
