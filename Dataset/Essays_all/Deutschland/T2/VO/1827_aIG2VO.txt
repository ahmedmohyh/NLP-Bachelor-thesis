In the hearing task, some arguments against the introdution of a new voting system in the USA using computers are listed.

Firstly, some people don´t use computers every day and might be able to use them, there could be some trouble or these peolpe entirely can´t vote.
Secondly, the point, that humans made mistakes, knows everyone, but some people forget, that computers are controlled and programmed by humans, so the also make mistakes, that are surely much more important, because the couldn´t be checked after the voting by humans.
Thirdly, people are using other systems for online banking or online shooping day by day, but for voting computers would only be used all 4 years, also the most technical system didn´t work perfectly used first time, there could be problems using voting computers first time.

These arguments obviously disagree the text. The text had a much more positive view on this topic, because the mistakes made by humans are much more important for these Text´s author, who the inefficency of the old system stresses.
