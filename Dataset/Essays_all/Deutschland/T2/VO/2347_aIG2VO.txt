There are some problems with old voting systems. Because the coputerized voting machines have an easy-to-touch-screen technology. The voter needs only to touch the candidat´s name on the screen to record a vote for that candidate. 
But in the traditional voting, the voters have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheed of paper containing many names.
Another problem with old voting systems is, that they rely heavily on people to count  the votes.
If there is an error detected, because they have to deal with thousands of ballots and its almost inevitable ehat they make mistakes, a long and expensive recount has to take place.
Its also too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide.
The computer technology is used every day.
