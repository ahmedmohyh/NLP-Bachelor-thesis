In the presentation the woman said that a traditionell voting system can bring many different problems, but she questioned if a technological voting system is that better. She said that nowadays, most people are used to computers because of their daily lifes, but that there are also people who are afraid of technology and who could get trouble if they have to use it. But the thoughts in the text are that it could be helpful for the voters to use technology because you have for example an easier viewing and you can read the names from the candidates better. The woman explained that she does not think that computers would do a better job because computers are from humans. And the text critisized that a computerized voting system would be better because there would be no human mistakes. The woman said that a person who counts the votes can miss a few ballots, but if there is a mistake in the computer system there could be more than thousand votes misscounted and a recount would not be possible because the whole system would have an error. But the text said that they want to use computers because it would be an more trustworthy system. The last argument the woman used is that we use other important programs like banking transactions too, but that these also had some errors in the beginnig and that they are used daily and can be improved faster. The voting in America is only once in two years, so it would be more dangerous to use the programm. But the text says that we also use technology in our daily lifes to communicate and to share highly sensitive information, so why sould we not trust the voting system?
