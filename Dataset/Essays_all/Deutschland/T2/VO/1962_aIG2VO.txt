People argue, how to improve modern day voting systems, especially of the United States. Some say, that it would improve the system to finally let computers count votes. But, like it was said in the record, this would not make anything better. There are still people who live without computers and maybe can't afford this modern stuff. 
Added to this all programs are made by humans and if you think it would be a problem to miscount a few ballots, you don't know what a serious programming mistake could do with the whole vote. This means, that there has to be a revote because there is no physical note. 
The text mentions these counting failures or problems with eyesight, but as we now know there could be more serious Problems with a wrong program. Another point is that computers have improved other time. But people of the United States do only vote every second year, so there is no room for mistakes. 
Although people do trust lots of modern complex computer technologies, these programs and computers were developed other the last decades and not only once.
