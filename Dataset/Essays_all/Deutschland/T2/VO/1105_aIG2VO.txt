Especially after the elections in the United States, many people want a better voting system, because they think the current one is inefficent and there could easily be errors at counting the votes. So is it better, to replace this traditional way of voting with a computerized one?
It might be easier to vote for some people,for those who already have made some experience with computers. But the people, who are a bit scared of technology, might not want to use it. Also it's possible that they accidentely vote for the wrong candidate. At least the machines have a magnifying function, so it's easier to find your candidate. That's why the computerized method is better for people who have problems finding their candidates on a long, long list of names on a sheet of paper.
If someone makes a mistake while counting the votes, they have to be recounted. That's a long and expensive process and these miscounts are very damaging when two candidates are very close to each other. But on the other hand, computerized voting wouldn't be much better, because programming mistakes may be even worse. What if thousands of votes can't be counted or are going completely lost?
It would cost much, much time to improve these voting machines until they are completely trustworthy. And recounts are often not possible. It needed  a long time to improve our banking system etc, so that we can fully trust them, and we're using them every day. So how long would it take, to improve a voting machine,
