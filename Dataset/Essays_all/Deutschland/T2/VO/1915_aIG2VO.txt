The just heard presentation is more about what is bad when it somes to computerbasede voting, while the text just tells us somethiung about the good parts about it. In the text it says compuuters are way more reliable and more trustworthy but in the presentation the speaker told us about problems of the programming because at least all computers as good as they may be are programmed by humans so it does not exclude human errors. Another Argument was that banking systems and many things in government are ruled by computers for years now and we still trust them because we have to so why not trust compouter concerning Vote Systems? It is easy; computerbased programms which are used by banks and the government are almost perfectly designed because it took so much time to improive them every now and then. Every second a programm needs to be used in banks and election systems do not have to be used as much as the bankinbg system do. The Presentaition easily disarms the arguments of the text.
