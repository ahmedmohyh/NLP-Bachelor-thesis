People who arent fit with a computer would have problems with these votingsystem and need help with the election.So they vote together with their helpers. There also could be an error in the computer system while the voting. These programms are also from humans and humans make mistakes. So if is an error in the programm it would be a problem for the current voting.
In the text they said an automatically counting is quicker than a counting by humans. There would be a problem if humans counted wrong. So the difference between the text and the speech is that they search the misstake at the different ways of counting. In the text the humans are guilty when the result is wrong because they can count wrong and also the lists are bad to see. So in the speech they critisize the counting programms because humans can do a mistake while they wrote the programm.
