It is a heavily discussion between the people who prefer traditional voting systems and those who prefer computer voting systems. Both systems have their goods and bads. It is said that the traditional voting system is inefficient and leads to inaccurate counting. Another huge problem of traditional voting systems is the voting for the wrong candidate. This happens because people with poor eyesight can easily tick the wrong name on the paper. Thus it is inevitable that they will make mistakes at the voting and at the counting of the votes. On the other hand critics say that the computer voting systems have problems too. The computer voting symstem is easy to use for people who are used to the computers but not to those who are not. In addition to that it was said that computers can count the votes more exactly and will not forget any votes. But that is not true. Computers are programmed by people making mistakes. That is human and mistakes can be made by programming the computers too. That means that computers can easily forget thousands of votes. That would be a worse problem than people miscounting five to ten votes.
To come to a conclusion you have to say that both voting symstems have their pros and contras but you have to try both sytems to know the better one.
