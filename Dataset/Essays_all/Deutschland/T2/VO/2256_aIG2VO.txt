There are many people in the United States, who think the the often used traditional voting system is not reliable enough anymore and should be replaced by a computorized voting system. critizisers of the old traditional voting system mention that it could happen very easy that a voter amrk the wrong name on the list long list full of names and they think that this wont be possible on a computer. These people also say that there are many mistakes at the counting of the votes, because just a few people have to count votes from long lists from thousands of people. So mistakes  are usual.
However there are also this kind of persons in the United States, who think that a computerized voting system would just lead to more problems. They know that ther are mistakes with tghe traditional voting system, but for example a computer could also make mistakes in the counting of votes, because it is also juts a program made by humans, and a mistake in the computer system would be much more dangerous than one vote, which was counted wrong by the counters. A recount with a computerized voting system would also be impossible, so a mistake has much more effects. 
Another point is that there are many people in the US, who are not  common th a computer, especially older people. So they would not vote, because they do not know how to do it and have fear.
So you can say that there are points for both sides, but you can not say that mistakes are not able anymore with a computerized voting system.
