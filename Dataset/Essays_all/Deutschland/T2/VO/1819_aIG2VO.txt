Some people say that todays voting is very ineffeciant and that it would be better to use computers for the voting process.
These people say that people could vote the wrong person by simply making a wrong mark because of a bad eyesight for example. The reason for that is that the sheets are very hard to read because of the small writing.
A touchscreen could be handled with ease so you can just touch the name of your candidate.
Furthermore it is said to be very hard work to count the votes which is done sheet by sheet from humans who can easily get a vote wrong because of all the votes and this could get very expensive because one would have to make recounts. Lastly they have the argument that we already entrusted many important things to computers such as banking transcitions and more.
Yet there are also people against computerized voting who say that this way of voting could be unfair towards people who don´t usually use computers or can´t afford to have one they might not be able to handle to vote with them or they could even refuse to show up to the elections.
In addition to that the programs of the voting system is made by humans of course which means that they could have errors which wolud lead to greater mistakes than just 100 votes for example and the votes could not even be recounted. That would be even more expensive. Because elections are just once or even less a year these computer systems are not being used very much so there wouldn´t be as much improvement as with systems that are being used very often such as bank systems.
