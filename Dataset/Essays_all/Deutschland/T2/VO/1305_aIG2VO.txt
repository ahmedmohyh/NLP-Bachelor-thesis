It is often questioned whether the current voting system needs an upgrade or not, as inacurracy and mistakes were only human: the number of counted votes could possibly be incorrect and not be represantative. Critics often tend to say that the current system lead to an inacurrate number of votes, as people with bad eyesight etc would often, accidentally, vote for another candidate. These critics fully trust today's computer systems and technology, as they were also used on a day-to-day basis by the government. It is often questioned, why we would rely that much on computers when it comes to the government, but distrust them in elections. 
On the other side it is mentioned in the presentation of the novel, that exactly these systems used by the government have been improved over the years, as they are used daily, which proves, that the people building the computers also make mistakes, but as the elections only happened every two years, the testing period would be too short. An error of system could therefore cause thousands of wrong calculated votes, whereas the mistakes made nowadays would only be minor. Additionally, it is mentioned that many people to this day don't have a good knowledge about technology, as they suffer from poverty and would often not be able to afford one. Being inexperienced when it comes to computers would also lead to wrong votings or not voting at all.  
To sum up, the author of the novel is certain that renewing today's voting system, exchanging it with a comuputer, would simply cause more mistakes rather than solve them, as we could not be certain about it's efficency, nor if it would be without mistakes or people were able to use them correctly.
