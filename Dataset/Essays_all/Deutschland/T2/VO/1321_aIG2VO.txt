The text and the presentation both going about votes. Especcially about the differences between traditional voting systems and computerized voting systems.
Critics said that the current voting systems in the United States are inefficient. They think, that a computerized voting system would be more efficient and easier. The people shouldn't search the candidate on the long cheat, they just scroll down and could only vote for the candidate. In the text it says that its also easier for people who can't see very well. They can just zoom in and the captures are bigger. It's also an easier system because nobody should count the votes after the vote because the computer counts the votes. So it's faster and human error wouldn't take place.
The woman in the presentation says that the text isn't right at all. Her opinion is that computerized voting systems making mistakes too because they are made by humans. She said although we trust in electronical systems in banking are something else everyday voting systems aren't used dailly and could make more mistakes. The mistakes might be bigger as in count-by-hand systems in which just a few votes could count wrong. 
The second contra to the text is that she thinks the computerized system might be easier for people used computer. But for people doesn't used computers often it might be difficult to use modern computerized voting systems.
