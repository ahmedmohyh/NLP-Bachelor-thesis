The essay is about the discussion between the traditional voting with the gallons or the new voting with computers. The text said that the voting with gallons can easily lead to a human error, because old people cannot read their names easily anymore and make the cross at a wrong name, or the people who count the votes can make a mistake, that they count one vote twice or leave one out. The speech said that the computervoting can also lead to mistakes, because the program is made by humans and then the program can have errors and thousends of votes cannot be counted or counted wrong. Aslo a reason, said by the text, that we trust the programs in things like banking or other things. The record replyed that we do that because we use them all day and they were improved and tested. The election programm is only used every two years. SO it can have easily a error.
To put it in a nutshell, the text and the record give pro and cons for the voting with computers.
