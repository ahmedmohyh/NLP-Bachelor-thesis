In the text obove and in the audio you heard something about the ways you can use to vote for someone.
In this text I will explain some possibilities for voting and their problems.
The first possibility is the traditional way: you have a paper with many name on it. There are a lot of names.... 
So you have to choose one of them, but because they are written down so small, there is the problem that you could choose a person that is written over another name that you generally wanted to vote for. JUst to conclude: you could vote for the wrong person. 
Another way to vote for somebody is to vote on a computer. With one click you can vote for a candidature. For the ones who are specialised to computers and like to "play" with it very much, it´s very cool because they know how to handle it. But for the ones who don´t play computergames or something like that it could be very difficult because they don´t know how the voting on the computer works.
But in genaral it´t better than the traditional voting because it´s easier to see all the names on the display.
But also with the voting on the computer there is a problem, because some computersystems are too old, so they can rely heavily on people to count the votes. So the human error is changed by the error of the technology.
In genaral it is complicate to decide which way they are going to use, because both possibilities have their own problem.
