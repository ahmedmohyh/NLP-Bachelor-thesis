In the excerpt and in the hearing part/ presentation the current problem of "Computerized voting - yes or no?" is introduced to us with two different opinions. The excerpt is for Computerized voting and the prsentation is against it. Both name some arguments for there side.

 In the excerpt the first argument is that most ballot papers are so large and full of names that most people can not overview the names and choose the wrong name. Also some people with bad eyesight are having big problemes with that too and choose the wrong name although they wanted to vote for someone else. The computerized voting will be more efficiant because it will have bigger screens on which you can vote.
Furthermore the excerpt critizises that the ballot papers are counted by people and it is very invitable for people to make mistakes by counting thousands of ballott papers. The computers will do that quicker and automatically so that there are no mistakes made. 
Now on the other side the presenter of the presentation said that it is doubtful that computers will make it better because most computers will and do have many technicall errors and those are hard to remove quickly. So if the vote counting starts and it is done by computers there will be more and bigger mistakes that are hard to remove. People on the other hand will only misscount some ballott papers and that is not as big of a deal as it would be with computers. 
Another point would be that not all people are used to dealing with technology or mostly computers at all. As a result there will be fear of technology and also more mistakes.
