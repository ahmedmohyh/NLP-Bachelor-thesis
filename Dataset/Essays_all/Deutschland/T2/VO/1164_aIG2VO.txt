Voting systems: 
First the presenter said that a computerized voting process is good for people who are used to computers. But for old people or people who hate computers the paper-based voting system is better. 
In the text, the author says that an easy-to-use touch-screen technology is very good for old people because if they can't see clearly the'll have the opportunity to magnify the content. 

According to the presentation, you can doubt that computers are better and more efficient at counting votes than people are. Plus if there's a mistake in the human-made software, it'll get much more expensive because you have to find the mistake, fix the code and count all the ballots again. 
The text says that a recount which has to take place if an error is detected is very expensive and a computerized system removes the possiblity of human errors. 

Last but not least, a software that is used every day is reliable but a system that is used every 2 or maybe even 4 years is not that reliable.
On the other hand, complex computer technology is used for accurate banking transactions and in the communication of highly sensitive information. So you have to give it a thought and then you may can use it for voting.
