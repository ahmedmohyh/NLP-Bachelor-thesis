The presentation was about the voting technigues. Today humans count the votes but there is the possibility that computer will make this job one day. It will be easier and better for those people who use a computer every day. But for those who don´t know how to handle with it the risk is higher that they vote wrong. The computer is programmed by a human and the human can have done a mistake or manipulated the system. The voting machines can´t be improved quickly because the vote is only once a year. Both texts see the problem that humans can make mistakes and that the voting system now is a problem. But the presentation informs about the non- technigue- persons, and the text only about the positiv things. Also both know that it is risky to use a computer for voting. But the text is more optimism. Of couse we use computer everyday but about the improvement talks only the presenter. All in all both see the problem of human voting- countings but the text says that it is more efficent and trustworthy to use a computer and the presenter see that in a more pessimism but realistic way.
