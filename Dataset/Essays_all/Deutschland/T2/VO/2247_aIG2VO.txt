The voting system of the US has been discusssed because of different reasons, positive and negative, especially after the recent election. Some people thought of it as manipulated. It is in discussion that instead of manually counting the votes by human hand it should be done by a computer system. This thought sparked different discussions with both pros and cons for a test project for the system.

One of the biggest doubts for this system is that even though by the younger generation and middle class used quite frequently, technology is not used by everyone. These aspects could lead to discouraging of voting all togehter, because the people are intimidated. It also could lead to more mistakes when it can avoid. Eventhough people praise that citizen who have bad eye sight if comes from age or else where, can zoom in and see better, the consequences that could happen because of a mistake in computer program itself, which is also made by human hand, could be tremendous especially in comparison to the mistakes made by humnn hand: while human counting can result in a few miscounted votes, the computer system can do all kinds of worse things. Also a lot of people in favor of the computer system say that the relay daily on computer systems for, for example bank transactions, but these system have been tested and improved also for a way longer time and are used everyday. The computer system for voting on the other hand, would only be  used every two years, or if also used in smaller votings twice a year at maximum. In that way the system could only be improved other many decades and the population would have to accept a chance of inaccuracy for way too long
