The presentation and the text are both about the same topic. This topic is the voting system of the United States. The text is using arguments against the traditional voting system, while the presentation is using arguments aginst the computerized system, that is descriped as a better voting system in the text.

The first argument of the text is, that the traditional voting system is inefficent and inaccurate, beacause every vote is counted by humans and that is taking time and they can do mistakes. The presentation has an counter-argument, because in the presentazion is said, that humans can also do mistakes by writing the counting program, so it doesn't have to be accurate. Also in the presentation is said, that there are people that don't know how to use computers, while the text says, that there are people that can't read the the smal names ont the big list of candidates. Also even if it's taking a longer time to count the votes manual, the votings take place every four years and in contrast to this four years the time it takes to count the votes is still short.
