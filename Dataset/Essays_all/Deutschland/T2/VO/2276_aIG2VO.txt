The lecture opposed the idea of computerized voting ,while the text supports it. 
The lecture explained that people, who are not using technology everyday could be opposed by the idea of voting on a computer and may not even vote at all because of that. Furthermore she opposed the text about the elimination of human error in technology . She argues that the programms for voting can have human error aswell. And that these human errors are far worse then a small number of misscounts, because they would affect every voting machine. She also rejected the comparision with banking, where computer technology is already used daily, because this technology is used daily , leading to eliminations of bugs and other failures of these programms. While voting machines would be used far less, which according to her would make it hard to find errors in the code. Furhermore, she fears that a recount of the votes is impossible with voting machines like that , becausee the votes are only saved digital , which would in case of a counting error make this data useless.
