 Many people say that computerized votings would be  better. They would be faster and easier to handle with their new technolegies. With old votimg systems the votes have to  count one by one which is quite stressful and would take a long time. So new and modern voting sytems will be improve this.
Another  advantage of computerized voting systems is that they could remove human error. Everyone doing mistakes sometimes especially if  they  have to count votes for a long time and get tired. The computerized voting sytems could  improve this human error and there won´t be mistakes in the programms.

Although computerized voting systems have many advantages some people say that it is to risky to let modern sytems let the votes count. Also they could be broken. Votes could also be easier to manipulate if no human is looking at that.
