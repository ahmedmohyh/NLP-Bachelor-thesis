Both sources are talking about the methods of elections: the traditional voting and the votings with th computer.
The text talkes about the problems of the traditional voting: the people who vote have a long paper where thy have to find the name of the candidat and to make a mark next to the name. People who can't look good anymore ore look wrong make their mark on the wrong name and vote the wrong person. Also the people who count the votes could make mistakes and the whole votes have to be count again. With the computer the people who vote can touch on the screen for voting. With the screen the letters are bigger and old people could see the names better.Also the voting on the computer is quickly because the people don't have to search for the name so long. The whole vote would be easier than. The recording is saying that in the traditional voting could be mistakes by the counting but with the computer it wouldn't be better. If there are people who don't know how to use a computer could mark the wrong candidat. Also the computer isn't perfect. It makes mistakes too because it is made by humans and humans make mistakes and this is normal. If a computer has an error over one thousand votes would be miscounted and because of the virutal ballot all votes are losed and the whole election has to be done again.And the election is only one time. 
In comparison the sources prefere different methods to make the votes. The text is for the computer because it would be easier for everyone. But the recording is for the traditional voting because of the problems of an error of a computer and the losing of all votes. Each source has a point against the points of the other source.The text knows that there could be errors but people have to try it because it would make everything easier and the recording don't want to try it because the risks are to big.
