The Chevalier, lived from 1725-1798, wrote a memoir recounting his life and his adventures. This Memoir was a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteen century, but there are some critics about the Chevalier and his memoir. They think, his life wasn't so nice, how everybody think. One time he must borrow money and crtics said, if he was so rich how everybody think, he would not have needed to borrow money. Another crtic is, in the memoir is written, the Chevalier had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire, but they have never met and the conversation was written many years after it was, so you can't say if the conversation in the memoir is really true. Another point is, that he said, he escaped from prison ; critics said, it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. The Chevalier said: 'The time has come to talk about many things' and then he named some examples for these 'things'. Maybe he was a little bit crazy because of the arguments he had, but who can say, that this is wrong, just because his words were a little bit crazy or they don't fit to the 'norm'? Nobody knows, except his own, but now it's to late to ask him. You can trust his memoir or you go with the critics.
