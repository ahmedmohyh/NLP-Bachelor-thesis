The woman we heard in the listening task talks about the accuracy of Chevalier´s memoir. She mentioned arguments against the critical points we read in the text. At the beginning she explained that he had welath even though he needed to borrow money. He borrowed money because at first he needed some money to reach his wealth. The second argument she mentioned is about the accuracy of the conversations Chevalier records in his memoir. She said that evidencely notes of the conversation exist which he took right after he had the conversation and he used them to re-write the conversation in his memoir. The last argument is about Chevalier´s escape from a prison in Venice. She explained that some other people in the prison had have even more politically well-connected friends in Venice who could helped them to reach their freedom again, not only Chevalier. She also mentioned that the ceiling of  Chevalier´s cell had to be repaired a few days after he escaped.
