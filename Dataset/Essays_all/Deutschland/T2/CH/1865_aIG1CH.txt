The record I listened to is a response to the critic expressed in the text.
The recording said, that no memoir could be exactly accurate, but the Chavalier´s is very accurate.
The doubts mentioned in the text according to his wealth were denied by the argument that the Chavalier had property which he first had to sell to make money, which is a kind of wealth as well. He borrowed money because sometimes he had to wait for his money.
The next critit says that the report about the conversation with Voltaire cant be so accurate because the conversation was many years earlier. But Chavalier made notes about this conversation, kept them and refered to them while writing his memoir.
The text mentioned doubts about the way the Chavalier escaped from prison. The text says that the Chavalier had a number of politically well-connected friends who could have offers a bribe, but venician documents say that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired after his escape and so the story of his escape is probably correct.
